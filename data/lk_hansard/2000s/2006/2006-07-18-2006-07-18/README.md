[A.. M. 10.49]

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for givingme this opportunity to speak on a very important day onwhich almost six Bills have been brought in on two, threedifferent topics.

In the morning you would have heard the commotion whenthis august Assembly started. This is the present state of affarsin the Government. The Government Members do not knowexactly what is happening in Parliament. The Leader of theHouse mentioned that Item Eight would not be brought inand the Hon. Minister of Disaster Management and HumanRights gets up and says, No it will betaken up. We wantedto make a statement and it was debated as to whether thatcould be done or not. Now this is the exact replication ofwhat is taking place in the rest of the country. The macro -economic policy of this country is put in to serious jeopardy;it is being tested beyond its limit.

Today, Sir, the world is looking at Sri Lanka and wonderingwhat is going on. People are looking at the peace processwith a lot of circumspection. The investors are looking at theGovernment, which is constituted of a heterogeneous group,to see whether it is getting its act together. Because we havea dominant Peoples Alliance with a chauvinistic, anarchicJVP, and a Hela Urumaya of support it. Now they are lookingat the direction that this Government is heading. Likewise,you see external dimensions into the internal working of thiscountry. The co-chairs, which came into existence becauseof the foresightedness of the Ceasefire Agreement, now seento be going forward. Now you can see that the Indans, withwhom we have extremely good neighbourly relations, arelooking at our country. They They are also looking at theirgeo-political situation. You have a Government today that isforgetting its closest neighbour and trying to do economicswith neighbours that are far away in our region, China on oneside, Pakistan on the other and as a result, our neighbour,who comes to our assistance at any given moment iswondering what is going on.

Then, Sir, also the people are getting frustrated. ThisGovernment was electd almost two years and four monthsago. The Executive President has been government and rulingthis country in a way that he deems fit for the last nine months.The people were expecting major changes to take place.

Likewise, the coalition partners are disjointed. They arelooking at what is in it for them. That is, each party in theGovernment is looking at personal gain. They are runningwith the hare and hunting with the hounds.

Amidst this, Sir today many financial amendments havebeen brought in, to suit certain things. Certainly, they arematters, may be too little too late, but we appreciate that theyhave been looked into. We have taken up the Recovery ofLoans by Banks (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Bill. Thenwe are also debating the National Insurance Trust Fund Billthe Banking (Amendment) Bill, the Payment Devices FraudsBill, the Non-Performing Assets (Recovery) Bill, the Gaming(Special Provisions) Bill, the Resolution under theAppropriation Act, and the Select Committee of Parliamenton the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution.

2006 1824672468

4 PL 001357 (2006/07)

If I may take them one by one, Sir, first I would like to take upthe Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions)(Amendment) Bill. Look at the intention of the Governmentfor bringing this Bill. At this particular moment, theGovernment, owing to certain mismanagement that is goingon, is trying to do certain things to resuscitate, give a newlook to it. In the process, they are looking at what can bedone. The first thing that we are looking at in this amendmentBill which we mentioned at the Consultative Committee onFinance and Planning is that the fact that any person whoowes less than Rs. 5 million to the bank should be exemptedfrom Parate execution.

Sir, today the price of even two perches in Slave Island isabout Rs. 8 to 9 million, So, what does Rs. 5 million amountto ? If you are looking at protecting the small and the medium- scale enterpreneurs the down trodden, the person whosevery existence depends on the banks funding. What is Rs. 5million? We, from the United National Party, have alwaysbeen considerate and we are proposing that this be increasedto nothing less than Rs. 50 million. Ensure that people whoowe less than Rs. 50 million do not come within thisdraconian law of parate execution. I am looking at theessence of it. The inflationary trends that have taken placehave distorted the actual position. So that Rs. 5 million meansnothing. Therefore, we request the Government to increasethis to Rs. 50 million.

Then Sir, the Hon. Deputy Minister was posed with thequestion from the Opposition - the Hon. Anura Dissanayakeasked him - whether the people who have taken money fromthese public banks can be named. Obviously the DeputyMinister, due to the lack of his knowledge on legal matters,said, Yes, you can reveal who the debtors are to this augustAssembly.

That is not the case. Actually, there is an element of secrecy.So, the only way that you can do it is by going to court andgetting an order to make it public. If you go to court, thenyou can certainly do it. But, we, from the United NationalParty, want you to bring in regulations. We tell theGovernment, Please, bring in regulations, to name in thisaugust Assembly, any person who owes a public bank morethan Rs. 100 million, and is a delinquent and is purposelyevading payment.

Quit rightly, the small borrower, is obviously a verygenuine payer. The History of public banks would revealthat payments have been no problem from the small andmedium - scale borrowers. It is the big sharks that utilize thelacunae in the laws and make use of public funds to fulfiltheir ulterior motives. Sir. Therefore, we would greatlyappreciate if an amendment or a special Bill could be broughtin throug which any person who has taken more than Rs.100 million and whose loan has been non-performing for acertain period, may be beyond six months or nine months,can be named in this august Assembly so that you do notneed to resort to legal procedures to do that . We are asking

for this to protect the decent, the innocent, borrower and thatis certainly something which we want to bring up at thisparticular moment.

Then, Sir, if you look at the Banking (Amendment) Bill,this is something that is too little, too late. You have theCentral Bank, performing a supervisory role in this country.If by chance, the Central Banks supervisory division has notperformed up to expectation, then there could be great errorsin its supervisory functions. Bringing in separate Bills inorder to correct the inefficiency there, is not the answer. Thishas been mentioned at the Consultative Committee and weasked, Is this not too little, too late? Why is the supervisoryrole not Functioning ? Give due credit to the Central Bank.There may be other banks which have crashed in the recentpast. This may be just one such bank. The Central Bank mayhave protected one or two such banks. So, on that basis, thereis a definite indication that they have been doing their job ina proper way. In that case, what is all this about? What are theState Banks that are having this problem that needs to berectified, to be corrected? The Hon. Deputy Minister ofFinance and Planning is not here, the Hon. Minister of Financeand Planning is not here. So, with whom are we debatingthese in this House, Hon. Deputy Chairman ? This isthe problem with this Government: nobody takes control. . , . , , , . An Acting Minister! What is the meaning ofthis ?

As we have been repeatedly saying, you cannot play withthe economy of this country. We can lose all battles in thebattlefield, but if we lose the economic battle, we lose allhope for this country. So, we are asking the Hon. Minister ofFinance and Planning and the Hon. Deputy Minister, who alittle while ago, stated certain things, as to why he is presentingthese Bills, Please, name the State Banks that are in jeopardy.Are they facing a situation of delinquency at the moment?Are they going to be bankrupt ? Otherwise, what is thenecessity to suddenly bring this in? Or is there an insidiousactivity undertaken to foster privatization ? We feel that thisis another guise to try to privatize the national banks becauseyou have partners who are steadfastly saying. Sorry, wecannot ensure that the privatization process takes place, thecommercialization process takes place. Downsizing to theright size, is not being allowed. So, this is another attempt toshow that they are trying to protect these banks and they areindirectly trying to allow different people to run the banks ina different style. We are asking you, Please, name the StateBanks that are in jeopardy. If not, why are you bringing thisBill? If you are trying to resurrect Pramuka Bank, do youneed to give all the attention to this type of thing.? Duringthe United National Party Government, Hon. DeputyChairman, you would be well aware, the then Hon. Ministerof Finance, instructed by the then Prime Minister, the Hon.Ranil Wickremasinghe, ensured that we came forward in orderto give Pramuka depositors some redress. Unfortunately,

24692470

[ ]owing to the asinine act of the Parliament being dissolvedthen that idea was lost. We were not going to utilize thegovernment money on this. It was completely private sectorled. Not a single cent was coming out of this. That is theingenuity of the United National Party. Today, these types ofBills are brought in. Who is paying for these? The innocenttax payers. This is not paid for by the Government. This doesnot come from their pockets. This is not brought from home.So on that basis what are we getting into the same old mess.Sir, there needs to be an explanation to this House as to whatis happening to the economy of this country. Please we havegot to protect it. If we play around with this, we will be ingreat jeopardy.

Look at the Banking (Amendment) Bill. What is all this?amendments to the Banking (Amendment) Bill that havebeen sent to us. Look at the dual treatment that is beingmeted out through this Bill. I am going to read the proposedamendment to clause 2 of the Bill in Page 5, that is going tobe moved at the Committee Stage. I quote:

Immediately after line 15, insert the following:

(3F) The Minister may, where it is necessary to do so in the interestsof the national economy, by Order published in the Gazette determinethat any deposit liabilities of a defaulting bank, or any part of suchliabilities, to any government institution, Provincial Council or otherbody or authority functioning under the Provincial Council, a publiccorporation or other public institution or local authority, which have interms of the aforesaid provisions vested in an acquiring bank, shell beliabilities to the Government.

This completely excludes non-governmental bodies. Itcompletely excludes the private sector and the privateindividuals. So how on earth is this august Assembly bringingin legislation which excludes almost 90 per cent of theeconomy? You are keeping the private sector out. You arekeeping the private individual out. You are keeping the non-governmental bodies out and only protecting the governmentinstitutions. I am, on this issue of the Pramuka Bank, beingthe former Minister of Trade, trying extensively to revive thePramuka Bank. Which owed money to the Dalada Maligawa. 21 . . amendments . ? . . This is theirony. The former Hon. Minister of Finance and the Hon.Minster of Enterprise Development and Investment Promotionare present here. Are you all approving this in Cabinet? Doyou not have a sense of feeling? I know the Government isbankrupt. But do you do this type on things inimical to theentire economy of this country? So, there is a necessity toanswer in this august Assembly as to what the intention is ofthis particular amendment that is being brought in. Why isdual treatment being given? The Government was elected toensure that equal opportunity is provided to all.

You can see what is being done to the private media. Youare trying to stifle them, stymie them by impossing taxeswhich are prohobitive and trying to close down the privateTV stations. These are disguised attempts of trying to bringin censorship through the back door. You are trying to do thesame thing to the innocent investors who have invested inPramuka Bank. For no fault of theirs they have gone bankrupt.They have gone bankrupt because teh Supervisory Divisionof the Central Bank has not done its job. So, why blame thedepositors? By bringing in this type of legislation you makethe tax payer borrow from these bankrupt banks, use the taxpayers monies and then try to resurrect the same old thingonly to protect the government institution because the RoadDevelopment Authority to my reckoning had deposited Rs.320 million. I am going back on my memory because I vividlyremember the then Prime Minister, the Hon. RanilWickremasinghe, the then Minister of Finance the Hon.Choksy and myself negotiating by settlement through theprivate sector. Not a single cent of Government money wasgoing to be used and 84 per cent of the depositors were goingto be paid back. All people who had more than Rs. 300,000were going to be paid back. There were only three or fourmajor players. The RDA was one of them. The DaladaMaligawa was another. But, we had to look at it in a differentway. Unfortunately, the government was dissolved and todayyou can see the ramifications. It is now almost two years andfour months, but nothing has still been done. So we are askingthe Government to come out with it and tell us what thesituation on this is? Why is this dual treatment being given?

Then, Sir, I will come on to the Gaming (Special Provisions)Bill. Here again, at the Consultative Committee meeting weasked the Deputy Minister of Finance and the Minister inattendence the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva and we ask theGovernment, You are bringing in amendments but are youaccepting the Betting and Gaming Levy (Amendment) Act?Do you accept it totally. You have brought in the MahindaChintana. The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna and Jathika HelaUrumaya are shouting themdelves hoarse saying that theydo not accept this. But now you are bringing in legislation inorder to ratify this, to coreect this to give legality to this.There was no answer that was given. This is exactly the case.The Government is unable to provide a satisfactory answerto anything that is being raised. Then, the Government juststated that revenues have increased owing to the increase ofcertain charges that have been levied. But we want to ask theDeputy Minister, is this the anticipated, expected revenue oris it what is actually levied and received by the Treasury?What we have been informed is that the expected revenue iscertainly far above the actual receipts that have come in. Theformer Hon. Minister of Finance will realize that while it wasincreased from rupees five million to 30 million, many peoplehave been delinquent. They do not pay a single cent. That isthe reason why we looked at it. There were certain sinnerswho were there. It is better to bring in legislation for thesinners rather than for the saints. We brought them within thetax net. Unfortunately by subsequent action you all threwthem out again. The revenues to my reckoning when it was

2006 1824712472

last collected was around Rs. 284 million which wasdrastically reduced to Rs. 164 million in the year 2005. I donot know what it is in 2006. But we are saying this withexperience. There was a huge hue and cry on the tax ammestythat was given. In the year 2004, when the Government wasbasically at its peak, when the economy was at full throttleand investments coming into this country, when the investorsgot the investor confidence, when all archaic rules were beingcompletely abrogated and nullified, here was a situation thatthe then Opposition specially led by the JVP accused that aRs. 222 billion worth of tax amnesty was given to the croniesof the then Government. We are asking this Government, if itis so, how much of money has been collected? It was last yearthat the Hon. former Minister of Finance answered thatquestion in Parliament and said, only Rupees one billionwas collected. That was the normal collection that takesplaces in any case. Then what happened to the Rs. 222 billionbecause they abrogated, they nullified the legislation thatwas brought in. So where is this Rs. 222 billion that was thereas tax amnesty? There is no point of bringing in legislationjust to fix certain political activities. This creates a completelywrong notion in the minds of the people that the Governmenthas all the money in the world but is not able to do anything.Today, the Government is faced with that reality. They ask,Where is the subsidy? ? ? ? ? ? ? . . . So, on this score, the Governmentmust come forward and say whether their constituent parties the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna and the Jathika HelaUrumaya are accepting this. Earlier they said, We do notwant this in this country. So, in that case why are you bringinglegislation into this august Assembly? We are adking themto take a stand on this issue. They will basically say, Theseare the legislations that have been brought in. Yes, theybrought in legislation. When we brought in legislations for atax amnesty it was the JVP, Jathika Hela Urumaya ledGovernment that abrogated ti. Then do the same thing. Nowthey are bringing in this legislation to confine the businessof Gaming to a designated area. Mr. Deputy Chairman ofCommittees, what is this designated area? The other day weasked the Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning and theMinister in attendance, the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva toplease tell us where you are trying to have these designatedareas.

What has the Betting and Gaming Levy Act brought in? Iwill read from the Betting and Gaming Levy Act, No. 40 of1988. The imposition of the levy covers the following areas.Section 2 (1) of the Act states, I quote:

(a) the business of a bookmaker ; or (b) the business of gaming,

There are many other things that come under this. Thereare slot machines, which is outside the system. There are card- games, which are outside the system. There is a multitude ofactivities that are taking place in the country, which are

outside the system. There are illegal pyramid schemes in thecountry, which are outside the system. Does this fall withinthe provisions of the Betting and Gaming Levy Act? Even inthe attempt to rectify the anomalies of that Act, they have nottaken these into consideration. So, this is haphazardlegislation brought in at the last moment without knowingwhat the actual ramifications and implications are andamendments that need to be brought into meet the presentsituation. So, does this cover those areas? It is far from it. Itdoes not cover those areas at all. We are asking the Governmetto be specific without just telling us to support this type oflegislation. Is it going to be operative in Wanni? Are theprovisions of this Gaming (Special Provisions) Bill going tobe operative in Mullaitivu or is it going to be operative inPuttalam or in a separate area like Kalpitiya in thepeninsula? In any other country in the world, Hon. Minister,as you know, if it is in the United States of America, Las Vegasis renowned for this type of activity. If it is in Hong Kong, itis there in the Macau Islands. Likewise, if it is in Malaysia,which is closer to us as a neighbour, it is there in the GentingHighlands. These are specified areas where they are treatedas if the sinners are going and doing yeoman service to theeconomy of those countries. Basically this legislation has itsgood intentions because you get revenue for the country.Certainly there are bad aspects of it as well, but those have tobe rectified. In a modern world, you cannot say, No toanything. You have got to bring it within a certain area,control it, rather than try to stifle it. This is why we tell theGovernment, if you want the revenue, do it in the proper way.Now you are telling them, Okay, we are going to take itaway. Where are you going to take it? The Hon. DeputyMinister of Finance said, We would give a long time, till2009. What is 2009? Today we are in July, 2006. The year2009 is only two and a half years away. That is nine hundreddays approximately. Within nine hundred days these placeshave to be relocated. They are in hotels. So can you say thatin two months, you are going to relocate on X number insome place? If the Government decides then what to do. So,these are not thought of. This is the problem in todaysgoverning, Mr. Deputy Chairman. This is a Talaiban type ofGovernment that is being brought into existence. There is nodemocracy. You are stifling the media on one side and youare stifling the journalists on the other. You are trying to forceregulations through this Parliament. When our Deputy Leaderwanted to make a statement, the Leader of the House, wasvociferously was trying to prevent him. What is going on inthis country? So I ask the Hon. Deputy Minister, please specifywhat is going on and where it is going to be relocated. Alsowe would ask the Government to please advise us, what is therevenue that is expected out of this? What is the intention ofthe relocation? Now if such a business is utilizing 1000square feet or 10,000 square feet in a Five Star hotel and youtry to relocate it into a particular area, what is the intention?Does that go against the morals of the country or does thatpurify the morals of the country? If it does not, then what thehell is going on? Is it just for the mental satisfaction that thiswas in the Chinthanaya. The Chinthanaya said it is going tobe changed. So you took it off. Please stop fooling around

24732474

with the economy. People are much more educated in thiscountry today. The Hon. Ministers who are present here, theHon. Sarath Amunugama and the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama,we are shocked and in disbelief because you come with theprofessionalism that comes from the United National Party.They keep the flag flying even in a bad governing situationat this particular moment. Why did you allow this to beratified in the Cabinet? You must ensure that you stand up forthe principles of equal treatment. If you do not want it justsay, I am sorry, there should be no gaming and betting.Your taking it away from Colombo 7 to Colombo 6, whatdifference would that make? So is there an ulterior motive,just to harass one lot and to help a certain other lot? No.Please be forthright with this type of thing.

Then, Mr. Deputy Chairman, I am coming on to the Non-Performing Assets (Recovery) Bill. Here again, before weventure forward, we would like to tell you that this is solelybrought in with one specific intention which was very clearlylaid down by consultants. Whom we questioned at theConsultative Committee on Finance and Planning. They saidthat certain State Banks are under - capitalized. They are ingreat jeopardy. They are unable to get the cash flows that arerequired to maintain the powerful statements. And as a result,these legislation are being brought in to rectify the greatdanger that is prevalent at this particular moment. The Hon.Rohitha Bogollagama also asked a question on the samelines, because he himself was confused at that ConsultativeCommittee meeting as to the intention. So imagine if he fromthe Government is confused, how we from the Oppositionwould feel. So I appreciate that but what is the answer thatcame ? I thought amendments would be brought in but noamendments were, brought in. So please, Hon. Minister, namethe State Banks that are delinquent, that are bankrupt. Thenthe people will know. It is not the Pramuka Bank that isbankrupt. They have only Rs. 600 million. There are StateBanks, and mortgage banks that are owned by the Govern-ment. So is the Government telling the depositors, I amsorry our two State Banks are bankrupt. So as a result we havegot to bring in legislation. So we want a statement made onthis. The innocent people must be protected. We, in the UnitedNational Party strive to protect the innocent depositors whohave invested with confidence in the State Banks. So on thatscore it is of paramount importance that the Minister, theDeputy Minister and the Ministers specifically tell this au-gust Assembly what the reason and intention of this particu-lar legislation are.

Then Sir, you are bringing this only in relation to the StateBanks. The Malaysian system, is the role model followed bythe then Minister of Finance, the Hon. K. N. Choksy and theHon. Prime Minister and the then Economic AffairsCommittee saw the valuable help that could be brought in ifthis type of legislation was brought in. These are not newlegislation. The United National Party almost brought themin to the legislation stage. It took two years and six monthsfor them to realize this but they have excluded the privatebanks from that. If they too were brought into the net you

[ ]would have got all the banks that are there to contribute. Soplease ensure that there is no burden on the Government,ensure that you appoint a professional team to carry on thefunctions irrespective of whehter they are government orprivate sector banks. Then, that will be the proper spirit ofbringing in this type of legislation. So, what is the answer ?You are basically talking of one thing and doing completelyanother. Just because the Peoples Bank and the Bank ofCeylon need capital and the partners in the Government areunable to support the commercialization process thinkingthat that will lead to an eventual privatization or downsizingof the Bank of Ceylon which has 10,000 employees and thePeoples Bank which has 11,000 employees. Managers andChairmen when they come before COPE say that they requireonly two thirds of that but they cannot rightsize themselvesnow, they are trying to transfer this to a separate monetaryauthority under the consultation and purview of Central Bankin order to give that feeling to the lenders, the institutionallenders like the IMF and the World Bank. Even though youhave not commercialized or privatized the banks you havein a worse manner brought them under a draconian authoritythrough which you could do anything you want. Why are thepeople silent on this ? If we brought in measures like this,Lipton Circus would have had a traffic jam by now. Nothinghappened. So, these are questions that need to be answered.

If you look at this Non-Perfoming Assets (Rerovery) Bill, Imay refer to this because of its importance. Under theEstablishment of the Asset Management Authority theobjectives are completely in relation to State Banks. As I saidit only looks at the State Banks perspective. So, it is verynarrow minded. Why is it not broad based ? Why are theprivate sector banks not brought under this particularAuthority because that is a noble cancept if that is the case. Ifyou look at Clause 4(a) of Non-Performing Assets (Recovery)Bill, I quote the last 4 lines which reads as follows :

...... Central Bank to be transferred to the Management Authorityunder section 17, and manage, amend, waive, sell, assign, transfer orotherwise dispose of the same, on a non-recourse basis ;....

Whose money is this ? I mean, these are depositors money.What is the basis that you are looking at ? You are also lookingat certain idle monies that are lying in the State Banks. Forexample, monies of people who are old, who are sick, andwho are overseas. Sometimes, they do not know whether thereis Rs. 100,000 or 200,000 in their accounts.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I would basicallyrelate a personal experience on this. My mother who hasbeen suffering from a stroke for the last 11 years has Rs. 1.1million in the Peoples Bank and owing to the fact that she isunable to sign documents she is unable to do anything withthe money in that account. So, we, as the two sons, are unableto do anything due to the fact that the situation does notprovide remedy for it legally. Until the demise of the accountholder you cannot do anything. What the Government istrying to do is to rob the money of innocent people that isthere.

2006 1824752476

? _ _ . 3000 . ? . 350 . 15 . , , , .

So, is this the intention of this Government ? I mean, doyou rob Peter to pay Paul? Is this the concept that thisGovernment under Mahinda Chintana is carrying on? Isthis what the Cabinet of Minister are ratifying ? Please, wewant an explanation on this because this is the only wayforward to get things done. The insincere activities that aretaking place is absolutely hypocritical.

If you look at the amendment to Clause 22 of the Non-Performing Assets (Recovery) Bill that is going to be movedduring the Committee Stage which reads as follows.

to non-performing assets of that Bank, the value of such non-performing assets shall for the purpose of such purchase, be determinedon the basis of a scheme to be specified by the Minister.....

The Minister or the Deputy Minister has to specify as towhat they mean by it. What is the basis ? Whimsically youtake certain people on and you exclude the others. That isnot the case. An experienced former Minister of Finance,Hon. Choksy. and Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama, I am sure, willunderstand the gravity of this. This is not just for the fun ofbringing is legislation just because the Secretary to theMinistry of Finance is unable to pay the bills and say thatthis is the best way forward, you take the non-performingassets of banks and take it as an asset of the bank and thenovercome the liabilities that are there. No, that is not the way.There is a moral obligation by the Government. You testcheck with the people. You test check with the banking normsof the country. There are almost 30 financial institutions inthis country. Have they gone through this ? That is thedifference, Mr. Deputy Chairman. During our tenure of office,we had a short span of 2 years and two months in government,but we brought the Consumer Affairs Authority into operation.We increased financial growth. We brought the tax amnesties.We had great consultation with the legal fraternity, with theChamber of Commerce, with the private sector and with everybody who could indicate the ramifications, the ill effects thatcould take place if such legislation was brought in. Nowthose are exempted. The Ministers do not understand what isin it. The Cabinet of Ministers raise their hands just for thesake of living for the day. So, that is why we, as a responsibleOpposition, knowing the implications that are there, arequestioning this Government that is living by the hour -Chandrikas Government lived by the day - what morejeopardy, what more problems are you going to create for thiscountry ?

The Daily News newspaper of 11th July, 2006, states, Iquote:

New laws to recoup Rs. 20 billion bad debts.

I presume that this is part of what is being brought in bythat legislation. There is a mythical notion that during theperiod of the United National Party, certain cronies gotmonies. We demand in this House, as the Hon. AnuraDissanayaka, Member of Parliament asked, to ensure thatthese racketeers are made known during what period werethe loans given, who has paid and who has not paid. Everyblame is put on the United National Party . . 28 . . , . 1988, 1989 ? , . So, we want to ensure that there is justiceand there is fair play in this system.

Then, in page 4 under Clause 6 - that is regarding theBoard of Directors it of the Non-Performing Assets (recovery)Bill states in line 6, I quote :

consu;tation with the Cenral Bank

Central Bank is a very sacred place. It is the apex ofbanking institutions. Why should the Central Bank getinvolved in this type of activity ? I mean, the United NationalParty is a Party that has governed this country and resurrectedit from a negative growth of 1.4 per cent to 6.8 per centgrowth rate. So, we know the gravity. We know theimportance of this type of thing. We are asking, Is thisfooling around with the people ? Please give the reasons asto why the Central Bank needs to be involved in the process.

Likewise, Clause 12(1) of the Non-Performing Assets(Recovery) Bill states, I quote :

The Board shall, having regard to the qualifications and schemeof recruitment specified under sub section(3) and after consultationwith the Central Bank, appoint a person to be the Chief ExecutiveOfficer of the Management Authority ....

What is the purpose of this? We are also asking on thesame basis the situation under Cluase 23, that is regardingthe Cosideration to be paid. The monies that are coming in,are the taxpayers money. So, we have an absolute right toask as to what is going on.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, that puts an end tothe question that the United National Party has on the Non-Performing Assets (Recovery) Bill. I mean, these are onlysmall, basic things that we are asking, because this Bill wasgiven to us only on Friday. We, as an Opposition wouldmuch prefer consulting with the industry and then comingup with our views. Also have only a limited knowledge. Thefact that we have hands - on knowledge on certain areasdoes not mean that we are pundits in all areas. But theUnited National Party is always humane. We listen to whatothers have to say and then take a stand from there onwards.

National Insurance Trust Fund Bill is another Bill that isbeing presented. Then there is the Payment Devices FraudsBill. Here again it is absolutely too little too late. There are

24772478

certain things today that the courts do not accept andadminister, such as computer printouts or computerizedactivities. So, you are basically accepting credit cards, debitcards and certain financial instruments, which only deal withpart of the frauds that can be committed. There are manythings that are excluded. So, why bring in laws just to glossover and show that certain legal provisions are put in place.

Sir, now we have got to look at this completely differently.The country is in abject poverty. The countrys foreigninvestments are fast dwindling away. The Government isfinding that their revenues are far less than they expected.Their costs are ten times higher than what they havebudgeted. As a result, there is a serious financial problem inthe country. We must convert this country, Sir, from a saver,nation to an investors nation. This is what the UnitedNational Party tried to do. Unfortunately, it missed the busfor the simple reason that Mrs. Chandrika BandaranaikeKumaratunga, ably assisted by an anarchic a party, ensuredthat the dissolution of Parliament took place.

Sir, we were getting foreign investors to come back intothis country. They had respect and they had confidence inus. They knew that our Government had business acumen.That is why there was such a vicious attack on the peoplewho were then governing.

Today, what has happened? There is a flight of directinvestment from this country. The Hon. RohithaBogollagama may read from statistics and say that the BOIhas this and that the BOI has that. But you actually know thereal situation. You go to a bank and ask, the banks will saythat no foreign investors are coming in. Signing agreementsdoes not mean that you have money and that you haveinvestors coming into this country. This is the difference.

So we must ensure that we change from a savers nation toan investors nation. We must also ensure that wealthmanagement takes place in the country. Today wealth isgetting perished. There is absolute wealth in this country.But it is not optimized. The real value of investments are notbeing looked at. Look, today there are certain very usefulcommercial establishments located in the most expensivelocations trying to make a one per cent return. There is nosocial obligation. It is just political rhetoric that is takingplace. So you have to give it, its natural environment. Thatis, today the commercialized world must live in acommercialized atmosphere. You cannot be talking of thenineteenth century and live in the twenty-first century. Ifyou are in the twenty-first century, we as a developingcountry, must plan ourselves for the twenty second century.

Then Sir, we are asking about the asset allocation that isthere. It is not done in this country. Otherwise how can 2.3million families in this country, which is almost 53 per centof the total number of families in this country, live below thepoverty line? It is now twelve years under the Peoples

Alliance Government and it is only poverty that hasincreased in this country. When the United National Partyhanded over the Government on 25th August, 1994 and thePresidency in November, 1994 the poverty line was only 44per cent. So there is a nine per cent increase over a twelveyear period. That is because of totally politicizing the system.So where are we heading? Somebody has to pay. There is nofree lunch in the system. The Government must realize that.

Sir, the Deputy Minister of Finance, an intended Ministerof Finance nor the Finance Minister is here to listen to whatwe are saying. What we say here is recorded in HANSARDand somewhere down the line somebody will say that thesewere spoken of, but who listened to it and did something tocorrect all this? That is why we are telling the Government ifyou, for Gods sake, cannot do this, cannot govern thiscountry properly, please hand it over to the United NationalParty because we are ready, willing and able to resurrect thiscountry from the mess it has been placed in.

Sir, we are looking at converting this country from a saversnation to an investors nation. Today, savers are losing almostseven to eight per cent because of the intermediary cost thatis involved. The intermediary cost is about seven to eightper cent. Today, bank loans are given on an interest startingfrom 15 to 16 per cent.

Sir, if you are lucky to have Rs. 100,000 and you go andinvest that in a bank you will be paid six to seven per centinterest as savings but if you borrow Rs. 100,000 you haveto pay an interest of 15 to 16 per cent. There is somethingradically wrong in this system. From saving to lending ifthere is a difference of 8 per cent, how is this country goingforward? The intermediary cost is so high owing to theinefficiency, the incompetency and the political interferencethat is taking place in the State Bank led operations. That isthe problem in this country. We must thin this, we must narrowthis, otherwise we have no future.

The former Minister of Finance, I am sure being anexperienced hand after trying to provide a Budget from thewomb to the tomb, will understand that there is a rationaleand that beyond a certain point you have to stop thenonsensical promises that are given. You have to get down tobrass tacks and you have to face the actual financial situation.

Then Sir, in todays environment you have anotherimportant thing that is missing in the legislation that hasbeen presented. That is the single borrowers limit.

Today, the Government owing to its incompetence, theinflationary factor and the rapid cost increases are drivingaway investors from this country. we have ourselves legislatedthat the maximum lending limit from a bank to a particularlender to be only 10 per cent of the share capital. I am speakingabout certain companies that are basically on the stockexchange. Today, blue-chip companies such as John Keells,Aitken Spence and Hayleys are constrained. They cannot

[ ]

2006 1824792480

borrow from banks not because they are bankrupt but for thesimple reason that the legislation is not in line with thedeveloped world today. The banks capitals are ill-equipped.Today these banks are far too small to be operative. So, onthat basis their capital restrict themselves only to provide 10per cent of their share capital to one particular company. Ihappened to speak to the Chairman of John Keells, wholamented, who are the administrators and who are the peoplewho are able to command this Government? Why are theynot loocking at our problems? We want to invest but we areconstrained. So we have got to go overseas we have got tohave off-share banking dividends into this country. ? . . . . , .

We have got to ensure that we bring in legislation. Hon.Ministers, please ensure that until such time that you getyour act together at least these type of things are handled bythe correct people. Today you have people who do not listento what is being told. The Finance Ministry feels that it is runon Gods own authority. They cannot be spoken to. That isthe problem that they have.

Then, Sir, with regard to the Bank of Ceylon branch in theUK, I am made to understand that it is going to be closeddown due to lack of capital. The requirement is SterlingPounds 20 million. As the Government is unable, and undercapitalized, they are basically going to shred their investmentthere. Having a branch of the Bank of Ceylon in the UnitedKingdom was something which they cherished . The Bank ofCeylon was proud that they has a bank branch in the UnitedKingdom. Now they are called upon to close it down for thesimple reason that they do not have money.

This is the time, hon. Members that we have got to thinkaloud and think of the country. Look as to how we can find aniche the SAARC region. Today, India is growing in thefinancial sector simply because of the fact that we, SriLankans have not got our act together. There are certain thingswe could have exploited.

Owing to the service industry, we have been superlative.As you know, 54 per cent of our GDP is composed of theservice industry. Now it has gone up to 57 per cent. We couldhave taken great advantage of the financial activities of India.We could have taken advantage in the areas of health andeducation. Unfortunately, owing to the introverted attitudeof our Sri Lankan planners we have lost that opportunity.This is the time that banks must be asked to merge themselvesat least when they are going overseas. May be Bank of Ceylon,Peoples Bank, Hatton National Bank and Commercial Bank,with no disrespect to the other banks which I did not mentionsuch as Seylan Bank and Sampath Bank, all of them can gettogether into one capital base to from a company in order togo out of the country. There is a necessity forinternationalization owing to world requirements. Other wise

we small Sri Lanka cannot stay alive be itself. There is anecessity to comply with the world regulations. Therefore, atleast in order to capture certain captive markets that are therestaring before us, we must look at getting these peopletogether and say, Merge yourselves internationally go andcapture what you could and bring back dividends to thiscountry Commercial Bank of Sri Lanka has gone intoBangladesh and they are bringing in almost Rs. 300 milliondividends from the third year of operation in that country. Iwas told that in two years they will have a return and thecapital paid off and them, there will only be profits cominginto this country. That is the ingenuity and ingeniousnessthat we have in our system. But are we utilizing it, Sir? No.That is the problem. We have got to look into this problem.

Now, Sir, it you look at the petrol sheds, if you look at theroads the road blocks that have come in, the security barriersthat have come in, the rising cost of living, corruption in theadministration, the hotels that are empty and the airlines thatare running empty, then you will feel what is going on. Banksare having idle capital. This is the problem in the economytoday. On the 2nd of April 2004 it was with a vibrant economythat we handed over the Government. .

( )(Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees)

Hon. Member your time is up.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Sir, I will take another five more minutes and I will ensurethat I oblige by standing down. So, these are the areas that weare talking about. When the country is in a perilous situation,there is no point in playing politics.

Even the Leader of the House today made a patheticdisplay in the House. He may be trying to aspire to be apotential Prime Minister. But at the same time he isexpressing his stupidity in the way he is conductingGovernment Business in this august Assembly. Ensure thatthere is decorum in this House. You do not stifle democracyin the House itself. Today they displayed the fear that theyhave for the United National Party. When the SLFP goes forelections their entire purpose is to defeat the United NatioanlParty and not to govern the country. The United NationalParty always comes into protect, to develop, to foster to bringin economic prosperity and to bring in peace and stability.That has been proven from 1948. That is why there is a senseof absolute confidence when United National Party comesinto power.

Sir, today you are talking of the country being placed in avery hopeless situation. The fifth rating of this country hasnow gone to a negative variance. The treasury bonds thatwere basically displayed to attract money has basically lost

24812482

out. So, they have gone to NRFC funding to protectthemselves, to get the money that is dearly required. Thisyear Rs. 453 billion is needed for amortization of capital.That is capital amortization and interest repayment, Rs. 300million as interest and Rs. 153 million as capital repayment.So how on earth is the Government that has only a projectedrevenue of Rs. 426 billion paying Rs. 453 million asamortization of capital funds? How is the Governmentproviding answers to these matters? The inflation is 17.7 percent and I am informed that in the month of June it has goneup to 18.4 per cent. A world record is being created in thisarea.

So, this is the time we need to come out. Look at what theyare saying about the BOI today. The Hon. Minister ofEnterprise Development and Investment Promotion, has, underhim enterprises that are diving forward. But they are sayingthat the BOI is no more the Board of Investments. It is aBarrier Of Investments. That is what is told about the BOI. So,ensure that we change this. Look at the censorship that istaking place. Look at credit cards.

Go slow sinking Colombo port, importers, exporters

2006 1824832484

Today the Government has lost Rs. 400 million in fivedays due to lack of activities in the Colombo Port, simplybecause of a go slow. It is not that they are on strike. Anemployee there is getting Rs. 30,000 to 40,000 per month.They are getting a higher remuneration, than the Membersof Parliament here. When the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopullewanted do increase the salaries of innocent MPs they made abig noise. But, today people who are earning Rs. 30,000 permonth want Rs. 42,000 per month and they have gone on ago slow. The country has lost Rs. 400 million.

? , . . , . . . . , . ?

Then, Sir, I am quoting a headline from the Financial Timesof the Daily Mirror Newspaper of today.

Exporters lose trust in govt. Support

In that same paper ther is another headline,

Budget deficit balloons but Govt says it is being managed well

That means from the projected deficit of Rs. 67 billion, ithas gone up to Rs. 88 billion, which means you are basicallylosing out another Rs. 21 billion.

Sir, I will take another two minutes and finish off my speech.You have bascically shattered the confidence factor. You aretalking of the LIOC. The LIOC today, is bringing fundinginto this country and the entire Ceylon PetroleumCorporation is in great jeopardy. They are going to sell petrolat Rs. 100. The Petroleum Corporation depends totally onits own means. So, with the interest cost that is there theywill basically be made to run out of business. The problem isthe same with the Electricity Board Today, they are Sayingthat they do not have sufficient monies. Look at the DailyMirror of 14th July which say IOC monopoly will closedown CPC and CEB, warn unions These institutions arepre-warned by these people.

Government wrong inhelping terrorists : JHU . ?

( )(Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees)Hon. Member, your time is up.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) shape . . 60 ? Ward place . , ? 10.00 , ? , . . 1971 ,1988 , 1989 , , . . ? ? Daily News . It states, I quote :

? , radio station . NTTE - The National Television of Tamil Eelam. ? , ? ? accident . . . ? , . ? , ? ., ? ? ? . The war that we should have taken to theLTTEs doorstep, the LTTE has brought it on to our doorstep.This is the irony of the mismanagement of this Government.We are asking It is the same rhetoric that they are doing onthe economic front? They laughed at the United NationalParty. They laughed at the experience and the ability of theUnited National Party. Today, they are in an absolute mess.The Indian Government is asking, Can you not get your acttogether? That is the irony. I am talking of the front-pagepicture of the Sunday Times of July 9th. That is regarding theinnocent children who have not even seen a metal detector.When they go to school they have to learn what metaldetectors are. That is the level that this country has descendedto.

Then about Lieutenant General Parami Kulatunga whodied recently. His sister is a saying that the brother is no moreamong the living owing to the fact that the army and the

[ ]Government did not provide necessary security to him andon this matter we have asked for a clarification from theGovernment. Why is the investigation regarding this notbeing brought forward? This is what is going on. The LTTEinsists on the ouster of Norway. What is the action that theGovernment is taking on this? So, these are matters of greatconcern because the country is being governed today in theTalaiban style. The Cabinet is devoid of any knowledge onwhat is going on. The Hon. Members of Parliament are beingsent to Parliament just to say, Do this task and do anythingfurther. Is there an organized crime that is going on in thiscountry? Every time when there is a peace resolution, there issomebody who destabilizes it. I know that little Sri Lanka isbeing envied by many. But, that does not mean that othercountries have a right to come and stifle us and basicallymanipulate certain political parties. India with whom we havean extremely close relationsship will ensure that they willtake on anybody who tries to destabilize us. So, on that basisthe Government must realize the geopolitical situation inthis country. In 1971, 1972 , , , ? ?

( )(Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees)Hon. Member, your time is up.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Please, give me just a second. I will conclude my speech.

Then on the same basis Norway when they are about tobring peace again they are being chased out. Is there nonecessity for peace to be brought into this country? We cansee that there is a desperate attempt by His Excellency thePresident and certain right-thinking hon. Members of theGovernment for a political settlement of this problem. But, isit being deprived by some? Is it being sponsored by some?Today there may be - , ? . . ? ? ? ? . . . . ? . . . , . , ? ? . ?

( )( () - , )(The Hon. (Dr) Sarath Amunugama - Minister of PublicAdministration and Home Affairs)Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, before I go intodetails of the Bills that we are discussing in Parliamenttoday, I would like to respond to some of the criticisms madeby my good Friend, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake.

His speech was a diatribe, a collection of all the critritismsthat are made by the UNP on public platforms. I think thatthese criticisms in the UNP are both internal and external.Going by the news papers he has made similar criticismsinternally as well. But that is a matter for him. I only wnatto tell you that the objective situation is quite differentfrom what he says.

I refer you, Sir, to the Annual Report of the Central Bankfor 2005 which I think is a more reliable analysis of theeconomy of this country. Let me deal with the commentson the development of financial institutions. That was amatter my Hon. Friend referred to. The actualmacroeconomic situation is as follows, Sir.

I quote, page 126, Chapter 8.2 of the Annual Report ofthe Central Bank for 2005, under the heading,Developments in Financial Institutions, it states :

Financial institutions expanded and improved further in 2005,enhancing the capacity and capability of the financial sector toeffectively support the financial needs of the economy. The numberof insurance and leasing institutions increased. Although the numberSof banks increased with the establishment of a government ownedspecialized bank, the SME Bank . . . . .

That is the Lankaputhra Bank.

. . . . . . the number of banks at the end of the year remainedunchanged as a result of the merger . . . . .

Exactly what you were recommending.

. . . . . . of a licensed specialised bank with a licensedcommercial bank. Total assets of financial institutions increased by14 per cent . . . . .

during the year 2005. So, these are the macro-elementsunder which some of your individual comments we maytake into consideration. But, certainly, we cannot take upthe position that we have been remiss in managing thefinancial sector.

Let me give you some other information from the CentralBank Report. Page 126, Chapter 8.2 further states underthe heading, The Central Bank of Sri Lanka, I quote :

The country experienced signifficant amounts of foreign inflowsof funds through grants, loans, debt relief and remittances, whichled to an overall improvement in the NFA and resulted in a BOPsurplus.

after a long time.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)If you relate that to the investments, I will certainly grantthat.

( () )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)As far as we are concerned, it may be that some of theseinflows were through tsunami assistance. I am only talkingof the macro-picture. The fact is that these flows haveoccurred and our Balance Of Payment position hasimproved. This refers to 2005. I can also tell you, as far as2006 and the years to come are concerned, you are wellaware that largely due to the negotiations with China, withIndia, with Japan and with many of our bilateral partners,we are about to start a large number of infrastructuralprojects. We are going to start the Norachcholai Project. Iam happy to say that the Government of China has more orless finalized the assistance package on that. We are workingon Kotmale, the Colombo-Katunayake Highway and manyother major projects both in the Government sector and inthe private sector.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)I give credence to what you are saying. Commercial loansare coming into this country. But the multilateral lendingagencies who are lending loans that include grace periodsare stopping. On that basis, it is commercial lending. You,yourself said that Sri Lanka will be the sick man of Asia.Is this the correct way?

( () )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

No, I will come to that. But let me explain in a profes-sional way. The fact of the matter is that with the moneycoming in for these major infrastructural projects, I think,you know well enough not to dispute that, there will be anexpansion in our economy.

24892490

[ ]

We are hoping to have a seven to eight per cent growth inGDP this year in a sustainable basis. So, the situation is notas you have mentioned in respect of various details whichwe can discuss. Some of it is right. Some of it is not right. Butthe fact of the matter is that, in the year 2005 we have hadvery significant growth. We have had a balace of paymentsurplus. This year largely due to our infrastructural projects,we are projecting an unprecedented growth. As regards thecommercial borrowings, now the situation globally haschanged. Hon. Member, it is true that may be five or tenyears ago the lending was basically government togovernment when it came to bilateral funds or we went tothe World Bank or to other lending agencies like the AsianDevelopment Bank. Kindly follow my argument. Hon. RaviKarunanayake, I will be very grateful if you will follow whatI am trying to say.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

I am following. You go ahead.

( () )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

What I am trying to say is that, today, if you take all themajor countries such as China, India, Malaysia and theEuropean Union countries the lending pattern is changing.Though it is government to government, the money is beingchannelled through EXIM banks. The basic negotiationsare with the EXIM banks. The governments are subsidizingthe interest rates which are offered to us by the EXIM banks.That is a new trend that is taking place in the world of bilateralassistance.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Minister, that is why I said that the United NationalParty under the leadership of Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghemanaged to get US Dollars 4500 billion into this country.That was at a .01and .2 per cent interest rate. Now you arepaying 6 per cent, 7 per cent. (Interruption)

( () )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

That is completely wrong. we are getting preferential rates.That is what I am trying to explain. There is an informationgap in this. Take the Government of China for example.They are not lending money on a government to governmentbasis. Our negotiations will be with the Export Import Bankof China. But the Government of China will be subsidizingor giving the differential to that banks, so that the bank willlend us at very low rates which we used to get under G to Garrangements. This is a system of lending which is changing

all over the world because most of the governments do notwant to have local agencies here. They do not want to haveunnecessary extra funding. They prefer to do it on a financialbasis, but the advantage to the recipient country will comewhen the differential regarding the concessional credit andthe normal EXIM bank credit will be paid to the bank by therelevant government. So, please do not worry that there isgoing to be a slippage in the growth process and a slippagein the amount of money coming into this country. But nowI come to some areas where I agree with you.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Government to government lending in no way excludethe private sector involvement. You would know, theNorochcholai coal power plant which is US Dollars 420million where Allan Watson the Switzerland consultant hadasked, we basically got for European standards, US Dollars420 million and the Chinese have come with US Dollars420 million. The same Chinese cost is only US Dollars 301million. So, US Dollars 120 million is for what purpose?That is the question. That is the credibility gap.

( () )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

I must tell you Hon. Member quite candidly every time aproject is given to China or to an Asian county where someof these agents are not avialable, these people who have lostout, particularly I must say, agents of western companies,make a huge fuss in this country. They give projectedamounts and say this is what we would have done this jobfor. How do we know? In fact the logic of it suggests, as youyourself said Hon. Member, due to increasing interest rates,due to various Dollar fluctuations and so on, it is mostunlikely that people can complete a project for somethingthat was estimated four or five years ago. It is simplyimpossible. Costs of al these things have gone up. Sosomebody can come up with a project offer which was madefive years ago and tell us. Well, this is what it would havecost. But in reality you have to have real costs of thesematters. So, very often these agents come up with what theyestimated many years ago and then compare with actual cost.I do not want to go into details. But I just want to address anissue that you raised.

So, the fact of the matter is that this Government isconfident that there will be investment in this country andwe are going ahead with that plan. Large scale infrastructuredevelopment will be the main means. Not only in Sri Lanka,that is happening all over the world where large amounts ofmoney are being invested in infrastructure projects and whatis special about our Government is that we will be focusingon the rural and the small and medium scale sectors. So, donot worry about that. As far as the inflow of capital askeeping the growth rates are concerned, we are quiteconfident that we can meet our targets. But I agree with you,

2006 1824912492

Hon. Member. Now listen to me when I agree with you. Weare facing a very very difficult economic situation. This isnot only faced by us. I was in Pakistan last week. They arefacing a terrible crisis. All their development plans are injeopardy. You know, India is going through not only aneconomic poblem but also a political problem because of theescalating price of oil. All the developing countries have hadto look at the growth rates, the sustainability of their projectsbecause of the rising oil prices and the highly volatile Middle-Eastern situation. Even as we are speaking now, you willagree, the Hon. Members of the Opposition will agree, oilprices are escalating. One oil specialist whom I met inPakistan told me, with the Iraq situation and with all theseproblems, he thought we could contain the oil prices at USDollars 70 a barrel. You include Iraq. You factor in Iraq to thisproblem, you will go up to US Dollars 70. But if you bringIran and if you have a highly volatile Middle-Easternsituation as we are facing today with the attack on Lebanon,there is a very serious and actual possibility of the price of abarrel going up to US Dollars 100. Now, that is a nightmarenot for the Government or the Opposition, not for the Hon.Ravi Karunanayake or for me, not only for Sri Lanka, it is ahuge problem for all the non-oil producing countries. So, letus not make a mistake.

This Government is going through an extremely difficulttime when it comes to managing the economy. And I want towarn the country that with this escalating oil prices, wecannot Hon. Bimal Rathnayaka, my Good Friend, we cannotgo on old economic surmises, economic theories because theworld and the global economy today is totally spinning outof control and our traditional responses, our traditionalanalyses are simply not adequate to face this problem. Iassure you very seriously as a Friend. I was one of the peoplein our party who strongly urged, the Hon. Anura Dissanayakawill remember, that we should have this Alliance and I stillsay that we should have this Alliance because I must say andI pay it as a tribute to the JVP that unless the JVP is animportant factor in this country there will be terriblecorruption in this country. They are the only people who arewilling to stand up and say, This is corrupt. Please stopthis. I have termendous respect for that. I think, you alsomust have respect. We can have differences of opinion abouttheories, about how we are going to take this countryforward. But I think, all parties in this country mustrecognize that they have always stood up, againstcorruption, sometimes it may be wrong, the information maybe wrong. You can explain and say that it is not so. That is adifferent story. But we need some people to stand up and say,This is wrong, this is corrupt, this is not in terms of equity inthis country. I want to pay that tribute to the JVP. I have haddifferences of opinion. We have argued with them. That is adifferent matter. So, we are facing a very very difficultsituation. And I think, this is not a time, I must say quitehonestly, that this country can afford to have industrialdisputes. We cannot in this global situation be carrying onour old little warfare, our old little battles. It is not a questionof what the UNP is doing, what the JVP is doing or what the

PA is doing. We are killing ourselves. We cannot afford thissuicidal, internecine rivalry when all the countries in theworld are facing an economic disaster if they are not oilproducing countries. Every day our budgetary projections,our budgetary plans have to be revised.

That is one thing. Sir, the second thing I want to impress onthis House isin the global economy today to which we areinvariably connected whether we like it or not Sri Lankacannot be out of the global economy. I mean, that is absurd tothink that we can be on our own without linkages to theglobal economy when our exports and a large amount of ourimports are totally interrelated to the global economy. Wecannot depend entirely on our agricultural sector as you havebeen advocating and as we have been debating. Every yearthe number of people taking to agriculture are getting less.Young people do not want to engage in agriculture. Ourmanufacturing and service sectors are expanding in oureconomy. That is the reality that we have to accept.

Of course, I agree that we have to improve our agriculturalproductivity. But now take the question of sugar. This issomething in which we have had an internal criticism and aninternal debate. Why are we not allowing the local sugarindustry to grow? Why are we bringing various tariffs and soon inhibiting the local sugar industry? I am glad that theHon. (prof.) Tissa Vitharana is here. His uncle, Dr. N.M. Perera,was the one who brought these reforms in excise laws toallow our people to tap Kithul tree to manufacture jaggeryand to manufacture various types of domestic sugarindustries. What is wrong with that? I am glad that I was ableto convince the Cabinet of that. And we are going ahead. Weare trying to develop that; stimulate that. So we have to lookat the total picture. [Interruption.] I think so; let us face reality.Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, you and I know that in our part ofthe country a large number of people are engaged in toddytapping Today the police go and harass them. The localbureaucracy goes and harass them. Sometimes they harassthat person and drink the very toddy and come off. Sometimeseven our own party members go and harass them and yourparty members too. So this nonsense must stop.

What I want to impress on, Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, isthat in the monetary world we have to constantly go onmonitoring checking and revising the laws. The old ideathat you can bring laws once and for all and close the bookis not valid today. If you look at all the bills that we arepresenting today, some of them may have little flaws, theremay be imprefections. But today managing financialinstitutions is an on going process. If I give a simple example,you may buy a car - now all have bought cars in this House.So as you go along there may be difficulties. So you have torevise it. Then you improve on it. So all the time it is thefunction of the monetary authorities - the Central Bank, theMinistry of Finance and this House - to be constantlymonitoring this and making changes. So as you go on makingchanges some Members like the Hon. Ravi Karunanayakemight say, This is not enough. This is not answering the

24932494

[ ]situation. And some others might say, This is too much,you are suddenly trying to change the situation and theremay be unexpected results. I know some of my friends inthe JVP feel that, Well these laws may be all right but it willhave an unintended consequence. Now yesterday somebankers told me, You can bring this and what will happenis that banks will be much more strict now in giving credit tosmall time people because they know that parate executionin not possible. That is one aspect. We have to look at thetotal picture. So nobody can say that we should not constantlyrevise and monitor financial institutions and financialinstruments. We cannot say that because now take forexample, the use of the credit card. Every year more andmore people are using credit cards. Though it is not directlyrelated to this I just want to give an example from the servicesector. see the rapid expansion of mobile telephones. Didanybody, five years ago, think that people will use mobiletelephones like this? How do you know how people will beusing credit cards in the future? So we have to look at that.Then each one of these pieces of legislation is trying totackle a specific problem - a problem that has arisen. Nowtake the Pramuka Bank. I am not interested in wasting thetime of the House in giving the history : who did this, didthe Central Bank exercise supervision, did somebody runoff with the money? That is not what we should be debatinghere. But, we have a real problem. we have large number ofsmall - time investors as well as institutional investors,because they had a system of giving a kick back to the personwho brought the account. So, all sorts of people, largelygovernmental and some others private, went and put in theirmoney there. That may be an illegal way of getting peopleto deposit money there. But, whatever the history is, now wehave that problem. The Hon.Karunanayake spoke about thesolutions offered when they were in power. Yes, there was asolution. But, as a solution they said, We are going to payall the small investors first and later,when we are financiallystable, we will tackle the large - scale governmental deposits.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Minister, that is wrong. Even this particularamendment does not say that anybody is going to be paid.You are only going to look at the government sectorliabilities. The private sector also should be included.

( () )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)Yes, It was the same package ; the same package was offeredto us. The only thing is, the question was, who gets paidfirst? There were private sector people who analyzed thisand said, Okay. They came to me ; these things were given inwriting to me. They came and said, Okay. Initially, we donot have the money to pay all these liabilities. We will pay- I think below a certain amount, I cannot remember ; rupees

two lakhs or rupees three lakhs - all those who depositedmoney below that amount immediately. The balance, oncewe are in business and we make money, we will pay But doyou know, Hon. Member, what has happened? This issomething totally unanticipated. The value of those landshave now appreciated. In Sri Lanka, the best investment island, as you rightly pointed out. So, what appeared to be[Interruption] Okay, it is - even debatable Something thatappeared to be, shall we say a very injudicious or questionabletransaction, over a period of time, has now developed into agood investment, no thanks to the guys who planned it, butdue to simple changes in the economy. So, I think it is not abad thing for someone to take over. Many of these are, asyou rightly pointed out, very poor people, small - timeinvestors.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Minister, what is being proposed is the money weget from - [Interruption]

( () )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

You are suggesting one possibility; we are looking atanother possibility. There are even those so - called, shall wesay, local private sector investors. You can make lots oftheoretical arguments. Okay. Just to give you a theoreticalargument then let us say, they are taking this moneyand buying over Pramuka Bank. That is money that couldhave been invested in some other sector. So, you can go onarguing.

( )(Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees)Hon. Minister, your time is up.

( () )(The Hon. (Dr) Sarath Amunugama)You can even say the private sector would have starvedsome other development area, brought in this money andthen acquired Pramuka Bank. So, I am not going into it. Thisis not an economic society debte. What I am saying is -

( )(Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees)Order, please! Hon. Minister, your time is up.

( () )(The Hon. (Dr) Sarath Amunugama)I have just started. - [Interruption.] Sir, I think, the Hon.Dinesh Gunawardena is not speaking today. So, I can havehis time also.

( )(Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees)Okay.

( () )(The Hon. (Dr) Sarath Amunugama)I am not trying to score a debating point. I am trying toexplain this.

The rescue package could have come theoretically. It nevercame to a position where they had to actually put down themoney. But, theoretically, they said, We are going to bringthis money. However, they had a caveat that when they acceptthis obligation, the first pay out will be to the smaller investors.But, between making that promise and actually negotiating,doing it and transferring the bank, there were many miles togo when you all were thrown out. We took up the position,No, you must meet all the liabilities. After all, when youcome with a rescue package, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriellaknows very well, there is no way in which you candifferentiate - [Interruption.] Yes, you have to pay. This newbank will, of course, accept liability. People can sue; theycan go to court Hon. Kiriella, you will have a lot of work incourt because so many people from Kandy have also invested.You can go to court and get back your investment andwhatever interest. So, when this rescue package is broughtin, it will include all. It has to include all, both in terms ofequity as well as forfeiture. But unlike - [Interruption] No.So, let me explain the thinking about it.

24972498

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)We are talking about the amendment that you are bringingin. We are not talking _

( () )(The Hon. (Dr) Sarath Amunugama)There are so many other speakers. They will explain toyou. But, this is my thinking on the subject. - [Interruption.]So, they will explain. -[Interruption.] What I am saying is,when a rescue package comes for a bank, in this particularcase the Pramuka Bank, whoever is the new financialinstitution, the entity, it will accept liability for all thedepositors. I know, there are some people here who are morethan anxious to see that their deposits are returned. That is adifferent matter. But, I can tell you that we are accepting allthe -

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)There are over 3,000 depositors.

( () )(The Hon. (Dr) Sarath Amunugama)Yes, three thousand. So? - [Interruption.] So, that is what Iam saying - we are accepting liability. You cannot run a bankwhich is not accepting the liability of small - time depositors.That is not possible. The method of payment as in other caseswhether you pay a certain percentage upfront, some amountlater and so on, is negotiable. But, why should you take upthe position that Government funds should be excluded fromthis? Government funds also _

Right, Sir, I will be very short. I want to assure the Housethat whenever there is a rescue package for a bank, likePramuka, the liabilities owed to every single of thosedepositors, whether they be small-timers or big-timers, willbe paid by the new Authority. Is that clear ? [Interruption.]

I will read a note sent by the Treasury. It states :

As provided in the Bill deposit liabilities will be settled according toa scheme formulated by the Central Bank (Vide 3(c) of page 3). TheCentral Bank will formulate and equitable scheme.

There is absolutely no idea at all to deprive [Interruption.]No, this is with regard to the Pramuka Bank. Sir, since I do nothave much time. I just want to add one or two points. I agreewith some of the submissions made by the Opposition, thatthe spread between the interest we pay to the depositor andthe amount of interest we charge from the invest or is far toobig. We are one country where our interest rates are veryhigh. This is due to, shall I say, mismanagement may bevarious elements of political interference and large amountsof non - performing loans by very big borrowers. Actuallysmall time borrowers under Rs. 100,000 are good people.Almost all the debtors who have taken money below Rs.100,000 from banks have paid back. So we have to lookinto that area. I hundred per cent agree with the suggestionmade by the Hon. Members of the JVP and the UNP that weshould publish these lists. I want to ask the Members of theUNP, why did you not get this idea when you were inGovernment?

( )(The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella)Then, you are violating the Banks secrecy laws.

( () )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)Then, why is your representative saying that we shouldpublish it? Why did you keep quiet when your Colleaguesaid that it should be published ?

( )(The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella)That is a legal question.

( () )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)Then you should have informed that to your Colleague.You keep quiet then to get some political mileage and whenI mention that you say something else. But we are taking upthe position that we can even change the law and have thatlist published. So are you against declaring that ? Tell me,Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, are you against declaring the namesof these fraudsters ?

( )(The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella)I am not against but by disclosing the names of creditorsyou are violating the banks secrecy laws.

25052506

( () )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)So then why did you not advise your Colleague on that ?You never advised your Colleague when he -

( )(The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella)I do not give illegal advice.

( () )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)That is right. So then he was speaking illegally. He was justtrying to get brownie points for your party.

So this is the sort of nonsense, Sir, that we have to encounterin this House. But I want to say that we certainly have toreform the banking sector, look into the area of non performingloans and make sure that our banking sector is modernizedbecause unless that key sector is modernized we will not beable to think of economic progress on the scale that weenvisage.

Thank you, Sir.

(12.38 p. m.)

. . ( )(The Hon. K. N. Choksy)Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I wish to address theHouse particularly on the bill entitled Non-Performing Assets(recovery) Bill the objective of which is to set up a NationalAsset Management Authority to take over the non-performingassets of the State Banks.

In my view, this piece of legislation is important becausethere is a duty to protect the financial viability and theliquidity of our State-owned banks. But at the same timethere is a necessity to protect the interest of the State revenuealso because in terms of the Bill before the House, the questiondoes arise as to the repercussions on governmental financesof setting up such an Authority to be financed particularly bythe State. The Bill provides for the Authority to purchase thenon-performing assets of a State Bank at a sum up to 90 percent of the net book value of such asset.

It is known Mr. Deputy Chairman, that there has been anaccumulation of such non- performing assets at the StateBanks, and the new Authority will have to expend large sumsof capital to purchase such non-performing assets. Whetheror not the Authority will be able to manage or dispose of suchassets profitably, or even to break-even, is an open anduncertain question. What happens if the Authority is unableto do so? That is an important question that has to be answered.The Authority starts - off with no capital of its own and so

clause 5 of the bill provides for the Government to makeavailable to the Authority such amounts specified by theMinister of Finance and voted from time to time by this House.This means a further loading of the already heavily over-burdened finances of the Treasury to enable the purchase ofsuch assets by the Authority which is in effect the State.

The mid-year Fiscal Report tabled by the Government inParliament at the beginning of this month and other officialpublications reval the following factors of concern :

During the first four months of 2006, the overall deficitincreased to Rs. 88.8 billion. Although in the same periodthere was a 19 per cent growth in revenue, the Governmentexpenditure grew by 24 per cent. The growth in revenue fellshort by approximately Rupees Six Billion to meet cash flowrequirements. Uncollected taxes in default stood at Rs. 92billion. The Report discloses a sharp 31 per cent increase inthe budget deficit during the first four months of 2006. If thisratio is to continue through the year, the total deficit for 2006will be 11.4 per cent, the highest on record.

The pressure on State finances is thus already sufficientlyloaded.

The Bill accordingly will overall be counter-productivebecause whilst assisting the State owned banks to dispose ofwithout complete loss their bad loans it will have a seriousnegative impact on the national economy. A differentapproach is, therefore, called for. This is imperative.

When the United National Front took office in December2001, the Bank of Ceylon, and more particularly the PeoplesBank, were in a Similar position due to the previousgovernments mismanagement of the economy. The Ceylonelectricity Board and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporationamongst other corporations were each heavily indebted tothe Peoples Bank, which had been run down to the ground.We were, therefore, confronted with finding a viable solutionboth in the interests of saving the Peoples Bank, whilst atthe same time. protecting the interest of State Finances. Thecorrect solution Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, wouldbe the strengthening or rebuilding of the banks themselves.The Bank of Ceylon possesses the capacity by itself becauseof its vey large private sector business segment. The PeloplesBank has always been the more affected of the two banks. Arestructuring of the Peoples Bank is thus the essential andlogical solution This bank has from its inception provided auseful financial service to the country by being banker tomany public corporations and financing their statutoryfunctions. However, the two public corporations which Ireferred to earlier, have once again made serious inroads intothe Peoples Banks liquidity by borrowing and leavingunpaid large sums, particularly for the import of oil. TheBank, however, has a large network of branches throughoutthe country which brings it considerable business throughmiddle-level businessmen. It also collects large deposits,particularly, at the close of the two paddy harvests. It will,

2006 1825072508

therefore, be prudent to consider restructuring of the banksbusiness by separating its commercial activities from its non-performing assets sector.

This separation will assist the bank to regain its financialviability and put it back on its feet. The commercial activitiesof the bank will build up the banks liquidity and asset base.After a period of time when this reaches a sufficient level, thebank will be able to apply some part to cushion theaccumulated bad debts.

Certain safeguards must of necessity be observed in thebanks future commercial activities. Each decision by thebank to extend credit must be based on its merits. No politicalconsiderations should creep into lending to individuals.Individual borrowings must be subjext to prescribed limits,with adequate security. Mr. Deputy Chairman, in this respectit is found that there are no limits prescribed for individualborrowings. That must now be prescribed more rationallyand end enforced strictly. Furthermore, whilst the banks havetaken security for loans given, that security has ultimatelyturned out to be of very poor value. The banks are todayequipped with sufficient legal authority to take action againstdefaulting creditors. But what happens is, when it comes torealizing the security given, it is found that the securitydoes not fetch anywhere near the outstanding amount fromthe debtors. It invariably consists of run-down machinery orold buildings which are unsaleable

The financing of activities of State owned corporationand the opening of Letters of Credit to finance their importrequirements must also be subject to guidelines. No doubt,such corporations require to be enabled to carry on theiractivities in the public interest, but the Bank has also toproted itself. The Peoples Bank Act empowers the Ministerof finance to give the Bank special derections in the carryingout of its activities. The Minister could make use of thisprovision to lay down gudelines that will govern the Banksdecisions in the above respects.

Sir, I find today that notice has been given of certainamendments to be moved during the Committee Stage ofthis Bill.

The amendment to Clause 33 is to empower the Ministerto issue general or special dipecial directions to the Stateowned Bankd, in respect of certain of their activities.

This provision could be expanded so as to enable theMinister to lay down guidelines which will govern theBanks lending procedures and particularly the manner ofthe assessment and evaluation of the security that the Bankswill be taking, bearing in mind that the realization of thesesecurities may take place many years later when they will bemore run down. So there is this provision which the Ministercould usefully employ to protect the interests of the StateBanks.

I suggest Mr. Deputy Chairman, that the Governmentconsider what I have just said as a viable alternative whichwill eliminate the need for the Treasury to increase theGovernments already near unbearable overloading of itsfinances.

The need to avoid State intervention in the interest of thenational economy is under scored by several factors inaddition to what I have already stated earlier. Risinginternational oil costs have increased the countrys importbill by as much as 21.5 per cent in the last five months.Exports have however registered an increase of only 5.8 percent. The trade deficit is thus growing. The Government istherefore compelled to spend more than it receives from thecountrys trade and tax revenue. The difference is met byborrowing.Borroeing is now made enef in Dollars. Theupshot si unfortunately that of an economy that is rapidly inreccession. The wealth of the nation is getting progressivelyreduced. The development of the infrastructure andinvestment in much needed public projects, such as,electricity, irrigation, transport and rural development,including the important training of youth in self-employment activities, finds little financial assistance.

No doubt the rise in international oil prices has contributedto the above scenario. Yes, petroleum prices started increasingfrom the year 2002 onwards the then united National RrontGovernment identified straightaway what the long-termrepercussions could be.

We therefore, put in place an automatic price adjustmentscheme Under this, we increased the cost to the consumer,thouth not in its entirety as and when prices reduced.orrespondingly, we gave the consumer the benefit whenprices reduced. In this way, we effectively. cushionald theburden on the Exchequer. President Kumaratunga summarilyscrapped this beneficial sheme, without replacing it withanother, causing great financial hrm to the country.

The Rupee stood at Rs. 98 to the US Dollar in December2001. With prudent financial planning, we reduced the sameto Rs. 94 in April 2004. Today, it is back to Rs. 103 to 104against the Dollar. in a country heavily dependant on imports,this does give rise to much cause concern.

The overal result is that Sri Lanka is receiving negativeratings and some are even trying to represent that the countryis a failed economy.

Sir, what I just said is not said as a matter of politicalrelish; it cannot be so to right -thinking people. Rather, it sia matter that requires a combined national effort and will tojointly cooperate and combat.

I trust that the Government will pay adequate attention tothe very arduous situation in the economy of this country,caused both by the on-going war in the North and the Eastand also by lack of adequate planning in the economic sector,and take immediate steps to put the country back on a soundeconomic programme.

I thank you, Sir.

( )( - , )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama Minister of EnterpriseDevelopment and Investment Promotion)Sir, indeed it is and opportunity for me to concentrate ontwo important Bills that have been presented to the Housethis morning. On this I would like to confine my submissionson the Non-Performing Assets (Recovery) Bill and on theBanking (Amendmend) Bill.

Both these Bills amongst the other Bills that werepresented to the House today are directly relevant to the co-business of the financial institutions of our country.

Today we are talking sbout a scenario where ourGovernment has come int office and we have been thebeneficiaries of a legacy that has got accumulated both interms of liabilities and that of a debt-stricken economy ofSri Lanka.

On top of that, as corectly articulated by the Hon. K. N.Choksy, the soaring oil pri9ces associated with the fuel costis again another challenge that we are experiencing. But inspite of all these challenges, as we have discussed in theHouse on the previous occasion, we have seen to it that oureconomy has recorded the hoghest levels of performance inthe production base of our country in agriculture, industryand in services in the first quarter of this year surpassing allother coreesponding quarters of several previous years. An8.1 per cent growth rate has been achieved. Today we arebringing this legislation purely because we need correctfundamentals in terms of the State Banks role in the recoveryof certain loand that have been given. I am sure that the Hon.K. N. Choksy is well experienced as a lawyer as well andwhen he was the Finance Minister I was a part of thatGovernment and we have discussed on numerous occasionsthe steps necessary to establish a more specialized onnumerous occasions the steps necessary to establish morespecialized approach, backed by a proper legal system, totackle the non-performing assets of our banking system.When the Pleoples Bank was ridden with liabilities of aroundRs. 16 billion and was not able to recover them could its ownlegal department and the recovery department ensure therecovery of these assets? The Bank of Ceylon was also in asimilar situation. I have observed as the Chairman of theCOPE during the last year, when we summoned the banksbefore us how their capacity to recover these sometimes isrestricted. Some were restricted partially due to severalintervening factors such as establishment issues, legal issues,court cases, arbitrations and political influence making themunable to recover to safeguard the liquidity positions of ourbanks and to serve the wider objectives of the country. In thiscontext it is unfortunate that the far-reaching benefits of thislegislation have not been adequately recognized by theOpposition benchers.

We are talking about the micro issues associated with themacro economic scenario of Sri Lanka as at this moment.Whilst we, as a Government is maintaining the propersafeguards that are needed to sustain the economy against allthe adverse effects that is generated, sometimes beyond ourcontrol, but still sustain it in terms of achieving our furtherstgoals; the Opposition is unable to recognize the pursuit thatwe are advocating today. We have brought this legislationnot just to allow the liquidity situation of the banks to bemanaged only by the banks themselves. They get stuck attimes when they try to pursue their own objectives. That iswhy we need specialized legislation. Many good suggestionscame from the Opposition, well and good. But here, we arebringing legislation to convert suggestions into meaningfulaction. The objectives of this Bill, if one bothers only to readcarefully, will cover the entire gamut of what the Oppositionhas been seeking. The long title of this Non-Performing Assets(Recovery) Bill states, I quote:

An act to specify the objects and to confer special powers on, anauthority to be called the National Asset Management Authority inorder to make the Recovery on Non-Performing Assets of State Banksmore effective and to provide for matters connected therewith orincidental thereto:

According to this Bill an Authority will be created. It willbe very carefully supervised and directed by the Central Bank,the main arm of the monetary management of this country.The supervision is needed for the type of direction that isrequired when you designate a State Bank coming under thepurview of this Bill, and once these assets are vested tosupervise the procedure adopted for the recovery of assets.We have seen in the past that even the Central Bank lackedthis type of institutional capacity that was needed to recoversome of their own assets adequately and properly.

I would like to refer is some of the relevant issues duringthe course of this Debate today in relation to other institutionthan the Central Bank itself. I may quote some examples toshow their incapability at times. Without the proper type ofmanagement and specialization built into an institution likewhat is proposed in this Bill that we are discussing today,they may get stuck as well. We have seen the recoveryperformance of the Central Bank in terms of the loans thatwere granted to the failed finance companies. During theUnited National Party regime - I would like to just outlinethis because it is no secret since these figures have beentabled in the House before. I will just mention some of thefacts in Annex I sent by the Central Bank and I will mentionthe names of some of the finance companies because it isrelevant, why we are bringing in an Asset ManagementAuthority in the light of the need for us to bring correctrecovery process associated with assets management. We havethe figures of the Castle Finance Company Limited in the1990 to 1991 period, that was during the time of the UNP andtoday the ourstanding amount is Rs. 101.8 million. That isthe total (principal plus interest) outstanding. The totaloutstanding of the Hideki Finance and Investment Limited isRs. 107.4 million as at today. Home Finance Limited has a

2006 1825112512

total outstanding of Rs. 309.7 million. Then we come to theSevana Finance and Investment Company Limited. The totaloutstanding of it is nil. The total outstanding of the TravelBag Investment and Finance Limited is also nil.Then, thetotal outstanding of the United Motor Finance CompanyLimited is Rs. 6.6 million. The total outstanding of the UnionTrust and Investment Limited is Rs. 800.1 million. Then whenwe take Mercantile Credit Limited, the total outstanding isRs. 5071.3 million and House and Property Trades Limited itis Rs. 727.1 million. Likewise, Rs. 7,137 million is stilloutstanding is other loans that have been granted by theCentral Bank and these were periods from 1990 to 1995 andfrom 1989 to 1991 likewise. So, this is the history.

Sir, due to the lack of institutional capability our countryhas lost out of the Central Bank alone this amount of moneythe biggest authority for the proper financial managementand all matters connected with the monetary management ofthis country. Now, here is a need for a special legislation toovercome this situation.

Today, the performance of the Bank of Ceylon came intolight here. There were wrong submissions made about theliquidity position of our two State banks. I must complimentthe two State banks for their performance. In the year 2005,again under a PA administration, the Bank of Ceylon in thefirst quarter of this year, it we go by their published figures,the profit before tax Rs. 3,203,216 billion as at December31st, 2005 as against Rs. 2,558,700 billion in 2004. That isthe profitability of the Bank of Ceylon today very muchhaving made all the provision for the non-performing aspect.

Then, we have the Peoples Bank. There again it isperforming well now. I have got the figures of the PeoplesBank. The profit before tax of the Peoples Bank in 2004 wasRs. 2,463 million and in 2005 it had shot up to Rs. 4,035million. This is the profit So, this is the liquidity strength ofour banks because they were well managed by ourGovernment both this year and the last year.

Now we come into the other areas which have to beconcentrated, I cannot see any justifiable reason as to whywe are bringing legislation than in order to support thedepositors who have otherwise lost out totally Thoughtsare of no relevance, unless converted to useful actions. Ourthinking to do something in the years 2002, 2003 and 2004has no relevance if we could not implement it having had theGovernment for over 25 to 30 months in this country. Nowhere is a Government within the first six months of coming tooffice has implemented many things. We have said things inour manifesto and we are converting them ot action bybringing about the proper legislative mechanism in order toreach our goal; the goal to fulfil our peoples aspirations asthey have placed their confidence in our Government. It is inthat context that we have brought the Banking (Amendment)Bill. There was a major issue that was confronting Hon.Lakshman Kiriella whether there is provision in this Bill topay off the depositors. Why not? If you carefully read theBill, you would see that there is provision in clause 2 (3c) (a)I quote :

Notwithstanding anything to the contary in this Act or any otherwritten law, the liability of the acquiring bank to meet the claims anddemands of creditors and depositors on liabilities of the defaultingbank vested in it shall be in accordance with the terms and conditions ofa Scheme which shall be formulated by the Monetary Board uponreview of the business of the defaulting bank and only to the extent setout in such Scheme.

So, here is a scheme that is going to be implemented. Nolaw is going to give details as to what the scheme would beand how it should be given. We have legally provided for thescheme to come into effect. That is the value of this piece oflegislation. In the absence of it, people will keep on canvassingevery other authority in the country without getting redress.We have recognized that clearly and we have brought thelegislation to suit that. We are also bringing today theRecovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions)(Amendment) Bill. What for?

There are certain loans as articulated today in this Housesuch as mega loans, macro loans, big loans medium loans,small loans, micro loans and the tiny loans. We are consideringa defaulter irrespective of how tiny the loans is, irrespectiveof what bearing it has on the institution from where moneyhas been borrowed and to what extent the repaymentcapabilities of the borrower had been assessed. All have beenbranded as defaulters, debtors and they end up losing whateverwherwithall they had merely because the same law applieswithout discrimination. Our President as the Minister ofFinance does not want that to happen. He has been beforethis House echoing over times the need to protect the smallmans interest because a wider base of this country still lies inthe hands of the small man. We have strengthen his capacity.

When he loses his pursuits, his capacities, his ability towork and situations become difficult for him, then he is beingtreated as if he is a billion borrower. It should not be the case.The law must have its own purpose of judgement. In thatcontext we have to have loans categorized. As Hon. RaviKarunanayake rightly said, what is Rs. five million today? Ifa person has borrowed or his loans oversteps Rs. five million,it is a differnet situation. But still if a limit of Rs. five millionis considered as a threshold, then why not he is given sometype of assistance to get back into the mainstream withoutlosing his house, his childrens assets, what he could haveprovided for the childrens education and likewise.

It is in that context we have brought this thereshold in thelegislation so that there is a divide between ones who havetaken loans, who have exploited the resources, who have notput that to good use for the countrys development and thatof the ones who have been pursuing their goals but tragedieshave over taken and they have got into difficulties.

It is in that social context that the President has thought itis best as a Government to bring in the cutoff point where wecan exercise certain levels of leverage to the ones who havenot the voice, the ones who have not got the capacity to goand negotiate with the bank, the ones who do not have thecapacity to obtain the best of legal services, the ones who

25132514

[ ]cannot buy influence. He is having protection in order tocome back into the mainstream without having to lose outand end up on the road. It is in that context we have approvedthat. I do not know why the Opposition cannot be supportiveof a Bill that will provide benefits to the greater wellbeing ofthe society and that of the banking community. In thebanking -

( )(Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees)Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Speaker will now take theChair.

[ ] ., , ( ) Whereupon MR. DUPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMTTEES left thechair and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER [THE HON. GITANJANAGUNAWARDENA] took the Chair.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)

.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)Yes, Sir. In this context what the Opposition has beenattempting to point out is the traditional rhetoric, showingsomething that is absolutely not present, showing somethingthat only a political platform can accommodate and that noeconomy is going to be a part of an agenda that only can beadvocated coming from the ranks of the Opposition. Sir, boththese Bills that I am trying to articulate to the House are theones that will affect the core area of the countrys developmentand in terms of the countrys banking requirements, tostrengthen the framework of the borrowers and that of theassets vested with the banks and to convert that process intothe macro development that is needed in the economicpursuits of our country. Now, Sir, in the light of this, once westart extending these conventions we will see how theeconomy is going to take a further upward turn. Now that iswhy we are very confident that the investment drive is verymuch on course and vibrant and our successes in attractinginvestors have reached very high. Further the United NationalFront Government failed for two and a half years. to get backinto good use the Thulhiriya Textile Mill. I am happy to seethat Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne is around. They were unable toget that back into good use. It has been restructured by theefforts under my Ministry. We have now started an investmentof US Dollars 100 million. We are not only talking. We havestarted that.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)Hon. Minister, you have put the time allocated to you, intogood use. If you can conclude please -

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)Thank you for your kind comment, Sir. On that note, I willconclude, Sir. Having said that, these are the far reachinginvestments that we have made and today we bring thoseinvestments into realization. That is the differnce. We havesupassed our goals. We have surpassed our targets inperformance. This is what is important.

I do not want to take further time because the timeallocated to me is exhausted now. I commend this Bill tothe House, Sir, and I think the Opposition should join usin bringing about the type of institutional strength to thelegislation we have presented.

Thank you, Sir.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)

Thank you. Hon. Lakshman Kiriella.

( )(The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne)

Before that, may I raise a point of Order, Sir? Sir, there is aserious problem in this Parliament as far as the security isconcerned.

( )(An Hon. Member))

There is no quorum also.

( )(The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne)

The fire alarm bells in Parliament are not working. TheParliament has invested so much of money and I am made tounderstand that there was a fire drill recently and theParlliament staff had to telephone others and tell them thatthe alarm bells are not working and that there is a fire and justto come out.

Sir, there is no quorum in the House as well.

, . - , -Parliament counted, and a Quorum not being present the DivisionBells were ordered to be rung.Later, a Quorum being present.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)

As far as the point of order is concerned regarding the firealarm system, in fact, I was also present on the day that thefire drill took place and it did not work. I also heard from my

2006 1825152516

staff that the siren was being rung outside the premises. Ijoined the rest of the staff outside and assembled and this hasbeen brought to the notice of the Hon. Speaker. He has orderedthe Secretary-General to have an inquiry and take necessarysteps to strengthen whatever security is necessary and to restorethe alarm system.

( )(The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne)

Yes, Sir. As long as the Hon. Speaker takes the responsibilitywe are all happy.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)

Yes.

( )(The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne)

Sir, as long as the Hon. Speaker thakes the responsibility,we are all happy.
