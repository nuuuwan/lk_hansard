There was a huge hue and cry on the tax ammestythat was given. In the year 2004, when the Government wasbasically at its peak, when the economy was at full throttleand investments coming into this country, when the investorsgot the investor confidence, when all archaic rules were beingcompletely abrogated and nullified, here was a situation thatthe then Opposition specially led by the JVP accused that aRs. 222 billion worth of tax amnesty was given to the croniesof the then Government. We are asking this Government, if itis so, how much of money has been collected? It was last yearthat the Hon. former Minister of Finance answered thatquestion in Parliament and said, only Rupees one billionwas collected. That was the normal collection that takesplaces in any case. Then what happened to the Rs. 222 billionbecause they abrogated, they nullified the legislation thatwas brought in. So where is this Rs. 222 billion that was thereas tax amnesty? There is no point of bringing in legislationjust to fix certain political activities. This creates a completelywrong notion in the minds of the people that the Governmenthas all the money in the world but is not able to do anything.Today, the Government is faced with that reality. They ask,Where is the subsidy? ? ? ? ? ? ? . . . So, on this score, the Governmentmust come forward and say whether their constituent parties the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna and the Jathika HelaUrumaya are accepting this. Earlier they said, We do notwant this in this country. So, in that case why are you bringinglegislation into this august Assembly? We are adking themto take a stand on this issue.

When we brought in legislations for atax amnesty it was the JVP, Jathika Hela Urumaya ledGovernment that abrogated ti. Then do the same thing.

These are specified areas where they are treatedas if the sinners are going and doing yeoman service to theeconomy of those countries. Basically this legislation has itsgood intentions because you get revenue for the country.Certainly there are bad aspects of it as well, but those have tobe rectified. In a modern world, you cannot say, No toanything. You have got to bring it within a certain area,control it, rather than try to stifle it. This is why we tell theGovernment, if you want the revenue, do it in the proper way.Now you are telling them, Okay, we are going to take itaway. Where are you going to take it? The Hon. DeputyMinister of Finance said, We would give a long time, till2009. What is 2009? Today we are in July, 2006. The year2009 is only two and a half years away. That is nine hundreddays approximately. Within nine hundred days these placeshave to be relocated. They are in hotels. So can you say thatin two months, you are going to relocate on X number insome place? If the Government decides then what to do. So,these are not thought of. This is the problem in todaysgoverning, Mr. Deputy Chairman. This is a Talaiban type ofGovernment that is being brought into existence. There is nodemocracy. You are stifling the media on one side and youare stifling the journalists on the other. You are trying to forceregulations through this Parliament. When our Deputy Leaderwanted to make a statement, the Leader of the House, wasvociferously was trying to prevent him. What is going on inthis country? So I ask the Hon. Deputy Minister, please specifywhat is going on and where it is going to be relocated. Alsowe would ask the Government to please advise us, what is therevenue that is expected out of this? What is the intention ofthe relocation? Now if such a business is utilizing 1000square feet or 10,000 square feet in a Five Star hotel and youtry to relocate it into a particular area, what is the intention?Does that go against the morals of the country or does thatpurify the morals of the country? If it does not, then what thehell is going on? Is it just for the mental satisfaction that thiswas in the Chinthanaya. The Chinthanaya said it is going tobe changed. So you took it off. Please stop fooling around",

Here again, before weventure forward, we would like to tell you that this is solelybrought in with one specific intention which was very clearlylaid down by consultants. Whom we questioned at theConsultative Committee on Finance and Planning. They saidthat certain State Banks are under - capitalized. They are ingreat jeopardy. They are unable to get the cash flows that arerequired to maintain the powerful statements. And as a result,these legislation are being brought in to rectify the greatdanger that is prevalent at this particular moment. The Hon.Rohitha Bogollagama also asked a question on the samelines, because he himself was confused at that ConsultativeCommittee meeting as to the intention. So imagine if he fromthe Government is confused, how we from the Oppositionwould feel. So I appreciate that but what is the answer thatcame ? I thought amendments would be brought in but noamendments were, brought in. So please, Hon. Minister, namethe State Banks that are delinquent, that are bankrupt. Thenthe people will know. It is not the Pramuka Bank that isbankrupt. They have only Rs. 600 million. There are StateBanks, and mortgage banks that are owned by the Govern-ment. So is the Government telling the depositors, I amsorry our two State Banks are bankrupt. So as a result we havegot to bring in legislation. So we want a statement made onthis. The innocent people must be protected. We, in the UnitedNational Party strive to protect the innocent depositors whohave invested with confidence in the State Banks. So on thatscore it is of paramount importance that the Minister, theDeputy Minister and the Ministers specifically tell this au-gust Assembly what the reason and intention of this particu-lar legislation are.",

Just because the Peoples Bank and the Bank ofCeylon need capital and the partners in the Government areunable to support the commercialization process thinkingthat that will lead to an eventual privatization or downsizingof the Bank of Ceylon which has 10,000 employees and thePeoples Bank which has 11,000 employees.

Even though youhave not commercialized or privatized the banks you havein a worse manner brought them under a draconian authoritythrough which you could do anything you want.

They give projectedamounts and say this is what we would have done this jobfor. How do we know? In fact the logic of it suggests, as youyourself said Hon. Member, due to increasing interest rates,due to various Dollar fluctuations and so on, it is mostunlikely that people can complete a project for somethingthat was estimated four or five years ago. It is simplyimpossible. Costs of al these things have gone up. Sosomebody can come up with a project offer which was madefive years ago and tell us. Well, this is what it would havecost. But in reality you have to have real costs of thesematters. So, very often these agents come up with what theyestimated many years ago and then compare with actual cost.I do not want to go into details. But I just want to address anissue that you raised.",

They arefacing a terrible crisis. All their development plans are injeopardy. You know, India is going through not only aneconomic poblem but also a political problem because of theescalating price of oil. All the developing countries have hadto look at the growth rates, the sustainability of their projectsbecause of the rising oil prices and the highly volatile Middle-Eastern situation. Even as we are speaking now, you willagree, the Hon. Members of the Opposition will agree, oilprices are escalating. One oil specialist whom I met inPakistan told me, with the Iraq situation and with all theseproblems, he thought we could contain the oil prices at USDollars 70 a barrel. You include Iraq. You factor in Iraq to thisproblem, you will go up to US Dollars 70. But if you bringIran and if you have a highly volatile Middle-Easternsituation as we are facing today with the attack on Lebanon,there is a very serious and actual possibility of the price of abarrel going up to US Dollars 100. Now, that is a nightmarenot for the Government or the Opposition, not for the Hon.Ravi Karunanayake or for me, not only for Sri Lanka, it is ahuge problem for all the non-oil producing countries.

That is one aspect. We have to look at thetotal picture. So nobody can say that we should not constantlyrevise and monitor financial institutions and financialinstruments. We cannot say that because now take forexample, the use of the credit card. Every year more andmore people are using credit cards. Though it is not directlyrelated to this I just want to give an example from the servicesector. see the rapid expansion of mobile telephones. Didanybody, five years ago, think that people will use mobiletelephones like this? How do you know how people will beusing credit cards in the future? So we have to look at that.Then each one of these pieces of legislation is trying totackle a specific problem - a problem that has arisen. Nowtake the Pramuka Bank. I am not interested in wasting thetime of the House in giving the history : who did this, didthe Central Bank exercise supervision, did somebody runoff with the money? That is not what we should be debatinghere. But, we have a real problem. we have large number ofsmall - time investors as well as institutional investors,because they had a system of giving a kick back to the personwho brought the account. So, all sorts of people, largelygovernmental and some others private, went and put in theirmoney there. That may be an illegal way of getting peopleto deposit money there. But, whatever the history is, now wehave that problem. The Hon.Karunanayake spoke about thesolutions offered when they were in power. Yes, there was asolution.

An8.1 per cent growth rate has been achieved. Today we arebringing this legislation purely because we need correctfundamentals in terms of the State Banks role in the recoveryof certain loand that have been given. I am sure that the Hon.K. N. Choksy is well experienced as a lawyer as well andwhen he was the Finance Minister I was a part of thatGovernment and we have discussed on numerous occasionsthe steps necessary to establish a more specialized onnumerous occasions the steps necessary to establish morespecialized approach, backed by a proper legal system, totackle the non-performing assets of our banking system.When the Pleoples Bank was ridden with liabilities of aroundRs. 16 billion and was not able to recover them could its ownlegal department and the recovery department ensure therecovery of these assets? The Bank of Ceylon was also in asimilar situation. I have observed as the Chairman of theCOPE during the last year, when we summoned the banksbefore us how their capacity to recover these sometimes isrestricted. Some were restricted partially due to severalintervening factors such as establishment issues, legal issues,court cases, arbitrations and political influence making themunable to recover to safeguard the liquidity positions of ourbanks and to serve the wider objectives of the country. In thiscontext it is unfortunate that the far-reaching benefits of thislegislation have not been adequately recognized by theOpposition benchers.",
