Court assembled for hearing at 10.30 a.m. on 14th June 2006.

Written submissions tendered on 20th June 2006.

A Bill bearing the above title has been published in the GovernmentGazette of 5.5.2006 and placed on the Order Paper of Parliament.

The parties named above have filed petitions in this Court, in termsof Article 121 (1) of the Constitution to invoke the jurisdiction of thisCourt to determine the constitutionality of the provisions on groundthat would be hereinafter referred to, others have sought to intervene.

At the outset it is necessary to state that a Bill substanitally similar incontent bearing the same title was presented as a Private Members Billby Ven. Omalpe Sobitha Thero, M.P., The contents of that Bill formedthe subject matter of S. C. (SD) No. 13/2005 to 22/2005 heard on10.01.2006. In those proceedings the Petitioners challenged theconstitutionality of the entire Bill, on the basis that it is inconsistent withArticles 12 (1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution. The challenge in termsof Article 14(1)(g) was on the basis that the Bill amounted to a restrictionof the freedom to engage in a lawful trade, business or enterprise, sincethe trade in alcohol and tobacco products which the Petitioners wereengaged in was permitted by law. It was contended by the Ven. Therawho presented the bill and some of the intervenient Petitioners that therestriction of trade as contained in the Bill is warranted in terms ofArticle 15(7), which permits restrictions of the fundamental rightsguaranteed by Articles 12 and 14, inter alia, for the protection of publichealth.

The Court examined the contentions of both parties exhaustivelyand determined that the bill taken as a whole considering its objectswould constitute a permitted restriction in terms of Article 15(7) of theConstitution and is not inconsistency with Article 14(1)(g) of theConstitution. It was held that the alleged inconsistency with Article12(1) of the Constitution on the basis of unequal protection of the lawin relation to the illicit trade of alcohol is misconceived, since thePetitioners who were engaged in permitted trades cannot be classifiedtogether with those who commit offences by engaging in an illicittrade.

In this connection the Court noted that its indeed the bounden dutyof the State to take such measures as envisaged in the Bill in the face ofthe proven risk to public health resulting from the use/consumption oftobacco and alcohol products.

Presumably in view of the determination on the previous Bill beingsubstantially the same in content the Petitioners have not challenged thepresent Bill in its entirety. The challenge by the tobacco industry andrelated business interests is in reference to clause 40 of the Bill, whichseeks to prohibit smoking in enclosed public places. A similar provisionwas not included in the previous bill and clause 40 has been includedon the basis of an observation made in the previous determination. Thisobservation was made on the submissions of counsel representing theBishops and Heads of several Christian Churches in Sri Lanka. Counselrelied on the evidence that was adduced as to the harmful effects ofwhat is described as passive smoking, Having considered the

objectives of the Bill which was intended for the elimination of thetobacco and alcohol related harm the Court agreed with the submissionthat a suitable provision should be included in the bill for the Prohibitionof smoking in enclosed public places. It was further noted that sucha prohibition would not be inconsistent with any provision of theConstitution.

Clause 40 included in the bill was challenged by the Petitioners oncertain grounds some of which need not be dealt with since the DeputySolicitor General submitted that the Hon. Minister who presented thebill in Parliament and who was present in Court at the time of thehearing, would move a Committee Stage amendment in Parliament toreplace clause 40 in its present form and substitute it with anotherclause which takes into account some of the objections raised by thePetitioners.

In these circumstances the amended clause was made available toCounsel and it was agreed that submissions be restricted to the amendedformulation. The re-formulation of clause 40 as drafted by the LegalDraftsman and submitted to Court is as follows :

40(1) No person shall smoke or allow any person to smoke anytobacco procuct within any enclosed public place.

(2) Any person who being the owner, occupier, proprietor,manager, trustee or person in charge of any enclosed publicplace shall ensure that no person smokes any tobacco productwithin any such enclosed public place ;Provided however

(a) any hotel, guest house or lodge having thirty rooms or more ;

(b) any restaurant or club having the capacity to accommodatethe minimum of thirty persons ; or

(c) an airport

may, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1), havewithin its premises an enclosed space or enclosed area thecase may be set aside exclusively for smoking. Such areashall be provided with adequate ventilation and conform tothe prescribed air quality standards.

(3) The Minister may, in consultation with the Dorector-Genrralof Health Services, from time to time, issue general or specialdirections not inconsistent with any written law, as may berequired for the enforcement and monitoring of theprovisions of this section.

(4) Any person who contravenes the provisions of subsections(1) and (2) shall be guilty of an offence under this Act, andshall on conviction after summary trial befor a Magistrate beliable to a fine not exceeding two thousand rupees or toimprisonment for a period not exceeding one year or to bothsuch fine and imprisonment.

The Counsel for the Petitioners are substantially in agreement thatthe re-formulated clause 40 obviates some of the grounds ofinconsistency with the Constitution alleged by the Petitioners. Theyhave submitted further amendments to ensure the constitutionality ofthe clause.

Prior to dealing with the different contentions of parties it is necessaryto briefly state the object of the clause and its general content assubmitted by the State.

The Deputy Solicitor Genral submitted that clause 40 which isintended to prohobit smoking in encluse public places is basedprimarlily on the World Health Organisation (WHO) FrameworkConvention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), being the first treatynegotiated under the suspices of the WHO. The Forward of FCTCspecifically states it is an evidence based treaty that reaffirms theright of all people to the highest standards of health.

As submitted by the State and in particular the Intervenient PetitionerH. S. Dhamika De Saram, who supported the contents of the Bill, SriLanka became a signatory to the WHO (FCTC) on 23.9.2003 andratified the same on 11.11.2003. It was submitted that altogether 168

2006 0419051906

countries are signatory to the WHO (FCTC) and 116 countries areparties thereto. In terms of Article 5 of the FCTC it is incumbent oneach party State to inter alia, adopt and implement effective legislative,executive, administrative and other measures to prevent and reducetobacco consumption, nicoting addiction and exposure of tobaccosmoke. The provisions of clause 40 of the Bill now in issue relates towhat is described in the FCTC as protection from exposure to tobaccosmoke or in ordinary parlance passive smoking Article 8(1) state asfollows : The Parties recognize that scientific evidence hasunequivocally established that exposure to tobacco smoke causesdeath, decease and disability.

Article 8(2) requires each Party (including Sri Lanka) to adopt bynational law effective legislative measures providing for protectionfrom exposure to tobacco smoke in indoor workplaces, publictransport, indoor public places and, as appropriate other public places.

In this background there would be no basis to any general challengeof the contents of clause 40 intended to prohibit smoking in enclosedpublic places. The restriction comes well within the ambit of Article15(7) of the Constitution which permit restrictions by law of any ofthe fundmental rights guaranteed inter alia, by Articles 12 and 14, forthe protection of public health. Exposure to tobacco smoke asenvisaged inthe WHO (FCTC) or passive smoking in commonparlance which would necessarily result from smoking in public placesis undoubtedly harmful to public health and a law could be validlyenacted to prevent such exposure to tobacco smoke in enclosed publicplaces.

We would now deal with the specific amendments suggested by thePetitioners. They are :

(i) that the prohibition in clause 40(1) that no person shall allowany person to smoke any tobacco product within any enclosedpublic place, should have a limitation that the prohibition isrestricted in its operation only to persons referred to in clause40(2), namely owner, occupier and the like of the place ;

We are of the view that the ambit of sub-clauses (1) and (2)are different. Sub-clause (1) deals with an actual state ofaffairs where any person who could take steps to preventallows any other person to smoke in an enclosed publicplace, whereas sub clause (2) relates to general preventivemeasures that have to be taken by the owner/occupier andthe like, to ensure that no person shall smoke within anenclose public place. In the circumstances we do not see anymerit this ground of objection. It certainly does not involveany question of unconstitutionality in view of the findingsstateabove.

(ii) That in proviso (a) and (b) to sub-clause (2) the requirementof having thirty rooms or more call of having the capacityto accommodate the minimum of thirty persons, be deleted.The submission is that the proviso should permit any hotel,guest house, lodge or restaurant irrespective of the capacityto have exclusive areas for smoking with adequate ventilation.It appears from the meterial submitted that the restriction inthe proviso with reference to thirty rooms or seating capacityof thirty persons, is based on the Act now operative in Indiabearing the title The Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products(Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulations of Trade andCommerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act 2003 Act No. 34 of 2003.

A similar provision appears in Section 4 of the Indian Act.The rationale for permitting exclusive smoking areas basedon the capacity of the establishment is to prevent a possibleavoidance of liability. It is clear that only large establishmentscould afford in economic terms the provsion of sufficientlyventilated places exclusively for smoking. In view of theharm to the smoker by smoking is such places, the exceptionshould be limited in its application. The restriction adoptedin the Indian legislation is in our view is reasonable.

(iii) We have to make similar observation with regard to submissionthat provision should be included to have one or moreenclosed spaces or enclosed areas which could be set asideexclusively for smoking. The entire objective of the Billwould be defeated by a proliferation of exclusive smokingareas ;

(iv) that the definition in sub clause (5) be restricted to what ismeant by the phrase public place and that it should not bea definition of enclosed public place.

The submission is that whether any public place is enclosedin order to attract the prohibition would be a question of factto be determined by a Court depending on the facts andcircumstances of each alleged contravention.

The present formulation would involve certain difficulitesprimarily in interpretation. The first part of clause 5 reads asfollows :

For the purpose of this section enclosed public placemeans any place to which public have access, whetheras a right or otherwise of a permanent or semi-permanentnature.

The second part specifies certain places, included in the definition.In our view the first part of the definition that an enclosed publicplace mean any place to which public have access, whether as a rightor otherwise of a permanent or semi permanent nature, includes adegree of artificiality. A place to which public have access, wouldindeed be a public place. But, the law cannot go further and definesuch place as being an enclosed public place.

Therefore in our view the definition should be separated as follows:

The first part will define the phrase public place to mean any placeto which public have access, whether as a right or otherwise and thesecond part to define an enclosed public place to include the placesthat are specified in the definition.

Further we are of the view that the reference at the end to kiosk orany other similar place extends the operation of the definition to awide and imprecise area which would be both, unreasonable consideringthat smoking is yet lawful and incapable of proper enforcement.

Therefore in our view the prohibition should be limited to whatwould ordinarily come within the meaning of phrase enclosed publicplace.

Whilst the other places specified in the definition would generallyhave the characteristic of being enclosed public places and warrant theprohibition the word kiosk does not have a generally operative meaningof being a place which is enclosed. In the circumstances we are of theview that inclusion of the words kiosk or any other similar placewould be unreasonable and be in conflict with Article 12(1) of theConstitution. Subject to the foregoing we are of the view that clause 40as appearing above would not be inconsistent with the Constitution.

The other main objection to the Bill is by the intervenient Petitionersincluding Ven. Dr. Omalpe Sobitha Thero, M.P., who presented theprevious Bill, who submit that the definition of alcohol products asappearing in clause 46 has been changed from the definition containedin clause 42 of the previous bill after its content was specificallyconsidered by this Court in the previous determination and found to bereasonable and constitutional. It was submitted that the amendment hasbeen made to remove Brewery Industry at that from the operation ofthe proposed law and as such the amendment-

(i) defeats the purpose of the bill,(ii) is contrary to government policy, and(iii) confer an undue advantage on those engaged in the breweryindustry, at this so as to be inconsistent with Article 12(1) of theConstitution.

19071908

It was specifically submitted on behalf of the Ven. Thera that theprohibition on the sale of inter alia of alcohol products to personsbelow the age of 21 years, being an amendment done after considerationby Court to clause 29 of the previous bill will be defeated entirely bythe new definition of alcohol product in the present Bill.

In view of the serious submissions that have been made this touch onthe bona fides of the amendment that has been now been presented byGovernment, it is necessary to consider this matter in its entirety.

The term alcohol product was defined in the previous bill as follows:

Alcohol product means a beverage containing a volume of one percentum or more of alcohol

Objections were raised to this provision especially the breweryindustry and certain others on the basis that some pharmaceuticalscontain more than 1% alcohol. The Court in its previous determinationhas specifically held that there is no evidence of any pharmaceuticalproduct that would come within the definition and that the Petitionershave in any event no interest in the pharmaceutical or ayurvedic drugindustry. The Court further noted that the alcohol content to be specifiedis a matter of policy and that there was no material to demonstrate thatthe definition is per se unreasonable so as to be inconsistent with Article12(1) of the Constitution.

The submissions of the intervenient Petitioners is that the definitionin the previous bill based on a lower percentage of alcohol so as toinclude brewery products is consistent with the policy of the Governmentas contained in the Mahinda C hintanaya which proclaimed that theshould be a stop to intoxicants ( .)

In this context it was submitted that the definition in clause 46 of thepresent bill which provides that only a beverage containing in volumeof 4.5% or more of alcohol would be an alcohol product, would ineffect remove beer from the definition of alcohol product and permitthe sale of beer to persons below the age of 21 years and also permitbeer advertisements.

On this basis the intervenient Petitioners supported the grounds ofobjection that the amendment is, (1) inconsistent with the proclaimedGovernment policy of there being a stop to intoxicants ( .) (2)that the purpose of the bill in prohibiting the sale of liquor to personsbelow the age of 21 and the advertisement of alcohol products, will bedefeated and (3) give an unduly favourable treatment to those in thebrewery industry and the by exempting them from the operation of therestrictions as contained in the bill.

Having considered the submissions we are in agreement with thegrounds of objections raised. These grounds of objection are in ourview well founded. Addl. Solicitor General when questioned by Courtwas not able to make any submission as to the basis on which thepresent bill departs from the definition as affirmed by this Court in theprevious determination.

The submission that the amendment has been made to accommodatethe interest of the brewery industry and is also well founded, since inthe petition dated 13.06.06 in SD 1/2006 filed by the IntervenientPetitioner - Lion Brewery Ceylon Ltd., in paragraph 17 it is stated asfollows : The Intervenient Petitioners state that some of the productsmanufactured by the intervenient Petitioners falls outside the definitionof the word alcohol product as defined in clause 46 of the new bill.

Thus it is manifest that what the brewery industry failed to achievewhen the bill was considered by this Court previously as to itsconstitutionality, it has obtained by having the Bill presented again byGovernment including an amendment which substantially exempts itsproducts from the operation of the law.

The more serious aspect of this amendment is in relation to certainamendments that were suggested by Court in the previous bill whichoriginally contained a prohibition of sale and promotion of sale of anytobacco or alcohol product within the teivn of 100 meters of any

premises frequented mainly by children or young adults (clause 29 ofthe previous bill.) The term children was defined to mean personswho are 18 years of age and young adults to persons who are of 18 butbelow 25 years. It was strenuously contended before this Court that thisprovision would amount to an effective prohibition of sale of tobaccoand alcohol products within a city such as Colombo.

In these circumstances it was agreed by all parties that this provisionbe deleted and substituted with a provision which prohibits the sale oftobacco and alcohole products to persons below the age of 21, Theentire purpose of this clause was to protect the younger generationfrom early use and addiction to tobacco and alcohol products. Thisamendment was specifically agreed upon on the basis that breweryproducts would come within the ambit of the prohibition and that therewould be no sale of brewery products to persons below the age of 21years and there would be no advertisements of those products.

In the circumstances we are of the view all 3 grounds of objectionraised by the intervenient Petitioners in regard to the increase of alcoholcontent in the definition of alcohol product in clause 46 of the billwhich is intended to circuitously exempt the sale of brewery productsfrom the prohibitions and restrictions in the Bill is inconsistent withArticle 12(1) of the constitution, Irrespective of legal considerations itis a reversal of the proclaimed policy of Government of there being astop to intoxicants ( ).

Accordingly we are of the view that this clause should be amended toinclude the previous definition that had been considered by this Courtand found to be consistent with the Consititution.

For the reasons stated above we make a determination that the bill isnot inconsistent with the Constitution subject to the amendment ofclause 40(5) and the amendment of the definition of alcohol productappearing in clause 46 to be the same as in clause 42 of the previousBill.

: :Determination of the Supreme Court:

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTREPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA

AN ACT TO AMEND THE RECOVERY OF LOANS BY BANKS(SPECIAL PROVISIONS) ACT NO. 4 OF 1990

S. C. (SD) No. 7/2006

Before:Sarath N. Silva, C. J.,Raja Fernando, J.Gamini Amaratunga, J.

Counsel : Harsha Fernando, Senior State Counsel for the Attorney-General Court assembled for hearing at 11.00 a.m. on 26th June 2006.

A Bill for the amendment of the above Act has been certified by theSecretary to the Cabinet of Ministers as being urgent in the nationalinterest, in terms of Article 122 of the Constitution and referred to thisCourt for a Special Determination by His Excelleny the President.

The single clause in the Bill is to be introduced as Section 5A to theRecovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act no. 4 of 1990.

Senior State Counsel who assisted Court in considering theconstitutionally of the amendment submitted that its purpose is to limitthe operation of the provisions of Act No. 4 of 1990, only to instanceswhere at the time default is made the amount due and owing to theBank is more than Rs. 5 million excluding interest and penalty.Consequently, the Bank would not be empowered to take steps in termsof Secton 3, 4 and 5 of the Act where the principal amount in default ismore than Rs. 5 million.

In the previous determination made by the Court (S.C(SD) 23/2003)five Judges of this Court considered the constitutionality of certainamendments that were sought to strengthen the provisions of Act no. 4of 1990. The Court examined the entire constitutional basis of the Actand held that a Bank being the lender and a borrower are parties to acivil transaction and belong to a single class of persons in the perspectiveof Article 12(1) of the Constitutiion which provides that all persons areeuql before the law and are entitled to equal protection of the law. Onthis basis it was observed that the conferment of a special power on abank to make recovery of the loan uopn its own decision (parateexecutie) would be inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Subsequently another Divisional Bench of this Court has held thatthe provision of the Act will not apply where are the principal debtorhimself is not the mortgagee.

The proposed amendment is intended to limit the operation of theAct to instances where the amount due as principal is more than Rs. 5million and thereby give a measure of relief to borrowers whoseindebtedness if relatively low. The bank would in any event be entitledto have recourse to the ordinary process of law under the Mortgage Actto enforce the liability of the borrower.

In the circumstances there could be no objection to the proposedamendment on any ground of constitutionality.

Senior State Counsel submitted that the word instituted as appearingin line 2 of section 5A in the Bill should be substituted with wordinitiated. It would also be necessary to specify in line 7 that thereference is to amount due on such loan. Appropriate amendmentscould be considered at the Committee Stage in Parliament.

Accordingly we make a determination that the Bill is not inconsistentwith any provision of the Constitution.

Sir, if we look at the economic indices and indicators, wehave now reached a growth rate of 8.1 per cent in the firstquarter of thsi year. This is a significant achievement for ourGovernment and the country as a whole because this is thestarting point of a sustainable development that can matchthe progress of the new world of the 21st Century. Now we arebecoming partners, in terms of regional economicadvancement, particularly with countries like India andPakistan with whom we are maintaining very close ties atthis moment. If I may have your indulgence, Sir, let me quotefrom the Mid Year Fiscal Position Report - 2006, which hasnow been released and which will shortly come beforeParliament to show how the economic indices and theeconomic growth played a significant role in terms of ourGovernments first quarter performance. In page 30, states, Iquote :

The ecomomy after a speedy recovery from the Tsunami shock andregistering 6.2 percent growth in 2005, recorded an impressive 7 percentgrowth -

Sir, this says there is a 7 per cent growth. After a calculationof the latest statistics, it has shown that now we have registeredan 8.1 per cent growth rate.

- during the first quarter of 2006 reflecting resilience of the countryseconomy to external shocks. The recent high growth momentum hasbeen mainly due to the increased investment activity including the posttsunami development work and improved domestic supply in responseto growing domestic demand supported by a significant growth inprivate sector credit.

The growth was broad based. Continued expansion in agriculture,mainly improved performance in tea, rubber, paddy and food cropsand rapid recovery in the fisheries sector, contributed towards aquarterly 11 percent growth in agriculture during the first quarter.

Tea production increased by 6 per cent against the 1.2 percent growthin the same period of 2005 and Rubber and Coconut production grewby 17.3 percent and 10.1 percent respectively, indicating a rapid recoveryfrom the negative growth rate recorded in the relevant period of 2005.The value addition in the fisheries sector has grown by 25 percent. Asignificant increase could be seen with the low base resulted from theTsunami setback during the relevant period of 2005.

In the industry sub sector, manufacturing activities consisting offactory industries, export processing industries, and small industriesshowed moderate growth rates of around 5 percent, while electricity,gas and water generated 11 percent growth in value addition.Construction industry reflecting the post Tsunami reconstruction workas well as increased investments in roads, urban development, educationand health. Infrastructure recorded a 7 percent growth.

Sir if you take the Sectoral Growth Contribution to GDP inthe first quarter of 2006, the services sector has contributed48.1 per cent industry has contributed 26.7 per cent andagriculture has contributed 25.2 per cent. This is what issignificant, Sir, in the creation of jobs. In industries andenterprises under the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka, wealready have a shortfal of 50,000 employees as it stands todaybecause economic growth is taking place: the economy isexpanding and also we are sailing through a heated economytoday. The economy has got heated up with the vibrantdevelopment programmes that have now been launched byHis Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksas Government.

2006 0419451946

It is in that context that we are having these hurdles andchallenges that we now face. The electricity demand theenergy and the fuel import costs of the country are all factorsthat we also have to be mindful. Against these challengeswe are trying to sustain this growth in the second and thirdquarters of this year. If that continues, Sir, we could reachwell above a 7 per cent growth for the first time in thecountry and after a long lapse, we are getting on to anadvanced level of economic performance.

Therefore, Sir, I must mention that every effort is beingmade today to encourage the local industrial programmesand also the foreign investment drive to the country asevident from the recently concluded very successful missionwe had in London. UK at the Commonwealth SecretariatMarlborough House Round Table conference which was anoverwhelming success of our efforts from Sri Lanka. TheBPO sector is growing at a tremendous rate and over 14,000job opportunities will be available by the end of this yearin order to satisfy the investment demand coming from theBPO and IT sectors. Over 5000 jobs are today available ina few of our free trade zones. We are now trying to mobilizecountrywide canvassing for job generation and for theprospective candidates to come into the industrial base andthe service sector with a job orientation programme initiallyso that they can fit in to be worthwhile employees in thesesectors. It is through human resource development, Sir thatwe could further achieve our economic targets Humanresource development is our main objective with moreemphasis being placed on the generation of greater outputfor the well - being of both sectors - the economy and thesocial fabric of our country. It is only with those efforts thatwe could achieve our objectives for sustainabledevelopment over the years that will ultimately uplift usto a developed nation status. So, this is the programme, Sir,that we are very strongly canvassing for and today with avery confident performance within the first quarter of thisyear against all types of pessimistic observations that hadbeen made from certain opposition quarters, we are now onthe way forward in terms of economic performance; factualand statistically proved economic performance that we areprepared to reveal to this House.

Therefore, Sir, the order I have submitted today is underthe Sri Lanka Export Development Act in order to imposea Cess on ferrous and non - ferrous metal scrap. In that regardwe would like to have the endorsement of this House tocontinue with this drive for generating greater avenues ofproduction, greater avenues of development and greaterscope for employment to the people of this country.

I must also mention here, Sir, that there was a contentiousissue raised in this House regarding the BOI enterprise,Merbok Lanka(pvt) Ltd. in the Horana Free Trade Zone theoperation of which is now being suspended by the Boardof Investment because it is not functioning in the bestnational interest and that of the local industries. There arecertain matters that we are currently going into and a

detailed report will be submitted by me to the ConsultativeCommittee of the Ministry of Enterprise Development andInvestment Promotion. That will be done tomorrow, Sir, andI will explain to the Hon. Members the steps that we willbe proposing to take. All these would show, Sir, that we aretoday promoting an investment drive. Foreign investmentconfidence has remained well for the benefit of Sri Lanka,the private sector - led growth is being encouraged by usand state intervention for the well - being of the countryseconomic framework and the macroeconomic sustainabilityhave been well protected and carried forward. With thisbackground we are confident of looking forward to greateremployment opportunities for the people of this countryas I have said in one of the press interviews yesterday andwe are confident of sustaining an economic growth that willsurpass 7 per cent by the end of the year.

Thank you, Sir.

. Question Proposed.

( )(Mr. Speaker) .

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Thank you Mr. Speaker for giving me this opportunityto speak a few words on the order presented by my colleague,the Hon. Minister Rohitha Bogollagama.

The entire emphasis in the Hon. Ministers speech wason the rapid economic growth in the country. Sir, you andthe Hon. Members in this august Assembly would certainlybear testimony to what is going on in the country as of today.

If this country has registered an 8.1 per cent growth inthe first quarter and it is on the road to recovery then I donot see why there is no business climate that is conductiveto attract investment and why development is not takingplace. The very attempt to hoodwink the masses by justshowing statistics does not help to permeate the benefitsdown to the citizens of this country. We are talking of almost55 per cent of this country, earning less than Rs. 1000 aday and we are talking of inflation which is 17.1 per centas reported by the same Central Bank.

17.1. . , . _

Mr. Speaker, I must confess that he is certainly the onlyMinister who is working in the Government. That is thehallmark of the people who have gone from our side. He atleast is giving the oxygen necessary to a patient that is deadand gone. That is how things are going on. Boldly we saythat he is the only man who is able to do even something.A bad brief but still he is handling it to the best of his ability.

( )(An Hon. Member)What about Mahinda?

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Which Mahinda?

( )(An Hon. Member)Mahinda Samarasinghe.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)A write-off. We only speak where it matters and when ithelps them. Every time we have got up in this augustAssembly to speak, one thing we have said is, not tocolourize the economy. We can fight wars but we have gotto fight the economic war together. If we lose the economicwar, we have lost all wars. We are at the threshold of whetherthis country is going back a hundred years or whether wecan survive for tomorrow.

During Chandrika Kumaratungas administration we wereliving by the day. Under this Government we are living bythe hour. You do not know at what moment schools will beclosed. You do not know at what moment bombs will gooff. This is owing to the express support that you get throughchauvinistic parties that is basically making up yourPeoples Alliance, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna and theJathika Hela Urumaya. The Governmet is caught up in thedichotomy between moving forward and getting back toStone Age. That is where they are placed.

Amidst this Hon. Minister, you are saying that you wantto develop the local industry. In fact, it is very good andwe appreciate it.

As you know Hon. Minister, during our Government weensured that there was a ban. From our point of view this isnothing but a revenue gaining exercise, rather thandevelopment of the local industry. If you want to developthe local industry why did you not ban this?

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)Hon. Member, I will not take your time. I will take theGovernment time in explaining this.

We have already banned, since the publication of thisGazette. This is a March Gazette. But in June we took adecision for a total ban. Today, not a single scrap is beingpermitted whether it is ferrous or non-ferrous to be exported.

That is why I stated in my speech that even the BOIenterprises have run into some difficulties today becausewe are now extending the ban to cover all aspects of localexports.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Hon. Minister when you speak, you should know thatyou are also speaking to an industrialist and a businessmanwho is trying to assist you to get the economy moving.

At this moment the BOI does 99 per cent of the exportsof that item. Hon. Minister, on one side you are saying thatyou want to develop the local industry and on the otheryou are allowing it carte blanche to a BOI company, theones who are flagrantly violating this.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)No local waste is being permitted to be procured by theBOI enterprises.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)I hope it is being implemented to the letter because it isnot the case.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)It is being done.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Even at this moment there are things that are going out,which you and I know.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)Right now I have put a temporary suspension for anyscrap material to be taken out from even the BOI companiesat the Horana BOI Zone. This is currently on.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)In any case, that is still not a step in the right direction,because if you want to develop the local industry - yourgovernment, our government did it successfully - this is notthe way to go forward. So on that score, please ensure thatwe have got to walk the chalk. Hon. Minister, while youthink it is implemented, do you know to what levelcorruption is on today? There are scores of containers that

2006 0419491950

are leaving for India. Even the Free Trade Agreement betweenIndia and Sri Lanka is in jeopardy owing to the fact thatthe Indian investors have come to Sri Lanka using the BOIstatus and taking the stuff back. This is the reason why Isay that we have got to look at it from a completely differentperspective. This is nothing else but a revenue gainingexercise.

This Parliament has been informed that the Departmentof Imports and Exports Control coming under the purviewof the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle has listed almost 100items that need to come under standardization. Is this a wayof trying to reduce imports, discourage imports or give afillip to the local investors? No, it is not the case. Theseare all revenue gaining exercises.

You are talking of developing the local industry. Takefor instance a simple industry such as the electric fanindustry. Today, fans that are imported to this country havea specific tax of Rs. 300 per fan, plus duty, plus other taxes.All those add up to at least another Rs. 600. There are locallyproduced fans. But air conditioners that are imported intothis country do not have a specific tax. If this is aGovernment that intends to develop the local industry, theseare the luxury items on which a tax should be imposed. Airconditioners are luxury items, fans are no more a luxury.But the Government feels that imposing a specific tax on abasic commodity such as fans is useful, but when it comesto air conditioners, it is not the case. What is this? This isthe duplicity that is going on.

Then look at radios. It is a poor mans commodity, foundeven in any corner. You have imposed a specific tax of Rs.720 on it. There are enough and more productions that aregoing on in this country. But in the same way, people whouse DVDs have to pay only a duty. So they are able tomanipulate the whole tax structure and able to bring insomething which is basically not produced in this country.

Hon. Minister, on the one side you are saying that youare developing the local industry and trying to stop imports,on the other, you are opening the floodgates to these typeof articles. Your entire tax structure must be looked at. Thisis what we said. We are basically asking this from thepeople who are supporting or who are supposed to besupporting your Government. Where is the tax amnesty thatthey talked of? We gave a tax amnesty. It was basicallyrevoked and retrograded. You mentioned that we gavebenefits amounting to Rs. 222 billion in this country. Haveyou all collected even Rs. 1 billion? What democracy areyou talking of? The JVP does not understand what theyare talking of when it comes to the economy. Where is thatRs. 222 billion that they said that the United National Partysquandered? So, you have got to get your act together. Wehave got to fight the economy. We are not the only girl onthe beach when it comes to investment or production. Thecost of living is zooming. It is going up the elevator andrevenues are going up the stairs. So, how can you bridge

the gap? If you have got to compete from an export pointof view, you have got to look at controlling costs. You arelooking at 17.1 per cent inflation. , 17.1. . . , 8.1 . ? ? ? 7,000 8,000 ?

, what is this talk about the VAT scam? Where isthe Rs. 3.57 billion of tax money they were talking of? Nowit has gone up to Rs. 46 billion. Was this stopped justbecause some of the Ministers got highlighted in theinvestigation process? There are some Members of the JVPwho got telephones from this company. Why are they silent?If there was a Rs. 100 difference during the United NationalParty, they would have made a big noise. We are tellingyou, Please, come out clean. Whether it is X, Y or Z, letit be known. Why are they silent?

In the same way, the interest rates are going up, Hon.Minister. Your intentions are blown away through thewindow. On the other side the interest rates have gone upfrom 8 per cent to 14.5 per cent. You are starting SME -Small and Medium Enterprise - banks. What is the rate atwhich they are lending? You are looking at LankaputhraDevelopment Bank which was started recently. It is a nobleconcept. But what is the share capital of that Bank? Howmuch can you get as the maximum from the LankaputhraDevelopment Bank? These things are there. Nice banks andnice labels do not mean anything. You have got to drivethe economy. Where are the Free Trade Agreements that youare talking of? You are talking of India; you are talking ofPakistan. You are saying, These are what we started. Todaywhen I was reading the newspapers I noticed that you weretalking of Malaysia. How can you have a Free TradeAgreement with Malaysia when they have said that the basicingredients that should be there are not being compliedwith? So, these are things that we have got to look into.You all ridiculed us. You said that we were trying to sellthe country. Today what are you doing? You are pawningthe country. That is what you are doing. You do not have aspecific objective. Where is the vision that should be thereto take this country forward? Sir, that is the alarming point,that we would like to mention.

Sir, today it is not the concept of privatization. Today itis the concept of closing it down. You are saying, , . That was the sloganwith which you came in. But today you are closing downthe economy. Look at Salusala. Seventy per cent of it isclosed down. Look at Lanka General Trading CompanyLimited. You are selling that land. . . . ? 24 24 . . Inland Revenue Department , office . Air-

Look at the Ceylon Electricity Board, Sir. Today its debtis Rs. 93.5 billion plus another Rs. 2.5 billion added onfrom last month amounting to Rs. 96 billion. That is,Rs. 96,000 million.Today, on one side their partners aresaying that they will ensure that restructuring is notpermitted. Now the Government is asking the UnitedNational Party to salvage them . On the same score theirown partners are saying that they will not support this Bill.

You are talking of the CPC. Look at what Dr. P.B.Jayasundara did. Well and good, this was done during theUnited National Party regime with a foresight. Yes, the worldis changing and you have got to move forward. It is thesame Chairman of PERC that entered into an agreement atthat time. He said that for five years we will ensure an evenplaying - field; three players will come in and share thefacilities. That was the way forward into privatization orcommercialization of the petroleum Corporation.Government changed. The Lanka Indian Oil Company hada share in it. They stopped a third player from coming in.Today what has happened? Rs. 7.1 billion has to be givento the Lanka Indian Oil Company and the Secretary to theTreasury says, I am sorry. There was no deal such as this.He was the signatory being the Chairman of PERC andtoday he has opened the floodgates allowing the LankaIndian Oil Company to import Oil from India and sell it tothe local market at no specific price. Now the CeylonPetroleum Corporation which has a debt of Rs. 96 billionor Rs. 96,000 million has to pay an interest cost on themoney. The interest cost alone will be almost rupees Six alitre. The Lanka Indian Oil Company does not have aninterest cost. They will sell it rupees three less. Is theGovernment going to subsidize that? What is the Secretaryto the Treasury doing?

That is why Hon. Speaker, I said when I started my speechthat Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike KumaratungasGovernement lived by the day ; This Government is livingby the hour. If a bomb blasts tommorrow the response willbe different. So, how can we drive the economy forward onthat basis? These institutions are not being privatized today.They said no to it. Now they are closing them down. Ifthis goes on for six months the CPC will be closed down.This is not the way to revive or reinvigorate this institution.

Likewise it is the same when it comes to roads.

Schools are closed with one telephone call. Do youremember the 1988 - 1999 period? ? ? . . [ ]

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) jokers .

Then Sir, look at what the world Bank is saying. The WorldBank and the IMF will tell anything which is relevent ineconomic terms. They are saying, World Bank expressesconcern over the situation in Sri Lanka. You do not needMr. Peter Harrold to say this. The JVP said that we mustchase away peter Harrold. He stayed here for two years. Whathappened? Why did they bribe the relevent party for keepinghis mouth shut?

Mr. Speaker, this is the said irony ; we run down partiesand when it deems fit to support them then they are silent.Where are the partners of your Government who said thatwe must protect the peace process? Today they are the oneswho say, We want to go to war. Why is there a stony silencefrom them? Now they have got the war that they wanted.Where is the JVP? Where is the Jathika Hela Urumaya? Whyare they stony silent? This is exactly what they wanted.

. , 50,000 . , , . , 50,000 .

Where are we heading to? We know that there is an outflowof capital from this country. How can you have an inflowof investment to get this type of employment generation?

Then we also mentioned about the BOI backstabbinginvestors. Hon. Minister, have you managed to overcomethe problem that is there in the BOI companies? While youare on a different voyage trying to save what is good forthe country, your Board of Directors of the BOI are goingin the reverse course. They are saying, No, we cannot givepermission for eleven items. You know there were manycompanies that almost threatened to withdraw from thiscountry. Now if they are only going to be given for megaprojects -

2006 0419531954

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

Hon. Member, I have gone through the list that waspublished. We thought the local industry could sustain thetype of support for these items, that we could encourage thelocal industry to produce in terms of steel and other connectedmatters. But I have found that certain super structures that arecoming up under the BOI Investment Programme cannotdepend only on the local supplies of steel were et cetera.Therefore, I will be removing the entire list from the 15th ofJuly onwards that this will not arise. and a free flow will takeplace.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Hon. Minister, this is why we are saying that when theUnited National Party was in power they had a coherentpolicy. We know what the vision is. We know what the targetis. That is how you can have growth in this country. You arehaving a growth today owing to the two year resurrection ofthe economy by us. If you go through the eleven itemsbanned, you know that lubricants are not manufactured 100per cent here. You know that only 30 per cent of ceramics aremanufactured here. So, why was this allowed to comeand go?

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

That is the very thing that we noticed as some type of amisdirection. We corrected that position. That is part andparcel of the administrative development.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Yes, but misdirection for 48 days from the day it came inSir.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

No, now it will not arise. All investors have been informedby a new circular.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Under Section 17 when eight companies went to courtonly the BOI decided to withdraw.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

No.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)You have vested interests. There are Board Members whoSay Okay, I have a manufacturing plant. So, let me bringthis on. I am sorry, this type of a thing cannot go on in thiscountry.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

If you can mention one name I will remove that BoardMember from the Board.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)You are having world class Taxi Cab Services in the BOI. ? ? Worldclass cab services. ? , , . . ? . .

Sir, I am asking the Hon. Minister, what is the privatizationpolicy of this country? Are you giving Sri LankanAirlines toEmirates for another ten years? You made a big fuss aboutthis. We made a fuss about this. Now it has come up onceagain. I am quoting Peter Hill who is basically saying to thePayload Asia Magazine of June, 2006 that the Sri LankanGovernment is begging the Emirates to take this deal backagain. Is this the policy of the Government? You are sayingthat it privatization. Begging from multi-nationals. What isthis? WE mentioned that Dubai Airlnes came and made aninaroad during Chandrika Kumaranatungas administrationand ruined Sri Lankan Airlines. They are posting a profit ofRs. 1.2 billion today with Rs. 1.4 billion made on the serviceindustry. There is no money made on flying. So, they havegot ground handling exclusively and they are getting Rs. 1.4billion. So, they are in effect subsidizing Rs. 200 million forthe loss in the flying area.

I am asking in the same way about the SAGT Board. Wementioned that the P & O will basically create a probleme forthe Port of this country. Now you have a problem whethertheir share has been sold to the Dubai Port. Now who is goingto control? Is Dubai going to control the Port of Colombo?What is the policy of the Government on this? We mentionedabout this. You and I were in the COPE when we brought thisout. Can you remember, what we said then has becomeprophetic today. What is the Minister and the Governmentdoing?

The paper, .

.

On the same day the Minister says, , . ? ?In the same way the Lankadeepa news paper of Saturday,01st of July, 2006, states, I quote :

, 29,000 ? 8,000 . 4,000 4,000 ? ? . . .

On the same score we are asking about the peace process.In order to have investments, in order to increase the growthrate, in order to have a forward march in this country youmust make the peace process known. Are we going to war orare we going to talk peace? If we are going to war, how can aGovernment that has gone on record saying We do not havemoney to generate electricity after 10 oclock, go for war?What are we talking? Then, why are you making this public?In the same way, as a Government if you cannot defend theArmy Commander and a brilliant officer like LieutenantGeneral Parami Kulatunga number one and number three inthe Army how can you go to war? Do not make fools of usYou can make fools of yourselves. But please do not fool thecountry. You have been given a temporary lease of life by thepeople to guide the country. Hundred and eight five thousandpeople made this difference. Today they are asking as towhat is going on. I am just asking these basic questions.Mr. Speaker. Is the Cease-fire Agreement valid? Do you wantNorway to facilitate or are you telling them to go to hell? Youask a newspaper Editor in this country to broker the peaceprocess! For what purpose are you looking at Mr. ShayamSaran, special envoy who has come from India? Suddenlywithin two days a certain statement was made. Is there anyinternal problem where external interference is needed? Hon.Karu Jayasuriya made a point today by saying that theLieutenant General was not given sufficient security. Is thisthe Government that is saying Let us develop the countryeconomically? When it comes to the JVP, they say, Let usban the LTTE and demerge the North and East. The nextmoment the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella, Minister gets backand says, I am sorry, the Government will not ban the LTTE.LTTE insists on ousting the EU monitors and the Governmentsays, We do not know what is going on. If you do not knowhow do we, as the Opposition know what is going on? This isthe sorry state that this country has been placed in, Sir.

Then in the same way, , , , .

, .

What is this? Are we trying to make a Great Wall like inChina or like Hamas which is fighting with Israel or is thisanother nonsensical wall that is there? Is this the way that weare going to govern this country? I am asking the hon.

[ ]Members. This is not what I am saying. I am only readingheadlines from some of the newspapers, which are made byyour own heterogeneous parties getting together. What arethey saying?

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Madam, Presiding Member, as you have just taken theChair, I think, I must refresh your mind by repeating what Iwas saying. Therefore please give me two or three minutesmore. Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama is the only Minister as Isaid earlier who is doing a good job. Obvisously, he has thehallmark of the United National Party and its ability hasbeen carried on to that side. I am saying today the BOIcompany that he mentioned that he is representing as thecaptain of the trade -

(+ )(The Presiding Member)Hon. Member your time is over.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Just give me two more minutes. I will ensure that I obeyyou.On that basis, sixty eight per cent garments is going to theUnited States of America. You have 29 per cent to 30 per centgoing to the European Union. I have been made to understandthat you did wonderful job in London by trying to getcompanies like Marks and Spencer, Adams Childernswearand Metaland into Sri Lanka. But then again you know thatthe biggest support comes from the Opposition rather thanyour own members on your side. - [Interruption.] I am madeto understand that you have taken Victorias Secret in aspecial manner because the feel of that is good. No problem,Sir. You go forward on that.

You look at the industry. Today the industrialists are cryingbecause on one side your suboptimization is going on. Yourown Ministries, your Ports Ministry, your Aviation Ministry,your Customs Department are imposing charges that are wellbeyond the ability, the affordability of the company. I amjust quoting a study that had been done by ten of the biggestcompanies in Sri Lanka. I do not want to name them because,I am sure, you are privy to this information. Today, they say,their export rates are as high as their imports rates. Importrates to Sri Lanka is around Dollars 180 - 2000 for a 20 ft.container. So for a 40 ft. container it is dollars 500. If youlook at the THC - Terminal Handling Cost, it is the highest inthe world. Countries like China, Bangladesh, sensibly hasput the burden on the shipping line. But yuo have put itupon the shipper -

(+ )(The Presiding Member)Order, please! Hon. Member, your time is up.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Okay. I am winding up.

I am saying, please look into this because otherwise youare going to have the garment industry in the doldrums beforetoo long. You have no people who are going to work in thefree trade zones. You know that. You know the costs are goingup. You know the import costs are going up. So on that basis,I will conclude my speech quoting what Lee Kuan Yew ofSingapore has said about Sri Lanka.

Sri Lanka - the country will never be put together again

We have got to live with the consequences of our actions and we areresponsible for our own people and we take the right decisions forthem.

You look at the old Philippines. The old Ceylon. The old EastPakistan and several others. I have been to these countries.

19591960

[ ]And he concludes by saying :

Sombody should have told them change the system, loosen up, orbreak off. And looking back, I think the Tunku was wise. (The referenceis to Tunku Abdul Rahman, the Malayasian Prime Minister under whoserule Singapore separated from Malaysia Ed.HS) I offered a looseningup of the system. He said : Clean cut, go your way. Had we stayed in,and I look at Colombo and Ceylon, I mean changing names, sometimesmaybe you deceive the gods, but I dont think you are deceiving thepeople who live in them. It makes no great difference to the tragedythat is being enacted. They failed becuase they had weak or wrongleaders. . . , , ? . . . . , ; . , , .

COMPLAINT to SLMM

Regarding : Abduction of TRO Staff personnel : Mr. KrishnapillaiKamalanathan (NIC 81335143)

Abducted person :Mr. Krishnapillai KamalanathanNIC 81335143Date of Birth : 29/11/81Occupation : Director of Sonobo Childrens Home - Vaharai

Time : 10:20 A.M., 1 July, 2006

Location : Valaichennai Town

At approximately 10.20 A.M., 1st July, 2006 Mr. KrishnapillaiKamalanathan, the Director of TROs Sonobo Childrens Home, andMr. Thevarajah Nageshwaran were stopped at the Oddumavadi BridgePolice (Government of Sri Lanka) Checkpoint. The two men weretraveling on a motorcycle.

They were stopped at the checkpoint and checked by the Police.The police then received a phone call and held the two men until aman in civilian clothes

Here we note with so much care and worry -

2006 0419731974

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( + )(The Presiding Member)Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

I am sorry to mention here that the entire speech -[Interruption.] No, I have got up on a point of Order. Iwonder why this Hon. Member is going on without listeningto the point of Order.

Now, this entire debate is on the Order under Sri LankaExport Development Act and Order under Sri Lanka TeaBoard Law. What has been spoken how is about somethingwhich is totally irrelevant to the matter before this House.In the event that there are some concerns to be expressedover incidents in Kilinochchi, those matters could have beenraised by the TNA Leader this morning in the House, whichis their entitlement. I think, Hon. Sir, it is important thatwe conduct the proceedings in line with the subject matterthat is before the House. Otherwise it will become nobodysBusiness in this House. The Business of the House is decidedin terms of the Standing Orders. I like to request the Hon.Member to confine his speech to the subject underdiscussion.

( + )(The Presiding Member) , .

. . ( )(The Hon. M. K. Eelaventhan)

There is precedence where subjects of importance wereraised in addition to the subject that was being discussed.There is nothing wrong. Here is a person who has beenabducted and now virtually killed. This has alreadyhappened. Are we to sleep over the issue? Are we to betotally silent on this issue when people are being killedand butchered?

TRO is an organization that is not related to any particularpolitical group. It is only serving the needs of the peoplewho were affected by the tsunami and the people who wereaffected by the war that has been devastating them for thelast twenty odd years.

( + )(The Presiding Member) , 84 . 84 . . .

. . ( )(The Hon. M. K. Eelaventhan)

Karuna Group arrived there and took awayMr. Kamalanathan from the police. There is clear evidenceand a letter has been submitted to the SLMM. Are they goingto deny it? Here it is a life and death struggle. They aregoing to totally ignore and only think of having a medicalpost-mortem after the events.

Can I not raise these issues? Have they not raised issuespertaining to problems of this nature? Why only deny it tome? Is it because it is unpalatable? Is it the reason?

( + )(The Presiding Member) . .

. . ( )(The Hon. C. B. Rathnayake) .

( + )(The Presiding Member)84 , .

. . ( )(The Hon. M. K. Eelaventhan)

I will conclude in a few lines. You gave me about tenminutes. Therefore, we say that the matter must be takenup. It is the duty of His Excellency the President to takeup the issue and see that Mr. Kamalanathan is released fromthe clutches of the Karuna Group. His Excellency thePresident has said that the Karuna Group will be broughtunder control.

( + )(The Presiding Member)84 , .

19751976

. . ( )(The Hon. M. K. Eelaventhan)In keeping with the assurance given, we expect that thehighly respected, all powerful Executive President MahindaRajapaksa will come to the rescue of Kamalanathan andsave him from butchery or killing. Therefore, I appeal againto grant this request so that human life cannot be treatedin this shabby manner.

( + )(The Presiding Member)Please wind up. Your time is up. , . .

. . ( )(The Hon. M. K. Eelaventhan)Human life is sacred, and we expect His Excellency thePresident to come to our rescue. Let me thankthe Hon. Presiding Member for giving me time.

Hon. Minister of Justice and Law Reforms, you must kindlygo into all these matters and find some remedy for theseinstead of just talking. We bring up all these short comingsand speak in Parliament. It is only being recorded in Hansard.But, what further action is being taken thereafter? It looks asif our speeches are only for purposes of record. It is not right.On what we speak and what we bring up here, there has to besome action; there must be a remedy found by looking intothese matters.

I would like to speak particularly about the Tamilproblem here because it is a Himalayan task for us. Ifsomebody is arrested on suspicion, they do not askquestions; they do not look into it. Immediately, they takethem to the police station. Then they say that five agencieswill have to clear them. The NIB, the CID and the SpecialInvestigation Bureau are some of them. Like that, there arefive. So, if these five institutions take one week for that,until then this poor man is kept in the police station. Whyshould an innocent man spend his time inside a cell in thepolice station with all the other ordinary criminals? Youmust look into all this. You must give directives in thisregard to the respective inspectors of those police stations.

At this moment, I would like to make a kind request:please, nominate very responsible people as officers-in-charge of certain police stations. Places like Wellawatta,Bambalapitiya, Dehiwala, Kotahena, Pettah and Mutwalhave a large concentration of Tamils. They face thisenormous problem day-in, day-out. We do not blame all,because there are some very fine officers. Recently, Ihappened to speak to the DIG of the SabaragamuwaProvince. He immediately took action and released them.There are some fine officers in the police service who aregentlemen. We do not say no. Hon. Minister, kindly lookinto this and nominate some fine gentlemen to these policestations where there are a lot of problems. That will be agreat service.

You say that you are concerned about the citizens of thiscountry. The Government should be for the people and notthe people for the Government. The Tamil community isalso a part of the people. We are not a different people. Weare also a part of the people of this country. So, take usalso into consideration; treat us also equally. The policeofficers must be told, they must be guided, to treat everybodyequally. Then we can solve a lot of problems. I personallyknow our Hon. Ministers Private Secretary. He was a fineofficer when he was incharge of a police station in Colombo.There are men like him. So, kindly look for such peopleand nominate them.

Coming back to this Amendment, we really welcome it.Before that, Sir, there is one more question that I would liketo raise. When a person is brought before a magistrate, themagistrate does not ask any questions. The magistrate alsodoes not ask why this man has been brought before him.Immediately, he orders the man to be detained for fourteendays. There must be some guidelines. When somebody istaken to custody on suspicion, he is produced before amagistrate within 24 hours or 72 hours by the police. Assoon as he is produced by the police, they submit a B reportand detain him for fourteen days. There are innocent peoplewho cry. When they come out of the cell, they are broken;it is a mental agony for them. When you take them to thepolice station, where do you keep them? With the ordinarycriminals. An innocent man, a good man, a law-abiding manis kept in the same cell with the other criminals. Is this

2006 0420092010

justice? In those instances, if you want to inquire, you musthave a special place for them. Do not put all of them intojust one cell with all the other criminals like murderers. Donot treat these people also like criminals. Make somealternative arrangements, please. The Government hasenough money. Do not say that you do not have moneyalso. You are spending so much on so many other things.The Government should accommodate their needs. We arerequesting this on behalf of the people. We are notrequesting anything for ourselves. So, you must take all thisinto consideration. Then only you will have a good andequal society, which you are claiming you strive to achieve.
