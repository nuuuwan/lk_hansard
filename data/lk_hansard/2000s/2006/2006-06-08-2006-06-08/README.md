. . ( )( () [ - )(The Hon. (Prof.) W. A. Wiswa Warnapala Minister ofParliamentary Affairs)Venerable Sir, I am quite happy to follow my learned Friend,the former Minister of Health, the Hon. P. Dayaratna who,speaking on behalf of the Opposition, made a very goodcontribution to this Debate. The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva,Minister of Healthcare and Nutrition and Leader of the Houseof Parliament, needs to be congratulated for introducing thispiece of Legislation which intends to establish a private-public partnership in the area of health delivery services inSri Lanka.

I wish to go into its history. The health policy duringthe British period was guided primarily by the need tosafeguard the interests of the Indian immigrant workers. In1872, the Medical Wants of the Coffee Districts Ordinancewas enacted primarily to provide medical facilities to theimmigrant workers in the plantations. Prof. N.K. Sarkar inhis famous book Demography of Ceylon stated that estatelabourers were the only privileged class among the nativepopulation who were able to obtain the benefits ofgovernment medical services. That was the situation in the1880s. Though the Civil Medical Department was createdin 1859, its activities remained confined to the control ofepidemics and diseases.

It was in the 1920s that the Government assumed fullresponsibility for the maintenance of health services in thiscountry. The political awakening of the period especiallywith the impact of the grant of the adult suffrage in 1931,had an effect on the Sri Lankan health policy and publicexpenditure on health services was nearly Rs.53 million.That was towards the end of the Donoughmore period.

The health policy underwent a change in thesubsequent years and the figures show a markedimprovement in the provision of health services. In 1926,there were only 98 hospitals with 8,089 beds and the numberof doctors was 285. In 1930, there were 112 hospitals with9,477 beds and the number of doctors was 341. In additionto this, there were 80 estate hospitals established by theplantation owners and aided by the Government. TheGovernment also assisted 650 estate dispensaries. Therewere also rural dispensaries. This structure, Venerable Sir,though it expanded slowly, was insufficient to meet thedemands of the people, especially the people in the ruralareas of the country. It was true that all persons who needed

hospital care could not get into the hospitals and the resultwas the ever-increasing number of people seekingoutpatient care.

On the basis of the population, there was only onebed for 370 people and one doctor for 10,000 persons. Inthe 1960s and 70s, the health care delivery systemunderwent a massive transformation resulting in theestablishment of a network of hospitals with modernfacilities.

Today economic development, Venerable Sir, of acountry is inevitably linked and related to the developmentof health services. This is a matter which deservesconsideration. The health system is generally regarded asan outcome of economic and social development of a givencountry. WHO, through its Commission on Macro-economyand Health established in 2000, emphasized that investmentin health would yield enormous economic benefits. This istrue of all developing countries in our part of the worldwhere improvements in health services and facilities wouldlead to poverty reduction and long-term economic growth.Our decision makers must realize that investment in healthservices in the end promotes and accelerates economicdevelopment. In the millennium development goals adoptedin 2000 at the United Nations Organization, they haverecognized the relationship between the health services andeconomic development and our Government through itspackage of policies called the Mahinda Chintana hasgiven recognition to this particular policy strategy.

In 1999, Sri Lanka spent nearly 3.5 per cent of the GDPon health services. In terms of government expenditure,the health services account for nearly 48 per cent. In otherwords, Government contribution is nearly 48 per cent andthe rest comes from employers and private services. Today,in Sri Lanka, there is a comprehensive system of healthservices. That is what the Hon. Minister tried to explain.For instance, there are 605 hospitals with 59,781 beds in asystem where there is a strength of 7,459 doctors. With aview to expanding the health care delivery system in thecountry the Government took over 54 Estate hospitals forwhich the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Siva needs to becongratulated again. This is the State system of health careservices in Sri Lanka, Venerable Sir. It is in this scenariothat one has to look at the role of the private sector in thesphere of health services. It began to expand in the lasttwo decades and with the liberalization of policies theprocess has accelerated. The Government also offeredvarious incentives to the private sector as Hon. Dayaratnasaid and they have responded with various changes Today,private-public partnership is a major feature of the systemand it was this expansion and the nature of the partnershipwhich demanded the establishment of a regulatorymechanism to guarantee proper delivery and enhance thequality of health care in the country.

The Central Bank, Venerable Sir, in its 2002 Report saysthat public expenditure on health services is 1.6 per centof the GDP and such a small allocation has been made

10671068

[ . . ]because of the budgetary constraints . The result was that aquantitative and qualitative deterioration in public healthservices has taken place while paving the way for expansionof the demands for the private sector health care services.Today, the private sector has emerged as a vital player, vitalcomponent of the health care services. I would like to givebelow some relevant statistics to show that this sector hasconsiderably expanded as Hon. Dayaratna said -

Number of hospitals - 160; number of hospital beds -974; number of patients - 51,418; number of out-patients- 388,069; number of doctors - 749; general practitioners- 800; private medical labs - 250; private blood banks -15 and medical insurance companies - 6. These are someof the institutional characters.

. . ( () [ )(The Hon. (Prof.) W. A. Wiswa Warnapala)

These are some of the institutional characteristics of thesystem, Venerable Sir. This means that today over 50 percent of the curative health care services are provided bythe private sector.

One must not forget the fact that the private health careservices provide a wide variety of services and a largeamount of money, several billions of rupees have beeninvested within the private sector. At the same time thereare certain visible deficiencies as the Hon. Ministerexplained. There are several visible deficiencies within thesystem. One such factor is the presence of unqualifiedmedical personnel who were described by the Hon. P.Dayaratna as . They are working in the system.

are working in the system. For instance thereare nearly 25,000 quacks posing themselves as qualifieddoctors. This in my view, is a major threat. This is a majorthreat to the health of the people in this country. VenerableSir, in any country health policy needs to be formulated onthe basis of certain national priorities, and the Government,if it wishes to establish a proper private - public partnershipin this sphere, needs to devise proper methods ofcoordination through a certain mechanism. That is whythe Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva wanted to introduce thispiece of legislation.

One can say that there is the Nursing Homes (Regulation)Act, No. 16 of 1949 to which the Hon. P. Dayaratna referred.But it does not have the required teeth to control theinstitutions which are massive enterprises. Today, the privatesector institutions, Venerable Sir, are massive institutionsengaged in all areas of health delivery services. It is inthis background that this legislation has been prepared. Themain purpose of this piece of legislation is to see that boththe government and the private sectors act as partners toprovide the people with better health care facilities. AsJoseph Stiglitz, one of the World Bank economists who haswritten a couple of books critical of the World Bank, says,

The State has to intervene in certain areas of activity to achievethe necessary balance in situations where both public and privatesectors function. Such things as equity, quality, efficiency, effectivenessand stability cannot be achieved without State interference or Stateparticipation.

One must not think, especially the private sector peopleassociated with the industry, should not think that thislegislation intends to restrict the freedom of the private sectorin the health care delivery services in Sri Lanka. This isall I want to say.

Thank you, Venerable Sir.

[11.09 a.m.]

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Thank you very much, Venerable Sir, for giving me thisopportunity. First of all, I must congratulate the Hon.Minister for bringing in this Private Medical Institutions(Registration) Bill. Two weeks ago when this Bill wasbrought before Parliament, there was a bit of a controversyregarding a policy decision and we were in no way tryingto oppose it. Hon. Minister you have brought this in aftera very long time. Many Hon. Ministers have seen thisparticular Bill and now it is going to be made legal beforelong.

2006 0810691070

All what we have got to look at is how well theGovernment money is being spent. Here, the private sectorhas come in, in order to do certain things which are expectedof the Government. Rupees forty four thousand onehundred and eighty million ( Rs. 44,180 million) is beingspent from the Governments coffers and that is, 1.64 percent of GDP. But, just four years ago there was almost 2.1per cent of GDP being allocated for the health sector. Now,there is a general impression of the Government that theprivate sector is there to extort certain things. We have beenadvocating the fact that there is a necessity for a healthydialogue between the Government and the private sector. Iguess that this type of legislation coming in is a healthysign. But, we should use this to go forward in a a positivedirection rather than use this as a hammer to hit the veryinstitutions that are helping us to protect the health industryin this country.

The private sector is spending much more money thanthe Government in this particular area. I am sure the Hon.Minister will be happy because that is a headache off him.Today, if you go to a Government hospital, I must say thatcleanliness and all that are being improved day by day, Idare say no to that, but, there is no medicine. There isthe general apathy in the worker attitude; the hospitals areoverstaffed and all these are political problems. But, at theend of the day the real efficiency comes through the privatesector and this is where we have got to decide on as to howwe are going to take this forward. In this particular area, Iguess that the relevant matters have been discussed. So, Ido not need to go into this Bill in depth because you allhave been consulting, getting things done and movingforward. But, at the end of the day what is the policy ofthis Government?

Today, there is quite a lot of money that is beinginvested by the private sector and the general feeling thatthey have of the Government is that it is on a collisioncourse rather than on a helpful and an assistance-basedcourse. Furthermore, we would like to know theGovernments decision on the concept of the foreignworkers coming into this country while encouraging theprivate sector. There is a general feeling about openingthis to a section of people that is not from this country. Imust say that there is a dearth in certain areas in the healthsector. But, if so, why has the Government that has comein to use the resources that are there in the country, notuse them? When you go to many private hospitals youfind that there are foreign nurses and foreign doctors. Thatmay be a necessity. I do not say, no to that at all. But, inthat case why do you not encourage the Sri Lankans to dothat? These are not sectors that are totally beyond thecapacity of our Sri Lankans.

On the same basis, during the last Government underthe Executive President Mrs. Chandrika Kumaratunga, thethen Secretary, Ministry of Education, Mrs. Tara de Mel hadgiven the approval to open private medical schools. What

is the policy of this Government? Are you going aheadwith this? These are the things that cross the minds of theinvestors who come into this country. When they go toinvest in a certain direction they see that the Governmentis giving contra-signals. Forget extremism in your parties;forget extremism in government; forget extremism in theParliament itself. If this is good for the country let us moveforward. But, when you are moving forward it has to be inline with the vision of Sri Lanka. Though it is politicallyacceptable, if it is detrimental to the country, then we havegot to look at it further and go beyond that. That is why Icall upon the Minister to take this into consideration. Iam sure that all the former Ministers of Health - Hon. P.Dayaratna is here; Hon. (Mrs.)Renuka Herath is here- all ofthem have totally accepted that the Hon. Minister NimalSiripala de Silva is doing a good job. He did it then; he isdoing it now. So, I guess that there is no collision withregard to this.

We are saying this for the betterment of this country. Iam sure that even now people will realize that when we getup to speak, we speak on behalf of Sri Lanka and that iswhy we got up and opposed some amendments last time,that was done with sincerity. We want to ensure that theprivate sector is not stymied and that is why I want to knowthe policy of the Government on the private medicalcolleges. When foreign people come in, whether they arenurses, doctors or people affiliated to the relevant areas,they see whether there are positive signals. But pleaseensure that you do not say one thing to the people and doanother. That is the contra- signal we want corrected. Thenlook, Rs. 44,000 million is being spent, that is 1.6 percent of GDP. How well is that spent for health care in thiscountry? When you go to hospitals, I am sure there is nomedicine in a majority of the places. Then what are wetalking of free medicine? Is it not the time that we got tolook at health insurance coming into this area. These arenot points to score in political debates. These are mattersthat you have got to take note of. The US Dollar isdepreciating. The costs are going up daily. The revenueis diminishing day by day. So, have we targeted on therelevant areas where subsidies need to be given. Health isone of the most vital areas. It is incumbent and it bestowson the Government and any of us to fully support itdepending on affordability. Many countries have lookedat this from two angles. That is, the needy should belooked after by the State and the rest to be taken care of byprivate sector/public sector participation.

So, I would like you to really look at it from a healthinsurance point of view in this country. I proposed thismany years ago and it is only on the cards because there isa sense of feeling that the health sector is going to beprivatized. No, it is not the case. Governments have limitedresources, so we have to maximize the resources. From amaximization point of view let us give the patient its best.There is no point in saying that we have free medicalfacilities in this country, when a patient who is almost

10711072

[ ]dying, goes to the hospital and dies unable to getmedicine.That is what we want to correct. So, please ensurethat we look at it from that point of view.

The next is regarding the things that need to be corrected.While we are talking of private sector development, thereare many extortions that is going on. That is the importanceof this Bill. There are certain things that need to becorrected. One is the quality of staff in the health sector.It is putrid. That needs to be corrected. That is where theconsultation element needs to come in. I would say thatthere is a necessity to have a quality control assurance. Eachhospital must be allowed to go through an ISO system andensure that there is a positive attribute towards this. If anyhospital within a period of three to four years does not getthe ISO, the International Standards Organization status,then you can tell them; you are not competent enough torun the health service. Those are the things that we havegot to correct if we are to go forward.

Likewise, with regard to medical charges, many will sayit depends on demand and supply. If somebody wants topay more how can you curtail?. That is not the answer.There is an ethical standard that needs to be practised. Justbecause there is a demand and just because there are peoplewho want to pay, it does not mean that you are going topay. Those are the areas that you have got to look into.We, the United National Party will help you to curb thesetypes of extortions. But that does not mean that you takethe hammer and hit the private sector which is helping atthis particular moment to develop health care in thiscountry.

Going on further, I guess there is negative publicity. Thereseems to be private agendas. There is a debate betweenone institution and another. That is where you as theMinister needs to come forward, if we are going to use themas a tool to move forward, to protect health care in thiscountry. If there is a mala fide act by one institution justbecause it has a private agenda, that is where you need tostep in Hon. Minister. There are many instances whereprivate litigation takes place just to score a point. I guessthat is where you need to step in and correct this type ofthing.

The most important thing is how we are going to providea better health service. There is no point in saying thatpatient-doctor ratio in this country is far superior to the othercountries in the SAARC Region. It is incumbent on us toimprove it day by day. It is necessary for the patients tolive much longer. There is no point in saying that the peoplein our country live up to 68 years when we can afford toprovide a better health service and help them to live up to75 years. That is the quality of health we are expecting inthis country. Have an all party discussion on this. Onlyfor matters that are absolutely impossible to discuss andsettle that you say; Let us have an all party discussion.Let us have a debate first of all on the economy of this

country, on important sectors like health and education inthis country because if people are educated properly, youcan overcome half the battle in this country.

But the armed forces were adamant and refusedto yield to their pleadings. In addition, the auto driver wasseverely hit by the butt of a gun.

Sir, I am asking you, is it human? Is it according to theBuddha Dhamma? The most merciful human being ever seenon this earth is our Gautama Buddha, on whom I have writtenan article in 1956 - The new path shown by GautamaBuddha - before some of you were born, in the Sri LankaMagazine. - Buddha whohas shown the new path to the world, the greatest rationalistthe world has ever produced. But all these are being done inthe name of Sinhala fanaticism, lunacy, I understand. But todo it in the name of Gautama Buddha is to disgrace thegreatest personality the world has ever seen, Sir.

I am not speaking with anger. I speak with so much sorrowas to why people of this calibre descend so low. Now look atthe pathetic incident that took place at Allaipiddy. If you killEelaventhan - will, he is a fighter for the cause - possibly youwill have a justification. I would not justify it, but I wouldpardon it. But how could you kill a child of four years and achild of four months along with their parents at Allaipiddy?I have gone and seen the pathetic condition, Sir. How do youexplain it, Sir? Are they Tigers? Plaese tell me, Sir. It isnothing but a calculated move by the successive SinhalaGovernments, aiming at genocide - -, [

I met Indira Gandhi in August 1983 and made it very clearto her. I asked her, Madam, what are you going to do to us?She said, I see your point, the issue of Sinhala colonizationhaunting a territory - something has to be done. This is whatshe told me in August 1983. She also said, For the first timein history I have used the word genocide being perpetrate onthe Tamils here. I told this to Prime Minister ManmohanSingh and pleaded with him that we are in dire need of theirhelp, I said, You must come to our rescue. We have a greatlove for India. Enlightened self-interest must make Indiarethink, reshape and re-orientate its foreign policy. If it doesnot do that and still wants to appease the Sinhala majority, Ican only leave it to the fate of India.

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem

Hon. Deputy Speaker, we are meeting here today to debateon the Private Medical Institutions (Registration) Bill. I mustthank the Hon. Minister for presenting this important Bill.

Health has always been an important subject of concernfor the public of Sri Lanka as well as for the Government. Asearly as the year 1940, the government as part of its concernfor ensuring health services, provided health care free ofcharge in its institutions. It anticipated the emergence of theNational Health Service in Britain. The results of this innova-tive policy is evident. All health indicators show that SriLanka is far in advance of the Third World. In fact she is onpar with the First World whether it is longevity, morbidity ormortality. Our child and maternity ratings are notably ad-vanced. In respect of health supply, Sri Lanka is indeed veryadvanced.

Health care has been provided in two forms. For simpleneeds, there are private practitioners spread all over theIsland. Though the numbers are not sufficient they providean adequate service. There are also the outpatientdepartments in the existing government medical institutions.For more complex health needs, the government institutionsare there. In other words, there is an extensive network ofteaching hospitals, provincial hospitals, base hospitals,

11191120

[ . . ]district hospitals and rural hospitals. They are all mannedby professional medical officers. The services offered bythem are supervised both by professional doctors and theadministrators of the Department of Health. The prime,noteworthy objective of these hospitals is that they areservice-orientated. Irrespective of the economic conditionof the patients, the best health service is expected to begiven at these government hospitals.

At present, Rs. 14 billion has been allocated for thegovernment health sector but this is not enough.Substantially higher investments have to be made to enablethe standard of health services to be on par with the heathservices provided in other parts of the world. This meansthat a significant private sector investment has to be made.

Private health institutions have about 800 privatepractitioners, 160 private hospitals, 12 nursing homes, 250private medical labs, 15 private blood banks, six privateambulance services, three home-nursing services, six privatemedical insurance companies and 26 co-operative hospitals.These private medical institutions have created over 100,000jobs.

While the bottom line of the private sector is profit-orientated, the bottom line of the public health serviceinstitutions is service-orientated. I do not say that the privatesector hospitals do not provide a service but that service isvery much within profit parameters. Costs tend to beexcessively cut down even to the extent of compromisingstandards. This does not cover the large private hospitalsbut the smaller, less sophisticated institutions. The objectiveof the present Legislation is to ensure quality control on asystematic basis.

One troublesome feature in the health service of theprivate sector is the existence of numerous non-qualifiedpractitioners popularly called quacks. There are about 16,000to 25,000 such practitioners who are a major threat to thehealth of the people. One of the main concerns of thisLegislation is to control the operations of those quacks.The invitation to the private sector to support theGovernment in providing health care services has to workwithin these limits. One is the uncontrolled spread of poorquality service-providing agencies. This does not mean thatthe private sector is excluded from providing health services.It only means that this activity is regulated, so that the publicof Sri Lanka is assured of a quality health service whetherprovided by the public or the private sector.

Thank you.

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)Thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak. ThePrivate Medical Institutions (Registration) Bill is a timelyone. Every Member who spoke here spoke in favour of the

Bill. Nobody spoke against this Bill. Now, whileappreciating and congratulating the Hon. Minister, I wouldlike to speak a few words on this Bill.

The Bill though brought in to regularize and legalize theprivate medical practitioners and other medical institutions,we should also ensure that it is not detrimental to thosemedical institutions providing a service to the masses. Whyprivate medical institutions have come up as we all know,is because the government hospitals in whatever form isnot in a position to cater to our needs. This is the reasonwhy private hospitals and private institutions are operating.So by this Bill we should not pass a negative message tothe private medical institutions. While monitoring,regularizing and legalizing the institution we must encourageand provide incentives to those private medical institutions.This is my humble request and point of view.

As you all know, today the private hospitals for example,are flooded with patients even from the remote areas. Thisis because the facilities available in hospitals in thoseremote areas are insufficient and they are unable to gettreatment for their illnesses. So it is necessary that a privatemedical institution should come up there. We must promotethem, we must provide them necessary facilities.

So Hon. Minister, while this Bill restricts illegal practices,you have to monitor these institutions. We must promotethe medical institution to go into villages, to go into thoseareas where there are no hospitals, laboratories and facilitiesfor the needy patients. This is one of the areas you shouldconcentrate on. I do propose that you offer BOI incentivesfor the private hospitals and nursing homes. On the otherhand, Sir, as you know, today we have a shortage of medicaland paramedical staff everywhere. There is a shortage ofdoctors. There is a shortage of nurses and also there is ashortage of MLTs. Everywhere in the laboratories, whatevertype of technician you take into account, there are shortages.I appreciate and congratulate the Hon. Minister as he istaking all action in this regard. You are recruiting more than4,000 nurses. I appreciate that. But, Sir, still we need manythousands more. It is not only to cater to our local hospitalsand institutions, Sir, but we also need medical staff to sendfor overseas employment. This is one of the areas that youshould concentrate on, Sir. You must coordinate with theHon. Minister of Labour Relations and Foreign Employmentbecause there are plenty of employment opportunitiesoverseas. Plenty of foreign exchange could be earned forthis country if you can set up an institution to produceparamedics. For example, nurses are needed the world over,from the USA to the Middle Eastern countries, Sir. You canearn in Dollars, Sterling Pounds, Riyals and Dirhams. Thisis one area everybody, every Parliament and every Ministeris talking about. But no tangible action has been taken sofar, Sir. Why do you not offer BOI status and invite theprivate sector to come in? Of course, you have a problemwith regard to the teaching hospitals, Sir. So you can havea tie-up with the major hospitals like the Apollo or you caneven invite some new institutions.

2006 0811211122

You can train some nurses. Those students who couldnot enter universities in the fields of biology, medicine ordentistry can be selected for a three-year diploma course.But of course we have a problem of the language. I know,Sir, sometime back the Minister of Health in Oman used torecruit over 200 to 300 medical and paramedical staff fromSri Lanka. But they do not recruit from us anymore becauseof the very low standard of the language, due to lack ofEnglish literacy. Likewise, Sir, we do not have any demandfrom the Middle Eastern countries. From countries like India,Philippines, Sudan and Egypt 4,000 to 5,000 nurses are sentto the Middle Eastern countries every year. Why do wenot tap this market? Why do we not give an opportunity toour unemployed youth? There are students, Sir. But againthe problem is finance. Therefore, why do you not give achance to the private sector?

Sir, I would like to say a few words about my district.Especially in the North-East, the area which has beenaffected by the civil war and further affected by the tsunami,the medical services have deteriorated. Hon. Minister, I knowyou are trying to provide the best service there. Thankyou very much. You have done so much for AshraffMemorial Hospital and the Ampara Hospital, Sir. But stillwith regard to the hospitals that were affected by thetsunami, Neelavanai Hospital, Marathamune Hospital,Sainthamaruthu Hospital, Nintavur Hospital and KaraitivuHospital, I am sorry to say no alternative action has beentaken so far to develop them. I do not know what the Hon.Minister in charge of tsunami rehabilitation activities is doingthere. All the NGOs that came forward to provide assistancehave gone back, I hear. For example, with regard toSainthamaruthu Hospital, the German Red Cross cameforward to rebuild the full hospital. But they are no morenow. The hospital is nowhere. It is now functioning in thepremises of a small library. Also the citizens of Marathamunebought a piece of land. But now they are suffering. Thereis no proposal to build up a hospital . It is the same asregards the Nintavur Hospital. I suppose the Hon. FaizalCassim knows about it- it is the same as regards theKaraitivu Hospital. So as a result, the people of that areaare further suffering.

Sir, the private medical institutions which were operatingin those areas, for example the Akkaraipattu Nursing Home,Crescent Nursing Home and a few other nursing homes havebeen closed down. Why? They do not have staff. Theydo not have proper doctors. They do not have MLTs. Theydo not have X-ray technicians. So they had to be closeddown, Sir. Therefore we should have adequate medical andparamedical staff. This is one area you have toconcentrate on.

Sir, you can tie-up with the Foreign Employment Bureauand make some arrangements to employ our medical staffabroad so that they will bring not only foreign exchange

into this country but they will return with a fair knowledgeof new technology. You are aware of it, but of course noproper action has been taken. So I insist on you that youlook into this. There is plenty of money available.

On the other hand I appeal to you, Sir, to appoint acommittee to look into these hospitals that had beendestroyed due to tsunami. The NGOs and the countrieswhich came forward to assist us have gone back becausethere is a problem of getting suitable plots of land to buildnew hospitals. Now the people in that area somehow havefound a land and the NGOs and the assisting countrieshave to come forward and build these hospitals, otherwisethe people of the area will further suffer from diseases. Asyou know, in the other areas diseases are escalating andthese people who had been suffering due to the civil warand further by the tsunami have to be given redress, Sir.

Your assistance towards Ashraff Memorial Hospital andalso towards Kalmunai North Hospital is appreciated. Butin the meantime, on behalf of the people of my area I haveto make an appeal. Sir, Nintavur Hospital, Kalmunai Hospital,Karathivu Hospital, Sainthamaruthu Hospital, KalmunaikkudyAyurvedic Hospital, Pandirippu Hospital, MarathamuneHospital, Neelavanai Hospital, all these hospitals weredestroyed. So you have to appoint a special commission tolook into the aspect of re-building these hospitals. Whilethere are other problems which I cannot take up during thisDebate, Sir, we would like to place before you only the facts.We, the MPs in the District, are not aware of these things,Sir. No meetings were held, no discussions were held withthe Members of Parliament representing the district in regardto this matter. The Hon. Rauff Hakeem is here. I do notknow whether there is any proposal from him for the peoplewho are affected in that district, may be regarding housing,hospitals, education or any other matter connected withthe lives of the people. No Member of Parliament in thisdistrict knows what is happening, Sir. We only know whatweread in the newspapers. We can see something ishappening but nothing tangible. There is no properbeginning, Sir. Therefore I appeal to the Government, appealto the Minister concerned to see that the Members ofParliament of the district are being consulted with regard torebuilding of this area. Those who were affected by thetsunami are suffering immensely. These are the points thatI wanted to bring to the notice of the Hon. Minister whiletaking part in the Debate on the Private Medical Institutions(Registration) Bill.

Thank you.

( )(The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva)It is not coming within my purview, I must say. Giving theappointments in the North Eastern Provinicial Council doesnot come within my purview.

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)That is the problem, Though it does not come within yourpurivew, because of this qualification problem they havetaken people outside the lot who have been working for manylong yeras.

( )(The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva)Then I will bring it to the notice of the Governor.

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)We will have to bring it to the notice of the Governor andresolve this.

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)Hon. Deputy Speaker, I am pleased to second theAdjournment Motion moved by the Hon. Ranjith MaddumaBandara regarding the dangerous situation prevailingespecially in the border villages in the Eastern Province.

As everybody knows, since this Government came intopower, there have been about 500 civillians killed from allthree communities - Tamils, Sinhalese and Muslims - bydifferent segments: by the forces, by the LTTE and byKarunas group. Today, the news is that the LTTE is preparingthe civilians in case of an emergency or the war breaks out.People feel that there is an undeclared war at present.Everybody feels that the war is going on though there is nopromulgation or proclamation by either the Government orthe LTTE. As the Hon. Madduma Bandara stated, the peoplein the border villages live in fear. They do not sleep in theirhuts; they do not go to their paddy fields and the people inthe Eastern Province are not in a position to cultivate theirpaddy fields. They are not in a position to take their animalsout to attend to their livelihoods and the ordinary fishermencannot go out to sea for fishing. The ordinary businessmenwho do day-to-day trading on their bicycles or carts cannotmove about. This is the situation that is prevailing.

Last week, the buses that went from Kalmunai towardsColombo were stopped at Mahaoya. The whole night theyhad to be there because there was firing at some placebetween Mangalagama and Mahaoya. Now there isinspection and after 6 o clock, the buses cannot pass thatplace. There are many checkpoints now. The elderly people,women and children have to get down from the vehicles atevery checkpoint and undergo severe checking. The goodstransported are under checking.

The peace that was prevalent in the last four years isgoing away from us. The Government has said that it willtake necessary action to provide security for these people.We hear that civilians are being provided with arms tosafeguard certain villages, but these facilities are not givento each and every village. That is why the Hon. MaddumaBandara requested the same facility for the border villagesin Monaragala. The Government has to provide more andmore security by providing mobile services, by keeping thepeople informed and there should be an on-the-spotcommunication system in the border villages. They are thepeople who get affected first, not the people in the cities. Isee that people from my district, Kalmunai, rich people,educated people and people who can afford to buy a propertyin Colombo or in other cities like Kandy, Kurunegala,Thihariya or even further down in Kalutara, are buyingproperties because they expect that something wouldhappen. They think that they cannot live in those areas;they cannot educate their children; they cannot have theirlivelihood and they cannot cultivate their paddy fields. So,now they have one foot in Colombo and the other in theirnative place. This is what is happening.

Therefore, while seconding and endorsing the Motionmoved by the Hon. Ranjith Madduma Bandara, I want theHon. Deputy Minister to take necessary action to giveconfidence to especially the people who live in the bordervillages in Pottuvil, Irakkamam, the Central Camp in theAmpara District, Valaichenai, Oddamavadi and the numberof border villages in the Trincomalee District to live withoutfear and any discrimination.

I wind up, seconding the Adjournment Motion movedby the Hon. Ranjith Madduma Bandara.

Thank you.
