(+ )(The Presiding Member) . .

( )(The Hon. Nadarajah Raviraj)Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member. While the TamilNational Alliance Welcomes this attempt taken by theGovernment to control the use of tobacco and alchol in orderto safeguard the younger generation. I would like to remindthis House first, especially my JVP Friends, if you want tosafeguard the younger generation, the first and the primething that we have to do is to find a lasting solution to theethnic problem for which you are the stumbling block. I wouldlike to remind that first.

While agreeing with the concept of controlling and makingsome regulatory bodies to control the use of tobacco andalcohol, we have to think about the tobacco cultivators. TheHon. Deputy Minister, Rohana Kumara Dissanayake - He isfrom Matale - forgot to mention that there are tobaccocultivators in Jaffna far out in the island. What are they goingto do? Where are they to go? My Hon. Frined made certainallegations, metioning the names of some big business menin this country which is very bad. They are also part andparcel of this system. They are also contributing to thenational income of the country, The Tobacco Company hasbeen functioning in this country for more than 50 years andit is giving so much of employment to our people. Tobaccocultivators are poor farmers. For whom are they fighting for?They are also being looked after by this industry.

In the mean time, we have to be careful about the negativeresults of this. But the Hon. Minister is not present here. Thisis the plight of this country. When we are going to makecertain suggestions and move amendments, the Hon. Ministerwho has presented this legislation is not present here.I am now making references only to his Chair. This is verybad.

If you take Clause 2, you will see that we are going to forma National Authority. Who are going to be the members of it?All of them are appointees of the Minister. It is anotherorganization where appointments are made similar to whatwe are doing when making appointments to commissionsand authorities to give jobs for retired government servantsor to our friends. This is what we are doing. According toClause 3 of this Bill, that Authority is going to be a totallygovernment controlled body. Where is the fair representation?There is no representation given to tobacco cultivators,farmers. And also there is no representation given to tobaccocompanies. Whether we like it or not, they are contributing alarge sum of their earnings to the national income of thiscountry. Whether we like it or not it is a fact. If you are goingto from an Authority, you must give representation to allstakeholders concerned.

Even the tourism industry is going to be affected by thislaw. There is no provision made in clause 3 of the Bill for theHon. Minister of Tourism to appoint his representative.Anyway, he is not present here. How can you rely on thiskind of Authority which is going to make provisions to havethe toabacco and alcohol industry regulated? We totally agreewith the concerms of the people who are engaged in thisindustry. My Friend from the JVP said he only had one glass.He says that there are claymore attacks and that the LTTE iskilling people. The Government is dropping bombs. SeveralTamil children were killed. Where are you Mister? You mustsee both sides. Do not have your opinions based only on oneside of the picture. We are against all kinds of killngs and weonly want a good country for our future generation. We totallyagree with you.

We must curtail this. Now small children are using tobacco.Even the school children are getting addicted to alcohol. Wehave to stop that. There is no second word about it. But wehave to do so without criticizing companies, withoutcriticizing individuals, without forgetting the real facts, andwithout forgetting our tobacco cultivating farmers.

Therefore, I humbly suggest, I am only suggesting to thebenches becuase the Hon. Minister is not here. Our DeputyMinister is here. I think, at least he will take note of it. Sir,Clause 3 should be amended in order to accommodaterepresentatives from the tobacco cultivators, tobaccoindustrialists and the Ministry of Tourism because it greatlyconcerns tourism. This is going to curtail the system. ThereforeCluase 3 should be amended accordingly by givingadditional representations to these sectors.

21392140

[ ]I would also like to say this. This National Authority,although we call it a National Authority, will not have anyrepresentatives from the Tamil people or the Tamil speakingpeople. That we can say for sure. This is the plight of thiscountry. There will be no ethnic balance.

I will now come to Clause 40. I think, Counsel have madetheir submissions in the Supreme Court and the SupremeCourt has recommended this. There are amendments in respectof defining public places.

The original Bill says, enclosed area. It should be enclosedpublic place. There will be a lot of difficulties in maintainglaw and order. I know this will be exploited. If somebodywants to put a boutique owner into trouble he can just walkinto the boutique and somke a cigarette and the poor ownerof the shop will be dealt with. This is what is going to happen.

Hon. Minister, we are unable to control the mosquitomenace in this country. We are unable to dispose garbageproperly in this country. We should think about all thesethings. The mosquito menace is a big problem in this country.We are unable to control that. What we are going to do byintroducing this kind of strict laws is that we are going togive authority to the police and the vindictive people toharass innocent shop owners, innocent boutique owners. Sotherefore, Clause 40 has to be amended.

I think this also has been agreed to in the Supreme Court.There are sometimes, vicarious liabilities attaching to theowners of a shop. Now if somebody commits an offence in arestaurant, the company director or the managing partnerwho is not aware of this can be taken before Court. Therefore,to Clause 40 (5) you have to it insert the following : I thinkhas also been agreed to in the Supreme Court.

Clause 40 (5) Where any person in charged withcontravening the provisions of Subsections (1) and (2) suchperson shall not be deemed to be guilty of such offence if heproves that he had taken all reasonable steps to ensure thatno person somkes in any such enclosed public place.

Hon. Presiding Member, these provisions really have tobe incorporated and thereby, we can balance this. When weare bringing in a law to this country, we should think of allthe stakeholders who are involved in that industry. Forinstance, take the smoking of tobacco. Of course there arepeople who smoke. There are farmers who cultivate tobacco.I am from the Jaffna District. Many of our farmers are involvedin this cultivation, like the Hon. Minister said happens inMatale area. Even down South and in Dambulla area wehave seen thousands of acres of tobacco cultivation. Theyhave to be looked after.

At the same time, there is a big countribution by theseproducts to our national income of course they may bemaking more profits. Anybody will like to make profits.

Hon. Members, it is natural. It is a human tendency. Whateverthe industry may be people will want to make profits. But inthe meantime, we must encourage them to do some socialservice.

After the tsunami disaster, I can remember very well thetobacco company contributed very much in areas downSouth, even in our areas-our Member from the EasternProvince is here-and in the Tirukovil District, they havebuilt houses. Not only there, even down South, in Galle,Matara and all these places, their contribution is evident.Therefore, while having some provisions to curtail or tocontrol ourselves, we should not forget about these things.They are also part and parcel of this system. They are alsopart and parcel of this country.

I am a teetotaller, Sir. I do not smoke. I do not drink.Recently we went to China. Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Theroalso came. You can see, China being a communist country [Interruption.] Please allow me to speak. Professor, you canreply. If you go to China, it is a communist country yet youcan see there is freedom with some restrictions. Of course,smoking in public

. . ( )( () [ - )(The Hon. (Prof.) W. A. Wiswa Warnapala Minister ofParliamentary Affairs)

.Rose

( )(The Hon. Nadarajah Iraviraj)Why ? I think you have not seen that. For anything, thereis freedom. There is no restriction. In Shanghai City it ismore than in the New York City. But of course there areregulations. I welcome that in public places. When we givepermission or issue licences, we should tell them that theymust allocate a separate area for smokers. That is what ishappening all over the world. In some international airportsthere are smoking areas with proper ventilation. I think, thisBill provides for that. It is good because those days even ina heavily packed bus, our people were smoking. But now ithas been stopped gradually. Even in the theatres, earlier,only the board was there in red but people smoked while theboard lights were on. But now the people are vigilant. Theysay, Do not smoke. Likewise, we must have regulations.There is no second word about it. But should not hateanybody. Hon. Minister, we know how much of millions thebig companies have contributed for Presidential Electionsand for General Elections to the political parties. We knowthat. If you want the facts and figures, I can give them. Butnot for us-the Tamil National Alliance. So this is the crux ofthe matter.

2006 0521412142

Sir, it is a pity that the Hon. Minister is not here but I thinkmy good Friend, the Hon. Deputy Minister will take note ofthe amendments that we have suggested. In Clause 3 of theBill where the representations are concerned, you giverepresentations to various parties. A member to representcultivators can be put in there. The Tourism Ministersrepresentative should also be there.

You say that this is a National Authority and you mustkeep the work national in mind. When you call itNational, it includes Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims.Please keep this in mind when you appoint representativesto this Authority. Do not take this as a Government Authority.It should be national, independent authority to guide thisnation to curtail this problem. It has to be in the nationalinterest and not in the interests of the Government. That isthe reason why each and every party represented inParliament is going to support this Bill. This is in the nationalinterest. This is in the interest of our nation.

Sir, Clause 36(1) is about public notices. Of course whenyou say it a public notice, if it is a mere notice it will not bethat effective on the people who caonsume. It has to havesome kind of description. So the publications ofadvertisenments have to be controlled. As it is prescribed inClause 36, it can be only published or advertised within theauthorized areas where smoking is allowed, where smokingis done. It has to be in that way. There are amendments toClause 40 that had been agreed upon by the parties in theSupreme Court and we were told that they will beincorporated. I think that is very important because that isthe penal section. Hon. Minister, you yourself is a lawyer.You know very well now these things are sometimesimplemented, how the law enforcing authorities take the lawinto their hands and exploit the situation. If anybody has apersonal animosity these provisions can be made use of topenalize a person. About this we have to be very careful.Therefore, the amendment to Clause 40 Sub sections is veryimportant. We have to see that a person is given properinstructions or proper description about these regulationsotherwise he should not be charged, should not be penalized.That is the reason why the incorporation of that Subsectionto Clause 40 is very important. Likewise, I think, Clause40(1) prescribes the public places that are to be covered.Therefore, once again on behalf of the Tamil National Alliance,we welcome this move by the Government to bring about aregulation to curtail the use of tobacco and alcohol especiallyto safeguard the future generations, the children from thisdanger. In the meantime, it has to be a balanced one. Ourrequest is, especially, in respect of Clause 3. When you aregoing to have the representatives appointed to this Authoritysee that it is national and also the stakeholders such ascultivators of tobacco, even the tobacco company,industrialists and especially the Minister of Tourism also beincorporated so that this

( )(The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva)I will ensure that all the ethnic groups are represented inthe Authority. I will give you that assurance, but with regardto giving a place to the tobacco industrialists and cultivators,that will be against our policy.

( )(The Hon. Nadarajah Iraviraj)Thank you. At least, the Hon. Minister has agreed to havethis as a National Authority. We welcome that. Hon. Minister,our problem is this.

(+ )(The Presiding Member) , .

( )(The Hon. Nadarajah Iraviraj)

I am finishing. A lot of our farmers are involved incultivating tobacco in the Jaffna Penisula.

( )(The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva)Even in my own district.

( )(The Hon. Nadarajah Iraviraj)

Yes. I know. Therefore, the amendments suggested by theSupreme Court also have to be incorporated so that we willhave a well balanced piece of legislation to safeguard ourfuture generations. Thank you.

( )(The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva)The concerns of the Supreme Court has been incorporatedin the amendments certified by the Attorney-General.

I am happy Sir, that this Bill has been brought to Parliamentand that this Bill will be approved by Parliament.

It can be said that there is a religious dimenstion to thisissue. It can also be said that there is a question of healthhazards and that in the interest of the health of the people ofthe country, it is necessary to introduce legislation in regardto both tobacco and alcohol which a lot of people consume,because they like to consume them and I think that is afundamental right. If a person wants to smoke he is entitledto smoke. If a person wants to drink he is entitled to drink. Iused to smoke at one point of time. I have now stopped. ButI still enjoy a drink in limitation, of course, because that is afundamental right, Sir. It is not something which can be takenaway by law but the most important thing is that a personwho smokes or a person who drinks must exercise that rightin such a way without trespassing on or infringing upon therights of others. That is what is important. You can do whatyou like. But you must do it in such a way that you do notinfringe upon the rights of others. As long as that is achievable,I think it is a good thing to bring about legislation to ensurethat that objective is achieved. Of course in achieving thisobjective we must also ensure, we must also be sure that wedo not promote illegal activity. There are persons who makecigarettes without a licence to make cigarettes. There arepersons who manufacture liquor without a licence tomanufacture liquor. Those products are very harmful. Theycause much more harm to the consumer than what ismanufactured legally. So in your anxiety to pass legislationin regard to smoking or in regard to taking alcohol, you mustnot encourage illicit, illegal production because that can bemuch more haumful to the health of the people than what islegally produced.

And the other thing is, persons who legally produce eithersmoking material like cigarettes or cigars or persons whoproduce liquor pay taxes to Government and they contributesubstantially to the revenue of the country. But the personswho manufacture these things illicitly Sir, do not pay any taxwhatever and they are the beneficiaries of all that they earn.

So both from the point of veiw of the countrys revenueand the general health of its people and welfare, it is importantto remember that while we try to curb some of these activitieswe do not do it in such a way that we encourage the personswho do it illegally or illicitiy.

Subject to that Sir, this law is welcome. Of course I findthat the Clause 40 contemplated in the original Bill has beencompletely reformulated and the amendments circulated tothe Members clearly indicate that the Clause 40 had beenreintroduced taking away the original Clause 40 completelyand that this reformulation is completely in conformity withthe view taken by the Surpreme Court. The Supreme Court,in justifying Clause 40 as presently contemplated, has referredto the World Health Organization Framework convention onTobacco Control and similar laws in other countries and theLegal Draftsman has formulated the new Clause 40 on thatbasis.

I am happy that the word kiosk, which was in the originaldraft, has been removed and that kiosk will no longer belooked upon as a public place. In fact, the Supreme Court hasvery clearly said so : the word kiosk does not have a generallyoperative meaning of being a place which is enclosed. In thecircumstances, we are of the view that the inclusion of theword kiosk or any similar place would be unreasonable andwould be in conflict with Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Ithink for these reasons the Hon. Minister has removed theword kiosk from the definition and that is also welcome.After all, Sir a lot of the people who smoke in this country arethe people who buy cigarettes loose from kiosks. Comparedto the sale of cigarettes in packets or cartons, the purchase ofcigarettes loose by the poorer segments of society from kiosksis very much higher. I think, Sir, the man who goes to thekiosk for a cup of tea would like to have s punt after his tea.Therefore, I think the kiosk being excluded is a good thing.

Subject to that, Sir, I would only say that in theimplementation of the law or the enforcement of the law. theGovernment must ensure it is done in such a way thatunnecessary hardships are not imposed upon persons whocarry on trade in either tobacco or alcohol legally, and inkeeping with the laws of the country and particularly thosewho pay revenue to the Government. If it is implemented ina way that is harsh or unreasonable, it will help the illicitproducer, the illegal producer of both cigarettes and liquor.

Thank you, Sir.
