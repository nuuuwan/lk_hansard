Why do you not give the management of these resthouses to them for about 10 years or 20 years? Then theywill develop it. You should consider that. Then they willdevelop them like hotels under strict discipline. I make astrong request to you. I hear that there is a rumour thatcertain companies are trying to take them over. Do not dothat. If those people in charge of the rest houses do notmaintain their responsibility, cancel it. That is a differentmatter. .

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem

Mr. Chairman, within the limited time available to me Iwant to quickly deal with a few issues concerning the severalMinistries, the Votes of which are being debated today.

My good Friend, the former Minister of Finance, the Hon.(Dr.) Sarath Amunugama is in charge of a very vital Ministryand having been a former public servant himself comingfrom the best part of the Civil Service, he can bring to beara lot of reforms in the activities of this Ministry. I am alsovery happy that one of my former secretaries,Mr. Dissanayake is serving him.

I would like to bring to the attention of the Hon. Ministerthe impending reforms pertaining to re-demarcation ofboundaries of the Divisional Secretaries Divisions all overthe country. There was a Commission appointed under theable leadership of another former civil servant, Mr. Andrewde Silva. I must say he and the other members gave manyof us a very good hearing. Sometimes we had troubled themseveral times over to submit our proposals. However, I seethat the implementation of the reforms is very slow. Youknow, Hon. Minister some of the Divisional Secretariatsare so large. There are several problems that occur. We madeseveral proposals. For example, we wanted the SamanthuraiDivision to be bifurcated into two without upsetting theethnic composition of the area, since Samanthurai DSDivision is predominantly a Muslim Division. There aresubstantial numbers of Tamils also living within thatDivision. But for easy administration we felt that it mustbe bifurcated into two. But then, I do not think that we wereable to convince the Commissioners that much. But theyunderstood our side of the argument and they assured usthat they would look into this matter as a matter of urgency.However, our complaint is that several commissions havebeen appointed. The earlier commission that was also headedby another important member of the Civil Service toorecommended several proposals; some of which wereimplemented and some are yet to be implemented. We havea specific problem regarding the boundaries of theIrakkamam Division for which you are quite well aware, avariety of proposals were submitted. But some Ministers

were not in agreement. Therefore, the poor people ofIrakkamam are being penalized since this boundary disputeis still to be properly resolved. I hope the Hon. Ministerwill take some speedy steps to have these issues resolvedas early as possible. I do not want to dwell much on thatsubject since I have several other matters pertaining to theother Ministries that are being debated today.

I would like to move on to the other issue pertaining tothe Hon. Dinesh Gunawardenas Ministry, the Ministry ofUrban Development and Water Supply which also has abearing on the Ministry headed by my late Leaderscharming wife, the Hon.(Mrs.) Ferial Ashraff - the Ministryof Housing and Construction. Hon. Ministers are aware ofthe Tsunami rehabilitation and reconstruction effort in mostof the areas. However much the Ministers are committedto speed up the work, there are a variety of other externalfactors that have delaye progress.

One particular matter of concern, which is of course beinghandled by the Hon. (Mrs.) Farial Ashraff, is the need toreclaim paddy lands and then fill the paddy lands in orderto find accommodation for a large number of affectedpeople within the Kalmunai and Nintavur areas. Here, Ifind that a proper coordinated effort to do the land fillingwill have to take place, since this impinges on the Ministryof Urban Development and Water Supply too. This is anarea prone to frequent flooding. Every monsoon season,frequent flooding is a very serious issue and I am sure theHon. Minister is aware of a detailed report - prepared duringthe period of my late leader the hon. M.H.M. Ashraff, whichwas under the Water Supply and Drainage Board - where aproper study was done.

( () )(The Hon. (Mrs) Ferial Ismal Ashraff)

SLRDC.

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

I am sorry, the SLRDC. I think the SLRDC prepared it. Ithink it was left to the NWSDB to implement it. Thisprogramme should not overlap the land filling activities.Both have to be coordinated properly, so that we do nothave an acute problem later, where haphazard land fillingshould not result in serious water drainage problems andflooding. In fact, in the Merttuvattai area in Marathamune,several private donors have advanced monies and peoplehave been allocated land. There the filling has started. Ofcourse, in the issue pertaining to the Government steppingin to assist in the filling of these and a large cost involvedin the filling of this land, the Hon. (Mrs.) Ashraff had takensome meaningful steps. But then more has to be done inorder to alleviate the sufferings of the people.

One particular instance, which I would like to bring tothe Hon. Ministers attention is the inadequacy of theRs. 500,000 that is being given to build houses. I know itis an issue that we will have to focus upon. Some housesthat have been built in those areas sometimes have costseveral million rupees . But then these poor people are leftwith only Rs. 500,000. Out of that too only Rs. 250,000 isprovided by the Government and the rest of it is from theNGO component. In some areas, particularly, in Nintavur,700 odd houses had to be built, but the NGOs have beenable to assist with only 250 houses. I think it is about 125houses. I do not know the figures, but then, these issueshave to be resolved. I know several NGOs have let us down,partly because of procrastination relating to the coastalzoning problem we had which has now been resolved, butthen several of them have taken flight after having givenpromises. But we have to resolve this problem becausenow we are approaching the second year of the tsunamidestruction. Several thousands of people are stilllanguishing in very squalid conditions, not being ableto rebuild their homes.

There is one particular instance. When we decided onthis component of Rs. 500,000, the cost of buildingmaterials was much less. Now the cost of building materialshas gone up so much that people cannot just build even ahouse with just one room; leave alone putting concrete.In order to qualify for the second instalment you will haveto show progress with the first instalment. People are unableto even complete the concreting of their first slab in orderto get the second instalment of the payment. I hope, theHon. Minister will look into these issues and take somemeaningful steps to redress these grievances.

( )(The Chairman)Hon. Member, your time is up.

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

Hon. Chairman, very quickly I would say a few wordsregarding the Ministry of Resettlement.

This Ministry of Resettlement is tasked with a verydifficult and onerous job of attending to the work of severalthousands of refugees who are living in many parts of thecountry. I would like to ask the Hon. Minister to lookinto some of the outstanding problems. One of which, ofcourse - I am sure he has taken some steps, I should say -relates to the payment of compensation to State officerswho lost properties in the North-East conflict. District-wisethey have given various figures. The number of casesawaiting payment is very large. Almost 5000 people are yetto receive compensation for the displacement that occurred.Only about 351 people have been paid so far. I know the

difficulties in getting monies from the Treasury in order topay this, because donor agencies are not going to give youmoney to pay compensation. We are quite aware of that.But the Hon. Minister must do whatever possible in orderto get more monies to assist these poor Governmentservants who are awaiting payment.

I must also appreciate the establishment of the Office ofthe Director-General, Task Force for Resettlement. Thisis a good move. This has been set up in order to find adurable solution to the displaced people through voluntaryand safe resettlement at the place of origin of the IDPs.Here I believe, the TFR will be involved in relief,rehabilitation and resettlement, reintegration, restoration,recovery and reconstruction activities of damagedinfrastructure and public utilities and basic civil amenities.I would like to ask the Hon. Minister to tell us in his reply,if possible, something about what is being done aboutthe rehabilitation of the important Ahaththimurippu Tankon which monies were allocated. Because of the currentsituation, this important and massive irrigation projectwhich will assist the displaced people from the Musali areait will be difficult for them to consider resettling in thoseareas. I know, in the current situation where hostilitieshave not been -

( )(The Chairman) , .

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)Yes, I am winding up. Since this issue needs to be lookedat, I hope, proper plans are being put in place so thatwhen the situation returns to normal this matter could beattended to as a mater of priority.

With those words, I will conclude my speech. Thank you.

+ENGLISH TEXT OF THE SPEECH

Mr. Chairman, my ministry, the Ministry of Urban Developmentand Water Supply, plays a major role in the development efforts ofthe Government. The strategy of my Ministry, in line with theMahinda Chintana of His Excellency the President , is to ensurea balanced economic growth in all provinces by exploring urbandevelopment potential and ensuring access to safe drinking waterand adequate sanitation facilities for all throught out the country.

My Ministry is focusing on three major areas in the urbandevelopment sector i.e. Urban Infrastructure Development, UrbanEnvironment and Resource Management, and Urban Governance.In the water sector, our thrust for the next decade will be oninvesting in infrastructure development for larger pipe-borne waterschemes, small and medium schemes to cover secondary townsand promoting rain -water harvesting - not only in rural areas butalso in urban areas.

Mr. Chairman, let me elaborate furthr on the urban sector. Thecountry is experiencing speedy growth in urban population on parwith the global urbansisation trend, and more than half of thecountrys population will be living in cities by the year 2015. Thepace and magnitude of this urbanization means that policies andstrategies should be in place to ensure sustainable urbandevelopment, to minimize poverty in cities and improve access ofthe urban poor to basic facilities.

The Ministry has taken the initiative in launching a number ofprojects ranging from developing national level growth centres tosecondary township development. The policy initiatives that wehave taken in the recent past will create a new working frameworkto address important issues in the urban sector. Let me mentionsome of the key initiatives we have taken.

*Amendment of the regulations on waste disposal of theUrban Development Act, with the objective of restrictingthe waste generated by polythene materials from within anypremises or in any public places.

*To ensure sustainable urban development, the establishmenof a fund for urban low-income housing development wasinitiated through the amendment of the regulations of UrbanDevelopment Act, to levy a fee on property developers as agraded percentage not exceeding 5 per cent of the totaldevelopment cost exceeding Rs. 10 million.

*Promoting the mobilization of domestic private sector capitaland sustainable financing for slum upgrading, low incomehousing, urban and other shelter related infrastructure.

*The establishment of an Urban Settlement DevelopmentAuthority is a major initiative the ministry has taken and theDraft Bill is been prapared at the Department of LegalDraughtsman. The Cabinet of Ministers had granted theapproval for the initiative.

The National Physical Structure Plan has been presented to theinter-ministerial co-ordination committee and will be ratified andthen submitted to His Excellency the President in December thisyear. Similarly, Regional Plans for Provinces will be preparedbased on the National Structure Plan in the next year.

In infrastructure development, which is a major part of A Ten-year-Horizon Development Framework for 2006-2016 my Ministry will taken the lead role in developing new national -Level growth centres, as an alternative to the Colombo conurbation,which acts as a population magnet. These will be developed, to

absorb the rapidly increasing urban population in a sustainablemanner using their natural and human resources and will functionas the service centres for the rural communities in their hinterland.

Greater Dambulla will serve as the commercial hub of the areaand a new industrial park will contribute to greater employmentgeneration. New connections to the railway network at Kurunegalaand Habarana will make Dambulla a transit centre for Agri-cargoand other products. Dambulla has immense potential to promotetourism, primarily eco-tourism and leisure activities attracting up-market tourists and protecting important archaeological sites willbe a part of the development plan envisaged for the next ten years.

Greater Hambantota development is anticipated to fulfil thesocial-economic and spatial needs of the area and act as thecatalyst for a major economic development in the Southernregion. The proposed Hambantota seaport and international airportwould be diving forces to attract larger industrial and commercialsectors to the region. Development of urban infrastructure in GreaterHambantota is an urgent need and projects are being prioritisedand the development plan for the new Township of Hambantotahas been prepared. Construction of a state of the Art InternationalConvention Centre has already commenced with the assistance ofthe Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea and construction of anadministrative complex with all facilities has commenced toaccommodate the government Institutions that are located in distantand scattered locations around the city.

The Development plan for the Trincomalee Metro Urban areaenvisages the population expanding up to 600,000 by 2030. Theplan contains major projects such as a 500 Megawatt coal powerplant at Sampur, a four-lane ring road and a special ExportPromotion Zone and others.

Horana being the intermediate township in the Kalutara Districtacts as the interchange for the commuters and will take on additionalimportance due to being a hub on the southern expressway. On thebasis of its tourism and Information Technology potential, a planhas been prepared for the Horana Township development.

Secondary town centres are also being developed, notablyDiyagama - Homagama, which will be in close proximity to thejunction of the Southern Expressway and the Colombo Outer CirularRoad. Here a modern sports village complex, an IT campus and atechno park are planned. Other Secondary town centres are plannedat Angunukolapelassa, Kiribathgoda and Maharagama,

At the same time, the development of Colombo will continue,using new and sustainable strategies, the aim being to make thecity a vibrant commercial and service centre. The PanchikawatteTriangle Development Project area, incorporating the ElpinstonTheatre and Tower Hall, has been identified by UDA fordevelopment in a planned manner to satisfy the future needs of theCommercial Capital. Activities aims at relocating the slum andshanty dwellers in the area has already commenced.

The national capital, Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte will be furtherimproved by the shifting of public sector administrative institutionshere. The Government has embarked on a larger infrastructuredevelopment programme facilitating the shifting of administrativefuctions in Sri Jayewardenapura Kotte. We have already begunstage II of Sethsiripaya to accommodate government institutions,and the design process for a new sewerage network for th SriJayawardenepura has already Commenced. A light rail transit systemwell as Bus Rapid Transit system will be introduced as innovativesolutions to ease the growing traffic need due to the increasing offloating populaton.

The present Government has come forward to address the shelterissues of the poor and under -privileged communities under theJana Sevana Programme of the Mahinda Chintana and pledgedto construct 65,000 housing units for those who are at presentliving in underserved settlements in the city of Colombo.

2006 2412931294

My ministry has been entrusted with this task under PelinMandira Housing Programme. The main objective of this housingprogramme is to fulfil the aspirations of the dwellers in theunderserved settlements by provisioning of housing with allinfrastructure facilities, liveable environment and joining theminto main stream of the society through re-housing.

The amendment to the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation andDevelopment Corporation Act has enabled my Ministry to takeaction against illegal squatting on canal banks, illegal filling oflow-lying areas and the dumping of waste on drainage lines andcanals.

The canal system is subject to uncontrolled waste disposal andwaste water discharges from industries as well as domestic residents.The Colombo Canal Water Quality Improvement Project aims,

*to improve water quality in canals and water environmentby clearing of canal banks and clearing of canals;

*to improve the health conditions and environmentalconditions of residents living along the canal banks byimproving the water quality of the canal.

*to enhance the flood control system by increasing the flooddrainage capacity in Colombo, thereby the risk of flooding;and

*to increase use of the canal system for recreational purposesand waterfront developmennt.

With the acquisition of machinery under Greater Colombo FloodControl and Environment Improvement Project, the dredging of inlandwaterways has been improved. This machinery and the technical skillsrequired for dredging has been made available by my Ministry to theLocal Authorities, especially those recently affected by severe floodingin the Western Province.

One of the major policies initiated by the Ministry for year 2006 isthe extraction of off-shore sea sand. With the banning by the Governmentof uncontrolled sand mining in most of the major rivers, there is asevere shortage in the supply of river sand particularly to theconstruction industry.

Mr. Chairman, I would now like to describe the programme of thewater sector of my Ministry.

Access to safe water and adequate sanitation facilities is a universalneed as well as a basic human right. It is also an essential element ofhuman development, poverty alleviation and primary health care. TheGovernments objective is to provide access to clean drinking waterand adequate sanitation for all citizens by the year 2025. The WaterSupply and Sanitation Sector has shown progressive growth during thelast three decades and the Government of Sri Lanka intends to continuein investing in this sector mainly in infrastructure development, andfinancing for operation and maintenance of most of the water andsanitation schemes in the country. The National Water Supply andDrainage Board, Community Water Supply and Sanitation Project(CWSSP), Gemi Diyawara Programme and the Rain Water HarvestingSecretariat are working on an integrated framework under the guidanceof the Ministry to achieve the national goals.

The Rural Sanitation Policy was prepared by the Rural Water Supplyand Sanitation Division in consultation with relevant National Levelsector stakeholders including the Health Department, Provincial Counciland the National Water Supply and Drainage Board. The policy wasprepared based on the principles of the 2003 Dhaka Declaration onSanitation. This policy promotes the Sanitation Revolving FundMechanism as a sustainable solution to sanitation problems in SriLanka. It also emphasises the need for greater involvement of LocalAuthorities, better co-ordination among stakeholders and theparticipation of women and children in sanitation programmes. The

policy was presented to a national workshop attended by variousstakeholders including Government agencies, donor agencies,practitioners and local and international NGOs,and finally submittedto the Cabinet for approval.

The National Rainwater Harvesting Policy has already been approvedby the Cabinet. As this policy is urban based, a need has arisen for aseparate policy focusing the rural sector-for which the RWSS Divisionhas already completed a comprehensive study with the assistance ofthe New Zealand Government.

The National Water Supply & Drainage Board has been the leadagency in the water supply sector, taking responsibility for the planning,design, and construction of virtually all urban water supply schemescovering all urban areas, town centres and small cities. These schemeswill not only provide better water and sanitation facilities to the peopleof Sri Lanka, but also contribute to generating direct and indirectemployment and building up an efficient human resource base withknowledge and skills. They will aid in industrial development,alleviation of rural poverty and upgrading of socio-economic conditionsof beneficiaries through the provision of access to improved health,sanitation facilities and other basic amenities.

In addition, the projects being implemented in tsunami - affectedcoastal areas will rehabilitate and reconstruct water supply and seweragefacilities, thereby improving the livelihood of those affected. Projectcomponents are not limited to restoration of damaged utilities, butinclude water supply and sanitation facilities to resettlement areas,improvement of service levels in affected areas and extensions to newdevelopment areas in the vicinity.

The Community Water Supply and Sanitation Project is intended toimprove the quality of life and reduce poverty of the rural and estatecommunities by improving health condition through the provision ofsafe drinking water, adequate sanitation facilities and hygiene practices.Increasing access to safe drinking water, and basic sanitation, promotingenvironmental conservation, along with hygiene education, and reducingwater-borne diseases in selected Grama Niladhari Divisions.

The project implementation framework is formulated on a people -centered, demand responsive, community - planned and constructed,community managed and owned approach. One of its key achievementsis the establishment of Sanitation Revolving Fund in all selected GramaNiladhari Divisions.

Achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is achallenging taks. Although the national performance of Sri Lanka isplaced well on the path of achieving MDGs, the findings of the 2002Survey by the Department of Census and Statistics showed widediscrepancies in poverty between districts. There are differences in theperformance of several areas of MDG concerns betwen provinces,between districts, between cities and even between settlements in thesame city as the majority of the national MDG programmes are structuredin a macro-framework along sectoral priorities and have their owndelivery systems.

My Ministry has commenced the preparation of the local MDGAction Plans aiming at reducing poverty and narrowing the gaps betweennational and local indicators of MDG performance.

This Government has a vision to overcome the problems facing thepeople, especially the low-income people, and an expectation ofuplifting their living conditions which has been elaborated upon in theMahinda Chintana. Fulfilling this concept is our ultimate objectiveand my Ministry if fully committed to achieving the national goalsplaying its part positively.

They built reservoirs to store waterduring the rainy period and constructed diversion canals torelease the stored water to agricultural lands. The State shoulddevelop water resources to the maximum possible extent byconstructing as many reservoirs as possible, includingtransbasin diversion canals.

Madam, the water distribution systems should be designedand constructed to ensure the reuse of water several times.That is the only sustainable and appropriate method toachieve prosperity. I wish to emphasize that water is the onlyother major natural resource of this country apart from thesuman resource. It should be conserved and hence, neitherits management nor ownership should be allowed to go intothe hands of foreigners at all, that is multinational companies,for obvious reasons.

Up to now, only about 25 per cent of the countrys waterresources has been regulated and at least another 25 per centcould be regulated. We should not depend on lendingagencies to develop our water resources as our country haslost billions of rupees by carrying out irrigation worksincluding economically non-profitable rehabilitation worksand water works using loans received from the lendingagencies.

Madam, the construction of all the waterworks should beundertaken by the Department of Irrigation on the same modelas that of Mau Ara project and the Veheragala Project. In thisprocess, hundreds of millions of rupees will be paid tothousands of local people employed on the project whileusing all departemental machinery to start woth. In thismatter, works can be done in double quick time and at verylow costs while local people get paid thousands of millionsof rupees as daily wages.

Our National Plan is to construct half a dozen dams acrossthe Kelani Ganga for domestic and industrial waterrequirements of the Colombo metropolitan area, which couldbe met easily without unnecessary expenditure. Flooding ofthe Kalu Ganga, the Gin Ganga and the Nilwala Ganga iscommon. The divesting flood waters could be stored inreservoirs and released when necessary for the benefit of thepeople to generate power, for domestic use, industrial needs,to irrigate agricultural lands et cetera.

Under the Mahinda Chinthana Programme, eight majorprojects have been identified for implementation andcompletion within the next five years. An allocation of Rs.4,000 million has been requested for the year 2007 from theBudget to implement all these projects.

Madam, under the above programme, the Ministry ofIrrigation is the implementing agency for the followingmultipurpose irrigation projects; the Menik Ganga DiversionProject or the Veheragala Reservoir Project, the Deduru OysReservoir Project, the Kekiri Obada Reservoir Project andthe Rambukkan Oya Reservoir Project.

After Right Honourable D. S. Senanayake constructed theGal Oya Project, for 50 years no development projects wereundertaken in that area. King Saddhatissa started theconstruction of the Rambukkan Oya Tank, but could notcomplete it. Thereafter, several attempts to construct thesame have also failed.

After I was appointed the Minister of Irrigation, on theadvice of His Excellency the President, I got the opportunityto serve the people of Binthenne Pattu area, who have beensuffering for many years without proper drinking water andwater for irrigation. I am happy to say that the constructionwork of this project will commence in January 2007.

The other projects are the Heda Oya Reservoir Project, theYan Oya Reservoir Project, the Uma Oya Reservoir Project,the Urawa Diversion Project, the Lower Uva Medium/minorIrrigation Project in the Monaragala District, the Small-Scaleinfrastructure Rehabilitation and Upgrading Project -SIRUP-and the Gal Oya Navodaya Project in the Ampara District.

Gal Oya Navodaya is a proposal for the Eastern Region,which is aimed at opening up of a new chapter in the Gal OYavalley. There are unused lands and water resources available.The Agricultural productivity from existing systems can beenhanced. Opportunities are available for post-harvestactivity and enterprise development. At the same time, thereare places where infrastructure facilities are needed or shouldbe upgraded to serve the population and for employmentgeneration.

The total cost estimated for the Gal Oya NavodayaProject is Rs. 1,260 million and I am happy to say that wewill be starting this project in 2007 and completing in threeyears time. The Ministry has programmed to implement themajor projects, using local human resources and experts. Thefunds used for these projects will benefit the people living inthose areas where the project will be implemented. The labourforce will be recruited from areas where the projects will becarried out.

An Engineering Studies Organization will be establishedunder the Ministry to study the available reports, preparefeasibility reports, design projects et cetera wothoutentrusting the jobs to foreign consultants at high costs.

Madam, I take this opportunity to thank His Excellencythe President Mahinda Rajapaksa for selecting me as theMinister of Irrigation, through which I could serve the peopleof my country. I also thank the Hon. Minister MaithripalaSirisena for the kind assistance given to me whenever

14031404

necessary. I also take this opportunity to thank the Secretatyof my Ministry, Vidyajothi A. D. S. Gunawardana, an engineer,for the tireless and hard work put in round the clock to makethese projects workable, the Director - General of Irrigation,all the Heads of Departments, their staff and my personalstaff, who give me all the assistance to make these projects asuccess.

Sir, I am thankful to the Hon. Minister for appointingan Advisory Committee to look after the industry. I amalso thankful to him for allocating about Rs. 900 millionand Rs. 600 million for re-cultivation of coconut and forfertilizer next year.

Hon. Minister, you have apportioned Rs. 250 millionfor the Coconut Development Authority and I hope youwill make some allocation for relief wages for thoseworking in the DC industry because they are beingneglected most of the time.

Today, the price of a litre of coconut oil is Rs. 120 andthe price of a kilogram of desiccated coconut is Rs. 98.Actually, it is impossible for the desiccated coconutindustry to sustain. Therefore, I suggest at the level of theexecutive committee, to which you have appointed mealso -

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)

Bismillahir Rahmanir RaheemI am glad to speak a few words in this Committee Stagediscussion. I would like to bring to your attention certainprojects that are still pending in Ampara District, especiallyin Samanthurai Electorate.

The Hon. Anver Ismail is here. I told him that I wouldbring to his notice certain proposals that should be givenurgent attention. One is regarding Karavahupattu. As youknow the NEIAP conducted a study and they came our witha proposal to develop the Karavahupattu Paddy field andthey promised to allocate Rs. 190 million. That was duringthe UNF Government. We had a number of discussions ofthis and I do not know what really has happened to this.That proposal has just been stopped; it is being held-up.That is one thing.

Hon. Anver Ismail, as you know, there is stagnant water inthe Chavalakade area. You have to fine some location forthat stagnant water to pass into the sea. This is the mainproblem for the people in Central Camp, Chavalakade andother colonies. They are unable to make use of that Kittankibridge. As you know this bridge was constructed during theregime of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, I think in 1978, when

[ . ]my father-in-law was a Member of Parliament. But after thatno development has taken place. As you know, this bridge isvery low. As a result water dose not flow through. Salvinia isblocking it. There has been sedimentation. Sand on the otherside has to be removed so that the water will pass into the sea.As you know. an extent of about 10,000acres to 15,000 acresof land is just idlying. This is one of the reasons why wewanted Kalmunai to be developed as a new city in that re-gion. So being the Minister of Irrigation, you have a verygood chance to develop your area. it is your electorate.

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)

Hon. Minister, do you want to say something? But I wasgiven only a limited time. Okay. Go ahead.

. . ( )(The Hon. M. I. Anwar Ismail)

Chavalakade area does not come under the purview of theMinistry of Irrigation. That belongs to the RDA.

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)

I know. Whatever it is, there are two Cabinet Minister andtwo Deputy Minister in the District. You have to get together.During the UNF Government the NECORD was prepared tospend a large sum of money towards this District. We took upthe matter with the Hon. Athaullah when he was a Minister.He promised to spend the balance money. It has to be anintegrated programme. It is not only Highways, it is not onlyRDA-

. . ( )(The Hon. M. I. Anwar Ismail)

We have already discussed this matter with the Ministry ofNation Building and Development. They are willing to spend-

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)

That is what I am trying to say. You have to raise thisbridge and then you have to construct the road so that thewater will flow through. And the entire 10,000 to 15,000acres of land, which is under water right throughout now, caneither be developed as a new city or used for cultivationpurposes. There are two Cabinet Ministers and two DeputyMinisters representing this district, but we do not see anyprogress taking place. That is one thing.

2006 2414171418

then there was a submission made by the Hon. Hasen Aliregarding the problems faced by the farmers. Hon. AnverIsmail, you are a responsible Minister. I know that you aredoing a lot of things. I would like to bring to the notice of theCabinet Ministers here the question of purchase of paddy. Inour areas - especially in the Kalumai Electorate, SamanthuraiElectorate, Pottuvil Electorate, we did not see paddy beingpurchased. Money was allocated very late for them to purchasepaddy and there was no storage facility. Stores were filled tocapacity with paddy. So they could not by any more paddy,Sir. That is one thing.

The second matter is regarding the irregularities in-

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa) Hon. Ministers, I humbly request you to sittogether and discuss these matters. In fact, we will help you. Afterall the Government and the UNP have come to someunderstanding. We are there to help you. We are there to proposeas to what should be done. But, we do not see that being theMinisters of the Government you sit together.

,( )(The Deputy Chairman)

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)

Even after the tsunami, there was a very pathetic situation inthe Ampara District. You, being the Ministers of the Governmentdid not sit together to discuss as to what should be done.

,( )(The Deputy Chairman) + +

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)

You do not invite us to sit together and discuss as to whatshould be done for the development of the area and the districtas a whole and you do not make use of the contribution wecan make for the betterment of the country.

Thank you, very much.
