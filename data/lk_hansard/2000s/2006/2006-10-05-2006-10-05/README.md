-to the shock of many people in the area. This is not the firsttime this is happening in the country. The law and order situationhas deteriorated to an extent where the Police uniform is no longerrespected or thought of as a symbol of State authority. Hundreds ofpeople in Wadduwa, out of sheer fright, got into their homes, lockedthem while the shooting was going on. One sergeant was shot deadand several of the armed robbers as well. Similar incidents are tak-ing place in many parts of the country out of the conflict areas.

.

In the areas in and around Parliament, , , , , , .

.

The people live in fright. Those with expensive jeepsand cars are now afraid of their lives because armed gang-sters have broken into their homes and have robbed themof their vehicles, their valuables and so forth. The other daya group of schoolboys .............. have gang-raped a girl andare said to have been suspended from school.

.

, _

We are continuing to receive complaints from the Tamilsin the Colombo District that abduction particularly ofbusiness people has by no means stopped.

. . .

Many people who were abducted from Colombo, whosenames are known to the police, are missing except for oneperson from Kotahena who has been released at Kotahenaitself last week on the understanding the ransom originallydemanded (Rs. 5 million) has been reduced to Rs. 2.5 million.The police say that they arrested the man who came to collectthe ransom money and that he is now in custody. At the sametime there is speculation that there is much pressure fromhigher-ups to release him.

. .

It is even said that the Police officers who arrested theseculprits are now in the process of being transferred.

. , .

I hope that it is not so because it will badly affect themorale and discipline of the good police officers. Much canbe found out from the arrested man.

I think, the new trend that has emerged in the Oppositiontowards establishing a greater consensus for our countrysnational wellbeing is something that we must appreciate.This development should be a continuing one; continuingfor the sake of addressing the burning issues of our country.Hence, at the outset, I want to compliment the standpoint ofthe Opposition in addressing issues not only in that sence,but also in a deep sense to avoid the divide that has prevailedin this House over so many decades, in not being able tocome together, to look at what has to be looked at in thecorrect perspective and in its correct context. My learnedfriend also went on to say how we must emerge and positionourselves at the peace talks. It is fortunate that we are debatingthe Emergency today with signs of peace talks getting started.Our efforts in bringing about a negotiated settlement to theNorth-East conflict were hampered with the emergence andthe sudden disruptive measures that were adopted by theLTTE in the month of April when we were gearing for thesecond found of talks Geneva. On the 08th of April, whattriggered off this development in Trincomalee, led to theunfortunate incidents of the 12th of April and since then wehave been caught up in a situation, where due to and onlydue to the visionary efforts of the President and that of themilitary forces in the country we have been able to onceagain establish the route for peace.

2006 0523332334

We must compliment the efforts and endorse thecontribution made by the armed forces led by the respectivecommanders. The Navy Commander, Vice Admiral WasanthaKarannagoda, the Army Commander, Lieutenant GeneralSarath Fonseka, the Air Force Commander, Air MarshalRoshan Goonetileke and also the Defence Secretary Mr.Gotabaya Rajapaksa have brought about a new responsibilitytowards maintaining the security of our people and that ofour land. We have addressed this issue in a very transparentmanner. His excellency the President took every effort toconstantly keep the Opposition and all political parties inthe country informed of the progress and the developmentsassociated at times in terms of limited engagements by themilitary, to react to the situations that were propelled by theLTTE. We brought about that direction because of a greatersharing to information and the power and discussions thatwere initiated by His Excellency the President. I say it is thatconviction that has led the Opposition today to look at theagenda that we have set for the country in a verycomplimentary manner and I am glad that they have endorsedthe direction that we are pursuing today.

We are now coming to the second phase of our developmentassociated with the political vision and the political need ofthe country, to bring about the warring factions to thenegotiating table and talk on peace so that our people couldhave the security in their own homeland and also be a part ofthe process of development in the future. In that context,how we are going to position ourselves at the peace talks willgive direction to the country and to the internationalcommunity, to lift the type of the reputation it carried in thepast and put behind us as a matter of history and take thecountry forward in a very calculated and cohesive directionthat would include everybody, all peoples of our communitiesin Sri Lanka. It is with that vision we address and also bringsolutions to the issues. We quite concede that there areinherent problems in any country and Sri Lanka is noexception. We see the need for us to lift it up. The law andorder of the country gets hampered because in one part of thecountry we have an involvement this is different from that ofthe rest of the country as the circumstances damand that ofthe Government.

It is with that objective that even today all our Ambassadorsto foreign countries were requested to attend a meeting inParliament premises to enable them to understand theinteraction and the type of discussion needed to raise theprofile of Sri Lanka and its position in their respective foreignlocations, what the Hon. John Amaratunga went on to explain.A change in the image of Sri Lanka is the need of the hour.We have made every effort to bring about a lasting quality toSri Lankas profile for it to be articulated and highlighted inworld fora. With that objective, we are today looking at not alimited agenda, but an agenda that can take Sri Lanka forwardthrough the 21st Century as a country that will havedevelopment for the people, economic advancement andsecurity.

We must endorse the contribution that has been madeduring the difficult period we experienced from April toOctober by countries like India. In fact, I would like to pay acompliment to the Indian High Commissioner in Sri Lanka,Her Excellency (Mrs.) Nirupama Rao, who would be leavingfor another location to take up her ambassadorial duties. Wemust wish her well and also appreciate the commitment thatwas displayed.

The Opposition today is looking at the Governmentsagenda for the country in the same way as we are. There is acohesive and colle ctive process getting established so thatwe could always strengthen the type of system that is neededfor us to address some of these burning issues in the country.With that, we can address the issue of how we could engagein bringing that type of development to the Northern and theEastern Provinces of our country because that is where thedevelopment is needed. We showed that immediately aftertha takeover of Sampur from the LTTE hands. We went inthere; our forces took control of the area; the civilianadministration moved in and the refugees started returning.What was promised to the refugees when they came to Kantalaiabout relocation within a limited period has beenaccomplished by the Government and that is a credit to thosewho are handling the exercise of taking these people back totheir original locations. The contribution that was made bythe Muslim Members of Parliament and the Ministers, weshould endorse here. If not for their tireless efforts, thepopulation that was subjected to displacement could nothave returned to their homes in such a short period. Withthat, today we have shown to the country that when we go toa location and say something to the people, we always deliveron out promises by accomplishing them. From that angle,Sampur was a clear case in point. The docks in the navaldockyard on the other side of Trincomalee were gettingaffected as it is within easy reach of fire from Sampur. Todaywe have established the Trincomalee Port once aganin as aport that can be commercially used without any terroristthreat. This is a major development and an achievement thatwe were able to accomplish. All these years, we did not lookat the reality of establishing peace and making it lastingbecause we did not engage ourselves in the correct direction.A special appreciation of the efforts of the navy in relation tothe securing of the port of Trincomalee has to be made here.We also have to look at the contribution that has now comefrom the American Government and the CanadianGovernment. Today, the American Ambassador to Sri Lanka,Mr. Blake, has taken it upon him self not only to bring ourrelations in terms of trade to a higher pitch, but also to lookat specific areas in terms of investment generation becausethey believe in Sri Lankas potential to harness its resourcesand become part of the developed world. Sri Lankas potentialis getting recognized well today because President MahindaRajapaksa went on to explain to the world at large how weare positioning Sri Lanka. We never went by the dictates ofothers. We took it upon ourselves to decide what is right forthe country as a mandate was given at the PresidentialElection to the newly elected President of this country. It is

23352336

[ ]with that mandate the people expected the country to havesecurity, lasting peace and the political issues to be resolvedby bringing about a greater consensus amongst all politicalparties. What wass set out is now being implemented.

I am glad at the response that has come from the UnitedNational Party and going by the speech that was made by theHon. John Amaratunga, it was a total endorsement of what isproposed. What we have set for the country is today beingcomplimented and endorsed by the Opposition. If not for ourinitiative in this regard, if we went on to practise variousother thoughts and isms that were believed in in the past andin contemporary times, we would not have been able to bringabout this greater consensus among the Southern forces.Today, the Southern forces are coming together as articulatedby all sections of the Opposition, which gives new hope forus to address the peace process in a meaningful manner. Onlywhen the Southern forces are together we could expect thatpeace will be realized, negotiations will be meaningful andalso the results will be beneficial to the country. In the absenceof that, if we go to Geneva or to any other location, howcould we present at the negotiating table what could bedelivered and what could be the solution? Both issuesdiscussed today at this Debate will be a clear message toLTTE to look at is seriously and also with honesty andcommitment. If they mean peace, we are there for peace andtowards that, we have brought about a greater consensusamong all forces that matter to realize the objective of pracebeing established in the country.

So, today we are opening a new chapter. The most salientfeature in this Debate, as I see it, has emerged this morningfrom the first speech that was made. That itself gives a clearmessage to the world at large, not only to the LTTE, thatPresident Mahinda Rajapaksa is today addressing the issuethat is confronting the country and that concerns theinternational community. It shows that the strength of allsections of the country are joining hands with theGovernment.

We are also mindful of why our learned Members of theTNA are seated on the Floor of this House. This should nothappen. In fact, this is a matter that received our attention.Even yesterday, I must say, the President was concerned aboutthat. I wonder whether the delegation from the TNA has beenable to reach the President with the issues that confrontthem; in terms of why this protest is being continued. Theseare matters we could always address. It is a pitiful sign thatour own members of parliament have to protest in this mannerwhen we, as a Government, could address all these issues in areasonable way. We have shown that in the past. We arecontinuing to establish that and we have proved that to theworld. There are issues that confront in an engagement likethat we have in the North and the East.

Today the STF has been once again appreciated by thepeople and they have been getting commendation for thesecurity they provided in the Eastern Province of our country

and thereby, the type of public perception that had beenthere of them has started changing in spite of the heavysecurity measures that have been adopted to protect the cityof Colombo. Queues and queues are forming because peoplehave to go through certain barriers and get themselveschecked in order to enter the City. But, I am confident thatthe public would co-operate more and I am happy to note thepublic response in that regard. No one complains of beingchecked today because checking is meant for their own good,their security and their safety. For that, we must complimentthe police.

The outgoing IGP, Mr. Chandra Fernando, took enormoustrouble. I must make a special mention of him. When Iarrived at the Trincomalee Town at 7 oclock in the eveningon the 12th of April in the midst of the massacre that tookplace at the marketplace there, it was the effors of Mr. ChandraFernando that persuaded all communities to donate blood,help the injured, take the dead to the hospital and try toresurrect, wherever possible, the civilian life back to normal.These were efforts to which some of our officers contributedto bring about the situation that prevails today; there is agreater consensus, greater development, a greaterunderstanding of the human needs. These are factors we mustendorse. I must wish the outgoing IGP, Mr. Chandra Fernando,the very best in his life in the future. I must also congradulatethe new IGP who is yet to take office, Mr. Victor Perera, andwish him luck in the responsibilities that he would have toshoulder to take the Police force, the Police Department to anew height in terms of its responsibility to the country.We need the underworld to be wiped out from Sri Lanka andthis world. We cannot have people carrying arms around; Weneed law and order or prevail; we need the people tounderstand their responsibilities; we want the civilians toimprove their quality of life; we want the civilianadministration to become conscious of its duties to the countryand the Public Service to respond to the needs of the peopleand the development agenda of the country. It is with theseobjectives that today we are addressing-

It is with those objectives that we are addressing the needsof the country. With that, we have started a new trend whichwould lead to many developments and we can approach thepeace process and engage in peace talks with greaterconfidence and greater strength, which would bring about alasting peace in Sri Lanka and to its people.

Thank you.

Thank you, Madam Presiding Chairperson. I am happy tofollow the Hon. Minister, the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama,who has made a very conciliatory and constructive speechin the sense that he has endeavoured to outline the futurethat everyone would hope this country will have: a countrywhere there will be peace, where war will come to an end andwhere the country and its people can really prosper.

Most unfortunately, Madam, I have to make reference towhat has happened, particularly in the course of the recentmilitary operations and in the recent past. I consider it myduty to place on record and to bring to the notice of theHouse and through the House, to the country the immensehumanitarian suffering that has been caused to the Tamilcivilian population as a result of the recent military operationsand as a result of various other events, which I shall brieflyrefer to. It is our submission, Madam, that the militaryoperations by the Sri Lankan Armed Forces in the North-Eastregion have been conducted with callous disregard for thesafety and security of Tamil civilian life and property. It isestimated that the number of Tamil-speaking civilians killedthus far by such military operations exceeds 1000 and thenumber of Tamil-speaking civilians grievously injured,mostly maimed, exceeds 4000 since December 2005. Civilianproperty comprising of houses, vehicles, livestock,plantations and personal belongings of the people have beentotally destroyed in areas where there have been attacks bythe Sri Lankan Armed Forces. The Sri Lankan Governmentand its armed forces have executed a policy which due to itsimmense destruction deters civilians from returning to theirhabitation. I am told, Madam, that after the militaryoperations came to a close and particularly in the Mutur Eastarea which also comprises the village of Sampur - I havebeen to Sampur as a little child. There is a famous templethere, the Pathirakali Ammbal Temple with which I have beenvery closely associated. I will not talk about Sampur at lengthtoday. But at some time in the House, in the near future, I willhave to talk at length about Sampur - after the people, theTamil civilians vacated, not one of them has returned to thatarea and not one of them is likely to return in the near future,there has been looting, stripping of doors and windows frombuildings, stripping of roofing material and even livestockhave been loaded into lorries and taken away. That is theposition that prevails in those areas. Thus far, Madam, around250,000 persons have been internally displaced and over15,000 Tamils have fled across the seas to South India as aresult of the conflict. This is in addition to the nearly 800,000people who continue to be displaced both internally andabroad as a result of the earlier phases of the war.

Quite apart from the military operations, Madam, there havebeen extra-judicial killings of a large number of people. Therehave been disappearances and abductions which is acontinuing phenomenon. Persons come in white vans and onmotorcycles without number plates to abduct, to assassinate,to shoot and kill Tamil people and these vehicles comethrough armed forces checkpoints and return through thosecheckpoints without any hindrance whatever. That is thesituation that prevails in our area, Madam, and it is not myintention to deal with all these incidents in detail. But I wantto refer specifically to certain instances and raise certainquestions with the Government. But briefly I state that a TamilParliamentarian, an ex-Tamil Parliamentarian, Tamil membersof the clergy, leading Tamil businessmen, Tamil journalists,Tamils civil society activists, Tamil aid workers, Tamilstudents, Tamil civilians seeking refuge in places of worshipand other Tamil civilians have been targeted and killed bythe armed forces indiscriminately. Despite representationsmade by us to the Government at the highest level, there hasnot been a single instance of the perpetrators being broughtbefore the law. I would like the Government in its answer atthe end of this Debate to state whether there is a single instanceof any one of the assailants, any one of the perpetrators havingbeen brought before the law.

This, Madam, is the strongest indication of theGovernments complicity in the said several extra - judicialkillings. The Governments armed forces have acted with theutmost impunity and with the fullest awareness that they havea free licence from the Government to act as they wish againstthe Tamils. Such deliberate killings of Tamil civilians is acontinuing phenomenon. Yesterday, on the 4th of Octoberaround 5 oclock between Mainkamam village and Dehiwattevillage in Trincomalee two people had been shot and killed,one man by the name of Amirthalingam Pradeepan aged 25years and another man called Mailvaganam Arulambalamaged 49 years. Last evening two persons had been shot andkilled. Two boys working at the Saraswathi Theatre inTrincomalee Town were picked up and taken away alongwith one other person. Nobody knows wht has happened tothem. On 16th September at Anbuwalipuram in Trincomaleearound 2 oclock in the afternoon people who went in a whitevan shot and killed three persons in a house - Divakaran aged20, Pratheepan aged 23 and a baby two and a half years bythe name of Divakaran Ranjana was also killed. Two otherpersons were injured. These things happen and no action istaken by the Government. Persons coming in white vans dowhat they like and go past army checkpoints. Nothinghappens.

It was very well known some time ago that on the 2nd ofJunuary, five students were shot and killed in TrincomaleeTown. One of them was an engineering student at theMoratuwa University and the other four students had donetheir GCE Advanced Level Examination and were awaitingadmission to the university. They were shot and killed in theTrincomalee Town. This was a matter that we raised with thePresident. We personally raised the matter with the President.

In fact the President in the course of his discussion with us,not merely assured us that action will be taken but he eventold us who the assailants were. Subsequently, the IGPcontacted me. The DIG who was entrused with theinvestigations contacted me and told me that promptinvestigations were being conducted and that the personswill be arrested and brought before the law. I want to knowfrom the Government, from someone who will reply on behalfof the Government, what has happened in regard to this crime,a deliberate crime where five students were killed inTrincomalee town. Our information is that the file has beenclosed and that is a closed chapter now.

Then Madam Chairperson, there was this shockingassassination of seventeen aid workers, thirteen males andfour females, on the 4th of August at Mutur in Trincomalee. Iam placing on record, and I would request that you kindlydirect that this be included* in the Hansard, the letter sent byme to President Mahinda Rajapaksa in regard to thesekillings. This is a matter, Madam Chairperson, which hasraised intenational outrage. The world is shocked thatseventeen people could have been shot and killed in thismanner.

These are the media reports, Madam, that appeared recentlyin regard to this matter. I think I should read them out to theHouse. I quote from The Hindu newspaper of 5th September,2006 :

Mr. Rajpaksa has said his Government will form an intermationalindependent commission to probe abductions, disappearnces and extra-judicial killings.

Asked by the Government-run newspaper Daily News on theexecution style killing of 17 workers of the French NGO in Mutur onAugust 4, he said the commission would consist of internationallyreputed judges, human reights activists and civil society representatives.

I would like to know, Madam, whether the commission hasbeen appointed. The President said this on the 5th ofSeptember and now we are on the 5th of October, one monthlater. I would like someone on behalf of the Government tostate to this House and the country at large whether thiscommission comprising of international personalities hasbeen appointed and if so, what is happening ?

( )(The Hon. Mano Ganeshan)

Now he says that he will have only observers. His standhas come down now. He says that he will have only observers.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

This is what the correspondent of The Hindu writes onthe 8th of September, in fact a few days after this report.I quote :

Queries on the circumstances under which 17 national workers ofa French NGO were killed in August are met with silence. Authoritiesare unwilling to speak on the subject, which has raised internationalalarm.

Why are you anwilling to speak ? What are you trying tohide ? Yesterday, Madam, there was a media report that theSecretary-General of the International Commission of Juristshas expressed disappointment at the refusal of the Sri LankanGovernment to have an international observer at the freshinquest to be conducted in regard to some of the bodies ofthe persons killed in Mutur. The International Commissionof Jurists wants to send and observer to be present at theinquest but, the Government says, No. You cannot come.Why ? Why on earth are you saying that they cannot come ?What are you trying to hide ? Are you concerned that if theInternational Commission of Jurists sends an independentobserver here, the truth will come to light ? Is that the reason? Please answer our questions. Do not be dumb ; do not bedeaf. Please answer our questions. Young Tamils have beenbrutally murdered. We want an answer.

Madam, this is the position of Tamil life in this country.This is the state we have come to. These are matters, Madam,which cannot forever be swept under the carpet. TheGovernment is violating the Ceasefire Agreement absolutelyindiscriminately. The present Sri Lankan Government, whileverbally stating that it abides by the Ceasefire Agreement,has in reality flagrantly violated the Ceasefire Agreement.The intensive earial bombing, heavy artillery firing andrepeated mortar shelling from both land and sea into Tamilcivilian populated areas in the North-East is a blatant, adeliberate violation of the Ceasefire Agreement. The actionsof the Sri Lankan Government, Madam, are consistent withthe hard-line positions enunciated during the PresidentialElection campaign and the policies of the alliance partnersof the Government - the JVP and the JHU. The position oftentaken by the Sri Lankan Government is that its actions arepurely defensive and not offensive. It is merely an effort tojustify its aggression.

The Governments unwillingness or inability to complywith the commitment made in Geneva in February is anothercause for the collapse of the Ceasefire Agreement. It is a matterin regard to which the international community, the EuropeanUnion, the Co-Chairs and the American Government havevery clearly commented that the Government has not kept itscommitment made in Geneva in February this year. What isthe Governments position, Madam, in regard to thesematters ?

2006 0523412342

Before I proceed with some of the other matters, I want tomention certain things that come to my memory suddenly.We must not forget what happened to the Chemmani matter.When we think of these 17 aid workers, what happened toChemmani ? There was much publicity that internationalpersons were coming here and there was going to be anexhumation of the bodies at Chemmani. Chemmani is dead.Those people were killed quite some time ago. About 400 to500 Tamils were slaughtered, and buried in that Chemmaniarea. The monthers wanted the whole matter investigatedinto. There was much publicity about Govermentsendeavours to find out the truth. But now that whole episodehas been forgotten about. What happened to the massacre atBindunuwewa ? At Bindunuwewa persons in your custodywere slaughtered. In this connection some were charged incourt, some of them were even convicted. But theinvestigations were so hopelessly conducted, so badlyconducted, that on appeal even the convicted people wereacquitted. In this country Sir, when Tamils are murdered, eitherinvestigations are not conducted and the chapter is closed orif investigations are conducated they are conducted in such amanner as to enable the culprits to escape. Sir, that is the wayin this Buddhist country investigitons are conducted. That isprobably Sir, the understanding of the people in this countryabout the teachings of Lord Buddha. I do not say for a momentSir, that the LTTE has not violated the Ceasefire Agreement.That is not my position. The LTTE also has violated theCeasefire Agreement. But your violations of the CeassefireAgreement as per the submissions that I have already madeare having a very, very serious impact, a very, very adverseimpact on the lives of Tamil civilian population about whomyou are least concerned, and that is my complaint.

The international NGOs, Sir, are being prevented fromworking in our areas. Today, only the ICRC and the UNagencies are able to go and work in the Tamil areas, otherscannot go. They have been kept out. There is an effort toisolate the international community. The Government thinksthat if these international NGOs go and work in the Tamilareas providing relief to the affected civilian people, theywill be well looked after. The Government does not want thatto happen. The Government wants the Tamil people to sufferdeprivation, to suffer hardships. I will give you the reasonsfor that as we go along. The Government wants to diminishthe involement of the international community in the North-East in regard to affected Tamil civilians and the Governmentwants to ensure that the international community is withdrawnfrom Sri lanka. There are parties in Parliament in alliancewith the Government who demand that the work of theinternational community, of the international NGOs shouldcome to an end and that they must be sent away. They wantthis done because they do not want the international agenciesto work in the North-Eastern part of the country, in the areaswhere Tamil people have been affectd and give the Tamilpeople the necessary humanitarian relief.

What is the plight of the Tamil civilian pepople, Sir ? Inmany areas we have no shelter. There is inadequate food,there is inadequate medicine, there is inadequate fuel. In the

Vakarai and Kathiraveli area, that is the Northern most part ofthe Batticaloa district, there are over 60,000 refugees, largelyfrom Trincomalee and some from Batticaloa. They are livingunder trees I am told. Tents are not allowed by the governmentarmed forces. The buildin material that are urgently requiredare not allowed. I am told that the ICRC and the UNHCR arein possession of sufficient tents and they want to take thetents and give them to the people in these areas. But they arenot allowed. They cannot take the tents. The rains are goingto come. They have already come. They get worse in themonths of November and December. Before that these peoplemust get their tents. They must have some shelter. I call uponthe Government to ensure that the people of Vakarai andKanthiraveli are given tents by the UNHCR and the ICRC, sothat at least before the rains come the pople will have tentsunder which they will have some shelter.

Sir, the Trimcomalee area has been a sepcial target. Peoplefrom Trincomalee have gone to Batticaloa, Ampara, andVanni. Out of the people who have fled to India, the largestnumbers are from Trincomalee. Over 11,000 families whowere displaced from Trincomalee are living in Batticaloaalone. They are being accommodated largely in Vakarai,Valaichenai and in the other parts of the Batticaloa District.Our people are being denied of other essentials like soap,buckets and various other requirements that they ask forbecause the NGOs cannot work there.

Some children have died of diarrhoea in the Vakarai arebecause there is no medicine. There is a fear that there can bean epidemic and diseases can spread in some of these refugeecamps. If the NGOs were able to go and work there then thesethings will not happen, but because the NGOs cannot gothere these things cannot be prevented. There is a danger ofan enormous epidemic in some of these camps. There areover 600,000 people living in Jaffna. People have beendisplaced from Thenmarachchi in Jaffna. They wereaccommodated in eleven welfare centres; some inThenmarachchi itself and the others in Karavedi. The IDPsare being given supplies on the basis of the entitlementdetermined in the mid-nineties. What is given to them for amonth is sufficient only for 15 days of for 20 days themaximum. People have inadequate food. In some areas theGovernment is giving food to the IDPs based upon a mid-1990 determination which today is totally inadequate. If thevaluntary NGOs could work in those areas they would lookafter these people, but that is not being allowed.

The Jaffna traders are unable to operate. It is only when theJaffna traders are able to operate, when they are able to buytheir requirements, take them and function in those areas, thethat community will be in a position to get all its requirements.

That cannot happen because the traders are not permittedto buy their things and take them to Jaffna. There is no waythat they can do that. The MPCS by itself Sir, is unable tomeet the demands of these people. The cargo that goes inships is insufficient to alleviate civilian deprivation andsuffering.

23432344

[ . ]I want so say this Sir, with a sense of great seriousness. TheGovernment should stop looking at everything from purelya military dimension disregarding legitimate civilian interests.If you do not do that and if you do not show any concern forlegitimate civilian interests and look at everything from apurely military dimension, you will behave like a tyrant.That is what our people think of you now that you have noconcern for them. I think, much of the suffering of the Tamilpeople today is due to the attitude of the JVP and the JHUwho had opposed to an ISGA, who had opposed to the P-TOMS Agreement. These persons are primarily responsibleand President Mahinda Rajapaksa is listening to these people.These are the reasons for the present situation. If either ofthese mechanisms, the ISGA or the P-TOMS, had been inoperation the present situation would never have developed,I would say Sir, that a situation of conflict and hostilitieswould never have developed in this country if either theISGA or the P-TOMS Agreement had come into being. Butthat could not be done by the former Government. That cannotbe done by the present Government because there is the JVPand there is the JHU you have to listen to.

We saw a procession of people walking yesterday to theNorwegian Embassy saying, No devolution, go back. Whatis this peace process that you are talking about? What is thispeace process that you wanted to have faith in when yourAlliance partners are walking to the Embassy of the facilitatorssaying. Go back, there can be no devolution in this country.

Sir, I have an innermost feeling, Sir, that we are being treatedin a stepmotherly way. We are certainly not being treated inthe same way that the affected Sinhalese people are treated inthis country. How will be treated? None of you can stand upand say in this House that you give the affected Tamil peoplethe same treatment that you give the Sinhalese people. Weare being treated like second calss people, like third classpeople, just like people who do not belong to this country. Inaddition to the much immense human suffering inflicted onour people, this attitude of yours causes us much pain.It compels us to ask the question. Why do you not just leaveus alone and get out of our areas? It will be good both foryou and for us. If you cannot treat us well, if you cannot treatus as equals, get lost. That is all that we can say. It will begood both for you and for us. You must remember that this ill-treatment is on top of 50 years of discrimination, inequalityand injustice. You would not do it. You would not let theNGOs to do it and that is because you have no empathywhatever with the suffering of the Tamil civilian population.This is not a fight against the LTTE. You are deliberatelyharming the Tamil civilian population. That is my position.What is the objective of this exercise of yours of deliberatelyharming the Tamil civilian population? You want to decimatethe Tamil people. You want them to run away from thiscountry. I will talk about Trincomalee some time later, nottoday. You want the people, the Tamil people to run awayfrom Trincomalee. You want no make them socially,economically and culturally weak and backward. You want

to break the will of the Tamil people. you want to break theirresilience and make them politically subordinate. That iswhat you are trying to do, to break the resilience of the Tamilpeople and make them politically subordinate. You cannotmake evey tamil person a Douglas Devananda. Pelase besure of that. We have been bombed into the Stone Age. Ourareas are being totally devastated, destroyed. This is not afight against the LTTE. This is a fight against the Tamilcivilian population because the Tamil civilian populationhas taken a certain political position, having committed to acertain political philosophy, having determined on a certainpolitical policy and you do not want that to succeed. Youwant to break the will of our people. You want to break theirbackbone. You want to break their resilience and you are justsmashing them up. That is what is happening. As I said before,we have been bombed into the Stone Age and the PakistaniGeneral, the President of Pakistan, who did not want hiscountry to be bombed into the Stone Age - there is a bookrecently published, which I think all of you should read - islavishly helping you with men and material to enable the SriLankan State to bomb the Tamil-speaking areas in theNorthern Province and also in the Eastern Province into theStone Age. He does not want peace in this country. ThisPakistani General and his various cohorts who were active inSri Lanka do not want peace in this country. He wants topromote further instability in this country. There will beinstability in the region. Of Course, very unfortunately thisPakistani General does not seem to realize that this is causingimmense harm not merely to the Tamil people but also to theTamil-speaking Muslim people in the Eastern Province. It ishelping the Sri Lankan State to crush the Tamil-speakingpeople including the Tamil-speaking Muslim people anddeprive them of their own resources in their own historicalhabitaion particularly, in the matter of land and water. That isthe real purpose. When I talk about Sampur, when I talk aboutthat area, I will one day show you, demonstrate to you clearly,your deliberate intentions. You will not be able to concealthese objectives for too long. Please do not be cruel by ourpoeple. Send those things to Vakarai and Kathiraveli. Giveour people shelter. Allow the NGOs to go freely and work inour areas. Look after our people and give them their needs.I do no thing a Government that is unjust by innocent civilianpeople only for the reason that they are Tamil people can goon being successful in their efforts for too long.

Before I conclude Sir, I just want to state that the withdrawalof Mr. Jayantha Dhanapala, a much respected Sri Lankan-international civil servant, from the contest for the post ofSecretary-General of the United Nations consequent tohis poor performance in the numerous straw polls thatwere conducted for that election is not an indication ofMr. Jayantha Dhanapalas deficiency in any way. It is aclear indication of the fact that in the opinion of theinternational community, Sri Lanka is in the doghouse.The whole world is watching you. The whole world iswatching you in regard to what you are doing to the Tamilpeople and Mr. Jayantha Dhanapala, that reputed civilservant has been compelled to withdraw from that contest

2006 0523452346

because the world holds you in such utter contempt onaccount of the manner in which you are treating the Tamilcivilian people Please remember this and please try toreform yourselves.

Thank, you, Madam.

( )( [ - , )(The Hon. Dew Gunasekara Minister of Constitutional Affairsand National Integration)Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, first on my behalfand on behalf of the Communist Party, let me congratulateyou on being elected to this high office. I wish you all success.

As only a short time is available at my disposal, I shallmake a brief intervention in English. What was the need forthese Emercency Regulations, Sir ? It is because the nationalsecurity, the state security need them , demand them so longas the current situation exists. It is no longer something newto this House or to the people of this country. Since 1983 wehave more often been under an Emergency.

President Mahinda Rajapaksa was sworn in as President inNovember, 2005. He was not allowed to run his administrationeven for ten days. Terrorism raised its ugly head on 03rdDecember. To be exact, the first bomb explosion was on 03rdDecember. We witnessed its escalation in a horrendous wayand we have repeated those events time and again in thisHouse. Therefore, I do not propose to waste your time.

I expected that the LTTE would need to test the new leaderon the peace front. On the contrary, probably the leadershipof the LTTE wanted to test him on the battle front. They havediscarded the opportunity that was offered by him at talks inGeneva. It was probably the subjective factor that hasmotivated LTTE to strike within ten days. Obviously, hesuffered from acute subjectivism. Had he considered theobjective factors in favour of the peace process he wouldnever have acted in that fashion.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, what are the objectivefactors ? Firstly, the international factor. Whether we like it ornot, this question has now been internationalized up to apoint since 1983. The whole international community waswith the Tamil people, was with the LTTE, as early as 1983.Apparently, the LTTE was obsessed with this situation withthe international support and it was interpreted as a greenlight for the LTTE to act. Though the LTTE was obsessedwith this position as the sole representative of the Tamilpeople, it did not act as the sole representative of the Tamilpeople. I do not want to repeat all what has been stated in thisHouse with regard to the non-LTTE Tamil leaders and thefate that they faced. [Interruption.] They may be traitors inyour eyes, but not to the people of this country.

As a result, the LTTE was deprived - [Interruption] Pleasedo not disturb me. [Interruption] Are you going to allow meto speak or not? Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, theLTTE was deprived of that opportunity.

Secondly, today the international community is no longerwith the LTTE. That is one factor. So is the mindset of theTamil diaspora. My good Friend, Hon. Ponnambalam, notemy words. It is the mindset of the Tamil diaspora today. It wasfully with you, no doubt, as early as in 1983 up to a point butnot today. The mindset of the Tamil dispora is changing sofast. They are changing their position. I do not want to comeout with names. I know personally according to theinformation I too have that the position is being shifted fromEelam to an alternative solution openly and they are workingtowards it. In time to come you will be able to see it.

Thirdly, the Indian factor. The Indian factor remainsunchanged from the time of the withdrawal of the IPKF andfrom the time of the assassination of Mr. Rajiv Gandhi. So isthe sub factor. In the Indian factor there is a sub factor whichis Tamil Nadu. People of the Tamil Nadu are no longer withyou. They are with the Tamil People, I agree. [Interruption.]

The other factor, the fourth factor - [Interruption.] I haveonly a few minutes. Therefore, please allow me to speak. Thefourth factor, the mindset of the South. We are totally opposedto separatism but we are ready for maximum devolution andpower sharing. - [Interruption.] We are going to prove it.[Interruption.] Let us meet in Geneva. Whether you accept itor not we are going to implement it. You may accept it or not,we do not care. We do not care whether LTTE supports it ornot. But we are going to give maximum devolution and powersharing. We are going to solve this problem. [Interruption.]

Fifthly, on this issue the UNP and the SLFP are closer thanever. We know this is a fact of reality and this is a fact ofhistory. Only their intransigent behaviour at certain timesand the prevalent political culture really prevented us to finda lasting solution to this problem. Today, I am so happy thatthe UNP and the LTTE are engaged in a serious discussion.I hope that they will at least come to a position as far as thisquestion is concerned.

2006 0523652366

( )(An Hon. Member)UNP and SLFP.

( [ )(The Hon. Dew Gunasekara)UNP and SLFP.

( )(An Hon. Member)You said UNP and LTTE.

( [ )(The Hon. Dew Gunasekara)I am sorry. But any way you can understand what I mean.We will bring in the LTTE later. That is the purpose. That iswhat we are going to do. If the LTTE has been conscious ofthese factors, I think, it would have by now changed itsstrategy and tactics. Instead, it still remains solidly belligerent,solidly intransigent and continues to assume that role of thesole representative of the Tamil people. But this is not astrange tendency in the context of the absence of politicalpluralism, the denial of the right to dissent, the absence ofdemocracy, the absence of human rights in the North and theEast.I ask you, at this late hour, it is time of the LTTE to considerthat it should abandon separatism and shift to a position ofan alternative solution and openly declare their position.[Interrution.]They have not done it. We will watch whetherthey are sincere. If they are sincere, let them openly say that[Interrution.] No, no we have made it clear [Interrution.]I have got only few minutes. [Interrution.]

Sixthly, there is a growing demand and a growingconsciousness in the South for unity in diversity, politicalpluralism and human rights. A vast majority of our people,85 per cent of the voting population today are lookingforward to a scenario in which a political solution could befound. There may be a 10 per cent or a 15 per cent who maynot agree. That is the very reason why I am happy. I am givingevery possible moral support to the discussion between theSLFP and the UNP because unless and until the UNP and theSLFP come to a consensus, this question can never be solved.

( )(An Hon. Member)What about the JVP and the JHU ?

( [ )(The Hon. Dew Gunasekara)First we will tackle the 85 per cent and then come to theten or fifteen per cent later.

( )(An Hon. Member)

Okay, okay.

( [ )(The Hon. Dew Gunasekara)This is a very important factor. The LTTE ignores, discardsand is not conscious of these objective factors. Therefore,they still continue to be to be intransigent. You always say.Eelam and nothing else. You say; Sole representative ofTamils and nothing else. you say Thimpu principles andnothing else, Arms struggle and nothing else andterrorism and nothing else. Therefore, the LTTE shouldstart functioning as a political party and not as a militaryoutfit. You have only given us to do the political work, butyou are not in a position to do it. I know in all sincerity,much against your conscience you are sitting in the well ofthe House today merely because of the dictations made bythe LTTE-[Interruption.] Please allow me to make my speech.Contradictions are developing in your ranks. You mark mywords today. As much as contradictions are developingamong the extremists in the South, contradictions aredeveloping among the extremists in the North. That isbecause the door is being opened for the major politicalparties and other political parties, who have been fightingfor the last 50 odd years, to come to a position where theywill be able to find a lasting solution to the Tamil nationalquestion.-[Interruption.] We play our role. In spite of thefact that one of our leaders were killed by the LTTE, wenever gave up. We are still fighting for devolution.-[Interruption.] Why not? Do you not know? Our districtleader, you do not know. Hon. Member, you and I jointlyprotested against that when you were with us. Now, youhave forgotten that.

( )( - )(The Hon. Chandrasiri Gajadeera - Minister of Home Affairsand Deputy Minister of Fisheries Housing Development)

Mr. Sathiyanandan.

( [ )(The Hon. Dew Gunasekara)Not Mr. Sathiyanadan.-[Interruption.]

Sir, this is why I say that there are contradictions. Therefore,I reiterate my position that extremism, either in the South orin the North, on either side, always nurtures itself. The historyshows that. If you look back the history, it would show thatthe LTTE had not touched the Southern extremists, but onlythe moderates. They had either killed members of the SLFPor the UNP or others. They do not touch the Southernextremists. Similarly, others also do not touch the extremists

23672368

[ ]inthe North and always the moderate people have been thevictims. That is why, I think, within ten days after HisExcellency Mahinda Rajapaksa was sworn in on 19thNovember 2005 the first bomb exploded.

I was listening to the speech of the Fair Member, the Hon.(Mrs.) Pathmini Sithamparanathan, for whom I have thedeepest respect. She was enumerating all the events and allthe killings. I agree. But, who started it? Who ignited it? Thefirst bomb exploded within ten days after His ExcellecyMahinda Rajapaksa was sworn in. Earlier, the LTTE leadersaid, I am giving Mahinda Rajapaksa, a pragmatic leader,one year. But even ten days were not given by the LTTEleader before the first bomb exploded.-[Interruption.]

Therfore, this process is taking place in our society, bothin the South and in the North - in the Sinhala society,theTamil society and the Muslim society. There is noalternative co-existence.-[Interruption.] However much youmay try to win Eelem or separatism, that will never beachieved. Therefore, you agree to co-exist with us. That isthe advice I am giving you and my former comrade too.-[Interruption.]

( )(Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , .

( [ )(The Hon. Dew Gunasekara)

I am going to wind up. I will make a request to my goodHon. Members. All the 22 Hon. Members of the TNA are myclose Friends. I am repeating my request to you: for heavenssake try to bring some sanity into the LTTE leadership! Letthe LTTE not bring insanity into you and get you to sitdown on this Floor.

Thank you very much.

( )(The Hon. Navin Dissanayake)Mr. Presiding Member, I am very happy to speak a fewwords on this occasion. As you know, the country is facing avery decisive moment right now. We come to Parliament everymonth to extend the state of Emergency because of the so-called national question or you can call it the ethnicquestion - you can call it in so many ways - the LTTEproblem or the biggest political problem that this countryis facing. But, we are here every month to extend the state ofEmergency because of certain factors that are prevalent inour country. As you know, we must look within ourselves tounderstand as to why this problem has arisen.

I like to think that I am still young. I am 37 years old.Right throughout my lifetime this problem has been there inSri Lanka. I have never known an era of peace and stability inmy country. Of course, in the 70s there was peace. But, in the80s, the 90s and right up to now, this problem has been there.We have been witnessing destruction, murder and generalinstability in our country.

2006 0523852386

To understand the crux of this problem, we must understandwhat the late Premier of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, said. Hesaid that in a multi-ethnic society we should never have theword minorities because if you do not treat the minoritypopulation in the correct manner, then there will always beproblems in that society. As you know - I do not want to dwellupon history too much - when the Sinhala Only Policy wasbrought in 1956, there came up Sinhala nationalism; therewas also Tamil nationalism. We must understand that. Likesir Isaac Newton said, for every action, there is a reaction. So,when you had Sinhala nationalism on one side, Tamilnationalism also started to come up. In the 1950s and the1960s, this problem was there. We could have easily solvedthis problem. What the Tamil community wanted was adevolution package so that they could feel part of our country.That did not happen. Our politicians were not wise enoughto look far ahead into the future and understand the verycomplexed problem this was becoming.

In 1976, the TULF passed the Vaddukoddai Resolution.The Vaddukoddai Resolution said that the Tamil communitywanted a separate State. That was there in the TULF agendaand at the 1977 General Election, the TULF went on thebasis that they were going to create a separate State. But, thatdid not happen. As you know, Mr. R. Narayan Swamy, theIndian writer says in his book about Prabhakaran, Inside anElusive Mind, that Prabhakaran shot and killed the Sri LankaFreedom Party Mayor of Jaffna, Alfred Duraiappah, in 1976.That was Prabhakarans first murder. He did it himself. Hetook upon himself to kill the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Mayorof Jaffna and from then onwards, the LTTE has gone towardstheir target, towards their goal of a separate State.

We had the 1983 riots, the so-called Black July, and we,as Sinhalese, have to feel ashamed about it because, in myopinion, it changed the dynamics of the race relations in thiscountry forever. The international sympathy for the LTTEincreased day by day; the funding for the LTTE increasedday by day. Why? Because the Tamil diaspora, the Tamilcommunity which left Sri Lanka, started sending money tothe LTTE every month. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,as they became popular among the international community,started a vicious campaign of slander and disinformationagainst the Sri Lankan Government. Unfortunately, the SriLankan Government was not able to meet this propagandacampaign. The Sri Lankan Government and the Sinhalesepeople were seen as pariahs before the internationalcommunity. This is a fact. We have to understand this.However, as time went by, we found out that the LTTE is nolonger a liberation organization. They assassinated not onlySinhala political leaders, but also Tamil political leaders.Mr. Amirthalingam, Mr. Thambimuttu, Dr. NeelanTiruchelvam, Mr. Vettivelu Yogeswaran, Ms. SarojiniYogeswaran, Mr. Pon Sivapalan, Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamarand Mr. Ketheshwaran Loganathan are just a few of the tamilpolitical leaders who had been assassinated. I like to ask aquestion from the Hon. Members of the TNA. Does a liberationorganization that profess to liberate its own people kill itsown political leaders? Please, answer that question. So, theLTTE is no longer a liberation organization.

Now, the swing has swung definitely in favour of the SriLankan Government. Everybody accepts, everybody knows,everybody states and everybody acts with the understandingthat the LTTE is a terrorist organization. Of course, I have tomention our late Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Lakshmankadirgamar, in this instance. He took decisive steps to exposeto the international community what the LTTE is all about.We have to thank India, which first banned the LTTE in 1992and the United States of America, which banned it in 1995.

Suicide killings, murder of opponents, extortion, drugtrafficking, kidnapping and the assassination of RajivGandhi, all led to the banning of the Liberation Tigers ofTamil Eelam. The LTTE reached its military peak with thecapture of the Elephant Pass in 2000. I like to mention herethat during that time, unfortunately, our army was not wellequipped; we did not have the sufficient manpower;corruption was at its highest level in the forces - I know thispersonally - there was no military direction or leadership andtherefore, our armed forces were not able to meet the LTTEthreat. Therefore, in 2000 and 2001 the LTTE was able tosignificantly gain collateral advantage over the Sri LankanState.

In this scenario, we had the Ceasefire Agreement. TheNorwegians came in and the peace talks started. During thepeace talks what happened? Was the LTTE sincere about thepeace talks? I say very clearly, no. One of the reasons whythe LTTE entered into peace talks was to neutralize the DeepPenetration Unit of the Sri Lanka Army. As you know, theDeep Penetration Unit was able to neutralize Shankar. It justmissed Thamilselvan and the LTTE was hell-bent on makingsure that the Deep Penetration Unit was no longer a factor.

During the Ceasefire Agreement what happened? Themajor important players of the Deep Penetration Unit waspicked one by one and assassinated. As you remember, inColombo there were several killings of the members of theDeep Penetration Unit. Why this ceasefire? Why a ceasefirewhen one party is not sincere about its commitment towardsthat ceasefire? Of course, there was a significant break in theLTTE. As you know, Colonel Karuna who was one of themajor leaders in that organization, who was able to givethem Elephant Pass, broke away from the LTTE. He is nowheading a separate organization in the Eastern Province. Asyou know, the LTTE was able to get a significant amount ofmanpower from the Eastern Province. This no longer ispossible. So I would say this. At the current moment forwhatever reasons this hostility has started again. When thishostility started, everybody thought that the LTTE is goingto make the Sri Lankan Government and the forces suffer.Some of the TNA Members expressed the same view. Theysaid that this war is going to be the war of wars; that the SriLankan army and the Sri Lankan Government will never beable to face the LTTE. What happened?

Sir, I am not speaking here as a politician whose fatherwas killed by the LTTE. I have studied this organization. Ihave gone deep into its history and I know its movements. I

23872388

[ ]have always believed that as long as we have commitment,clean leadership and discipline that the Sri Lankan ArmedForces can take on the LTTE. That is my belief.

Today, I am happy to say that after about 10 to 15 years wehave got a very good defence team in our country. We havegot a young team working together. Once the hostility started,our armed forces - army, air force and navy - have been able toinflict considerable damage on the LTTE. So I would say abig thank you for the armed forces, the leadership of thearmed forces for defending this country, for defending thesovereignty of this country. They have sacrificed a lot andthey will continue to make the necessary sacrifices. AlthoughI am from a different political party. I would also like tomention Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksas name because he hascontributed significantly for the recent victories of our armedforces.

Sir, I am not a fool to say or pretend that this problem canbe solved by military means. We cannot do that. We mustunderstand that. We must understand the complexity of theproblem. Although we are against the LTTE, we must acceptthat the LTTE is a factor in this equation. We must be sincereabout our approach towards talks. we must have peace talks.We must have a southern consensus, not only with the UNPand the SLFP, but also with the JVP. The JVP now is asignificant party in this country. They command about amillion votes. We cannot ignor them. We must understandthe reasons for the JVP and their certain political stances. SoI would say number one, we must understand that a politicalsolution has to be given very soon to the Tamil people tobring them in towards a Sri Lankan State because we cannotgo on fighting like this. I am happy to say that my late father,Mr. Gamini Dissanayake took the first approach towards thispolitical solution through the Indo-Lanka Accord in 1987. Iwould like to mention to the TNA Members here that theyare talking about the Interim Council now. The InterimCouncil was given to the LTTE in 1987. Prabhakaran refusedto accept it. From 1987 till 2003 how many people havedied? What would have happened if he decided to take theInterim Council in 1987 with the Indo-Lanka Accord? Thesituation would have been different today. I also would liketo mention that as a Government , the Sri Lankan Governmenthas certain obligations and duties. We cannot equate theLTTE organization with that of the Sri Lankan Governmentbecause it is a terrorist organization and the duties andobligations of the Government are different and fundamental.The first duty of the Government, I would say, is to protect allcitizens, whether they be Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim or Burgher.The Government has to tap its conscience and ask honestlyand rationally, Is this happening in the North and East?Are they protecting the Muslims and the Tamils in the Northand the East? Is that happening? The harassment of Tamilcivilians must stop. Because, I know that in certain instancesthis has happened. It has happened in the North. It hashappened in the East and it is happening in Colombo whenTamil civilians are being searched. While taking this position

against the LTTE, I would say that we must be able to balancethe other factor of making sure that the innocent Tamilscivilians are protected. When something goes wrong, foxexample, when there is an allegation by certain parties - I amnot notsaying it is correct but it needs investigation into theSTF actions in the East - there must be a mechanism toinvestigate these allegations. We are not saying we needinternational investigators to come or anythisng like that.There must be an independed body that is answarable to thearmed forces, to the Parliament, to the President, to theDegfence Secretary and it must be seen as bona fide and itmut be credible.

Also, I would say that there must be some transparency inthe military decisions that are taken. I would say that in thisinstance, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and United Party mustcome together and give a political solution to the Tamilpeople. We must also bring on board other political partiesthat are represented in Parliament because we cannot go onfighting for ever. These military sucesses are there now buttomorrow when a bomb goes off in Colombo, the publicopinion in Colombo and the elites going to change. I hopeit does not happen but it is possible. As you know, yesterdaythere was a bomb that was detected. All that a terrorist needsis to be luky once.

We must encourage our armed forces. They have done anexcellent job up to now and I hope that we, as responsiblepoliticians can take the decisive steps that are necessary for alasting solution and peace in our motherland.

Thank you.
