It is fortunate that we are debatingthe Emergency today with signs of peace talks getting started.Our efforts in bringing about a negotiated settlement to theNorth-East conflict were hampered with the emergence andthe sudden disruptive measures that were adopted by theLTTE in the month of April when we were gearing for thesecond found of talks Geneva. On the 08th of April, whattriggered off this development in Trincomalee, led to theunfortunate incidents of the 12th of April and since then wehave been caught up in a situation, where due to and onlydue to the visionary efforts of the President and that of themilitary forces in the country we have been able to onceagain establish the route for peace.",

We showed that immediately aftertha takeover of Sampur from the LTTE hands. We went inthere; our forces took control of the area; the civilianadministration moved in and the refugees started returning.What was promised to the refugees when they came to Kantalaiabout relocation within a limited period has beenaccomplished by the Government and that is a credit to thosewho are handling the exercise of taking these people back totheir original locations. The contribution that was made bythe Muslim Members of Parliament and the Ministers, weshould endorse here. If not for their tireless efforts, thepopulation that was subjected to displacement could nothave returned to their homes in such a short period. Withthat, today we have shown to the country that when we go toa location and say something to the people, we always deliveron out promises by accomplishing them. From that angle,Sampur was a clear case in point. The docks in the navaldockyard on the other side of Trincomalee were gettingaffected as it is within easy reach of fire from Sampur. Todaywe have established the Trincomalee Port once aganin as aport that can be commercially used without any terroristthreat. This is a major development and an achievement thatwe were able to accomplish. All these years, we did not lookat the reality of establishing peace and making it lastingbecause we did not engage ourselves in the correct direction.A special appreciation of the efforts of the navy in relation tothe securing of the port of Trincomalee has to be made here.We also have to look at the contribution that has now comefrom the American Government and the CanadianGovernment. Today, the American Ambassador to Sri Lanka,Mr. Blake, has taken it upon him self not only to bring ourrelations in terms of trade to a higher pitch, but also to lookat specific areas in terms of investment generation becausethey believe in Sri Lankas potential to harness its resourcesand become part of the developed world. Sri Lankas potentialis getting recognized well today because President MahindaRajapaksa went on to explain to the world at large how weare positioning Sri Lanka. We never went by the dictates ofothers. We took it upon ourselves to decide what is right forthe country as a mandate was given at the PresidentialElection to the newly elected President of this country. It is",

It is our submission, Madam, that the militaryoperations by the Sri Lankan Armed Forces in the North-Eastregion have been conducted with callous disregard for thesafety and security of Tamil civilian life and property. It isestimated that the number of Tamil-speaking civilians killedthus far by such military operations exceeds 1000 and thenumber of Tamil-speaking civilians grievously injured,mostly maimed, exceeds 4000 since December 2005. Civilianproperty comprising of houses, vehicles, livestock,plantations and personal belongings of the people have beentotally destroyed in areas where there have been attacks bythe Sri Lankan Armed Forces. The Sri Lankan Governmentand its armed forces have executed a policy which due to itsimmense destruction deters civilians from returning to theirhabitation. I am told, Madam, that after the militaryoperations came to a close and particularly in the Mutur Eastarea which also comprises the village of Sampur - I havebeen to Sampur as a little child. There is a famous templethere, the Pathirakali Ammbal Temple with which I have beenvery closely associated. I will not talk about Sampur at lengthtoday. But at some time in the House, in the near future, I willhave to talk at length about Sampur - after the people, theTamil civilians vacated, not one of them has returned to thatarea and not one of them is likely to return in the near future,there has been looting, stripping of doors and windows frombuildings, stripping of roofing material and even livestockhave been loaded into lorries and taken away. That is theposition that prevails in those areas. Thus far, Madam, around250,000 persons have been internally displaced and over15,000 Tamils have fled across the seas to South India as aresult of the conflict. This is in addition to the nearly 800,000people who continue to be displaced both internally andabroad as a result of the earlier phases of the war.",

The Governments armed forces have acted with theutmost impunity and with the fullest awareness that they havea free licence from the Government to act as they wish againstthe Tamils. Such deliberate killings of Tamil civilians is acontinuing phenomenon. Yesterday, on the 4th of Octoberaround 5 oclock between Mainkamam village and Dehiwattevillage in Trincomalee two people had been shot and killed,one man by the name of Amirthalingam Pradeepan aged 25years and another man called Mailvaganam Arulambalamaged 49 years. Last evening two persons had been shot andkilled. Two boys working at the Saraswathi Theatre inTrincomalee Town were picked up and taken away alongwith one other person. Nobody knows wht has happened tothem. On 16th September at Anbuwalipuram in Trincomaleearound 2 oclock in the afternoon people who went in a whitevan shot and killed three persons in a house - Divakaran aged20, Pratheepan aged 23 and a baby two and a half years bythe name of Divakaran Ranjana was also killed. Two otherpersons were injured. These things happen and no action istaken by the Government. Persons coming in white vans dowhat they like and go past army checkpoints. Nothinghappens.",

We are certainly not being treated inthe same way that the affected Sinhalese people are treated inthis country. How will be treated? None of you can stand upand say in this House that you give the affected Tamil peoplethe same treatment that you give the Sinhalese people. Weare being treated like second calss people, like third classpeople, just like people who do not belong to this country. Inaddition to the much immense human suffering inflicted onour people, this attitude of yours causes us much pain.It compels us to ask the question. Why do you not just leaveus alone and get out of our areas? It will be good both foryou and for us. If you cannot treat us well, if you cannot treatus as equals, get lost. That is all that we can say. It will begood both for you and for us. You must remember that this ill-treatment is on top of 50 years of discrimination, inequalityand injustice. You would not do it. You would not let theNGOs to do it and that is because you have no empathywhatever with the suffering of the Tamil civilian population.This is not a fight against the LTTE. You are deliberatelyharming the Tamil civilian population. That is my position.What is the objective of this exercise of yours of deliberatelyharming the Tamil civilian population? You want to decimatethe Tamil people. You want them to run away from thiscountry. I will talk about Trincomalee some time later, nottoday.

We have been bombed into the Stone Age. Ourareas are being totally devastated, destroyed. This is not afight against the LTTE. This is a fight against the Tamilcivilian population because the Tamil civilian populationhas taken a certain political position, having committed to acertain political philosophy, having determined on a certainpolitical policy and you do not want that to succeed. Youwant to break the will of our people. You want to break theirbackbone. You want to break their resilience and you are justsmashing them up. That is what is happening. As I said before,we have been bombed into the Stone Age and the PakistaniGeneral, the President of Pakistan, who did not want hiscountry to be bombed into the Stone Age - there is a bookrecently published, which I think all of you should read - islavishly helping you with men and material to enable the SriLankan State to bomb the Tamil-speaking areas in theNorthern Province and also in the Eastern Province into theStone Age. He does not want peace in this country. ThisPakistani General and his various cohorts who were active inSri Lanka do not want peace in this country. He wants topromote further instability in this country. There will beinstability in the region. Of Course, very unfortunately thisPakistani General does not seem to realize that this is causingimmense harm not merely to the Tamil people but also to theTamil-speaking Muslim people in the Eastern Province. It ishelping the Sri Lankan State to crush the Tamil-speakingpeople including the Tamil-speaking Muslim people anddeprive them of their own resources in their own historicalhabitaion particularly, in the matter of land and water. That isthe real purpose. When I talk about Sampur, when I talk aboutthat area, I will one day show you, demonstrate to you clearly,your deliberate intentions. You will not be able to concealthese objectives for too long. Please do not be cruel by ourpoeple. Send those things to Vakarai and Kathiraveli. Giveour people shelter. Allow the NGOs to go freely and work inour areas. Look after our people and give them their needs.I do no thing a Government that is unjust by innocent civilianpeople only for the reason that they are Tamil people can goon being successful in their efforts for too long.",

But, we are here every month to extend the state ofEmergency because of certain factors that are prevalent inour country. As you know, we must look within ourselves tounderstand as to why this problem has arisen.",

Hesaid that in a multi-ethnic society we should never have theword minorities because if you do not treat the minoritypopulation in the correct manner, then there will always beproblems in that society. As you know - I do not want to dwellupon history too much - when the Sinhala Only Policy wasbrought in 1956, there came up Sinhala nationalism; therewas also Tamil nationalism. We must understand that. Likesir Isaac Newton said, for every action, there is a reaction. So,when you had Sinhala nationalism on one side, Tamilnationalism also started to come up. In the 1950s and the1960s, this problem was there. We could have easily solvedthis problem. What the Tamil community wanted was adevolution package so that they could feel part of our country.That did not happen. Our politicians were not wise enoughto look far ahead into the future and understand the verycomplexed problem this was becoming.",

The international sympathy for the LTTEincreased day by day; the funding for the LTTE increasedday by day. Why? Because the Tamil diaspora, the Tamilcommunity which left Sri Lanka, started sending money tothe LTTE every month. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,as they became popular among the international community,started a vicious campaign of slander and disinformationagainst the Sri Lankan Government. Unfortunately, the SriLankan Government was not able to meet this propagandacampaign. The Sri Lankan Government and the Sinhalesepeople were seen as pariahs before the internationalcommunity. This is a fact. We have to understand this.However, as time went by, we found out that the LTTE is nolonger a liberation organization. They assassinated not onlySinhala political leaders, but also Tamil political leaders.Mr. Amirthalingam, Mr. Thambimuttu, Dr. NeelanTiruchelvam, Mr. Vettivelu Yogeswaran, Ms. SarojiniYogeswaran, Mr. Pon Sivapalan, Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamarand Mr. Ketheshwaran Loganathan are just a few of the tamilpolitical leaders who had been assassinated. I like to ask aquestion from the Hon. Members of the TNA. Does a liberationorganization that profess to liberate its own people kill itsown political leaders? Please, answer that question.

As you know, Colonel Karuna who was one of themajor leaders in that organization, who was able to givethem Elephant Pass, broke away from the LTTE. He is nowheading a separate organization in the Eastern Province. Asyou know, the LTTE was able to get a significant amount ofmanpower from the Eastern Province. This no longer ispossible.

We must be sincereabout our approach towards talks. we must have peace talks.We must have a southern consensus, not only with the UNPand the SLFP, but also with the JVP.

I am happy to say that my late father,Mr. Gamini Dissanayake took the first approach towards thispolitical solution through the Indo-Lanka Accord in 1987. Iwould like to mention to the TNA Members here that theyare talking about the Interim Council now. The InterimCouncil was given to the LTTE in 1987. Prabhakaran refusedto accept it. From 1987 till 2003 how many people havedied? What would have happened if he decided to take theInterim Council in 1987 with the Indo-Lanka Accord? Thesituation would have been different today. I also would liketo mention that as a Government , the Sri Lankan Governmenthas certain obligations and duties. We cannot equate theLTTE organization with that of the Sri Lankan Governmentbecause it is a terrorist organization and the duties andobligations of the Government are different and fundamental.The first duty of the Government, I would say, is to protect allcitizens, whether they be Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim or Burgher.The Government has to tap its conscience and ask honestlyand rationally, Is this happening in the North and East?Are they protecting the Muslims and the Tamils in the Northand the East? Is that happening? The harassment of Tamilcivilians must stop. Because, I know that in certain instancesthis has happened. It has happened in the North.
