REGULATIONS

( )( () - , )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama - Minister of PublicAdministration and Home Affairs)Mr. Speaker, I am presenting five Regulations to this House,namely, Regulations under Registered Stock and SecuritiesOrdinance, Regulations under Local Treasury BillsOrdinance, Regulations under Regulation of InsuranceIndustry Act, No. 43 of 2000, Order under the Debits Tax Act,No. 16 of 2002 and Regulations under Inland Revenue Act,that is Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement between SriLanka and Vietnam. I will now proceed, Sir, to give somedetails of each those Regulations.

Regarding the Regulations under the Registered Stock andSecurities Ordinance, it contains provisions relating to theissue of Scripless Treasury Bonds. These bonds are notrepresented by a certification, but are recorded electronicallyin the central depository maintained in the Central Bank,and title and other rights of the bonds are also recorded in thecentral depositary.

The Regulations titled Scripless Treasury BillsRegulations No. 3 of 2004 enable the recording of securitiesin trust accounts where the owner of the security has onlylegal ownership and beneficial ownership is held by another.

The salient features of these Regulations are

(a) The Central Bank would take notice of a trust only ifit is satisfied, on the basis of documentation providedto it, that a legal trust exists.

(b) Notwithstanding (a) above, the Central Bank maytake notice of a trust expressed, implied or constructiveif the primary objective of the direct participant is toact as a central depository to a stock exchangelicensed under the Securities and ExchangeCommission Act and has been approved by theMinister in consultation with the Securities andExchange Commission and the Central Bank issatisfied on the absis of documentation provided to itthat a trust exists.

(c) Notice of a trust under (a) or (b) will be taken only ifthe Central Bank is satisfied that the establishment ofthe trust is in the interest of developing a sound andefficient secondary market in government securities.

(d) By recognizing an account on the CentralDepository in the Central Bank as a trust account theCentral Bank would not incur any obligations to thebeneficial owner. However, the regulations wouldimpose an obligation on direct participants to utilizepayments received on securities in trust accounts inaccordance with the terms of the trust.

(e) Direct participants are required to segregatesecurities held in trust from their own holdings, andare prohibited from intermingling trust holdings withother holdings.

(f) Changes to trust documents require prior approval ofthe Central Bank.

(g) If necessary, the Central Bank may call forinformation on beneficiaries of a trust.

Then I present the Regulations under the Local TreasuryBills Ordinance. Local Treasury Bills Ordinance containsprovisions relating to the issue of Scripless Treasury Bills.These bills are not represented by a certificate, but are re-corded electronically in a central depository maintained inthe Central Bank, and the title and other rights to the bills arealso recorded in the central depository.

The regulations titled - Scripless Treasury BillsRegulation No. 3 of 2004 - enable the recording of securitiesin trust accounts where the owner of the security has onlylegal ownership and beneficial ownership is held by another.Then I will table* the details of that, Mr. Speaker.

Then we come to the Regulations under the Regulation ofInsurance Industry Act, No. 43 of 2000. We are suggestingchanges to the Regulation of Insurance Industry Act, No. 43of 2000 that came into operation on the 1st of March 2001,to provide for the establishment of the Insurance Board of Sri

Sir, I will *table the details of that.

Then, Mr. Speaker, we have an Order under Section 13 ofthe Debits Tax Act, No. 16 of 2002. The District Secretariatspay tsunami relief payments to tsunami affected personsthrough Samurdhi Banks by opening current accounts inPeoples Bank and Bank of Ceylon on behalf of the SamurdhiAuthority. Debits Tax is charged when withdrawals are madeby the Samurdhi Banks for this purpose and therefore reliefshould be given in this regard.

The provisions related to exemption of Debits Tax appearin Section 13 of the Debits Tax Act, No. 16 of 2002.Accordingly the Order is being made in terms of Subsection13 (1) to exempt from the Debits Tax the debits made fromthe current accounts opened in the above banks have beenprepared and published in the Gazette Extraordinary No.1410/31 of 16.09.2005.

The Order before the House requires approval ofParliament in terms of Subsection 16 (3) of the Debits TaxAct, No. 16 of 2002.

Finally, Sir, we have the Double Taxation Avoidance Agree-ment between Sri Lanka and Vietnam and I am *tabling thatdocument also. Thank you, Sir.

Note for the use of Government Parliamentary Group

Double Taxation Avoidance AgreementSri Lanka - Vietnam

A draft comprehensive Agreement of the avoidance of doubletaxation and prevention of fiscal evasion was initialed at officiallevel on February 13, 2004 in Colombo. This was approved by theCabinet on March 31, 2004 and formally signed at Government levelat Hanoi, Vietnam on October 26, 2005.

Presently, Sri Lanka has concluded thirty - five such Agreements.The main objective for entering into agreements for the avoidanceof double taxation is to, (i) stimulate the flow of capital, technologyand personnel from one country to the other and thereby accelerateeconomic development ; and (ii) remove obstacles incidental toavoidance of double taxation. Foreign investors are generally sebjectedto tax in their home country as well as in the country in which theymake investments. Tax Agreements secure the result that a taxpayeris not required to pay tax twice in respect of the same income, forthe same period.

The present Agreement falls broadly within the pattern of suchother recently concluded Agreements and the tax rate applicable thereunder on dividends, interest and royalties are as follows -

Dividends 10%Interest 10%Royalties 15%

The taxation of profits from the operation of ships in theinternational traffic would continue on the source principle with areduction of the tax charged by 50%. The profits from the operationof aircrafts in the international traffic are exempt from taxation inthe source country. These provisions have been made to encouragethe flow of shipping and airline traffic between Sri Lanka and Vietnam.

The revenue loss on this Agreement entering into force would bemarginal. It could, however, be anticipated that the benefits fromthe provisions for encouraging investments in Sri Lanka and forexpansion of trade and economic ties between Sri Lanka and Vietnamwould be more than the immediate reduction in revenue. Agreementssuch as this go a long way in establishing goodwill,friendship andcloser corporation between countries.

Approval of Parliament is sought for this Agreement.

( )( - , )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama Minister of EnterpriseDevelopment and Investment Promotion)Thank you Madam, Chairperson. I would like to begin myspeech by complimenting the Madam Chairperson who hasreturned to Parliament. Today, we have submitted along withthe other financial regulations the Double TaxationAvoidance Agreement between Sri Lanka and Vietnam. Weneed such agreements for the promotion of investment.Investors must have the liberty to determine the manner inwhich they generate their income and the personnel theyemploy must be free of being taxed in their parent countries.With that in mind, the Government, as being traditionallydone, has proposed the adoption of the Double TaxationAvoidance Agreement between Sri Lanka and Vietnam inorder to avoid the double taxation that would otherwise arisefor investments that are coming into the country from Vietnam.

2006 06809810

The main objective of entering into such agreements is tostimulate the flow of capital. We need capital in this country,because capital is the mechanism through which we cangenerate investments and investments in turn add intoproduction; production in turn provides employment andthe finished proudct finds its way to the markets overseas.The Hon. Bandula Gunawardane gave an analysis of amacroeconomic picture in the financial arena which he hasbeen always speaking of and I have been in the habit oflistening to. Today having listened to him once again andhaving had several such interactions previously in the Housewith him, I did not find anything new.

We are looking at the growth which is fundamental to acountrys economic advancement. This growth is somethingthat we all, whether the UNP is in government, whether thePA is in government or the UPFA is in government, mustconcentrate on. The debt situation that is confronting thecountry is not anything new. We are still servicing the debts,the loans that we generated in order to build our infrastructuresuch as Mahaweli, hydropower, ports, airports, roads, et cetera.We have been raising funds because we have not been able togenerate enough funds within Sri Lanka. That is the shift thatis needed if we are to maintain a sustainable economy thatwould address the issues conforonting the people of thiscountry. If we are to spread development covering all regionsfrom the North to the South, we need greater investment ininfrastructure; we need investment in production; we needinvestment in agriculture; we need investment in plantation;we need investment in the service sector. In almost all areaswe need investment. That is why we are still a developingcountry and is not developed enough. Twenty-five years ormore since the advent of our free economic market policies,we still reamin poor. The average income of our industrialworker still remains at US Dollars 50 or less in most areas.Therefore, with the increasing commodity prices in the world,we will obviously face a dilemma in the end in meeting thepurchase prices when procuring from overseas and making itavailable to the local consumer. That is the gap that we cannotbridge unless we shift the paradigm in terms of localproduction and local basis for greater enhancement of ouragriculture, our industry and our production base overall inthis country.

We have the sea surrounding us, but have we optimizedthe catch from the sea? The answer remains no. If the fishprices are going up, we have to make more fish available tothe consumer. It is the market forces that would ultimately fixthe prices. Out of the catch that comes from the sea, 40 percent goes waste because the post-harvest techniques havenot been developed in this country in aquaculture or inagriculture. Therefore, by the time what a farmer generatesout of his production and what a fisherman generates out ofhis catch reaches the consumer, there is so much of waste.Along the passage through which the consumer gets thisproduct to his household, there is so much of waste and thatwaste and perishability ultimately adds to the cost. So this isthe micro situation that is confronted by everyone of us. Wehave to find the answers to that.

Then once again we have to shift to investment, totechnological transfer and thereby have a better productionbase. Nothing will come out of mere talks. It has to be realizedthat in terms of tangible development of the mechanism andtechniques to the base and development of the process throughwhich it can reach the consumer that all these developmentscan take place. We have such a situation with regard to fuelprices. Our entire fuel procurement is based on imports. Inthe absence of at least a value addition process adequatelytaking place in the country, we will not be able to controlfuel prices, crude oil and refined oil prices going up. We needmore refineries, so that we could at least cushion theexpenditure related to freight and other associated expensesincurred and be in a competitive refined oil market. We lackthat type of a process through which we can bring in amechanism to lower the prices. So, this is the dilemma SriLanka has been facing throughout. From the time ofIndependence, proper attention has not been paid to thekey areas that matter in development. An ultimate productionbase have to be created in terms of the 21st Century marketforces, consumer preferences, consumer needs and that of thecountrys needs. We have to address these issues now andPresident Mahinda Rajapaksa has already set that in motion.The motion is in place now and that is what is important. Itis that confidence that has now generated a response in manyareas and that response is in terms of investment.

I would like to highlight the progress we are now makingin terms of our export sector. If we may look at the figuresof the first six months, we do not have to go for archaicfigures, let us have a contemporary discussion. Hon. RaviKarunanayake is here. I wonder whether he would befollowing my speech. That would be good. Here are somefigures that show that the trend is now being set towardsgetting an enhanced development process for the countryseconomy and thereby generating this production base thatI was talking about at the beginning of my speech. Let uslook at the investment flow along with the facts that areavailable at hand . The investments from January to May2006 - these are the latest figures - if I may say, estimatedforeign investment within the first five months of this yearis Rs.Mn. 24,926 out of the 81 agreements that have beensigned. We have got Rs.Mn.21,634 out of local investmentand a total of Rs.Mn.46,560 is expected out of these 81agreements that have been signed. Now, we will take acomparative analysis of this figure. This shows that themotion set by President Mahinda Rajapaksa for economicadvancement is now in place. In 2005, during the sameperiod, we have signed 45 agreements and generated acumulative foreign investment of Rs.Mn. 17,398.[Interruption.] .Yes, I am giving the figures of the first fivemonths.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)At that time Madam Chandrika Kumaratunga was thePresident. You are looking at the figures of the previousyear.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

Everyone has contributed well. The UNP was there. I wasa Minister in the UNP as well. We will have a discussionwithout getting into these so-called small issues. Let us lookat the big picture. It is not a question of who was in power.What matters is, what the country gets at the end. In thatcontext, we have got 45 agreements signed in the first fivemonths of 2005 and now, we have got 81 agreements withinthe first five months of 2006. It is an increase of 80 percent. Now, in the first five months of 2005, the localinvestment was Rs.Mn.16,075. In that we have got a 39 percent increase. Then the cumulative total of foreign andlocal investment from January to May, 2005 was Rs.Mn.33,473. From January to May, 2006, it was, Rs. Mn.46, 560 - a 39 per cent increase over the same period ofthe previous year.

Then let us look at the exports of the BOI enterpriseswithin the first five months of 2006. It was Rs.Mn. 148,195. In the first five months of the previous year, it wasRs.Mn. 104, 126. Now the increase in exports is 42 percent in the first five months of this year against theprevious year. If you take the figure in US Dollar terms,we have been able to export goods worth US Dollars Mn.1,453 in 2006 against the US Dollars Mn. 1, 047 in thefirst six months of 2005. So there is a 42 per cent increasethat we have registered.

Now let us go into another very valid area - employmentgeneration. Exports, production and employment are thekey areas of development envisaged by His Excellencythe President, Mahinda Rajapaksa. The following figuresare for the first three months of this year. Incrementalemployment generated from BOI projects from January toMarch 2006 in the textile and apparel sector was 7413.In the electronics and electrical goods sector it was 336 andin the manufacturing sector covering beverages, coirproducts, cosmetics, wood products, leather, jewellery,marine, fishing gear et cetera, it was 3196 and thecumulative total was 18902. Now this is against theprevious years figure of 7421. So in that also there is anincrease that we have registered.

Now coming to another vital area in terms of the totalexports, today we have targeted UK as one of our topten export countries. Investment-wise, UK ranks No. 1,with 96 projects in Sri Lanka with a Rs.Mn. 25,895investment. Singapore ranks number 2 with 52 projects,with a cumulative investment of Rs.Mn. 22,610. Theseare projects approved under Section 17 of the BOI Law. Inthis regard by the time we come to the end of this year weexpect to reach, which I have been always emphasizing,our target of generating one billion US Dollars which weare now approaching fast. I say so because we have beenable to net the correct type of investments coming intothe country. Recently we signed the Dialog GSM Telecom

Expansion Project - two projects starting in 2006 comingfrom Dialog GSM alone amounts to US Dollars 150million. This is the trend. The NTPC power plant which isat the final stages of finalization is an investment of USDollars 450 million. This is the type of trend we are nowgenerating fast in terms of substantial investments. Hithertoinvestments came for the apparel sector, electronics,fisheries and other manufacturing areas. But today we havegot very specific new areas of development. BPO services- Business Process Outsourcing sector- are now catching upfast. Presently, we have got 14,000 jobs created within theBPO service sector as well as the IT sector. We need morepeople with English literacy skills in that regard so thatwe can go up to 25,000 by the end of this year. We needmore English literate people through which we can generateavenues of employment in these new sectors that areemerging fast.

The spillover from India in the IT sector and BPOservices in the call centres necessarily will have to fall inwithin the region. Sri Lanka is ideally positioned tocapitalize and take the outflow of the Indian investmentsto Sri Lanka. I can show you some of the trends of Indianinvestments. In 2005, there was a major development inthe Indian flow of investments to Sri Lanka. The FTA hasdone well. We had the FTA figures between India and SriLanka for the year 2005 where the cumulative effect of theIndo-Sri Lanka FTA reached Rs.2.4 billion, the highestbusiness relationship in the region and in the Indian sub-continent with Sri Lanka. In that regard we have a 1 to 4ratio- when four Indian imports come into Sri Lanka, oneSri Lankan export goes into India. That is a very healthydevelopment. We need that strengthening and expansionin order to lift up the production base of Sri Lanka.

It is in that regard that I emphasize the fact that we haveto look at Pakistans FTA. We have just signed it. We mustgive credit to the Minister of Trade and CommerceConsumer Affairs and Marketing Development and Ministerof Highways for having advocated this FTA and now wehave implemented this FTA. We are now catching up fastwith Pakistan and the GSP plus scheme with Europe hasbecome a major source of development for Sri Lankanproduction base. Seven thousand items have gained accessto USA because of duty free access given to Sri Lankanproducts and that is what we value in terms of ourdevelopment in the production base. These are theindicators that will ultimately result in greater amount ofexports, higher amounts of investments -

, we are now looking at the micro picture. The macropicture cannot cater to all these aspects because we havebrought in an ideal system to stabilize the policy frameworkthat is needed to generate production and investments interms of both local and foreign in this country. There is noshift in that system. With that we have the strength to lookforward in terms of making things happen in this country andthat is the pragmatic leadership offered by His ExcellencyPresident Mahinda Rajapaksa in promoting the type ofdevelopment that is needed for Sri Lankas future. It is in thatregard that we are now preparing the sectoral report toadvocate in terms of automobile components, tourism andrubber related products because Sri Lanka needs a majordevelopment.

Recently, I was in Japan and we were able to address aforum in Tokyo in which over 200 investors participated.Such a thing was never heard of in the past. The Japaneseinvestors have taken a keen interest in Sri Lanka becauseof two advantages Sri Lanka commands. They are thelogistical advantage, location advantage and also the FTAswe have signed with India and the European Union. Theseare the factors that we have brought within the frameworkIt is in that regard that we could address the issues thatconfront the local consumer, the need for greateremployment, more money in the hands of the consumer sothat the consumer can match the requirements in a marketeconomy. Otherwise we will all get stuck. It is the advantagethat we are now having in terms of the Double TaxationAgreements. We have one coming from Australia and theothers are Bangladesh, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic,Denmark, Egypt, Federal Republic of Germany, Finland,France, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Japan,Jordan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mauritius, Nepal, the Netherlands,Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Peoples Republic of China,Philippines -it is very important for us to have all thesebeing discussed in the House- Poland, Qatar, Republic ofKorea, Rumania, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia,Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, United ArabEmirates, United Kingdom, United States of America andtoday we are finalizing the Agreement with Vietnam beforethis House. It is by following this path only that we canget the higher level of development that is associated interms of Sri Lankas production base. The confidence factorhaving to go up is the major development towards ourreaching the targets for exports. Last year we realized a targetof US Dollars 6.3 billion in terms of exports and we aregoing to surpass US Dollars 7 billion in terms of exportsfor 2007. This is why we are now targeting the sectorsthat matter, and in that regard, I am sure the Hon. RaviKarunanayake will appreciate. Sri Lanka to be made alogistical hub where we can bring in the type of goodsfrom other locations and do the consolidation becauseregional consolidation is an important factor, a key areafor future expansion in terms of our exports and valueaddition basis out of Sri Lanka. We are also not stoppingat that. In fact there is quite a good account in the form ofan editorial in the Financial News of the Daily News of

today, 6th June 2006, and I endorse and I appreciate it,captioned Fillip for overseas expansion. I quote:

Fillip for overseas expansion.

The National Enterprise Development Authority (NEDA), a long-awaited initiative, is to be launched soon by the Government.-

I am happy to announce on the 15th of June, now thatthe legislation is through and it is law, we will be launchingthe National Enterprise Development Authority (NEDA).In that I must read the recommendation from this editorial.I again quote:

It should also develop a healthy relationship with all relevantGovernment departments and major private sector establishments,especially those thathave already made their mark abroad. Theirinputs will be much appreciated as the NEDA seeks better prospectsfor our entrepreneurs.

It is the entrepreneurs of Sri Lankan origin, Sri Lankabased that must seek markets overseas and not beingconfined to the 19 million market that is available in thecountry. It is in that regard we are now bringing the valueaddition process.

I must compliment the initiatives taken by the Hon.Members representing the Moneragala District, the Hon.R.M. Padma Udayashantha Gunasekera and also the Hon.Minister Mrs. Sumedha G. Jayasena in regard to the typeof invitation that was extended and also the submissionsthat were made at the Consultative Committee of myMinistry on the last occasion where we carried out a totalsurvey in terms of the iron ore deposits available in theMoneragala District. I have now got the report before meand I also brought a sample of iron ore deposits which isnow available in the library for the benefit of the Hon.Members to have a look . In this regard we must have thevalue addition process of all our mineral deposits in thiscountry. The iron ore is present in the Moneragala Districtand it is a traditional development that has been there butwe have not done the value addition and there is a majorobjection from our local people, rightly, because nomineral should be exported out of Sri Lanka unless we havedone the value addition adequately which will bringadditional income to the country. We must apply that tomineral sand. We must apply that to graphite. We mustapply that to iron ore. We must apply that to silica. Wemust apply that to our petroleum products that we may findin the future and we must make Sri Lanka the base for valueaddition. It is in that regard, I am also happy to table* thereport that has been submitted to me from the Gem andJewellery Research and Training Institute which has givenan analysis on my direction. I must highlight what oneyouth from the area has said about their deposit.

( + )(The Presiding Member) . . 40 .

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity tospeak Madam Chairperson. I am delighted to follow theHon. Rohitha Bogollagama because I have been saying thathe is the person who has some knowledge, who has someflair in the areas of economic development and the instinctsand the colourization of the greens are there as he alwaysmentions that. So it only basically shows that the abilitythat is there in the United National Party is shown whereverthey are represented.

Hon. Minister, you did try to make a good case of a baddream. Your situation is you are living in the dead past.The future that is unborn is yet to be known. In economicterms, I have been saying at every given moment that if welose the economic war, we have lost all wars. That is wherethe Peoples Alliance Government is rapidly heading for.

Today we are debating issues of Scripless Treasury Bills.Then we are talking about Regulations under LocalTreasury Bills Ordinance, the regulations under theRegulation of Insurance Industry Act, Order under the DebitsTax Act and the Regulations under the Inland Revenue Act.As all matters concerned are related to revenue gainingexercises and the development of the economy, I thoughtit was a good opportunity to take an overview of theeconomic situation that is prevalent. When we talk of theeconomy, you cannot talk only of limited areas of exportdevelopment. We have got to look at the cost of production.We have got to look at the cost of living, the employmentcreations, the business climate and all of that is what I intendbasically to touch upon today.

But, Madam, before that I like to touch upon a verysacred area and I think it is the professionals in this country,the people who are able to say and do certain things andthe competent people who are silent today. That is a cursein this country today. Where are the professionals in thiscountry? Where are the people who can do something andwhere are the people who have the might to get a job done?All of them are silent. God only knows the reason fortheir silence. But I guess it is time that the professionals,it is time that the people who have got out of this countryneed to put back into this country, not look back in a yearor so and cry for Sri Lanka. We have got to ensure thatthis is the hour of need. There is no colourization when itcomes to the economy of this country. Unfortunately certainblind politicians who do not want to see across the dividetry to bring in subjective matters and distort the real situation.But today we have got to go beyond that. There is no pointcoming here and comparing what was there last year to this

year. Inflation alone will push economies forward. But weneed to take stock of that and I call upon professionals tocome out of their slumber. I call upon the people who areable to make decisions in this country to make decisionswhich are beneficial for the country not for the sake of afew and sacrifice the rest. That is what is going on. Thenagain you look at the changes that are taking place, thedecisions that are changed overnight. Today, is the countryrun by the Executive or is it the Parliament or is it theJudiciary? We do not see. Parliament is there to ensurethat the money is spent correctly and to make policy. TheExecutive is there to head the Government and to drive thecountry in a direction. And then unknown to both of this,the Judiciary comes and makes decisions that are notrelevant. They are there only to implement laws. So thisis where we have got to ensure that we look forward onthe basis of protecting Sri Lanka. There is no point justshouting, standing on roads, putting up posters. Todaywe have got firstly to ensure that the people are able tolive. Next, that they are protected from the bombs and thethreats that are there. Today whether it is the underworldor whether it is the overlords taking control of Governmentactivities that are taking place, people are puzzled. The Hon.Minister was trying to project an island of prosperity in aocean of poverty. ? . . So, the Hon. Minister was trying to labour onthat point. But I guess that we have to go much furtherthan that. If we lose the economic war we have lost allwars. But if we win the economic war we can live fortomorrow.

I guess history is not relevant, but to learn from historyis very important. Abraham Lincoln had said certain veryimportant things and I think those are more relevant intodays context. In 1855 he said this. I quote:

You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift.You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong.You cannot help small men by tearing down big men.You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich.You cannot lift the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer.You cannot keep out of trouble by spending more than yourincome.You cannot further the brotherhood of man by inciting class hatred.You cannot establish sound security on borrowed money.You cannot build character and courage by taking away a mansinitiative and independence.You cannot help men permanently by doing for them what theycould and should do for themselves.

How relevant are these words that were said almost 151years ago!. That is what we have got to look at. We havegot to learn from these wise men who have been able tosee the world before us and are we learning from them isthe question.

Now we are discussing about the Treasury Bills and allthose things. My Colleague and former Minister, the Hon.Bandula Gunawardane, did ably cover the areas of

819820

Government borrowing money. But all I want to touchupon is that the Government is going deeper and deeperinto debt today. The Central Bank report shows that thepublic debt as opposed to GDP has reduced from 104 percent to 95 per cent. That is good. But we also know thatthe devaluation that took place owing to the tsunami fundsthat came in, distorted the picture. Are we not living in afools paradise? But the quantum has increased to Rs. 2542billion. Hon. Minister, I am sure you are basically awareof this. Let us not get fooled around with statistics. At theend of the day the debt component in this country willincrease rapidly.

Furthermore, the Bank of Ceylon and the Peoples Bankare now in a situation of pawning the NRFC monies thatare there to issue Treasury Bills. I do not say that theseare totally illegal. I do not say that, but that is morallyincorrect. You do not sell your family silver if the countryhas sufficient money. This is what we have got to look at.Is that the reason why the Chairman of the Central Bankwas suddenly told to resign? Was he told to resign or hashe resigned on his own volition? Is it that they wanted theCentral Bank to print money? So, we must look at thesethings. Why are they trying to politicize this issue? If youmess around with the economy of a country you can neverregain yourself from a deep and dangerous trend that youare going into.

The insurance sector is also being discussed. I thoughtit is necessary to mention this. It is a competitive area. Butin reality is there a penetration in this area? It is very little.With regard to the personal insurance scheme, thepenetration is very low. Fanciful advertisements arebasically duping the people. But we must ensure, as aGovernment, as administrators, that we look at and guideit in the correct way. What we basically ask is whether thistrend is moving in the correct direction.

The Deputy Minister of Finance, the Hon. RanjithSiyambalapitiyas penchant is always to take the UnitedNational Party on at any given moment. I quote the headingof an article in the Daily Mirror of 31st May 2006. Itstates,

Dont mislead public on countrys economic growth:Siyambalapitya

In that same article it states, I again quote:

The price of a litre of petrol would have been increased to Rs.100, diesel to Rs. 69 and kerosene oil to Rs. 67 per litre had thegovernment continued to follow the UNP policy.

The very next day, which is the 1st of June 2006, the Hon.Minister, A. H. M. Fowzie says in Lankadeepa Newspaper,I quote :

100 . 70 , 69 .

[ ] ? ? ? 12 . . 1994 . . . 12 ? ? . ? . . ? [ ] ? [ ] , . [] . . ?

Our country is drifting, is drifting dangerously into a terrainthat is unlnown.

Today, are we looking at and concentrating on the economyon a basis of friendliness or on geographical reality? TheHon. Minister, Rohitha Bogollagama was speaking of theFree Trade Agreements. All of those Free Trade Agreementswere started by the United National Party. We were basicallytalking of the Free Trade Agreement with Pakistan and DoubleTaxation Avoidance Agreement between Sri Lanka andVietnam too was started by us. So, these are the Agreementsthat are there.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

It was started in 2001, prior to United National Party cominginto power.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)What is it?

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

The Indo-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)I said, Pakistan Free Trade Agreement.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

The Pakistan Free Trade Agreement was just signed by us.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Yes, but is was started by us.

2006 06821822

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

You may have started bu we implemented that.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)This is the problem. So, in two years we brought abouteconomic stability. There was a 1.4 per cent negative growth.We brought positive growth to that. Investments were flyingout of this country and we brought them back. You canremember what we did. You were part and parcel of us at thattime. Right. So, that is why I am saying that there is no pointin saying that this was done by the Greens. And this was doneby the Blues. The ruination has been done by the Reds. Weall know that and they continue to do so. Let us get to thereality of this situation. Let us take control of this country ina manner that is good for our people.

, . . ? ? , . . ? . ? 08 683 , . . . . . ? ? ? . . . ? . , . . , . ? 17 . . . . ? ? , ? .

But what we are saying is, is that necessary?

Look at the economhy. We have got to realize that there isa regional geo-political situation. We basically look at Indiaas a very important neighbour. We had Free Trade Agreementsand it was Mrs. Chandrika Kumaratunga who started them.Hats off to her. We embraced the situation and we knew thatwe had to do it better than them. They only signed. We carriedthem forward. What happened? Indians and Sri Lankans werethriving in their business. You mentioned that it was 1:4. Ifyou look at the annals of th history of Sri Lankas trade, yes,it was 1:16 when we took over. When the United NationalParty left if was 1 : 4 and that is what you still maintain andthat is with Vansapathis, with granites, with copper and withthings that are there. Those are not what we traded. We must

look at tea; we must look at textiles; we must look at spices;we must look at service industries. Those are the things thatwe have to look at. Now, Vanaspathies are under check. Graniteis under check. Copper is prohibited from being exported.So, then immediately it will come back again. I am notdistorting. Let us not take credit for it. What we have got tolook at is what is there for the future. No, you forget India andyou go to Pakistan. Then you forget Pakistan and at the nextmoment you try to embrace Chin. You end up with China bygiving China everything. At this particular moment we mustrealize that every country has its own agenda. We cannotblame that. They will not come for the love of us. They willcome for the love for themselves. So, whether it is the UnitedStates of America, whether it is Russia, whether it is India,whether it is Pakistan or whether it is China, as Sri Lankanswe must do what is good for Sri Lanka. When China gets thePort of Hambantota the Indians get annoyed. It isunderstandable. You do not blindly go to China forgettingSri Lankan politics. We have gone through these lessonsbefore. So, you must all look at these. China is givingcommercial loans. Whether it is Norachcholai or whether it isColombo-Katunayake Express Way, they give commercialloans. You need not go to China. You can go to the CityBank; you can go to the Peoples Bank; you can go to theBank of Ceylon. The NRFC gives at 4 per cent. So, why doyou go to China for 6 per cent. There is nothing important inthis, I mentioned last time about the Colombo-KatunayakeExpress Way. In 1999, when the tender was evaluated andawarded the cost was Rs. 3100 billion and now the Hon.Minister Jeyaraj Fernandopulle brings it before Cabinet on5th of May 2006 the same thing which costs Dollars 292,000and says that he spent Rs. 4.5 billion previously. So, thatmenas this Colombo-Kanayake Express Way which is of 25.4kilometres costs Rs. 36 billion, Rs. 36,400 million. 1300 . ? 1100 . ? Katunayake Express . 5000 36,000 .

. .

Those days it was through military approaches thatcountries were invaded but today it is through economicinvasion that countries are captured. So we must be cautiousof this.

Chinas over-concern and love for us is not just becausethey have surplus money but it is because they want tointernationalize themselves.

( )(The Hon. Bandula Gunawardane)Big commission business!

823824

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)As the hon. Bandula Gunawardena says there are bigcommission in the business that are going on. They are tryingto internationalize themselves because today. America istelling China, Your currency is absolutely weak. So theyare trying to spread their investments all over and we getduped. We annoy India on one side. We annoy our SAARCpartners on the other. What are you doing?

I saying all these Hon. Minister because you seem to beformidable. The SLFP Mininsters are not heard of . Our UNPnominees are heard of. It may irritate the PA guys, but theyare incompetent. We know that. We have got the brains andthey have got the power.

Then you talk of investments and include infrastructureinto that. But infrastructure is something that has been doneby the Government in the past. If you bring that as privatesector investment and show that it is a quantum leap ininvestment that is a distortion.

Look at Dialog. It is 150 million out of about 1000 million.This is a company that is here. That is infrastructuredevelopment for an existing company. Let us look at newcompanies.

Today, the newspapers refer to a new company. That isgood. But Dialogs 150 million is a waste of money. I am notsaying it is a waste of money, it is a requirement for them. Butthat is not a new investment. They will not be creating newjobs.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

What they are going to do with the 150 million US Dollarinvestment is not expansion. This is a new foreign directinvestment coming for two enterprises which is onlyconcentrating on the broad - [Interruption.]

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Minister, you know how much I have helped you tobring in investments during this period.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

Why not. I appreciate that.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

If I am thinking only as a UNPer I will say, This is the PAGovernment, do not invest.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

I appreciate that.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

I am selling the country because we all live in this country.We do not want India or Pakistan to get our business. So donot look at it from the point of view that this is being said bya green. So let us look at it differently. We are saying, look atit from the spirit of what is good for the country. We from theOpposition are helping you more than your own partnerswho are supposed to be your brotherhood. . ? . ? , . . . .

Hon. Minister, we have to look at how we are going to takethis country forward. Where is Russia? Where is China? Whereis Romania? Where is Hungary? Where is Poland? Where isIndia? All of them have embraced the market economy. Sowhy are we looking at these Communist countries. Look atCuba. The Forbes magazine says that Fidel Castro of Cubais the seventeenth richest man in this world. I am sure VasudevaNanayakkara will hit the ceiling when he reads this.

Then Hon. Minister, you are talking of economicinvestments. What have you done about the BOI projects?You are saying that we must develop the economy. Butaccording to a newspaper article the BOI has backstabbedinvestors.

I am totally in agreement that we have got to, whereverpossible, develop national industries, We must do it.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

That article was about a project that

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)No, no. I am talking of an article that appeared in the DailyMirror which says that the BOI backstabbed investors andthat it has backtracked on certain things it agreed to.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

If you read it you will understand the context in whixh itrelates to the BOI.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)I am only referring to the boxing of U-turn, where they aresaying that we have signed

[ ] ( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

I do not want the BOI to go by default.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Absolutely.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

They must maintain their credibility. We know certainconcerns of some of the people.

Thank you.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)I do not want to waste time your time and I am not in theleague that tries to do that. I know that you know whatbusiness is.

I am talking of a subject matter that comes under the BOIon which they have taken a policy decision to stop theimportation of certain items which are locally manufactured.There is no problem. In future, if a new company comes in,you sign an agreement with them and say, No moreimportation of items manufactured in this country, then weno problem at all. But, this is going back to the 1970s. . Here, I have got an article by a veryreputed person, Mr. Nimal Perera, who does a lot of housingdevelopment activities. In it he says, My cost of capitalgoes up by 25 per cent.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

Hon. Member, I would not waste your time. Once you finish,I will take time from the Government side and explain that toyou.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Then, it is the same with Deshamanya Lalith Kotalawala.As you know, he has made the biggest invwstment in thiscountry. And what is going on? He says that his cost ofinvwstment goes up by 33 per cent. One day the Board of theBOI sits and the next day they say that you cannot importthese 11 items into this country. Then two days later, you geta correction saying, Mega projects are exempted from thisruling. ? ? , ! , . ? mega projects

2006 06829830

. . . , ? That is theproblem I am talking about. I am talking of the problems the peopleare having today. In that case, you must say, Stop car importa,becuase now we have the Micro cars. Then, you can say, Stop sugarimports, because we have got the Pelwatte and Hingurana sugarfactories. Then you can say, No more cement should come in.Further, you can basically stop textile imports, because we exporttextiles to the USA and Europe. Then, canned fish. Why, we have gotthe sea around us! There were people who have been saying that. . . ? It iseasy to talk, but you must make itwork. Then, on the same basis, ?

We are not the only girl on thebeach for investments, If we do not ensure that all are put onan even playing field, we will never compete with ourneighbourhood. India is moving ahead. Their growth rartisat 9 per cent or 10 per cent. When the United National PartysManifesto was put out and the Hon. Ranil Wickremasingheand the United National Party said, We will ensure that wehave a 10 per cent growth rate, what did they say? What isthe country in this region that has a 10 per cent growth rate?It is India that is having a 10 per cent growth rate. We havetha ability, we have the confidence and we have the know-how to achieve this. Now, you see the proof of that.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)I will take another ten minutes and finish my speech.What I am saying is to increase production in this country-

( )(The Deputy Speaker)

, I will have to now call the next speaker. I amvery sorry. The time allocated to your group -

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Our Deputy Whip, who is now walking towards theChair, will discuss it with you and take action on that. WhatI am saying is, how to reduce the cost of production andthe cost of capital in this country. Today, the cost of capitalis almost -

( )(The Deputy Speaker)

, 10 . 5 .

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Our cost of capital is roughly about 12 per cent to 14per cent. That is increasing day by day. The Inflation isat 12 per cent in this country according to official figures.

Then, another matter is the delay in decision-making inthis country. The decision-making is absolutely slow. . , . , , ?

The next most important thing is taxation. Now, youare basically having, on one side, taxes on banks and, onthe other, taxes on credit cards and mobile phones. Youare trying to capture that source from where payments arebeing made. This country will never succeed on that basis.You cannot succeed by taxing the people who can affordto pay. You must develop the base of the tax net . There isno point in having a 40 per cent tax if you cannot collect10 per cent of that. You must reduce it to 15 per cent andensure that you collect a higher tax revenue. These werethe things that we were driving at. Remember, they weresaying that a Rs. 222 billion tax amnesty was given. Whata fuss was made! During the election in April, 2004, theywent before the Supreme Court and for the first time, gotan order for retroactive action, saying that they would repeal

the tax amnesty that was granted. How much of moneyhas been collected by that? It is only Rs. 1.2 billion. Theysaid it would be Rs. 222 billion. So, if only Rs. 1.2 billionhas been collected, there is something wrong in the system.That was absolute hypocrisy. The situation would be thesame if you do not bring down the interest.

India is having a 3 per cent cost of capital; in Bangladesh,it is 2 per cent; in Japan, it is 0.6 per cent and in Indonesia,they are telling the investors, You do what you want andwhen you can, come and pay us back. If Sri Lanka is havinga cost of capital of 22 per cent, how on earth are we goingto start asking for investments? So, that is what you haveto come and speak about here. There is no point in talkingof a 41 per cent export increase when you do not give themthe necessary base to carry on with the investments in thenext couple of months. Please, look at that.

Today, a bomb went off in Ragama; yesterday anotherbomb went off. These are what that gets into theinternational press. Then, what happens? Do the investorscome? How many of them have signed agreements and howmany of them have come and invested here? Signingagreements is one thing, but investing is another.Crystallization takes, from the point of signing theagreement, almost an 18-month period. So, as you know,at the Consultative Committee I presented some ideas asto how we can overcome this. As I mentioned before, nowit is time to collect our revenue. The Hon. BandulaGunawardane mentioned that the total income in thiscountry is Rs. 457 billion. Of that, Rs. 437 billion is foramortization of capital and interest owed by this country.Then, after paying the salaries of government servants andthe pensions, from where is the Government going to findmoney to fund the rest of its development projects? Somepeople say, We do not want foreign aid. . ? . , , . . . . ? ? . . ?

Now, look at the Hilton issue. They made such a bigfuss. US Dollars 6.4 million has to be paid by the 1st Julyto the Mitsui Company by Hilton. Of that, the companyhas only US Dollars 4.2 million in its account. So USDollars 2.2 million has to go out from the Treasury. USDollars 2.2 million has to go out from the Treasury whenthey do not have five cents to pay the Sathosa workers. . 2.2. , . ? ? , ?

Lanka IOC. 7,500 . , 1000 . . ? PERC, SEMA . You havebrought all the Government institutions which are makingmoney - cash cows - under SEMA which is illegal at thisparticular moment. PERC is the driving force. Now theyhave created SEMA which is not legally constituted byParliament. So please ensure that this is looked into.

Then you are talking of the peace process. I guess thisis something which is very important. Look at theendorsement that the four Co-Chairs made. Look at theendorsement that the European Union gave us. Look atwhat they said in Tokyo. We are saddened. After threeyears you come back and come back to the same oldplace. When they met us three years ago they told theHon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, they told the Hon. (Prof.) G.L.Peiris, they told the Hon. Rauff Hakeem who went there,Here is US Dollars 4,500 million to develop yourcountry. Three years later they have reduced that to Rs.3.8 billion, that is US Dollars 3,800 million. So withina couple of years, they themselves have reduced thecommitment to this country. So get back, you are on thebrink of war. If you want to salvage this country, the onlyway possible is to get back to the time that the UnitedNational Party was governing.

I would like to refer to the Joint Statement issued bythe Co-Chairs of the Tokyo Donor Conference. They saythat the best of times were the years 2002 and 2003. Theyearnestly requested us to get back to those days. Theyhave said that they can only facilitate, it is we who havegot to implement it. They said this to the Government aswell as the LTTE. What is going on? The same thing isgoing on. The Co-Chairs basically suggested a sort of asolution for this country. Nomenclature is immaterial.

Let us get back to the Tokyo Declaration. Let us getback to the Oslo Declaration. We have the courage ofconviction to say what we meant that day. From 1999 wehave said that this is our stand and that has been provencorrect. Today it is not only the Sri Lankan communitythat is speaking but also the international community. Thatis absolutely essential. This is basically a re-endorsementof the fact that the best of times were during the UnitedNational Partys regime. Who was the then Leader and whois our Leader? The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe. Theywere laughing.

, . . _ _ ?

[ ] 688 . ? . ,

What is going on with the Karuna faction, EPDP andthe military? They are named. This is the first time suchthings have happened. We have a Government. We are acountry governed by the Peoples Alliance. We are thealternate Government. We have a responsibility to ask whatis going on in this country. Further, the Co-Chairs saythat they will basically support the peace process facilitatedby Norway.

Getting back to the Tokyo Declaration. The EuropeanUnion is harping on the same thing. They are saying,Yes, we are proscribing the LTTE. But they are permittedto travel about in order to ensure that the peace processis carried forward.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)Hon. Member, I am very sorry. I will have to force youto conclude. The best of times is the best use of time.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

I will definitely wind up in one minute. The EuropeanUnion has re-endorsed the fact that they also agree thateven though they proscribed this group it is necessary, it isincumbent on the Government to look back at the time theUnited National Party governed this country. They areasking for the United National Partys help. We have beensaying this right from - [Interruption.] We are asking, whatthe Governments stand is? Are they accepting the CeasefireAgreement? Are they accepting that there is a unitaryframework they have got to protect? Are they requiring afederal status on that particular basis?

Thank you.
