QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE

NON-CONSTITUTION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COUNCIL

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)I thank the Hon. Speaker and you, madam Chairperson forpermiting me to make a statement in regard to a matter ofurgent public importance which is the non-constitution of

2006 0723732374

the Constitutional Council. Some conclusions prevail,Madam Chairperson, in regard to the non-constitution of theConstitutional Council.

I draw the attention of the House and the country to theprovisions of Article 41A. (1) of the Constitution pertainingto who shall consist of the membership of the ConstitutionalCouncil.

I draw attention in particular to the provisions of Article41A. (1) (f) of the Constitution which reads as follows :

one person nominated upon a agreement by the majority of theMembers of Parliament belonging to political parties or independentgroups other than the respective political parties or independent groupsto which the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition belongsand appointed by the President.

Some misinformation prevails in regaard to this nominationunder Article 41A. (1) (f). As the Parliamentary Group Leaderof the Ilankai Tamil Arausu Kadchi a party to which the Hon.Prime Minister and the Hon. Leader of the Opposition do notbelong, I need to Keep the House and the country informedof our position which I submit is the true position in regard tothis matter.

By letter dated 30th may 2005 addressed to the Hon. PrimeMinister and the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, the ITAKproposed the names of two persons, both reputed specialistsin the field of Constitutional Law and Political Science tothe said position in the Constitutional Council. I table* thesaid letter, Madam Chairperson, and request that it be includedin the Hansard.

In my letter I stated, May I urge that a consensus beattained if possible for the nomination of either of them.

In the letter I further stated, A nomination on the basis ofthe priority indicated above, is the wish of the majority of themembers of the minority political parties, if a consensusamongst all members of minority political parties is notattainable.

No action was taken in terms of that letter. Subsequently,we verbally urged that the appontment be made in terms ofthe said letter, but no appointment was made.

Thereafter, Madam Chairperson, I addressed another letterdated 10th March 2006 to the Hon. Prime Minister and theHon. Leader of the Opposition pertaining to the saidappointment. I table* the said letter and request that thesame be inclueded in the Hansard. In that letter I stated, Theminority parties represented in Parliament are,

(1). Ilankai Tamil Arausu Kadchi, ITAK(2). Jathika Hela Urumaya, JHU

(3). Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, SLMC(4). Eelam Peoples Democratic Party, EPDP(5). Up Country Peoples Front, UCPF

I further stated in the said letter, May I point out that thereare no other minority parties with elected representatives inParliament. In the said letter I further stated, Therepresentatives of Parties (1), (3), and (5) above, totalling toover 25 agree to the proposal made in my letter of 30th May2005. I urged that the appointment be accordingly made.

No action was taken in terms of the said letter.

It would appear that consequent to certain other claims,theview of the Attorney-Generals Department was sought. I referto the letter dated 22nd May, 2006 addressed by the Attorney-Generals Department to the acting Secretary-General ofParlimanent. I table* The said letter and request that thesame be included in Hansard. Having referred to Article 41A.(1) (f). the Attorney-General stated that the determination ofthe members for the purpose of Article 41A.(1) (f) .....................would be on the basis of the nomination papers uponwhich the said members were elected to Parliament and aspublished in the Gazette by the Commissioner of Electionsin terms of the Parliamentary Elections Act No. 1 of 1981 asamended.

Thus the nomination to the Council under the the saidArticle has to be made upon an agreement by the majority ofthe remaining Members of Parliament. That is, the Membersof Parliament other than those belonging to the politicalparties to which the Prime Minister and the Leader of theOpposition belong.

The opinion of the Attorney-General is completely in accord with the contents of my letter dated 10th March,2006.

On 26th May, 2006 the leaders of the Ilankai Tamil ArausuKadchi, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and the Up CountryPeoples Front addressed a Letter to Prisident MahindaRajapaksa nominating the first named of the two names earlierproposed by me for appointment to the constitutionalcCouncil under Article 41A. (1) (f). The said three partieshave a total of 29 Members in Parliament which constitutes aclear majority of the members of the political parties to whichthe Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition do notbelong. I table* the said letter and request that the same beincluded in the Hansard.

The Secretary to the president by his letter dated 21st June,2006 acknowledged receipt of the said letter.

[ . ]

No action has been taken thus far in terms of the said letterof 26th May, 2006.

An impression is being sought to be created that itis the failure of the Members of Parliament who fallwithin the ambit of article 41A. (1) (f) that has resultedin the constitutional Council not being appointed.

The facts that I have enumerated in the course of thisstatement would clearly demonstrate that the majority of theMembers of Parliament falling within the ambit of Article41A. (1) (f) have more than one year ago nominated theirchoice for such appointment. The failure to make suchappointment lies elsewhere.

The question arises as to whether the SeventeenthAmendment is sought to be nullified, by not making theappointment under Article 41A. (1) (f) though the majority ofthe Members of Parliament of the Political parties entitled tomake their choice under the said Article have unambiguouslyindicated their choice.

We have to urge that the said appointment be made and theConstitutional Council constituted.

I thank you on behalf of myself and the other politicalparties which have agreed to this nomination.

Thank you, Madam.
