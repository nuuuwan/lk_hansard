( )( - , )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama Minister of EnterpriseDevelopment and Investment Promotion) , , .

At the outset, I must congratulate the Hon. Minister ofTrade, Commerce, Consumer Affairs and MarketingDevelopment for the far - sighted measures adopted inbringing about legislation that is of contemporary value andfar - reaching consequences as set out in the two Bills - theAnti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties Bill and also theSafeguard Meassures Bill - that are before us today. TheSafeguard Measures Bill states, I quote:

to give effect to the Agreement of Safeguards; for the conduct ofinvestigations and the application of Safeguard measures on productsimported to Sri Lanka; and for matters connected therewith.

I would like to submit my views in line with the demandsof the State. For a long time we have been waiting for thislegislation. We have been subjected to international needs,because today we have entered into an era of globalizationand Sri Lanka has faired well in measuring up to theexpectations of international commerce and trade.

Our exports have grown during the last ten years inparticular and the incremental value of our exports over theyears has been remarkable. Our exports have registered a 12per cent increase over 2004 in the year 2005. Our traditionalexports have been overtaken by industrial products and today

803804

[ ]we are competing in the global market because we have beenconforming both to the standards and the quality criteria andabove that to the value - based products made in Sri Lanka.

My good Fiend, the hon. Bandula Gunawardane outlinedseveral areas that as a Government we may have to overcomeand as a country we have to pursue. I must concede the needfor us to be more liberal in terms of making Sri Lanka aproduction - based country, not only in terms of industry, butalso in bringing about a good quality environment forservices, tourism, health and education, thereby increasingthe value of our human beings in terms of achieving a betterquality of life.

These are factors that our Government has started to address.We are confident that the vision of His Excellency thePresident Mahinda Rajapaksha, which is enumerated in theMahinda Chintana, is very much on course to overcome thechallenges that were cited and the needs that were advocatedby the Opposition speaker, the hon. Bandula Gunawardane.

We are quite adapt to change. We have identified thePriorities of local enterprise development, local entrepreneurprogress, and that is one reason why only last month I broughtin legislation to set up the National Enterprise DevelopmentAuthority. In the absence of the safeguards that are beingnow contemplated through this Bill we will not be able tomeasure the needs of the local entrepreneurs to becomeadapted to the export markets. If we do not prevent, throughlegislaltion, the dumping of goods of both low quality andlow cost, it will affect the local production base. Once thelocal production base gets affected, there will be lessproduction, obviously resulting in less exports. So, therefore,the need is there to bring in legislation that could safeguardthe environment which would make a better production basefor the local entrepreneurs. It is in that light that I say I amparticularly happy that the much awaited, long overduelegislation in antidumpingto prevent dumping of lowquality goods - has now been introduced in this House.

This is a tremendous boost for investment. It is investmentthat could generate the flow of foreign exchange therebycushioning our external resources and adding on to theproduction capacity of Sri Lanka. It is on those lines that Ihave now started fashioning the Board of Investment regimewhich would facilitate, generate and through that develop atotally comprehensive production base in our country. Ourproduction base today can become wider because there arenew sectors for people to look at when investing in Sri Lanka.

Telecommunication, oil refineries, oil exploration,infrastructure development, IT related sectors, BPO servicescall centres, these are all new areas, new sectors innovativeareas for investment generation. That is why at the outsetwith my assumption of office as the Minister in charge ofinvestments of this country, I set a target of US Dollars onebillion for 2006 as the investment goal for the Board of

Investment of Sri Lanka. Like how Malaysia is progressinghow our neighbour India is making tremendous growth interms of their industrial base and service sector, we are alsonow looking at a production base, a service base and alsoencouraging greater investment flow to Sri Lanka.

I am indeed happy of the first three months of His ExcellencyMahinda Rajapaksas period in office ending on the 31st ofMarch, 2006 in which we have been able to register atremendous growth in terms of foreign and local investmentsunder the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka. Shortly I will berevealing the figures, but from the statistics available to me,we have now exceeded by over 50 per cent in the first quarterof 2006 as against the first quarter of 2005, in terms ofinvestment flow. The Mahinda Chintana also envisages anindustrial base spread in Sri Lanka which we call theNipayum Sri Lanka Programme or the 300 factoryprogramme under the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka outof which we have now started construction of 20 factories in20 divisional secretariat divisions in our country. It is in thesame context that we are now activating new zones in thiscountry so that there is greater development in terms ofindustries. I am happy indeed there are now weal investorscompetent to invest substantial amounts of monies in foreignexchange in Sri Lanka which was not the case five years ago,which was not the case 10 years ago. There were investorswho took money from the banks and defaulted. Some wereforeign investors who went away from the country. KaboolLanka was one such example which has to be highlightedtoday on this Floor. For three years, Sir, we could not find aninvestor for Kabool Lanka at Thulhiriya because the Koreaninvestors defaulted in their bank commitments and went outof the country without any intimation or information or anynotification to the local authorities. What were we able todo? We were able to do nothing. Three thousand oddemployees lost their jobs. The countrys export earnings fromKabool Lanka in Thulhiriya dropped by over US Dollars 60million. The local activities that were generated at Tulhiriyabecame totally non - existent. People who were working inKabool Lanka at Thulhiriya had to end up in Alawwa bazaaror Alawwa town in the Kurunegala District I doing variouslabourers jobs far below the expected economic pursuits thatthey used to follow. We had to arrest that transformation andbring about a new development.

When we found a local investor for Kabool, I regret to note,there was so much of negative publicity of a local investorbeing found for Kabool to take over an investment of overUS Dollars 100 million naming Mast Group of Companiesheaded by Mr. Mahesh Amaleen one of the largest and masthonourable entrepreneurs of Sri Lanka.

This article appeared in the of 02nd April,2006. I quote :

2006 04805806

What is this ? It is the fact that a local entrepreneurhas been identified to take over the defunct, closed up Kaboolpremises at Thulhiriya which every consecutive government,the United National Front Government of which I was theMinister of Industries failed to find an investor the previousPA administration failed to find an investor. Today under theMahinda Chintana we have identified at least a localinvestor who has undertaken a US Dollars 100 millioninvestment in transforming Kabool premises at Thulhiriya toa value added, internationally recognized integrated textileprocessing plant.

This was an article that appeared in the IridaLankendeepa If they only saw their own sister paper, - page3 of the Financial Times of The Sunday Times of 02ndApril, 2006 which states, I quote :

Thulhiriya to host world class warp knit fabric project

It gives a totally positive account of the efforts of theGovernment in finding an investor capable of investing USDollars 100 million and starting a world-class textileprocessing zone at Thulhiriya. From the same press office,the Sinhala news paper gives a different version and theEnglish news paper gives a very positive account of thisproposed investment. This is where the media also has tobecome responsible because even countrevailing measuresadopted through legislation cannot be sometimescountervailed, when distorted publicity is given. So I callupon the press to be very responsible because we need apositive outlook for investor confidence to be generated.

So, Madam Chairperson, basically in this instance, Ithought it is my duty as a former Minister of Commerce andConsumer Affairs of the United National Party to congratulateHon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle for bringing the Anti-Dumpingand Countervailing Duties Bill and Safeguard Measures Billand also Regulations relating to the Import Export ControlDepartment before the House.

The most important thing is that, if these laws are beingbrought in, the Government has accepted the World TradeOrganization. The World Trade Organization was somethingwhich was virulently opposed when we were in Government.I can remember the hon. Members of the then PA and the JVPmade such a din that we went to Cancun. We projected SriLanka and we were able to get a very good status for SriLanka in the international arena. They made it a conditionthat when the PA and the JVP come into Government, thatwas on 2nd April, 2004, that they will abolish the WorldTrade Organization agreement, they will walk out of the FreeTrade Agreement and that they will ensure that the investmentsthat are in Sri Lanka will be protected, to hell with whathappens in the World Trade Organization. Today, it bearstestimony, after 25 months in Government, now they are doingthe very thing, that we basically did. So, is this not hypocrisy?But, still as the Opposition, if it is something good we willensure that we will support it and we will take it forward. But,what is it? When you are saying the World Trade Organizationis good in one aspect you must ensure that the conduciveclimate is there. There is no point in bringing legislation andon the other hand basically talking of a completely differentthing. Now, that is what is happening, Hon. Prime Minister,in this country. Under your stewardship your Cabinet ofMinisters are talking of one thing and doing completely

another. You must crack the whip on them. You have to ensureas you are in charge of the Cabinet, that investments areprotected in this country. If we do not get investment intothis country our hope for an accelerated development withan 8 per cent to 9 per cent growth rates is an absolute dream. . . So, we have got to ensure that we basically fortify,nurture, foster investment and take it forward and we are thereto support you even though you ridiculed. The hon. MPswho were standing on that side basically said if the UnitedNational Party comes this is what is going to happen andexactly the same thing that we proposed is what you aredoing now. Never mind. What is good is good and the peoplehave realized this. You can see how it is moving forward. Atthe World Trade Organization Cancun, Mexico we, small SriLanka was unable to fight against 216 countries. It was ourintention that we Project Sri Lanka as a shining star in theSouth Asian region and that was exactly what we did. TheUnited States of America was talking of the Free TradeAgreement with Sri Lanka. The Indian Free Trade Agreementwas booming even though it has now gone haywire. ThePakistan Free Trade Agreement is something we started. Wetalked with Singapore; we talked with Thailand. Why is itnot being pursued? That is what you have got to do. The SriLankan investors are always on a wait and see approach.When I was the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs,I was calling the Chambers and telling them to speak in onevoice - Forget thinking of what the Government wants. Thinkthat you are talking as one lot from the commerce; as thecaptains at the helm of commerce. But, they did not. Today,they are still waiting and seeing. So, if that is the case, if theSri Lankan investors are not investing in this country wemust bring investments into this country and that is why inorder to keep pace with the international trend and regulationsthese are necessary. But, the only thing is that we must ensurethat there is a proper justice system, a quick justice. Otherwisewhat they feel is, All these laws are there but not to beimplemented.

When you look at anti-dumping, the most important aspectof anti-dumping means that you are fully embracing the openmarket system in this country. In that case then how are youbasically going to say on the other side that we have got toalso look at the non even playing field for the Sri Lankaninvestors? Now, that has not been addressed. If you look atwhat some of the Hon. Ministers have been talking and theagreements signed in the last couple of days they put ourlocal investors into jeopardy. They are basically givinganything and everything to the foreigners. Our Sri Lankanpeople who are basically having, the ability to do that arenot being given the opportunity. This happens even in yourown electorate Hon. Prime Minister. So, this is what I thinkyou have to get, the most important aspect of where thiscountry is being taken to. Sometimes, the inflated Rigureshave shown as US Dollars 100 million but the actualinvestment may be US Dollars 5 million to 6 million. That isnot the type of investment that we want in this country.

2006 04817818

So, this is really what you have got to look at.

We say that anti-dumping and countervailing dutyregulations are absolutely essential. If countervailing dutiesare essential and legislation is coming in, then you must takeaction against people who breach those. There is nomechanism for that. The regulation alone is not sufficient.The Attorney - Generals Department must be well versed inmatters like this. In India, Madam Chairperson, you wouldknow that Mr. Arun Jaitley, former Minister for commerceand industry, was fighting the system, the WTO from the wordgo and he had hands-on experience. Now we must be ableto bring in these safeguard measures. That was something wedid when we were in the Government. We told the AmericanGovernment - when they came, they wanted to bring certaingenetically modified foods, which they said there was noway of labeling- We are sorry. Sri Lanka is not a dumpingground. It is not a graveyard for you all. We basically toldthem, If you want to do trade with Sri Lanka, you have got todo it in the manner that Sri Lanka wants it done and not inany way you want. That is what we told them. That type ofmethod is not being implemented now. So, that is what wehave got to tell. Unfortunately, my successor, the Hon. JeyarajFernandopulle, is not present here to listen to this. But I amsure he will look into this matter and take cognizance of whatI am trying to say.

But the most important aspect that needs to be mentionedis that, while we bring legislation in, we must have capable,competent and able people to carry them out. Otherwise, itmakes it senseless and you would only give a wideopportunity for racketeers. You can see what has been goingon in the last couple of days.

Once again, I would like to say that the safeguard measuresare something necessary. But they have to ensure theprotection of the people and not to stymie trade in this country.That is the most important thing. You know as to how theDepartment of Import and Export Control is working. Whenit was under my stewardship, you could see how rigidly itwas controlled and how difficult it was to get things done.Unfortunately, now it seems that a much more liberal and anopen policy is being pursued there. The revenue loss fromthat is significant and I guess that has got to be looked at. TheHon. Minister should take note of this because, otherwise,either known to him or unknown to him, his name can beruined in these areas. So, bringing regulations is absolutelyessential, but controlling it is more important. There weresome top-class officers there and I hope they are still there.But I am made to understand that they are being shuffledaround. That does not help this course. My main idea here isto say that we must foster, we must develop and we mustmake the investments in the proper way in order to ensurethat Sri Lanka moves forward to achieve an acceleratedgrowth. They have been boasting about an 8 per cent to 10per cent growth rate. If we do not do this, I do not think wecan see even a 3 per cent to 4 per cent growth rate.

Further, I beg to see as to what is going on with regard tothe Indian Free Trade Agreement. All these are theoretical.The practical aspect is how you perform, how you take forwardthese things, how you give leadership to this and how theCabinet of Ministers speak in one cohesive voice. At theLocal Government Election you saw how diverse the opinionwas. On the 17th of November, 2005, the President, HisExcellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, gets elected to carry out theMahinda Chintana. In less than 90 days, . . . . .

The most important thing is that the foreign investor looksat this situation and says, What the hell is this? Is this aGovernment? Within 90 days they changed their policy.An alliance of the same people who said how good andimportant a leadership it is is torn to pieces. So, is this aGovernment that an investor, who wishes to come and investin this country wants ? There are 216 countries in the world.Our country is not the only girl on the beach for investment.So, we must ensure that we bring about the necessary,conducive business climate in order to protect our economyand move forward.

Madam Chairperson, there was an article that appeared inthe Financial Times of the Daily Mirror of Saturday 25thof March, 2006. It states, Disastrous start for exports in2006. These are matters that need to be looked at ; these arematters that committees need to lool at. Today the rupee isbasically falling. You have an inflation which is between 10per cent to 11 per cent. Even if you had done noting from lastyear to this year, you will have a growth rate shown, becauseyesterdays Rs. 10 has devzalued to Rs. 11. So, even if theexports of yesterday were done on a constant basis, on thisside you will have the same 10 per cent growth rate. So, youhave got to look at as to why there has been a disastrous startfor exports in 2006. Is it because of the impact of the tusslebetween the J V P and the P A on the new Chintanaya? Wehave got to look at this. . , 2006 .

Then again an article appeared in the Financial Times ofthe Daily Mirror of Monday, 20th of March, 2006. It states,I quote:$ 1 b FDI target:

And the same heading further states, I quote:

No action, Talk onlyBOI success ratio a mere 23% so far with only 19 agreementsinvolving us$ 38m investments signed since January

So, this is of great concern because after all, we have toensure that whether we do politics or not - we have aneconomy which is strong, vibrant and led from the front.Whether this is happening or not is something of greatconcern. We must ensure it happens. If we lose the economicwar, we will lose all wars.

819820

[ ]We are heading for dangerous times. When the peace processis heading towards a more war-orinted situation, whether thatis the action that should be taken should be looked at.

Today the investors look at the macro-economic policy ofa country; they look at the political stability of a country;they look at the peace process that is going on. Just 130 daysago people laugher at the Leader of the United National Party,the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, for embracing certainprincipal policies. Today what was happened? Every singleprincipal policy that was followed by the United NationalParty is being adhered to by the Government without a singlealteration. That bears testimony to the absolute futuristictrend and planning that the United National Party had. Butdo you think that the innocent people are gullible, that theyhave not seen through this? That is what we basically need.So, together we must endure that we protect the economy.

Coming back to the same subject, you look at what isgoing on in Prima Ceylon Limited. Thousand six hundredpeople have been basically displaced owing to the simplefact that they wanted salary increase well beyond therequirement. The company says, that is not for us to discusshere. That is up to the Hon. Minister of Labour Relations andForeign Employment and I am sure he will provide a correctanswer. But there is no right for the JVP to go and instigate aprotest come out and say, This is it. This is the way that youhave got to do it and have a problem created. Whether it isin Kotte, whether it is in Mattakkuliya, whether it is inTrincomalee or whether it is in Seeduwa, all of them arecoming out with red flags. When any investor comes to PrimaSeeduwa and when he sees these red flags outside Prima, doyou think that investments will take place? This is not whatthe Government must do. If by chance green flags are therethen the Government will ensure that those are taken off. Butwhen there are people shouting around with red flags, nothingis being done. As soon as an investor lands here, in five minuteshe sees what goes in Prima. I am saying this not with relish.I am only saying, not destroy what we did. That is all what weare saying. You all are carring on exactly what we did. But atleast have the modestry, the honesty and the sense of dignityto say that you are basically carrying on something good,that we had been doing. That is why we say, please ensure ithappens.

Look what happened in Trncomalee. An hon. Member ofParliament categorically told them Please ensure that youstrike. They told him Go to hell. We have families to protect.We have a job to look after. We are not there to look aftteryour political agenda. Are these the people who support theUPFA Government? We from the Opposition are doing a moreyeoman service than those people who are in the Government.So, look at your ture friends in the proper perspective. Youare shouting around politics. Today the peace process isheading towards war. The economy is in dire straits. Theinflation is at 10 per cent and there is no control.

Today, look at the VAT scam that is there. Nobody knewthat. The Auditor-General, on the 5th of June 2005, mentionedthis, highlighted this. It is almost a Rs. 10 billion scam thatthey are talking of. No action was taken till about two weeksago. During this one year what was going on in this country?They are saying that there is no money in this country. Everysingle person is taxed from the time be gets up till he goes tosleep; from the time he was born till he dies. If that is the case,then why has this Rs. 10 billion scam not been looked at?That is what we have got to basically ask. So, look into thismatter. We have to protect the economy and take the countryforward.

On the same basis, we must have our macro-policies inplace. The United National Party has time and time againbeen accused that if it comes in there will be representationof the LTTE in this country. You saw on the 17th of November2005 the vote we got from the LTTE? But, we still stood ourground. We have a policy; we do not shake just because acouple of maniacs shouts around. We stood our ground. Todaywhat is happening? Every single thing that the UnitedNational Party had said has come to pass. Today we are asking,why has the Ceasefire Agreement not been cancelled? Whyare the helicopter rides not stopped? Why has theManirasakulam camp not been removed? Why have thecourts that are administered by the LTTE not been removed?If that is the case, then you must at least have the honesty tosay that the United National Party did on their best for thecountry to bring in peace. I do not say that everything thatwas done was perfectly correct. In the limited time, with theopposition we had, with a President who was not with us, wemanaged to bring in peace and that is the same peace that thepresent President and the UPFA is trying to protect. But whatis happening? The same officials in the Government now saysomething else. Mr. Kotakadeniya says that disarmingparamilitaries is impossible and it will not be done. The Hon.Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, theHon. Rohitha Bogollagama and the Hon. (Mrs.) Farial Ashraffmade a solemn promise that they will ensure thatparamilitaries are disarmed. The rights or the wrongs are notfor me to discuss. But I am only talking about the hypocrisythat is being practised. They say yes when they return fromGeneva and when Mr. Kotakadeniya says, Go to hell, we theyare not going to do that. What is the purpose of bringinganti-dumping regulations, what is the purpose of bringingcountervailing duties and what is the purpose of bringingsafeguard measures if there is no investment climate, if thereis no conducive climate created for investments to be broughtin? That is what I basically want to mention.

So the same way, another amiable member of Parliament,Mr. Ponnambalam junior is saying, It is obvious the LTTEis preparing for war. Who is saying this? He is saying thisnot with relish, but he is stating the actual state of the playthat is going on. He thinks that the Government is not doingwhat what they have got to do and on the same basis, he ispointing out the reality. On one side, the JVP ParliamentaryLeader Mr. Wimal Weerawansa ,

2006 04821822

. , . . , . , . ? . _ , _ . . . . , ? . , . , .

130 . ? . : Strengthen the military. Use the big stick. JVP tellsthe Government. I am now telling that the same stick must beused on these rogues who are ruining the country. They triedto do this in 1971; they tried to do this in 1988. They are tryingto do what they could not do with the bullet, with the ballotnow. That has got to be looked at. After all there is aresponsibility on the big parties that are there. Had we beenin the Government, I am sure, the Opposition that would havebeen here would have made a merry hell out of what we wouldhave done. But see the responsibility with which we are acting.Do not ever think that this is our weak point. Do not thinkthat you can split por party and be in power forever. Neverwill that be the case! You saw what happened in 1977. TheSLFP was in fragments, but they came back stronger thanever. The people are there. When the going gets tough only,the tough get going and the tough are there with the UnitedNational Party.

You saw the results at the Local Government Election. Thevotes were intact. Whether it is a big party, whether it is thegoverning party, normally it moves with the trend that is there.When we were in Government, we got a 94 per cent successrate, but the present Government, within 128 days, has gotonly a 72 per cent factor and also the Alliance is in splinters.But we only want to drive a point: ensure that the economy isnot brought down to an absolutely dangerous position.Create the conducive climate for investment. . . , , . , .

. 350 . ? 22 ? 22 , 7 8 . ? . .

? . . , .

Another very important issue that I would like to raise hereis with regard to the Auditor-General. I would salute him asan accountant. I am so honoured and humbled by theprofessionalism that had been dispalyed by our accountantfraternity. The Auditor-General, whom I know, is a man parexcellence and has displayed his courageous attitude andshowed wat a public servant needs to do. A very few will dothis type of thing. In an era where if you basically suck up tothe politicians you can be going places, he has withstoodthat and come out and said what is right and what is wrong. Isalute the Auditor General and his Department for standingup for what is right. Today there is one of the biggest scams.But do you think this is in the hands of one or two or threepeople? No, this has been going on for four to five years. Thisis a racket that is going on. We as businessmen, if you havegot to get a refund of your input tax, you have got to showthat your output tax has been paid, and to reclaim just a Rs.100,000 will entail such a difficult process. How can almostRs. 9 billion be fraudulently displaced or defrauded by agroup of people?

The Government must look into it and I am happy that HisExcellency the President has taken a serious stand on it. Butwhat I am asking is this. The revelation of this had takenplace on the 3rd of June, 2005 under Financial Regulations,whether it is 126, 127 or 131, I am not sure. The FinanceMinistry should have been on the prowl and asked from them,Where is the Rs. 10 billion that we should have got? Butwhy has it not taken action? Now you could see that there isan absolute, gross, interference in the constitutionallegislative function that is before the Auditor General.Nobody should allow the Auditor General to be stymied orbe crunched. He is coming forward to say where the problems.You must not kill the messenger. Look at what the messengeris carrying.

. ? , ? , .

Now look at what he says in his Administrative Report. Heis unable to express an opinion on the accounts of the RDA.The Auditor-General is unable to give an opinion on theaccounts of the National Livestock Development Board. Heis unable to give an opinion on the accounts of the GramodayaMandalaya injstitution. He is unable to give an audit opinionthe central Cultural fund. But two of these in stitutions havebeen under the JVP. They are boasting so much that from2004 to 2006 they were in Government. These institutionshave come under them. Now the auditors are saying thatthey cannot give an opinion on that. What are we talking ?For Gods sake, we must stop this nonsense of trying to

823824

ridicule all political parties and at the end of the day, like awhirlpool we are in the same position. We, as responsibleMembers of Parliament across the divide of this House mustensure that we look at the country as a whole. Bickering doesnot help to ensure that you give satiasfaction to anybody.There may be opportunistic people who take advantage ofone or two opportunities that are there. But that is not whatthe majority of this country needs. The country needs rapiddevelopment. So ensure that the country moves into an erawhere the neighbours are moving forward and be part andparcel of that development. Ensure that we have a corrupt -free environment, ensure a healthy, business conductiveclimate and a liveable cost of living. Where is the low cost ofliving that was promised?

, 24 , , , .

This is basically what we want to say. The Auditor Gerneralis quite rightly talking of Rs. 10 billion that was scammed.That has been a fraud. We have got to look into it irrespectiveof who is involved. There are fake documents that had beenbrought in. This cannot be done by one or two persons. It hasto be an involvement, not of a department but of the Ministryitself. So please ensure that we have a special, a non-politicalCommittee to go into this and even if required, there shouldbe a Parliamentary Committee to go into this, and ensure thatwe get every single cent beak because normal businessmenare harassed. Look at the character assassination carried onthe Members of the United National Party and ourselves.Unnecessarily we were harassed. And today when the entireAuditor Generals Department is giving information, theyare absolutely unable to find even one cent that was defaulted.So at the end of the day it is proved that we have come toserve the people rather than serve ourselves. But there are ahandful of people who are serving themselves. So we mustensure that we eradicate that.

Today if you look at the Auditor Generals Report, it is ashameful indictment on the Government institutions. This isnot what is experted of the public servant cut why is ithapenning? A couple of or I would say fraudulent officialswho take the law unto themselves cannot be made responsiblefor the lack of revenue in this country or the people whosuffer in this country. Also look at the corruption PerceptionIndex which is maintained in Berlin. Sri Lanka has slippeddown from 67 to 78 from 2004 to 2005. So these need to beinvestigated, looked into and action taken.

Going on further, all we can basically ask is, is thisGovernment speaking in one cohesive voice? We talk oftrying to ensure that the peoples living standards areimproved, investments are increased, unemployment is

reduced and getting Sri Lanka into the world map. On thesame token, the same people are fighting against the system.This is the hypocrisy that I need to point out. The Governmentis forcing the poor to eat spoilt rice. , . . , . . 24 . 3157 . ? .

. , . ? . , . , 3157 , . . ? Theirony is, the Indian Oil Company has to get Rs. 7 billion. ThePrima enterprise needs to get about Rs. 8 billion. The CeylonElectricity Board is about Rs. 115 billion in debt. ThePetroleum Corporation is Rs. 65 billion in debt. Today theGovernment is unable to pay tomorrows salaries. On whatbasis are you making promises when there is no foreignfunding that is coming in. Where is the internal generation ofrevenue ? On one side the little that is coming through theVAT is also being scammed. So on that basis we have got toensure that at least now the promises are stopped and realitiesare brought to place. Shame! Members of your Government - . , . , .

. . , . ? , 05 , 06 . ? , ; . , . , , , . ; . , .

That is the difference between us and the people who arein the Government who are acting as the Opposition today.Look at the statement that is there in the Divainanewspapers. .

Now the same lot that is here, I can remember when Ispoke of this six months ago said, you saw what the TradeMinister did? When Prima tried to increase the price of flour,

[ ]

2006 04825826

imported flour to this country. What happened? When theUnited National Party handed over the Government flourwas Rs. 22. Today it is Rs. 33. What is going on? Who isresponsible for this? Without any sense of shame, you allshout without knowing what world trends are, withoutknowing what world trade markets are and without knowingwha demand and supply is. Today you all ridicule and makefools of yourselves. It is the same thing that JBIC is saying.Aid is related to reforms in CEB. That is why I say, when onone side the revenues are drooping and on the other sidewhen we find that the necessary investments are not cominginto this country, then what happens? You are going to getinto a cash plunge. Now look at the rupee. 93 103 . , ? , 70 , ? ? . Soall we can basically say is, together we must ensure that wehave a different approach. We have colourized and gonethrough elections. I was speaking to an investor the otherday. I happened to speak to the Chairman of the BOI, who isdoing a tremendous job even though in a difficultenvironment. He said within the last six years we had sixgovernments, we had six Chairmen of BOI, we had sevenministers, we had five secretaries. So how on earth doinvestors come to this country? One letter given by oneadministration is revoked by the other.

When I went overseas on the instructions given by theHon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, who was the then Prime Minister,we brought HSBC the worlds local bank into Sri Lanka.Four thousand five hundred people were given employmentin Kotte by the first BPO, Business Processing outsourcingCentre. When it started, what a fuss was made that land wassold to Ravi Karunanayakes friends. Today, they areemploying 3800 people. Potentially it is 4500. Almost Rs.100 million is coming into this country per month and that isbeing emulated. I am at least happy that the Hon. PrimeMinister and His Excellency the President have been sayingthat these are the type of investments that need to be broughtinto this country. I am asking, what are the investments ofthat calibre that have been brought in during the last 27months? Nothing at all. That is why I say, please do not playwith the economy of this country. Look at the mighty Thaksinin Thailand. He was doing so well in the economy. He tried topoliticize the economy and today the people are saying, Go to hell with it. That is the same thing that is happeninghere. If we do not look at this - On the 19th April, I hope andpray that the country goes in the proper direction and thepeace process is taken forward. We may have differences ofopinion on the peace process. There is no question about it.But we must ensure that, we do not go back to war. If we goback to war, then every single rupee that is collected goes fora senseless war. That is where the credit comes to the UnitedNational Party. After 23 years we managed to bring peace tothis country. We were ridiculed. We were insulted. We lost

elections. But today the same Government is carrying onwhat the United National Party did and begging everybodysaying, Please ensure that the peace process is untouchedand unharmed. We also say the same thing. But, is ithappening?

A party, in the Government, who is bolstering and givingthe necessary support to ensure that majority is maintained,is saying, Go to hell. We do not want Norway to be here. Wedo not want the peace process in the manner that it is beingpursued One lot is saying, We cannot have a solution basedon a unitary state in this country and the others are saying, We have to have a solution based on a unitary state.

So, all what I say is, you have to look at the reality. I read in The Island on the 1st of April - I was wondering whether itwas an April Fools joke - it states, I quote :

LG polls victory bolsters Mahindas right to SLFP leadership

Now this is being tossed around. Where are the people whowere there prompting Chandrika Kumaratunga when we havebeen telling for the last 11 years that the ruination of thiscountry was by Chandrika Bandaranaike? Where are thepeople who supported her at that time? Now everybody hasdecamped her a typical mentality of human frailty. Whenthings are going bad they jump out of the sinking ship. Isthat what you should do? We have been telling this for thelast 11years without any fear even when we were supportingChandrika Kumaratunga. But today everybody is saying thesame thing that, we have been telling, for 11 years. She ruinedthe country for 11 years and now she is ready to ruin theSLFP. Go ahead and do it. We have no problem at all. But Iguess, is that why Anti - Dumping and Countervailing DutiesBill has been brought in today? Then the same regulationsmay probably, be used to protect her from being dumped outof the party. That is what I am basically saying.

On the other hand you are talking about MahindaChintana.

, .

We must ensure that the economy is strengthened. We mustensure that we have free trade agreements. You have to carryon with what we have started. Ensure that you renegotiatewith India to further strengthen the free trade agreement thatwe have discussed. Ensure that you take up the Singaporefree trade agreement that is there. Ensure that BIMSTEC freetrade agreements are brought in and look at the free tradeagreement with the United States of America. Look at thelabour GSP that we got with great difficulty. It is in jeopardyat the moment. But I am made to understand with interventionthat now it is being basically put into place again but ensurethat investments are brought in. Have an all - party mechanismwhere investments are brought in on the basis of at least USDollars three to four hundred million and not just to say thatinvestments are coming in only for signing purposes.

You must ensure that the Sri Lankan investors are giventhe opportunity, instead of harassing them. Just because theyare Sri Lankans, that does not mean that they should not getthe benefits from the BOI. Ensure that you reduce the taxesfrom 35 per cent to 10 per cent because then the compliancefactor will be higher than what you collect out of the revenueat the moment. The 10 per cent taxes will bring you muchmore than the artificial 35 per cent that is there. This is theway that you can bring investments to this country.

So on that particular note all I can basically say is, thoughthe world Trade Organization is there, it is absolutely essentialto look at this from a Sri Lankan perspective. Then, nobodycan bring in pressure to the Government of Sri Lanka. Nobodybrought pressure to the Government of Sri Lanka when wewere in Government. All what we want to say is to ensure thatwe have a consistent, coherent and business conduciveclimate if we want to make Sri Lanka into a rapid growthrelated country. On this particular basis all what we can tellthe Minister of Trade is to pursue the policy of the UnitedNational Party. You must ensure that the cost of living isbrought within a liveable range and ensure that whateverthat is being done is looked at from a Sri Lankan perspectiveand not just because it is imposed on us.

I thank you very much for giving me this opportunityand once again I thank the Minister of Trade and theGovernment for pursuing the legislation that we thoughtfit to bring investments into this country and take thiscountry to a safer tomorrow.

Thank you.
