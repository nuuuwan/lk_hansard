We have identified thePriorities of local enterprise development, local entrepreneurprogress, and that is one reason why only last month I broughtin legislation to set up the National Enterprise DevelopmentAuthority. In the absence of the safeguards that are beingnow contemplated through this Bill we will not be able tomeasure the needs of the local entrepreneurs to becomeadapted to the export markets. If we do not prevent, throughlegislaltion, the dumping of goods of both low quality andlow cost, it will affect the local production base. Once thelocal production base gets affected, there will be lessproduction, obviously resulting in less exports. So, therefore,the need is there to bring in legislation that could safeguardthe environment which would make a better production basefor the local entrepreneurs. It is in that light that I say I amparticularly happy that the much awaited, long overduelegislation in antidumpingto prevent dumping of lowquality goods - has now been introduced in this House.",

Shortly I will berevealing the figures, but from the statistics available to me,we have now exceeded by over 50 per cent in the first quarterof 2006 as against the first quarter of 2005, in terms ofinvestment flow. The Mahinda Chintana also envisages anindustrial base spread in Sri Lanka which we call theNipayum Sri Lanka Programme or the 300 factoryprogramme under the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka outof which we have now started construction of 20 factories in20 divisional secretariat divisions in our country. It is in thesame context that we are now activating new zones in thiscountry so that there is greater development in terms ofindustries. I am happy indeed there are now weal investorscompetent to invest substantial amounts of monies in foreignexchange in Sri Lanka which was not the case five years ago,which was not the case 10 years ago. There were investorswho took money from the banks and defaulted. Some wereforeign investors who went away from the country. KaboolLanka was one such example which has to be highlightedtoday on this Floor. For three years, Sir, we could not find aninvestor for Kabool Lanka at Thulhiriya because the Koreaninvestors defaulted in their bank commitments and went outof the country without any intimation or information or anynotification to the local authorities. What were we able todo? We were able to do nothing. Three thousand oddemployees lost their jobs. The countrys export earnings fromKabool Lanka in Thulhiriya dropped by over US Dollars 60million. The local activities that were generated at Tulhiriyabecame totally non - existent. People who were working inKabool Lanka at Thulhiriya had to end up in Alawwa bazaaror Alawwa town in the Kurunegala District I doing variouslabourers jobs far below the expected economic pursuits thatthey used to follow.

They made it a conditionthat when the PA and the JVP come into Government, thatwas on 2nd April, 2004, that they will abolish the WorldTrade Organization agreement, they will walk out of the FreeTrade Agreement and that they will ensure that the investmentsthat are in Sri Lanka will be protected, to hell with whathappens in the World Trade Organization. Today, it bearstestimony, after 25 months in Government, now they are doingthe very thing, that we basically did. So, is this not hypocrisy?But, still as the Opposition, if it is something good we willensure that we will support it and we will take it forward. But,what is it? When you are saying the World Trade Organizationis good in one aspect you must ensure that the conduciveclimate is there.

MPswho were standing on that side basically said if the UnitedNational Party comes this is what is going to happen andexactly the same thing that we proposed is what you aredoing now. Never mind. What is good is good and the peoplehave realized this. You can see how it is moving forward. Atthe World Trade Organization Cancun, Mexico we, small SriLanka was unable to fight against 216 countries. It was ourintention that we Project Sri Lanka as a shining star in theSouth Asian region and that was exactly what we did. TheUnited States of America was talking of the Free TradeAgreement with Sri Lanka. The Indian Free Trade Agreementwas booming even though it has now gone haywire. ThePakistan Free Trade Agreement is something we started. Wetalked with Singapore; we talked with Thailand. Why is itnot being pursued? That is what you have got to do. The SriLankan investors are always on a wait and see approach.When I was the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs,I was calling the Chambers and telling them to speak in onevoice - Forget thinking of what the Government wants. Thinkthat you are talking as one lot from the commerce; as thecaptains at the helm of commerce. But, they did not. Today,they are still waiting and seeing. So, if that is the case, if theSri Lankan investors are not investing in this country wemust bring investments into this country and that is why inorder to keep pace with the international trend and regulationsthese are necessary.

It hasto be an involvement, not of a department but of the Ministryitself. So please ensure that we have a special, a non-politicalCommittee to go into this and even if required, there shouldbe a Parliamentary Committee to go into this, and ensure thatwe get every single cent beak because normal businessmenare harassed. Look at the character assassination carried onthe Members of the United National Party and ourselves.Unnecessarily we were harassed. And today when the entireAuditor Generals Department is giving information, theyare absolutely unable to find even one cent that was defaulted.So at the end of the day it is proved that we have come toserve the people rather than serve ourselves. But there are ahandful of people who are serving themselves. So we mustensure that we eradicate that.",
