( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)I do not know. It is in rupees.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)But, Hon. Minister, you better check it. That is an untruth.

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)That is the Answer I have got.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)So, you better tell the officials to check; whether it is theCentral Bank or the Ministery of Finance, they are telling anuntruth.

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)Anyway, if you say that it is not correct, I will find out from theofficials and let you know.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) They are even leading you astray.

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)This is the Answer I have got.

( )(The Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne)In 2004, it is stated as Rs. 14 million or something likethat.

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)No, no, in 2004, it is Rs. 23,056 million.

( )(The Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne)How can that be? In 2005 it is an increase of how much? Afourfold increase!

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)That depends on the grants we received. You cannot askhow. This is how we got the grants.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Hon. Minister, I think on the Floor of the House it will bementioned - [Interruption.]

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)You cannot make a chart and say that it should not go up orgo down. You cannot say like that.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)That is precisely the case. It should be the basic grants thathave been - [Interruption.]

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)As and when we require money, they give us by way ofloans, grants, soft loans - [Interruption.]

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)No, the Question that is asked is the amount of grant, notaid.

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)What is your Question?

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)The amount of grant-aid received? That is the moneygiven free to the Government; not by way of loans.

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)

5 .That is grants.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)So, if it is Rs. 90 billion, then this House is being told onuntruth by the Minister of Finance and the Central Bank.

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)No, this is the Qnswer I have got. - [Interruption.]
