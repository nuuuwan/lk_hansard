. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

I wish to raise a Supplementary Question, Sir.

We had a meeting with His Excellency the President twodays ago, on the 16th morning, and raised with him thedifficulties being experienced by the people of Vakarai andKathiraveli as a result of no food having been sent theresince the 27th of last month. The President assured us, alongwith the President were his Secretary, Mr. Lalith Weeratungaand his Adviser, Mr. Basil Rajapaksa and, they assured usthat on that very day, on the 16th, sufficient food wouldbe sent. But no food was sent on the 16th. Yesterday, 10lorries had gone with food, but they were stopped aboutsix kilometres away from the Mankerny cheekpoint at aplace called Cobra Bridge or Navaladi and the lorries weresent back. The Government Agent and the AdditionalGovernment Agent had asked Brigadier Ratnayake, who isin that region as to why the lorries were sent back. BrigadierRatnayake had answered the Government Agent that nolorries would be permitted to take food to Vakarai anylonger and that no lorries should be sent to Vakarai andKathiraveli from Batticaloa area any longer. He had furthertold the Government Agent that the Army wants the peopleout of Vakarai and Kathiraveli, therefore, food cannot besent there.

This statement of Brigadier Ratnayake to the GovernmentAgent is in direct contravention of the assurance given tous by His Excellency the President, his Secretary and hisAdviser that food would be sent to Kathiraveli and Vakaraion the 16th itself. Food was not sent on the 16th. But onthe 17th food was sent. The lorries were returned; were sentback by the Army. Therefore, I want to know from the Hon.Minister whether His Excellency the Presidents directionsand the Presidents decisions have a relevance, an authorityin this country or whether it is the military who decideswhether the people of Vakarai and Kathiraveli shouldreceive food or not?

I would like to have an answer because I am told thatno food has gone from the 27th of last month. That isalmost three weeks and the people of Vakarai are starvingand there is going to be death by starvation in Vakarai andKathiraveli unless food is sent. People have no medicine.People have no supplies. There is a grave humanitariancrisis in Vakarai and Kathiraveli. Therefore, I want to knowthe Governments position in regard to this matter and asto whether His Excellency the Presidents assurance will becomplied with or not?

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)Sir, with regard to this matter. I contacted Mr. GotabhayaRajapaksa who is the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence,Public Security, Law and Order this morning. He undertookto look into this matter. I think by noon we will be able togive you a reply. [Interruption.]

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

People are starving. People are gong to die. [Interruption.]

( )(The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle)I will be able to get a reply from Mr. GotabhayaRajapaksa by noon.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Hon. Minister, I told you to table the Answer but if youcan, read out the Answers for (c) (i), (ii) and (iii) please.

QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE

ASSASSINATION OF HON. NADARAJAH RAVIRAJMEMBER OF PARLIAMENT

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)Mr. Speaker, I rise with your permission to raise a matter ofurgent public importance.

The Hon. Nadarajah Raviraj, Member of Parliament forthe Jaffna District of the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi wasbrutally killed on the morning of 10th November, while hewas travelling in his vehicle along Elvitigala Mawatha, aprominent public highway, within the City of Colombo.Mr. Shantha Lakshman Lokuwella, a security officer wasalso brutally killed along with Mr. Nadarajah Raviraj.

Information available would suggest that while one ofthe assailants stopped vehicular traffic on the road, yetanother assailant freely sprayed bullets from a T.56 Rifle atMr. Raviraj and his security officer. After the Killings wereexecuted with professional perfection, the killers fled fromthe scene of killing on a motor cycle.

Information available would suggest that securitypersonnel are on duty at several points along this highway,including the immediate vicinity.

Mr. Raviraj was a popular and prominent politicalpersonality, who endeared himself to all people, irrespectiveof ethnicity. The large number of people, who paid theirrespects to him both in Colombo and Jaffna, and thesponataneous demonstrations against his killing in Colombo,in the whole of the North-East and other parts of the country,particularly the up country areas, bear ample testimony tothis fact.

We, of the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi - Tamil NationalAlliance - have lost a valuable Colleague and a dear friend.

Mr. Raviraj was fearless and forthright in the expressionof his views. He actively participated in demonstrations andprotests against the continuance of the war, and againsthuman rights abuses. It was widely accepted that Mr. Ravirajwas not offensive to others in whatever he said or did.

Sir, Mr. Ravirajs killing has raised pertinent questions.Was Mr. Raviraj killed because of the views he held and forfreely expressing such views, both by word and deed? Wasthe motive for the killing, an effort to suppress such views,by silencing Mr. Raviraj, an ardent proponent of such views?If it be so, was Mr. Ravirajs killing in pursuance of aconspiracy? If so, who were the conspirators? All rightthinking people would very much want an answer.

Current reports of the investigations into the killing donot inspire confidence. Previous experiences have beendismal. We consider it necessary that this matter be raised inthe House. The country and the world at large should knowthe truth.

Thank you, Sir.

Sir, I would like to respond to the statement made by theChief Government Whip. We have no definite confirmationthat ten lorries with food supplies have left Batticaloa asyet. According to the Chief Government Whip, the DefenceSecretary has instructed the Government Agent, Batticaloato send ten lorries. But the Defence Secretary has not givensuch instructions to Brigadier Ratnayake who is in chargeof the Mankerny checkpoint and that road, to permit thelorries to go. When we met the President two days ago thePresident assured us that food would go on that day. Thatwas on Thursday. But the food did not go. When ten lorrieswent yesterday they were sent back by Brigadier Ratnayakeat a place called Navaladi about six kilometers towardsBatticaloa before Mankerny. Therefore, there is no guaranteewhatever that the lorries will reach Vakarai and Kathiravelieven today. People are starving. People are on the verge ofdeath. The lorries have still not left Batticaloa. There is noguarantee that even these ten lorries will leave Batticaloaand reach Vakarai and Kathiraveli today crossing theMankerny checkpoint and the other point at which theywere stopped yesterday, Navaladi. We cannot take thislightly because even after the Presidents assurance onThursday that food will go, food did not go. So we must besure that food will go and that our people will not starve.Until that position is reached, I am sorry we cannot act onverbal assurances.

( )( [ - , )(The Hon. Dew Gunasekara Minister of Constitutional Affairsand National Integration)Mr. Speaker, at the outset, may I express my thanks,satisfaction and appreciation to His Excellency thePresident, Hon. Minister of Finance for the introductionof the Budget for 2007. It was a professional task underdifficult circumstances.

Mr. Speaker, to be exact and precise, I wish to describethis Budget as a pro-people and a pro-development Budgetwith burdens to none, relief to the needy and satisfactionto all. Its philosophy was based on Maninda Chintana,disregarding IMF or World Bank prescriptions.

Mr. Speaker, you would recall that the LTTE leaderPrabhakaran, on the day that His Excellency the Presidentassumed office as President assured him of a time of oneyear for he believed him to be a pragmatic man. But whathappened? Not even ten days were given and before HisExcellency the President could present his maiden Budgetfor 2006 Prabhakaran recommenced violence anddemonstrated his belligerence and intransigence once again.

You would remember that the Budget for 2005commenced with an unprecedented catastrophe - the tsunamidisaster. Yet we recovered from it faster than we expectedrestoring our economic fundamentals and placing them wellunder control.

Mr. Speaker, the Budget for the year 2006 had to becommenced with a man-made disaster - the LTTE violence.Yet, Mr. Speaker, the operation of the Budget for 2006 isbeing completed with economic fundamentals being trulysustained and with a GDP of 7 per cent plus, for the firsttime since the open economy and in fact sinceIndependence.

Before I move on to my analysis of the Budget for theyear 2007, let me start from the performance of the Budgetfor the year 2006. As compared with the Budget for theyear 2005, the performance in 2006 has been spectacularmuch to the disappointment of the predictions by theeconomic pundits of the Opposition.

Mr. Speaker, here are some statistical indicators:

20052006

There was an increase in growth in the three main sectorsof the economy which are agriculture, industries andservices.

Mr. Speaker, it is necessary to comprehend the background- the international trends and developments - in which theBudget for 2006 operated and the Budget for 2007 isexpected to operate. I drew the attention of the hon.Members last year to the realities of the changing worldsuch as the emerging multi-polarity of the world, the on-going changes in the world balance of forces, resurgenceof the Asia-Pacific region as an engine of the globaleconomy and emergence of two potential economic giants- China and India.

Mr. Speaker, by the year 2015 the GDP of Asia wouldrise up to 45 per cent of the world GDP. The GDP of Asia,Africa, Latin America and Russia would be in the region of63 per cent of the world GDP as against the combined GDPof 37 per cent for US and Europe, once the glorious empires.

Mr. Speaker, you would witness a polarization takingplace in the world in spite of globalization. This is themain reason why a global war on terror is being leashedout. It is nothing but a pretext as a necessary contrivanceto defend neo-liberalism and prevent a change in the worldbalance of forces. In order to justify the Western powersforeign policy of pre-emption and defence policy ofunilateralism, they use the global war on terror only asa pretext. It is for fear of polarization which is inevitableunder neo-liberalism.

Mr. Speaker, the concept of neo-liberalism in the guiseof globalization, which was first tried and tested in LatinAmerica, is being rejected by country after country. Inaddition to Cuba, country after country is opting out for

439440

[ ]alternatives to neo-liberalism - Venezuela, Brazil,Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Ecuador, Bolivia and nowNicaragua. There was a narrow escape in Mexico. Themain lesson to be drawn from Latin America is that underneo-liberalism the economic development did notaccompany human development. It was essentially a newversion of neo-colonization under globalization. Whatthese countries are trying to achieve is not socialistsocieties, even though they are profoundly inspired by Cuba.Their philosophy is planning cum market, not subservientto the dictates of IMF and World Bank or transitionalcorporations.

Mr. Speaker, the world economy is in good shape with a5 per cent growth but the most unjust, unequal world orderhitherto unknown in history is being created - the world ofpoverty, insecurity and inequality brought about by neo-liberalism through unbridled globalization. This is todaythe most formidable challenge facing the human society.

It is in this context of development that the UnitedNations launched its project of Millennium DevelopmentGoals (MDGs) in the year 2000, whereby it was expectedby the year 2015 to achieve a reduction of poverty by half,education to all and a world with no fear of diseases.

Mr. Speaker, however, all three pillars of development,namely; development assistance, international trade andsecurity have crumbled, the peoples aspirations beingfrustrated.

Mr. Speaker, today we witness through the prism ofthe United Nations itself a potential danger of a worldeconomically volatile, politically unstable and morallyinsecure. As a reaction to this, independent, sovereign andrealistic approaches are being explored by new emergingcountries as alternatives for neo-liberalism.

What are the lessons that we should draw from theseinternational developments? It is necessary to shape thecharacter of economic growth. Experience has shown thatgrowth can translate into higher levels of humandevelopment. Here, much depends on the nature of growth.They are not attempting to go back to closed economies.

The relationship between growth and humandevelopment is dynamic. Economic growth provides theresources to permit sustained improvements in humandevelopment. On the other hand, human developmentimprovements raise peoples capacities to boost economicgrowth. There should be a proper balance between economicgrowth and human development. It is not economic growthor human development.

This is precisely the difference between MahindaChintana and Ranils Chintana. It is the role of the Stateas well as the role of the market and not the market alone.It is not spending regardless, no matter from where the

resources come. Subsidies are necessary not as a permanentfeature but as a temporary measure to give relief to the poor,the disadvantaged. I believe in this context the Samurdhiprogramme needs careful review to be more realistic,pragmatic and scientific.

Mr. Speaker, if human development is prioritized, thensuch a strategy will run into fiscal constraints and balanceof payments crises. Similarly, growth first strategy can alsorun into political instability and social crises.

Mr. Speaker, this is why the Government uses the Budgetas an instrument to ensure a balanced growth - growth withhuman development. This is the hallmark of PresidentMahinda Rajapaksas two Budgets. This is precisely thedifference between the Mahinda Chintana and RanilsPeoples Agenda or Regaining Sri Lanka. This is thestriking contrast between Mahinda and Choksy as Ministersof Finance.

The correct strategy in this era of globalization demands, planning cum market, growth as well as equity,economic development along with human developmentand private sector together with public sector.

This was why Regaining Sri Lanka witnessed a joblessgrowth in the years 2002 and 2003. This jobless growth isa phenomenon that we witnessed throughout the world underneo-liberalism. In fact, we have our own experiences inSri Lanka since 1977, since the dawn of neo-liberalism.

This is why, Mr. Speaker, we of the Communist Party ofSri Lanka, reiterate the imperative need for reorientationof our foreign policy, the need for new economic co-operations and new economic relations, need for regionalco-operations, having regard not only to geo-politics butalso geo-economics.

The main focus of this Budget is infrastructuredevelopment in three main areas of the economy hithertoneglected. That is, regional development, SME sector andrural economy. This is what was absent in the previousBudgets. From the point of economic development, theseare the most salutary features of Mahinda Chintana in myview.

Mr. Speaker, if you take the Ten Year HorizonDevelopment Framework 2006-2016, this year, the Budgethas been formulated on the basis of a three year mediumterm strategy which will lay the foundation for a ten yeardevelopment effort. That will generate an annual growthrate of eight per cent. That is to raise the per capita incomelevel three fold, from Dollars 1000 to Dollars 3000. At firstglance it may look unrealizable. Let us debate this. It isopen to debate.

Mr. Speaker, future development prospects of this countryrest on four pillars. Those are, human resources,infrastructure, private sector and public sector. The fourpillars must be grounded on terra firma. That is peace,democracy and the rule of law, which are interrelated.

2006 18441442

Mr. Speaker, it is my firm conviction that it is the politicalculture which has prevented us from finding a solution. Letus consider what the Tamil people need and not what theLTTE demands, and seek a solution.

Secondly, with the present state of affairs in the publicservice - corruption, inefficiency, lethargy and negativeattitudes - and unless the Administrative ReformsCommission awakes from slumber, you will not be able toimplement Mahinda Chintana.

I have already spoken to the President in clear terms.Now I tell openly that this Commission appears to bestillborn. I recommend the Budget proposals to the House.I offer a bouquet to Dr. P.B. Jayasundara, Mr. Nivard Cabraaland other officials of the Treasury. It is a sterling effortmade under difficult circumstances and Sir, it is a herculeantask that has been performed well.

Thank you.

There should be open tenders with competitive biddingand though this has been accepted by the Cabinet, I amsorry to say, that this is not strictly observed.

, , .

. , . . . .

Exporters do not remit all their profits and also they donot do it quickly. As a result the Government loses. Thisis leading to a considerable loss of foreign exchange to theGovernment and the delay in getting that money back iscreating a situation in which had that money - the dollars,the pounds, the foreign currency - come here in time thenour foreign currency reserves would improve and thepressure on the rupee will diminish and we will be able tohave a far better exchange rate in relation to the Dollar. Soit is very important that this also be implemented properlyif we are to bring down the cost of living.

From the point of view of increasing productivity Scienceand Technology occupies a key place. The contribution ofScience and Technology, I am sorry to say, is not yetadequately appreciated in our country.

I am glad that His Excellency the President supported theNational Science Week when we tried our best to get themessage across that scientists and technologists should berecognized. There was a very successful award ceremonywhere scientists who produced technologies or did researchthat culminated in technologies were recognized by thePresident and by the country. Now this will help to changethe mindset of the scientists so that they will be able todevote their efforts to generating the technology that weneed to develop our economy.

In this connection, there are two valuable proposals thathave been included in the Budget Proposals. One is, thedevelopment of nanotechnology. While appreciating thatmove, where the National Research Council has beensuggested as the organization that should be handling this,I would like to mention that the National ScienceFoundation and the Ministry of Science and Technologyhave been working together last year setting up theframework for developing the Nanotechnology Centre in thiscountry. The importance of this emerging technology isbecoming evident daily. It is going to have an impact onall industries. It is going to give a new impetus to usingraw materials to develop new industry and in this context,we must not make the mistakes that we made in the past.When electronics developed, countries of East Asia cashedin on that and developed industries which took theireconomies ahead. When bio-technology developed therewere countries like India which cashed in and went ahead

2006 18509510

also with communication technology. Cuba, despite the factthat it had an embargo and various problems took to bio-technology, invested in bio-technology and today, theyhave become one of the leaders in bio-technology not onlyin the west but even throughout the world. Now the positionis that biotechnology is the number two foreign exchangeearner for Cuba. Sri Lanka lags behind. We did not developthe scientific capability for this and in this situation we failedto take advantage and build the industries that would havetaken our economy forward. But, now with nanotechnologythis opportunity is before us. There are brilliant Sri Lankanscientists who are world leaders in nanotechnology and whoare prepared to help us. Therefore, I think, if the NationalScience Foundation is given the leading place in takingthis technology forward we will be able to become a leaderin this field to develop industries based on this technologyand help our economy.

The other point I would like to mention is the very goodproposal to create a Science and Technology Research andDevelopment Cluster and this Cluster is to promote researchand development with Rs. 2 billion allocated to the variousresearch and development institutions in the differentministries. Here again, this has been put in charge of theNational Research Council. I think that the organizationsthat are already evaluating and monitoring theperformances of these organizations and interacting withthem are the National Science and Technology Commissionwhich comes under my Ministry and the National ScienceFoundation. I think they should be a part of this process ifyou want it to be successfully done. So, while saying thisI must say that the Mahinda Chintana was geared towardsspending 1 per cent of the GDP for science and technologyresearch and development.

( )(The Deputy Speaker) , . 5.00.

( () )(The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana) -

( )(The Deputy Speaker) .

( () )(The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana)Therefore, instead of limiting this to 0.17 per cent of theGDP, I would appeal that this should be increased to at leastdouble that amount if we are to start progressing anddeveloping our economy. I hope that that will be done in thenear future.

Thank you very much.
