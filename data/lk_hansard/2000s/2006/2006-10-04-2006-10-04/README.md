( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member for giving me sometime to speak in this important Debate. I am so happy tofollow our Deputy Leader, the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya, who hashands-on experience in what he handled. I must say thatduring his tenure of office, a loss-making institution w asconverted into a profit-making institution and was able toshow that there is an opportunity for exploration of oil in thiscountry.

, , . 1976 . . . , . , 2004 24 .

, . . . , . . .

, . - - , .Hon. Minister, this is the reason why there was an enactmentof Parliament under which nobody at his whims and fanciescould give blocks to anybody. Today what we are faced withis something[Interruption.] Sorry, sir?

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

This is government to government.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Even government to government cannot do it on thisparticular basis.

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

According to the Ordinance, you need not call for tenders.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Hon. Minister, government to government means nothingtoday. The biggest rogues and racketeers handle these. EveryGovernment says that it is having a dead with China on agovernment to government basis. There is no government togovernment activity that is going on in China. When yousay you are dealing with firearms, with Norinco ArmsportsCompany Limited, you are dealing with the most privatesector oriented company in China. So, this government togovernment is nothing because India will give it to RelianceEnergy Limited to provide and it does not exclude the fearsthat are there.

I know you are a Minister who works hard. That is why youare being hit. We worked, we got hit. You work, you get hit.We are there to support you all. No maniacs or politicallockeys can try to do that.

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)This has been already accepted.

22452246

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)This is accepted, but still the manner in which it was doneis not accepted. I will come to that, but now that you asked,there are eight or ten blocks that could be given for oilexploration. When you give one or two blocks for exploration,whethere it is to China, to America, to Cuba or North Korea,the valuation of the rest of the blocks falls to zero. That is theproblem. According to the maximum internationallypermissible and acceptable area of territorial waters of SriLanka, we can break it up to ten blocks. So, when youarbitrartily give China one block and India another, thevaluation of the rest of the seven or eight blocks becomenothing, Hon. Minister.

I am happy that the former Minister is here, the presentMinister is here and the Minister who brought the enactment,the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya is here. My good Friend, the Hon.Vijitha Herath is here and I am sure he will speak after me.But his political party is a party that makes a noise out ofnothing. They will try to show that Sri Lanka has a bigger oilreserve than even in Saudi Arabia.

. , , . , Ceasefire Agreement .

Sir, on the 13th of February, 2002 the Hon. Karu Jayasuriyaallowed the then Chairman, Mr. Daham Wimalasena, who is aperson of impeccable credibility, to sign the document. Helooked at the benefits that were there. Also we werer not agovernment which tried to undo everything that was doneby the previous Government. So, on the 13th of February,2002, when the then Chairman, Mr. Daham Wimalasena signedan exclusive agreement with the then General Manager ofTGS-NOPEC, it was only a continuation of the good workthat he thought that was done by the previous Government,the Peoples Alliance.

Under the Heads of Agreement which was signed on the21st of May 2001, they had ratified a certain agreement. Mr.Daham Wimalasena personally told me. Ravi, this is a gooddeal. So, we basically pursued on that. There is no point inundoing this. Just because the UNP Government has come topower we do not need to reinvent the wheel. So that was thebasis and he re-clarified that with the Hon. Minister and thethen Cabinet and it was proceeded with. So, there was noulterior motive in this. They try to show a link the betweenthe Ceasefire Agreement being signed on ht 22nd of February,2002 and this being signed on the 13th of February, 2002.So, I think this mischievous element

, , . . . _ . 1971, 1988-89 , , . ? , . .

_

This is what is important. So, on the 13th of February, 2002they signed the agreement and went forward. Thereafter, therehave been many discussions going on. The executedagreement signed by Mr. Paul A. Gilleran of TGS-NOPEC

2006 0422472248

and the then Chairman, Daham Wimalasena was a step in theright direction because it was only for non-exclusive seismicinformation. That was being looked at that way because,obviously as the Deputy Leader of our Party, the Hon. KaruJayasuriya who was the line Minister at that time mentioned,that we, the Government of Sri Lanka was looking at this as afortuitous opportunity. There may be an opportunity or theremay not be. So why should we put our money on somethingwhich we specifically do not know? So the agreement thatthe TGS-NOPEC signed was on a win-win basis. May be itwould cost us roughly US Dollars seven eight or ninemillion. I do not know. I am not privy to that information. [Interruption.] I heard it is US Dollars five million or whateverit is. So there was an agreement; up until US Dollars 10 millionlet us basically do that, after that let us have a profit sharingagreement. So on that particular basis Hon. Minister, non-exclusive seismic information which is of 2 D knowledge, Iam made to understand, has limited validity. It can be inbroad prospect, Yes, there is some oil, somewhere. That isall that can be looked at. So on that particular basis, I still donot understand Hon. Minister as to why you have looked attrying to buy this information because it can be valueless. Tobe very frank, the SEMA information that came contradictoryto the good Cabinet Paper that you submitted, I think, iscorrect to a certain extent. I think, you have taken the correctstep. I am talking of the first Cabinet Paper which was dated27th June, 2006. So what SEMA has basically said was correctto a certain extent because my feeling is this is valulessinformation. If by any chance there is oil that has been locatedby now, I am sure there are many others that would havecome running to you and have said, Please give it to us atany cost.

I think, your Secretary is a person who works with all thezeal. I am sure that he is, because he came before the COPEand said certain things. But I think there is too much of zealin that because to pay 100 million Dollars on a possibility,on an expected revenue

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)US Dollars 10 million.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)No, US dollars 10 million is on a block. You will give twoten million blocks. That is what is being mentioned. In yourCabinet Paper of 17th June, you say that two blocks of USDollars 10 million each will be given to China and India andsubsequently you are looking at a US Dollars 100 milliondeposit on a cash flow that is to be collected in advance. Nowthat is something very futuristic, Hon. Minister. This is a hitor miss deal. This is like a lottery . Now you are trying yourluck. It is well and good if you try your luck. But the personwho is coming also is not an idiot. He also is not coming forthe love of the Hon. Fowzie or for the love of Mahinda

Chintana or for Sri Lanka. He is also coming to make somemoney out of that. [Interruption.] Absolutely correct. Ifthey do not give they will not get, which means that you willnever get somebody. Then it goes back to competitive bids.Now we have no problem with that at all.

The Hon Karu Jayasuriya, when this came before theCabinet at that time, said, Look, it may be me today, it maybe somebody tomorrow. But let me not tie Sri Lanka down toanybody. Let it be on competitive bids so that nobody canever say that we tried to give this to somebody at a particularmoment. So, Hon. Minister, my feeling is that the correctstep has to be taken. The Hon. Karu Jayasuriya said this devoidof politics. I am sure, you are doing this in the same spirit.That is why you are having a problem at the moment. TheJanatha Vimukthi Peramuna says, You cannot do this. Youare a mad Minister for a simple reason. They said that wewere also mad. , . . . . . , . . , , . , . 1976 , . . 2004 . . . . , , plug , , plug . . . [ ] ,

There is no point paying TGS-NOPEC all this money toget that rubbishy information. It is outdated. My informationis that collecting this non-exclusive seismic data is valueless.This is something you know. Hon. Fowzie, with yourexperience, you will be able to touch and see whether there isoil in this area. After all, you are also a Muslim, you know theEast and the Middle-Eastern area - . . . . . . .So, going on that basis, Hon. Minister, all I could basicallyask is, ensure that you do not reinvent the wheel. There aregood officers who have been there. I do not understand as towhy an institution like the Petroleum Corporation is making

22492250

[ ]losses today. It is simply because of the unions in that place.The management came before the COPE and I was so surprisedthat the Directors there said, We are sorry. We cannot make astraight decision because it is the unions that basically createall the problems there. I am sure with all confidence we cansay that the Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya of the United NationalParty will never interfere in this type of actions that are there.The Hon. Gamini Lokuge is there. The Hon. Rajtha Senaratneis there. They will ensure that it will never happen.Unfortunately we blamed them for not doing politics out ofthis. But still that is the responsibility that we have as anOpposition. Unlike that, when we were in Government, whata mess the Sri Lanka Nidahas Pakshaya Union and the JVPcreated ? That is the difference in culture that we have. Soensure that you work together.

( + )(The Presiding Member)

Hon. Member, You have two minutes more.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

So on that particular basis, please do not try to hide behindthinking that a government to government agreement isgood. There can be many holes there. If you give two blockson a unilateral basis to India and China or to Cuba and NorthKorea or to anybody you want, the valuation for the rest ofthe other seven or eight blocks will be next to nothing. It willgo down. Nobody will pay. Hon. Minister, because we asbusinessmen know it. All you have got to do is that, if youare giving one even, ensure it is based on competitive bids.At the same time say, okay, India and America or India andChina could get preference out of these two blocks. That is adifferent matter. But ensure all are given at the same time,otherwise we lose an opportunity.

Remember today, the oil prices which were at US Dollars65-66 has gone down to US Dollars 62 a barrel. I am made tounderstand that it will revolve around this US Dollars 60 - 65level. But the cost of excavation or exploration of oil at leastcost US Dollars 45 to 50 a barrel. So if the oil prices are on adownward trend nobody will come forward. Do not committhis country to something which you cannot get an advantageout of just because some maniacs shout. Forget about them.We are there. If they are trying to pressurize you, we are thereto support you. As a matter of fact, today, your own partnersare more a hindrance than being of any use to you. We as theOpposition are more helpful to you than being a hindrance.That is the difference. . . , , ? . . . . , 1948 . . . ,

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)Hon. Deputy Speaker, I thank all the Members for theirvaluable contributions. It is the duty of His Excellency thePresident, the Government and the Opposition to use all theresources to exploit the possibility of extracting oil and gasas quickly as possible in order to build up the economy ofthis country. This is a national issue. I thank the formerPresident Chandrika Bandaranaike for initiating action inthis regard in the year 2001. During that period the thenChairman of the CPC, Mr. Anil Obeyesekere signed anagreement on 21st May, 2001 with TGS - NOPEC. Thereafter,Mr. Daham Wimalasena signed another non - exclusiveagreement on 13th February, 2002. The mandate of theagreement is to conduct seismic surveys to explore theprospects of petroleum resources in the territorial watersincluding the Exclusive Economic Zone of Sri Lanka.

[ ]There are three objectives of the Agreement. They are asfollows :

1. To mandate TGS - NOPEC to conduct seismic surveyson behalf of the CPC to explore petroleum resourcesin the entire territorial waters.

2. To empower both parties to share the income earnedby selling seismic data.

3. To assign the right of selling non - exclusive seismicdata with TGS - NOPEC on behalf of the CPCcomplying with the phases of the Agreement.

After signing this Agreement, Petroleum Resources Act,No.266 of 2003 was passed in Parliament in order tostreamline the exploration of petroleum resources in SriLanka. Thereafter, activities in connection with theexploration of petroleum resources in Sri Lanka that werecarried out by the CPC have been assigned to PetroleumResources Development Committee and PetroleumResources Development Secretariat. Accordingly, these twoorganizations have been made responsible for theimplementation of the activities connected with prospectingfor oil and gas in offshore areas off the west coast ofSri Lanka.

Now, I have to work according to the Agreement that hasbeen signed. TGS - NOPEC has violated its conditions. Oneof the conditions they have violated is that they have notsupplied the data within the specific period. The second oneis not giving us our royalty. Therefore, we decided to cancelthe Agreement without destroying our image in theinternational community. You cannot simply cancelagreement the way somebody wants it to be done. Oilexploration is timely and it is very important to Sri Lanka foraccelerated economic growth. In South East Asia, othercountries are moving ahead of us discovering oil or gas. It isprobably the only way that we can move Sri Lanka forward.We have talked about oil exploration from the 1950s. Butnothing has happened yet. If we conduct explorations nowand discover oil, We may even be ahead of our neighbours.An agreement is a two - sided document and connot beviolated by one party. My Secretary and the Director - Generalwent to Perth to find a way to go forward with oil explorationbecause a court settlement or arbitration will take many years.Currently, Sri Lanka is paying US Dollars one billion for oilimports. It is very important that we search for oil and gasfields in the Sri Lankan offshore area. Any discovery willaccelerate the economic growth and the development of thecountry. This is why I am trying to expedite it.

TGS - NOPEC has invested US Dollars 5.5 million to getthe data. They, as an international company, have taken aconsiderable risk in spending this money to collect data.They expect an adequate return for their investment. Theirtarget is another US Dollars five million as return on theirinvestment. In addition, by cancelling the Agreement TGS -NOPEC will no longer have any exclusive rights to collect

22692270

2006 04

2D and 3D seismic data offshore Sri Lanka and they will losetheir chance to collect additional revenue further through2D and 3D seismic survey. Therefore, they will also lose therevenue expected by selling the data already collected untilthe year 2012. So, I simply cannot cancel the Agreement. Iwould like to ask the Hon. Vijitha Herath, now if we are goingto cancel the Agreement, do you suggest that no compensationshould be paid?

( )(The Hon. Vijitha Herath)

I think that we need not pay.

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

Yes, I also can take up that position that we need not pay.But when we go to court and when the arbitration takes place,it will take more than 15years to finalize this. We will bepostponing this exploration for another 10 - 15 years.

( )(The Hon. Vijitha Herath)

Hon. Minister, they have already violated the Agreement.

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

They have violated it, all right. We say that they are theonly people who have violated it. Just because they haveviolated it, can we cancel the agreement? What is theviolation? That is, not giving the data on time.

( )(The Hon. Vijitha Herath)

Yes.

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

And not giving 5 per cent to us. These are two matters.

( )(The Hon. Vijitha Herath)

They have not paid the first instalment.

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

But, does that warrant the cancellation of the Agreement?That is the first issue. All right. Secondly, what happens? Wecancel the Agreement, will we get the data? They will notgive the data. They will say, Go to hell. You give us money.

Otherwise, we will not give the data. Then, we have to go tocourt. This is why I sent my Director - General and the Secretaryto negotiate with them. The only area they have alreadysurveyed is the Mannar Basin including the Cauvery Basinand we wanted to tell them, You better go ahead with that.We will do the balance.

( )(The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella)That settlement is good.

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

Yes. It is a very good settlement that I proposed. Up to nowwe have not spent a cent even.Without spending a cent wewanted this TGS - NOPEC to go ahead. So, I submitted aCabinet paper expecting the Cabinet to give me the blessings.But, unfortunately, due to various parties interfering in this,they got the Cabinet not to agree to it. So, it was decided thatwe give a block to India and a block to China on nomination.Not only on nominations, but we are also getting a signaturebonus of US Dollars 10 million each and also US Dollars 100million as a deposit. Government to government you cansell this. According to the law also you need not call fortenders.We can even call for applications. But that is not thesolution. What we were trying to do was to build up oureconomy. We thought that this was the best and the quickestway that we could do it. Otherwise, you have to sell the data.Then, you have to go for the 3D survey. Then, you have to gofor bidding. All these things will take time. I had prepared aschedule by which by now I would have called for tenders.

( )(The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella)We went through your settlement in the COPE. Thatsettlement is very good.

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

Yes. But, Unfortunately I was told to cancel the Agreement.So, to cancel the Agreement, we appointed the CANC andgot legal opinion also. They have now decided to cancel theAgreement on the condition that we pay US Dollars 10.5million. Out of the US Dollars 10.5million, US Dollars 2million that they have already collected by sale of the datawill be deducted. Then, we have to pay US Dollars 8.5 million.So, that is the recommendation that is going before theCabinet this evening and I hope that will be gone throughbecause His Excellency the President himself said, You haveto pay compensation. We connot simply say, Go, fly a kite.I mean, a lot of money has been spent and just because theyhave violated some conditions, you cannot tell them that weare not going to pay. Then they will also say, Okay, we are

22712272

not going to give you the data. So, where do we stand?Without the data can we proceed? Can we sell the data withouthaving it with us? So, this is the situation that we have tothink about. Just because of these disputes we are having weshould not oppose TGS - NOPEC like that. We must also bepractical in these matters.

We do not have professionals in the PRDS. Already I haveprepared the papers and we are creating 20 positions in thisfields including lawyers, economists, geologists andgeophysicists. This cadre has been approved but, the salarieset cetera have not been approved yet. So, once that is approveswe will appoint these officers.

It is not an easy task. Oil exploration needs massiveinvestment. To do the 3D seismic survey, having taken itover from TGS - NOPEC, we will have to find money. Even tofind US Dollars 10 million is not an easy task. That is thecompensation that we are going to pay. But, the view of mostpeople is, You cancel it. Do not pay anything Some peoplesay, You cancel it. Pay US Dollars 10 million. So, I ambetween the devil and the deep blue sea. But, we must bepractical in these matters.

Not only the money but also we do not have the technology.We can simply cancel it but then we will be blamedinternationally. Nobody will come to invest in this country.No one will accept Sri Lanka as a genuine country to comeand invest.

( )(The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella)

They will think that this is not a trustworthy country.

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

Yes, they will think that this is not a trustworthy country.So, we have to be very careful. We cannot do this just becausesome people want this to be cancelled.

The Cabinet paper that I submitted will be taken up today.The following recommendations are there in that.

The first one is, to pay US Dollars 8.5 million to TGS -NOPEC in addition to the US Dollars 2 million earned byselling Mannar Basin seismic data to acquire by PRDC, allthe Mannar Basin seismic data held by that company, and tocancel all agreements signed by TGS - NOPEC with theCeylon Petroleum Corporation.

, . 10.5 - data - . 2 8.5 .

[ . . . ]The second one is, to obtain information on similarcompanies in order to call for tenders and to select a suitablecompany and to sign an agreement to carry out secure storage,studying and copying et cetera on payment.

The third one is, to appoint staff to the PRDS and sendappropriate officials to foreign countries to obtain broadtraining for seismic data studies, evaluation and copying.

The fourth one is, to appoint a committee to hold discussionwith India and China about conditions with respect to givingexploration blocks in the Mannar Basin to these twocountries.

The fifth one is, to provide from the Government of SriLanka Treasury the financial provisions and foreign exchangerequired to carry out the above tasks.
