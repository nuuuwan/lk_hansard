IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE DEMOCRATICSOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA

HIGH COURT OF THE PROVINCES (SPECIALPROVISIONS) (Amemdment) Bill

S. C. (SD) 12/2006

BEFORE :Sarath N SilvaChief JusticeN. E. DissanayakeJudge of the Supreme CourtA. M. SomawansaJudge of the Supreme Court

COUNSEL : P. A. Ratnayake, P. C., Addl. Solicitor General withMs Anusha Navaratne, Deputy Solicitor General forthe Attorney General

Court assembled for hearing on 20th November, 2006 at10.30 a.m.

The Bill to amend the High Court of the Provinces (SpecialProvisions) Act, No. 19 of 1990 bears the endorsement of the Secretaryto the Cabinet of Ministers in terms of Article 122(1) (b) of theConstitution that it is urgent in the national interest. The Presidenthas in terms of Article 122(1)(b) made a written reference to thisCourt requiring a special determination as to the constitutionality ofthe Bill.

Addl. Solicitor General who assisted the Court in examining itsconstitutionality submitted that the background to the Bill is the largebacklog of civil appeals now pending in the Court of Appeal. Hesubmitted that as at 31.12.2005, there was a backlog of 13,345 appealsfrom judgements and orders of the District Courts. Some of themhave been pending for the past 11 years. As an example he submittedthat whereas 1792 appeals were filed in the Court of Appeal in theyear 2004, according to the statistics available only 396 appeals havebeen concluded within the year. On the basis of these statistics hesubmitted that the delay in the Court of Appeal would increase by alarge measure and that appeals now filed would be heard and disposedof only in the years 2013-2015. It is obvious that the situationsubmitted by the Addl. Solicitor General would seriously erode publicconfidence in our system of administration of justice. It is in thesecircumstances that the Cabinet of Ministers has rightly certified theBill to be urgent in the national interest.

The Court of Appeal was established by the present Constitutionand it took over the back-log of cases then pending in the SupremeCourt. Thus the Court inherited a back-log of cases. With theincrease in litigation the back-log increased tremendously. From timeto time legislative measures have been taken to transfer the appellatejurisdiction of the Court of Appeal in respect of specific matters tothe Provincial High Court.

Accordingly, the 13th Amendment to the Constitution in Article154P vested the appellate jurisdiction in respect of convictions andorders of the Magistrates Court and Primary Court in the ProvincialHigh Court.

Article 154P(4) vested a writ jurisdiction (writs of Heabus corpus,Certiorari, Mandamus and the like) ordinarily exercised by the Courtof Appeal in the Provincial High Court, in respect of specific matters.This was followed by the High Court (Special Provisions) Act, No.19 of 1990, which vested in the High Court the Appellate jurisdictionin respect of orders of the Labour Tribunal and orders made in termsof certain provisions of the Agrarian Services Act, (Section 3). Thesemeasures contributed greatly to reduce the backlog of appeals in respectof Magistrates Courts, Labour Tribunals and Agrarian Services matters.

The present Amendment is a continuance of that trend and theProvincial High Court is now vested with the appellate and revisionaryjurisdiction in respect of judgments, orders and proceedings of theDistrict Court, within the Province (Vide: Clause 5A(1),

The only possible issue of constitutionality is whether the jurisdictionpresently exercised by the Court of Appeal could concurrently bevested in the Provincial High Court. In this regard the Addl. SolicitorGeneral submitted that this Court has already dealt with the questionin the case of Swastika Textile Industries Ltd., vs. Thanthrige Dayaratne(1993) 2 SLR 348. At page 353 the Court held that the provisionsof Article 111(1) and 138 of the Constitution enabled Parliament byordinary law to transfer and existing jurisdiction of the Court of Appealunder Article 138 to the High Court. The Court also relied on Article154P(3)(c) of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution which statesthat the Provincial High Court shall exercise such other jurisdictionand powers as Parliament may by law provide. Accordingly this Courtdetermined in the Swastika Textile Industries case that the vesting ofa concurrent appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in the High Courtis beyond argument.

675676

It is to be further noted that under the proposed Amendment thejurisdiction in respect of judgments, orders and proceedings of theDistrict Courts has to be exercised by not less than two Judges of theProvincial High Court sitting together (Clause 5B)

As regards pending appeals Clause 5D(2) empowers the Presidentof the Court of Appeal to issue directions from time to time thatsuch appeals stand removed to the Provincial High Court. Suchdirections may be made in reference to the year in which the appealswere filed in the Court of Appeal. These provisions in our view wouldcontribute to an expeditious disposal of the alarming backlog of casesnow pending in the Court of Appeal.

In addition to the expeditious disposal of civil appeals the proposedAmendment has the further virtue of taking the process ofadministering justice closer to the People. Persons from distant partsof the country would not have to travel to Colombo for their appealsin civil cases.

The Amendment is both timely and essential.

We make a determination in terms of Article 123(1) of theConstitution that neither the Bill nor any or its provisions areinconsistent with the Constitution.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTATNDINGBETWEENGOVERNMENT OF SRI LANKAANDASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANKFOR THEPROPOSED COLOMBO PORT EXPANSION PROJECT

1.INTRODUCTION

1.The Government of Sri Lanka (the Government) has requested theAsian Development Bank (ADB) for a loan of $225 million for theimplementation of the Colombo Port Expansion Project. The Colombo

Port Expansion Project will enable Colombo Port to retain itstransshipment hub port status for the South Asian region. This in turnwill bring economic benefits to the country. This Memorandum ofUnderstanding sets out the broad guiding principles that will be followedin processing the proposed Loan.

II.GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR PROCESSING THE SOUTHHARBOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT LOAN

(i)Project Concept

2.The overall Colombo Port Expansion Project has two inter-relatedcomponents. (i) the civil works component invoiving the dredging ofthe apporach channels and harbor basin, relocation of the submarineoil pipeline. construction of the breakwater. construction of ancilleryfacilities as well as the provision of navigational aids; and (ii) thecontainer terminal concession component which includes constructionof the cortainer termianl and procurement of associated handlingequipment. The project will be developed as on a public-privatepartnership basis. The SLPA will undertake the civil works componentfor which the Government will request ADB financing of approximately$225 million and arrange retroactive financing. The Government willselect the concessionaire for at least the first two terminal componentsthrough open competitive bidding. In this respect the Government willensure that an equity share will be reserved for the Sri Lanka PortAuthority. This will be reflected in the concession document. Thepercentage of equity to be so reserved will be finalized duringsubsequent ADB processing missions.

(ii)Economic and Financial Viability3.ADB and the Government will complete the assessment of theeconomic and financial viability of the project through missions thatADB will field starting September 2006. As the economic and financialviability of the project depends on both the public sector and privatesector components being impiemented, the Government and ADB agreeof the need for linkages between the two components. The details willbe finalized during subsequent ADB processing missions.

(iii)Improving the Effciency and Operating Environmentof Colombo Port.

4.The implementation of the Colombo Port Expansion Project willhelp to increase the capacity of Colombo Port. However, capacityimprovement will need to be supplemented with increased efficiencyof exiting facilities at Colombo Port. To this end the Government andADB will work on an action plan to increase the efficiency of existingfacilities of Colombo Port. The details of this action plan will be finalizedduring subsequent ADB processing missions. The Government andADB also agree that the operating environment for the ports sector willneed to assure existing and future terminal operators that competitionwill take place. In this respect an Advisory Committee will be establishedunder the chairmanship of the Secretary of Ports and Aviation to promotecompetition. For the processing of the proposed Loan, the Governmentand ADB will agree on interim measures that could be used pending theestablishment of such regulatory arrangement.

(iv)Procurement, Social and Environment Safeguards

5.All bidding for the civil works component will follow ADBProcurement Guidelines. ADB environment, resettlement and othersocial safeguard policies will be followed wherever applicable. Thedetails will be confirmed during subsequent ADB processing missions.

Mr. Speaker, now I would like to get to the main part of thespeech. As this august Assembly debates the second Budgetof the Mahinda Rajapaksa administration, we are also com-memorating the first anniversary of His Excellencys Presi-dency. In November last year, he was given a mandate forpeace and prosperity in Sri Lanka.

As envisioned in the manifesto, Mahinda ChintanaPresident Rajapaksa identified economic development as themost critical issue facing us today and has made it his numberone priority. His ascendancy to the presidency is a clearindication of the people of Sri Lanka choosing socialdemocracy as espoused in the Mahinda Chintana over theneo-liberal agenda pursued by his main opponent, Mr. RanilWickremasinghe at the last elections.

However, as we are all aware, the economic developmentin Sri Lanka is intrinsically entwined with a durable peace.There can be no sustainable development in Sri Lankawithout a permanent peace and a lasting solution to thenational question. Therefore, our Government has givenutmost priority to that. Hon. Kiriella, as you mentionedrightly, peace is essential and we are completely focused onseeking a negotiated settlement with the LTTE.

In his inaugural speech last year, President Rajapaksa statedthat, I quote, To achieve this noble goal my Governmentwill be ready to engage the LTTE in discussing a politicalsolution when the LTTE declares their readiness to resumenegotiations, which they unilaterally abandoned during theperiod of the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe. To this end, Ishall soon initiate consultations with all parties concernedas a matter of top priority with a view to building a consensus.My priority work in this area will include consultations withfriendly countries who have worked with us in the past inregard to the peace process. While these consultations areunder way, I reaffirm my Governments continuedcommitment to the ceasefire and my Governments readinessto review the operations of the ceasefire as soon as the LTTEis ready to do so in order to effectively enforce its provisionsespecially those relating to political killings, abductions,child soldiers and other human rights violations.

In pursuing this objective the President, as you mayremember, even offered to sit down with the LTTE, on the19th of November itself, when he made his address to the

2006 21745746

nation and offered to walk that extra mile for peace. Yet,what was Mr. Prabhakarans and the LTTEs response, despitethe Presidents sincere and genuine invitation to settle theconflict through negotiations? The LTTE was to unleash acampaign of violence and terror which up-to-date has takenthe lives of more than 1035 civilians and 1069 members ofthe armed forces.

In fact, I am not in the game of pointing fingers and tryingto score points with figures because we must all rememberwhoever dies, whether in the North or elsewhere they are allSri Lankans. Other than the soldiers, even those youthhowever misguided they are who are dying for the LTTE areSri Lankans. But yet, because Members like the Hon. Kiriellaseems to have forgotten the kind of challenges we have hadto face I would like to give you a breakdown of the deathswhich took place during the first year of President Rajapaksa.Throughout this period President Rajapaksa has shown anenormous amount of patience and restraint which franklyspeaking no other leader in the world would have shown. Iask you, Hon. Kiriella, in the face of such challenges wouldany other democratic leader be so patient for so long? Werecently saw this year how the kidnapping of two Israelisoldiers sparked off a terrible war which brought untoldsuffering to thousands of people on both sides of the divide.However, even after hundreds of military deaths the Presidenthas been wise enough to exercise restraint as he is well aware,as we all are, of the horror and the futility of war. In the faceof such continued provocations, suicide bombings, claymoremine attacks, assassinations, blatant human rights abuses,the Government was reluctantly compelled to defend itselffrom time to time especially since the suicide attack on theArmy Commander. But, military action in every one of theseinstances has been limited, as you know, in time and scopeand were carried out, I stress this Mr. Speaker, purely asdefensive measures. We never initiated any offensive againstthe LTTE during this period. The suicide bomb attack on theArmy Commander, the assassination of General Kulatunga,Kebithigollewa, Mavilaru, the truck bombing of a navalfleet of buses, attack on Galle Harbour are just a few atrocitiescommitted by the LTTE this year. Despite the violence theGovernment was prepared to hold unconditional talks withthe LTTE. Yet the LTTE in its usual style shied away from thenegotiating table after two days of talks in Geneva in Februarythis year. That is when the international community showedtheir support to our Government and to our country especially.They stepped in and under intense international pressure theLTTE agreed to meet in Norway, you remember, in June buthaving arrived in Oslo they snubbed the Norwegianfacilitators too by refusing to meet with the governmentdelegation on a lame and unacceptable excuse. They said-

( )(Mr. Speaker) . .

. . . ( )( [ - , )(The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne - Minister of Power and Energy)

.

, Question put, and agreed to.

, . , , () Whereuon MR. SPEAKER left the Chair and THE HON. (MRS.)RENUKA HERATH took the Chair.

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)Madam Chairperson, thank you again for allowing me tospeak. As I said they snubbed the facilitators too in June.With mounting global pressure from the US, European Union,Japan and India the LTTE was forced, begrudgingly to re-turn to the negotiating table in September of this year. TheEU ban was an important factor that subtly pushed the LTTEto the negotiating table. I believe that the threat of beingbanned in Japan which was conveyed to the LTTE by specialenvoy Akashi a few months ago when he visited the Vanniwas yet another important pressure point.

We must also recognize the vital role the United StatesGovernment has played in clearly indicating to the LTTEthat terrorism does not pay. In January 2006, Under Secretaryof State Nicholas Burns stated, I quote:

The burden of peace rests upon the LTTE. We hope that the LTTEwill understand that it will have no relationship with my governmentand, indeed, no effective relationship with any country in this world aslong as it seeks to redress its own grievances through the barrel of agun.

The United States has matched their words with action bycracking down on fundraising and arms procurement activi-ties within their borders. The Contact Group Initiative tostop arms procurement by the LTTE elsewhere in the worldcan be seen as an added incentive for the LTTE to return tothe negotiating table. The commitment and support ex-tended to us by the United States Government must beapplauded by all Sri Lankans.

Of course, we can also not forget India, our great neighbourand old friend who has played a very important and vitalrole in trying to forge a settlement in our country. Despite, aswe all understand, domestic political compulsions and pres-sures the continued support of the Indian Government spe-cially, the Hon. Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh for thesovereignty and the territorial integrity of our country mustalso be appreciated by all Sri Lankans.

[ ]In order to counter the intense international pressure, theLTTE of course has embarked on a new strategy. The LTTEhas mounted a systematic campaign to tarnish the image ofSri Lanka. In a vain attempt to offset its horrendous recordof human rights violations and child abductions, the LTTEis now accusing the Government of all sorts of similaratrocities.

I know, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella made his speechperhaps with a certain degree of passion, but I really thinkyou should not perhaps give it publicity. The sort of thingyou said is, what the LTTE would like to be repeatedelsewhere. You are repeating the same allegations whichthe LTTE is making. The chorus for the LTTE campaign - Iam not talking about you now - is provided by a few localNGO mouthpieces, following their own selfish agendas formonetary gain as well as some well meaning but cluelessand blue eyed foreigners, as I would call them, who havetaken on the role of the 19th century sermonizers who camehere to pontificate and harangue us natives , so to speak,on how best to govern our own country. We need not betold how to govern our own country, we have enough andmore people on both sides of the divide who know how todo it.

I would not dare to presume that the Government is withoutany shortcomings, that also I must admit. When you areunder intense pressure of this nature, there could beshortcomings. But I must say, despite all this, the militaryhas behaved in an extraordinarily disciplined manner underthe most trying circumstances. As a matter of fact, the UnitedNations have chosen soldiers from the Sri Lanka Army, dueto its strict discipline, as peacekeepers. Otherwise they wouldnot be choosing our soldiers for peacekeeping purposes toserve as peacekeepers in many trouble spots around the world.In fact, there are approximately thousand members of the SriLankan armed forces at the moment serving in five countries-Western Sahara, Haiti, Congo, Liberia and Sudan and as Isaid, we provide a significant contingent of peacekeepersfor the UN.

Having said that, as I said earlier, even in the mostdisciplined army, Hon. Senathirajah, there could be a fewwayward elements. Young lads working under extremeconditions, risking getting killed or maimed on a daily basis-in fact we know on an average five soldiers have beenkilled a day since January by the LTTE- may on rareoccasions try to take the law into their own hands. But, ifsuch undisciplined elements exist in our armed forces, wemust and we will take stringent measures to punish them. Infact, President Rajapaksa, as you know, ordered the arrest ofseveral soldiers in the aftermath of the killing of severalstudents in Trincomalee. While the Government wanted toprosecute these offenders, the courts ordered them to bereleased due to lack of evidence. We have to go through theprocedure. I mean, if there is no culture of impunity in thiscountry as some would like to claim-

. . ( )(The Hon. M. K. Eelaventhan)

Madam-

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

Not only - [Interruptions]. Please-

. . ( )(The Hon. M. K. Eelaventhan)

Sir, with due respect to you, do you say the army is sodisciplined that they are killing so many people in Jaffna andTrincomalee? I think you have taken cover under some pre-text. Be honest. Tell us. It is an army of occupation, an armyof aggression.

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

Mr. Sooththara Puncha, give me a few minutes. If Ihave more time I do not mind the interruptions. I have only20 minutes, I really would like to continue with my speech.[Interruption.]

As I said Hon. Senathirajah, Hon. Members, what couldwe do? The court held that there was a lack of evidence.

And regarding the incident in Mutur where 17 aid workerswere killed, the Government has appointed a commission ofinquiry to be monitored by a team of eminent internationalpersons. In fact, I must actually tell this House the delay inappointing this observer team of eminent persons is due tocertain countries not having sent us their list of nomineesstill. In fact, yesterday some ambassadors said that they wouldget the names. We have been persuing it. No sooner we getthe names of the nominees from the relevant countries thework of the actual commission of inquiry headed by Hon.Justice Nissanka Udalagama will commence.

And of course again regarding the cold-blooded murderwhich you mentioned, of our erstwhile Colleague, the Hon.Nadarajah Raviraj, a person whom I considered also a per-sonal friend, a very brave and honourable person, at the re-quest of President Rajapaksa, my Ministry, through our HighCommission in London, has been in contact with ScotlandYard who have agreed to assist us in the investigation. Andas I said when the Hon. Kiriella was speaking, we will, themoment they are here, discuss the contents of the MoU and ifthere is a request from the House certainly we are willing totable it.

Despite the sincere and concerted efforts by the Govern-ment, what worries me Madam Chairperson, is that NGO rentboys like Kumar Rupasinghe who live off the money of NGOscontinue to bray loudly and hurl baseless allegations againstthe Government.

2006 21749750

( )(The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella)

The only thing is the delay will destroy the evidence. Thatis what I say. Delay in any form will destroy the evidence.

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

But, on our part, Hon. Kiriella, we are trying to expeditethe process.

( )(The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella)As a lawyer, I can tell you, the more you delay, the moreevidence will be destroyed. That is all. You can take it orleave it.

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

We always take the good suggestions and leave the badones. But again what I cannot understand is this. KumarRupasinghe who lives on the money of the NGOs, he is likea rent boy. He is an international rent boy, with due respect,and they come forth and say, We accuse the Government.But where is the evidence? Where is the solid evidence? Irequest Mr. Rupasinghe if he has evidence, verifiable evi-dence against the Government to prove that the Govern-ment was behind the killing of our Friend Hon. Raviraj,please let us have it. Not only Mr. Rupasinghe, but if any oneof you or anyone of the public has evidence at least regard-ing the murder of the Hon. Raviraj, please, either come andtell us or go to the police. If you feel that you cannot go tothe police, at least make that evidence public because, as Isaid, the Government always welcomes any verifiable evi-dence on any of these killings. - [Interruption.] We are notonly worried, in fact a few months ago again a good Friend ofours, Hon. Pararajasingham, was killed.

. . ( )(The Hon. M. K. Eelaventhan)

.rose.

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

Hon. Sooththara Puncha, if you have any evidence, giveit to us without just making - [Interruption.] Hon. SooththaraPuncha, just give us any evidence because in the face ofevidence, I can assure you, there will certainly be no cover-up by our Government. - [Interruption.] In that case, as some-one else said earlier, what about the Hon. Pararajasingham?

What about the Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar, our own illus-trious Minister of Foreign Affairs, my predecessor? Evenafter a year, we still cannot solve his murder. If we really wantto go back to the early days, what about Dr. NeelanTiruchelvam? What about Mr. Amirthalingam? What aboutall those cases? Because the very nature of this conflict -

. . ( )(The Hon. M. K. Eelaventhan)What about the Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham?

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)What about President Premadasa and the then Leader ofthe Opposition, Mr. Gamini Dissanayake? All these murdersand problems have not been able to be solved because oflack of evidence and also because of the very nature of theconflict. As I said, any of you, please come and give us solidevidence and after giving solid evidence if the Governmentdoes not act or after having verifiable evidence, if theGovernment tries to cover it up, then you have all the right toget on to the streets and condemn our Government in theharshest of terms. I agree with you that in this sort of thingthere cannot be a cover-up. There should not be a cover-upand we should not allow anyone to cover it up.

I also believe, Madam, that if there are indisciplinedelements in the armed forces - as I said there would be in thebest of armies; we have seen that in the United States, themighty American Army also had miscreants and they punishedthem - the military hierarchy or the leadership should nothesitate to punish these miscreants who tarnish the image ofour armed forces. That also, I agree. - [Interruption.] If thereare miscreants in the army, I request the army leadership,please punish them. As I said before, we have a committedand highly disciplined army. We have around 115,000soldiers in the Army, 25,000 in the Navy, 20,000 in the AirForce and almost all of them - I am not saying all of them, butalmost all of them - serve the country with great honour andvalour. Even in the finest army, there can be found a fewtruants. These few bad apples do not represent the vastmajority of the military and they must not be allowed totarnish the image of the army. - [Interruption.] As evidencedby events in recent times, as I said, even the great and mightyAmerican Army had a few miscreants who broke the law andwere punished for their transgressions.

Some members of the armed forces believe that themiscreants should not be punished as it would demoralizethe others. - [Interruption.] This is the argument that hasbeen put forward to me from time to time. I certainly do notagree with that; I strongly disagree with that concept.Punishing wrongdoers, if proven guilty, will only strengthenthe morale of military personnel who serve our nation withhonour, distinction, commitment and discipline.

President Mahinda Rajapaksas administration is not,cannot and will not be a party to any human rights violationsof our people, wherever they may be. President Rajapaksawill not tolerate any human rights violations because hispolitical career is based on championing human rights in theface of grave danger, intimidation and threats. I remember, intrying to take some documents to Geneva, he was arrested.That is the kind of record our current President has.Extrajudicial killings of even those guilty, abductions andkidnappings will not be condoned or tolerated. I mustunderline that: extrajudicial killings of even those who areguilty, abductions and kidnappings should not be condonedor tolerated. - [Interruption.] The President said in hisinaugural speech last year, I quote, As a long-standinghuman rights activist at the grass-roots level and the Presidentof all communities in my country, Sinhalese, Muslims, Tamilsand others, peace I envisage will ensure human rights for alland multi-party democracy in our country.

As you know, Sri Lanka is one of the oldest democracies inthe world and as a democracy, we must always be abovereproach. A democratically elected Government such as oursshould never allow room for critics to compare us with aviolent terrorist organization, Madam Presiding Member.Terrorism, I certainly say, must be combated vigorously andfearlessly, but in doing so, we must always be aware of ourobligations as a duly elected democratic Government. Allactions in combating terrorism must be within the rule of law.A democratic Government does not have the luxury ofresorting to terrorism even while dealing with one of themost deadly terrorist groups in the world.

Madam, it is in this context that the internationalcommunity must further strengthen the hands of ourGovernment, which is fully committed to a negotiatedsettlement within the contours of democracy, human rightsand pluralism. Our friends internationally, I am happy tosay, Hon. Kiriella, that we have many today - the USA, Japan,the UK, the European Union, Canada, Australia, our greatneighbour India, of course, and even our facilitator Norway -must strengthen our hands further whilst applying pressureon the LTTE to change its violent ways. The LTTE must betold in no uncertain terms that terrorism will not help them toachieve their goals.

Our job at hand is to find a durable solution to the problem.- [Interruption.] Hon. Sooththara Puncha, it is not merely toscore debating points at the expense of our Sri Lankan peoplebecause while we debate here, while we talk about themounting tragedy in the North, while we talk about numbersand while we hurl insults at each other, the death toll of SriLankans is rising everyday.

Especially if the international community genuinelywishes to help Sri Lanka to find a durable peace, they shouldsee our problem in its true perspective. Sri Lankas ethnicproblem, for which a solution has eluded us for nearly thirtyyears is very complex and nuanced. Contrary to what some

[ ]might believe - some of the blue-eyed friends of ours - SriLankas problem is not a classic textbook case of conflictresolution where a standard boilerplate solution could beapplied.

A romanticized notion of the LTTE being freedomfighters is the biggest obstacle for some of our wide-eyedfriends in understanding Sri Lankas ethnic issue. The LTTEcertainly is not a freedom fighting movement, but anorganization depending on the whims and fancies of a singleman whose heroes happen to be Joseph Stalin and NapoleonBonaparte. Need I say more about the mentality of this man?While the Tamils of this country have genuine grievances,the LTTE neither represents them nor fight for theirgrievances.

. . ( )(The Hon. M. K. Eelaventhan)

Are you representing the Tamils? - [Interruption.]

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

Yes, I am representing the rights of the Tamils more thansome of your friends do. They are engaged in a bloody terrorcampaign solely to carve out a separate independent state inSri Lanka where Prabakaran can establish his dictatorial andfascist rule. Madam, I am quoting from the recent UTHR(J)Report which points out, For twenty years now the LTTEshumanitarian concern means nothing other than the militaryneeds of the LTTE.

Despite these grievances, the majority of the Tamil citizenschoose to live in the democratic, pluralistic, multiculturalenvironment outside the LTTE-controlled areas. Even theHon. Sooththara Puncha is able to shout like this; he is ableto express his opinions of this nature because he is here inColombo with us. - [Interruption.] Back in the Wanni, youwould not have that freedom. Fifty four per cent of the SriLankan Tamils live outside the North and the East of thecountry. Some of the largest contributors to Sri Lankaseconomy are Tamil businessmen who are based in the Southand they want no part of the LTTE.

Madam Presiding Member, today we have yet to find asolution to the grievances of the Tamil people, but it is notfor the lack of trying by the successive governments in SriLanka. You must admit that. For example, from Timpu Talksand the Indo-Lanka Accord during President J.R.Jayewardenes time to President Ranasinghe Premadasaand from President Chandrika Bandaranaike to the Hon. RanilWickremasinghe, each successive government had tried tonegotiate a settlement with the LTTE to no avail.

We have some cause for optimism now because, for thefirst time, President Rajapaksa is working on finding aconsensus of everyone at the All Party Conference byappointing a Committee of Experts to find a solution.

2006 21753754

However, up to now, the LTTE has not publicly committeditself to any solution other than Eelam. You point a finger atthe JVP; you point a finger at the JHU; you point a finger atthe other parties in this Parliament, but they have actuallybeen very flexible.

. . ( )(The Hon. M. K. Eelaventhan)The JVP, flexible?

( + )(The Hon. MangalaSamaraweera)It is the LTTE which has yet to show an iota of flexibility.In fact, every moderate politician who tried to propose asolution other than a separate State, the ones who took anactive part in trying to propose a solution had been eliminatedby the LTTE. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Mr. GaminiDissanayake, then a Minister, were the chief architects of theIndo - Lanka Accord. - [Interruption.] What happened tothem? Both were assassinated by the LTTE. Then followingthat, President Ranasinghe Premadasa went to the extent ofinviting the LTTE to Colombo and directly negotiating withthem. What happened to President Ranasinghe Premadasa?He was brutally killed on the streets of Colombo. Then, theGovernment of President Kumaratunga negotiated; she triedvery hard, the Hon. Sampanthan knows. In fact, Dr. NeelanTiruchelvam was one of the chief architects of the 1997Constitutional Draft of Regional Councils . This, of course Imust say, is my personal opinion, not that of the Government:I still feel that that is one of the best constitutional drafts SriLanka has ever been presented with, the best model for thefuture.

( [ )(The Hon. Dew Gunasekara)The most advanced draft.

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

Yes, the most advanced draft.

. . ( )(The Hon. M. K. Eelaventhan)

A diluted draft!

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

The LTTE not only rejected that, but they also killed Dr.Neelan Tiruchelvam again in the heart of Colombo.

( )(An Hon. Member) On the streets.

( + )(The Hon. MangalaSamaraweera)

Then, President Kumaratunga escaped with an injury toher eye. This is the kind of history we have had to go through.So, please do not blame the successive Sri Lankangovernments and say that we have not tried. We have triedand under President Rajapaksa, we are trying even more inorder to ensure that a solution which is acceptable, if not tothe LTTE, to the majority of the Tamils is presented

( + )(The Presiding Member) , 5 .

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) . .

For the first time since the tragedy of our country-

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

I want to ask you one brief question.

( + )(The Hon. MangalaSamaraweera)

I do not have time.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Does the judgment of the Supreme Court virtually settingat naught the merger of the Northern and the EasternProvinces help the peace process in anyway and when thistype of thing happens in the country, can the Tamil peoplerepose any faith whatever in the peace process? That is thequestion I want you to answer.

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

Hon. Sampanthan, please do not blame us on a court order.The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka has even - [Interruption.]Being a lawyer, Hon. Sampanthan, please do not forget-

755756

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Your Supreme Court strikes down the P-TOMS. YourSupreme Court strikes down the North-East merger. Wheredo we go? - [Interruption.]

( + )(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

Hon. Member, I have only one minute. Hon. Sampanthan,have you forgotten the fact that the Supreme Court of SriLanka even went against the Executive President of Sri Lankalast year? - [Interruption.] When the P-TOMS was proposed,it gave a ruling against the President and when the term ofthe President came to an end, the Supreme Court of Sri Lankawent against the Executive President. That in itself showsthat the Supreme Court cannot be influenced. So, I do notthink your argument stands. Of course, I have my own opinionabout the merger and I feel that we must discuss it as an itemon the agenda at the All Party Conference. We feel that youshould also give your opinion and something should be doneabout it.

Anyway, for the first time since the tragedy of our countrybegan nearly three decades ago, I think now, Hon.Sampanthan, we have a window of opportunity to solve theproblem. A national consensus, I believe, is emerging andeven the UNP leader, who sabotaged two previous attemptsto bring about a solution, has now stated that his support willbe forthcoming in resolving the national question. That ismost welcome and if we are to let this opportunity slip by, Ithink, the generations to come will curse us. That is whyHon. Sampanthan, Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, Hon. Membersof the JVP and the JHU, I think we must stop, as I said earlier,trying to score debating points while the loss of manyvaluable lives continue to mount. We know. In fact, I amtalking about the media. Just look at it. When some soldiersare killed, the LTTE and the Tamil Net gloat about it and say,200 soldiers killed. Then when LTTEers are killed, someof our newspapers carry rather disgusting headlines againsaying, 200, 300 LTTEers killed. But what we forget isthat while each side gloats over the deaths of the other side,all those who are dying are very valuable Sri Lankans. Infact, the soldier who is fighting very bravely in the Northsacrificing his life for our country is a Sri Lankan. -[Interruption.] Then take, for example, the young Tamilgirl who goes around with a cyanide capsule, ready to die forher cause. She is a Sri Lankan. And then the Muslim motherswho may have been in one of the refugee camps in Mannarfor many, many years are Sri Lankans.

So, I think, it is time we should really think how we couldhold hands, join hands to develop our nation and to bring inthe economic benefits our nation can surely harness becausewe must remember, even with a tragedy of this nature, wehave had a 7.5 per cent GDP this year. During the last tenyears the average GDP was 5.5 per cent. So, we must, I think,

remember that and come together; let us build trust. Myfeeling is, the LTTE also must be told the same. We arewilling to, even tomorrow, go back to Geneva, Tokyo,Colombo or wherever you want to start talks. My feeling is,we do not even need an agenda for a few rounds of talks. Letus sit down and talk to each other. Let us build the trust wehave lost because the solution to this problem surely lies ina political settlement reached across the negotiating tableand not in killing each other in the judges of the Wanni.

So, that is why I think whole House should now gettogether, stop scoring debating points and jsut say,Enough is enough.

Thank you.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I intend discussingthe main or salient features of the Budget.

Having myself presented three Budgets as Minister ofFinance, I am conscious of the fact that the preparation ofa Budget in a developing nation which is subject to adverseinternational fiscal trends such as the rise in oil prices andflour prices presents tightrope walking for its FinanceMinister. And yet, we cannot allow ourselves to be swampedthese challenges have to be faced and met as best as wecould. Let us therefore examine the stepping stones of theBudget to see whether these are correctly positioned.

Firstly, I observe that the Budget refers to almost everysector of the economy - but it presents no clear overall planor strategy of economic construction. A home-grownpolicy interspersed with basic international requirementsis well and good - but it must lay down a clear path alongwhich development could be channelled. This, Mr. DeputyChairman, is lacking in the Budget.

Secondly, - [Interruption.]

I rise to a point of Order. There is no Quorum in the House.

Secondly, Mr. Deputy Chairman, certain sensitive issuespresent in our economy and which have got aggravated inthe last three years, have not been addressed. They are,

[ . . ]Rising inflation, which presently stands at 8 percent, costof living, the index of which has risen by 12 percent,increase in interest rates, the sharp decline of the Rupee asagainst other international currencies; the Rupee presentlystands at Rs. 105/- against the US Dollar.

Each of the above is an unfavourable tendency in anyeconomy, and particularly in our country which importsalmost 70 percent of its requirements. Cumulatively, theywill drain our national wealth. How does the Governmentintend arresting each of the above features? Parliament andthe country at large must be told this through the Budget.But the Budget remains silent.

The recently concluded MU between the SLFP and theUNP is a welcome move. The UNP has agreed to supportthe Budget in principle. I believe that constructive efforts- particularly when they are bipartisan - are beneficial. Yet,we require to be fully informed, so that our cooperation willbe more meaningful. Unfortunately, the Budget is notinformative on these issues.

Sir, the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act of 2003sets the parameters for the development of the economy,which a government is called upon to meet. The Actstipulates that the Budget deficit at the end of 2006 shouldnot exceed 5 percent of GDP. Yet, the deficit is 7.3 percent.This has increased from last years figure of 7.1 percent.

The Minister of Finance has pointed out, not withoutjustification, that the sudden and sharp increase in worldoil Prices adversely affected the countrys economic indices.He stated that the foreign exchange cost of petroleumimports is US Dollars 2.2 billion. The fuel subsidy costthe State Rs. 25 billion in 2005 and a further Rs. 12 billionupto June 2006. But timely planning and action could haveconsiderably reduced those crippling figures. The increasein world oil prices took place also during the regime of theUnited National Front (UNF) Government. But withplanning, we immediately introduced an automatic priceadjustment mechanism, whereby we increased the cost offuel to the consumer when world prices went up, and gavethe consumer the benefit of reduced prices when costsdecreased. This formula reduced the financial burden bothon the State and the consumer. Unfortunately this beneficialscheme was abandoned when the Peoples Alliance formedthe government in 2004. It has since not been replaced,resulting in the adverse results on the revenue referred toby the Minister.

The Budget also states that the fertilizer subsidy costsRs. 11,000 million, and paddy purchases Rs. 2,900 million.The Samurdhi payments are being increased. None can

grudge governmental assistance to the needy but is this aloneadequate in the long run? Should not parallel steps be takento systematically reduce poverty and make the people moreself - dependant?

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, take for example ourrural youth. Should not schemes be put in place to train themto be moreself-reliant and self-productive? There is a demandfor services such as of motor mechanics, electricians, repairsto and maintenance of agricultural and electronic equipmentand there has been a considerable increase of the demand forsuch services in our rural areas. Why not commence trainingschemes to enable rural youth to qualify in these capacities.At the end of the period of training, they could be providedwith the capital to purchase the basic tools of their trade. Inthis manner, they enter the stream of productivity and self-reliance. The continuous granting of subsidies and Statedoles will not end or reduce poverty. On the other hand,training people to earn a livelihood of their own willprogressively reduce poverty and dependence on the State.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, we must introduceinnovative measures to expand the economy and the revenueit generates. The current position is that of an economy thatis contracting. The MoU between the two major parties andits objective of cooperation on the major political andeconomic issues confronting the nation should be utilizedurgently and fully by the Government as the catalyst towardsurgent economic reforms.

I wish to advert to another matter. The Fiscal Management(responsibility) Act fixes the ceiling of Governmentborrowings. It stipulates that at the end of the financial yearcommencing on 1st January, 2006, that is the current year,the total liabilities of the Government including its externaldebts at the current exchange rates should not exceed 85 percent of the estimated Gross Domestic Product for that financialyear. However, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, duringthe current year, the Government commenced externalborrowings in US Dollars. The danger with which this isbeset is that the rupee has depreciated considerably as againstthe US Dollar at the same time. When the United NationalFront Government relinquished office in April 2004, therupee stood at Rs. 94 as against the US Dollar. Today, it hasspiralled to Rs. 105. If this trend of reducing the value of therupee continued, it means that the Governments debt willincrease when it comes to repayment of such borrowings.

This is another reason, Sir, why, as I said earlier, theGovernment will have to introduce measures to increaserevenue by making the people more productive and self-reliant. Otherwise, the country is faced with a situation whenthe Governments outgoings far exceed the revenuegenerated, leading to greater reduction of the national wealth.This must certainly be avoided.

I thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees.

SUPPLY OF ESSENTIALS TO VAKARAI AND

KATHIRAVELI

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Thank you Mr. Speaker, I move Sir, the following matterof urgent public importance for discussion in the Housetoday.

Around 12,000 Tamil families comprising about 38,000persons, men women and children presently live in theVakarai and Kathiraveli areas in the north of Batticaloa,bordering the Trincomalee District.

Around 3,500 of the aforesaid 12,000 families arepermanent Tamil residents of the Vakarai Kadiraveli areasand the balance 8,500 families are Internally DisplacedPeople from several villages inthe south, south-east andsouth-west of the Trincomalee District. These Tamil peoplewere displaced consequent to aerial bombing and heavyartillery shelling from both land and sea, in areas of Tamilcivilian habitation in the said villages during the militaryconforntation between the almost exclusively SinhalaArmed Forces of the Sri Lankan Government and theLiberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) between themonths of April and September, 2006.

839840

[ . ]The aforesaid Internally Displaced Persons abandonedall their personal belongings when they so fled and are ina state of penury and destitution.

In the present situation, the said people have nooccupation, and no income whatever and in any event, donot have access to food, medicine or other essentials.

The only source of succour and survival that is availableto these people, is the assistance provided by eithergovernment or by non-governmental organizations.

In the past three months much to the detriment and harmof the Tamil people, NGOs have been prevented by theGovernment, by the Armed Forces from working in theseareas and being of assistance to these IDPs, therebycompelling these people to depend only upon the assistancemade available through government.

The supply of food, medicine and other essentials bygovernment to these people has been scarce and irregular,and these people, particularly women and children, havesuffered much deprivation and undergone immense humansuffering.

Food and essentials in some adequate quantity was lastmade available to these people by Government on 20thOctober, 2006, and thereafter there was a further meagresupply of food and essentials on 27th October, 2006sufficient only for a limited number of people.

After 27th October, 2006, there has not been any supplyof food medicine or other essentials to these people.

These people have during the past three weeks sufferedmuch deprivation, starvation and undergone unbearablehuman suffering.

At a meeting held with President Mahinda Rajapaksaon 16th November, 2006 also attended by the PresidentsSecretary and the Presidents Principal Adviser, Membersof Parliament of the Tamil National Alliance urged thePresident to immediately send food, medicine and otheressentials to the people in the Vakarai and Kathiraveli areas.The said Members of Parliament were assured that food,medicines and other essentials would reach Vakarai andKathiraaveli by that very evening, the 16th of November,2006.

Though such supplies were not sent on the 16th, ten lorryloads of goods were sent form the Batticaloa Kachcheri toVakarai and Kathiraveli on the 17th of November, 2006,and the same was accompanied by the Divisional Secretaryfor Vakarai and Kathiraveli.

At a place called Navalladi - Cobra Bridge - somedistance south of the Maankerni checkpoint the said lorrieswere stopped by the Armed Forces and directed to return to

Batticaloa. Thereafter one Brigadier Ratnayaka of the ArmedForces is said to have imformed the Government Agent andthe District Secretary, Batticaloa that lorries should not besent with goods towards Vakarai and Kathiraveli, and thatthe people living in those areas should be brought out ofthose areas.

This matter was raised in Parliament on the 18th ofNovember, 2006 and Ministers on behalf of the Government,particularly the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, Minister ofTrade, Commerce, Consumer Affairs and MarketingDevelopment and Minister of Highways and ChiefGovernment Whip, intervened, spoke to the DefenceSecretary and others in the military establishment and gavean assurance in Parliament that eight lorries with goodswould go to Vakarai and Kathiraveli on that very day the18th and that the armed forces would not prevent the lorrieswith such goods reaching Vakarai and Kathiraveli.

Eight lorries with goods did leave the BatticaloaKachcheri for Vakarai and Kathiraveli, accompanied by theAdditional Government Agent for Batticaloa, the DivisionalSecretary and Assistant Divisional Secretary for Vakarai andKathiraveli and also a representative of the ICRC Batticaloa.The said eight lorries were once again stopped at theMankerni checkpoint and not allowed to proceed to Vakaraiand Kathiraveli.

These 12,000 Tamil families in the Vakarai andKathiraveli areas continue to face starvation and aresuffering from malnutrition and disease and death bystarvation.

The aforesaid actions of the armed forces are clearlyviolative of the assurances given by the President and inParliament on behalf of the Government. The said actions,Sir, also constitute a blatant violation of all humanitarianlaws, and is clearly an attempt to use food as a weapon ofwar, and compulsively evict persons from their areas ofhistorical habitation against their wishes.

It is the duty of the Government to immediately take allnecessary action to ensure that the people in Vakarai andKathiraveli areas are able to receive food, medicine andother essentials and thereby avoid a grave humanitariandisaster.

We call upon the Government to immediately takenecessary action to rush food, medicine and other essentialsto the families resident at Vakarai and Kathiraveli andthereby avert an imminent and grave humanitarian disaster.

I might also mention, Mr. Speaker, that on the 20th,yesterday, I sent a letter to His Excellency the President inregard to this matter outlining the position. I table* thisletter, Sir, and request that be included as a part of theHansard. I kindly request that you direct accordingly.

* . Produced at end of speech.

2006 21841842

I will just mention three short paragraphs from the letter.It states,

I quote :

Your Excellency,

No food has been sent to Vakarai and Kathiraveli after the 27th ofOctober, 2006, on which date a meagre supply sufficient only for alimited number of people was sent. An adequate supply was lastsent on the 20th of October.

You will thus appreciate that for a period of over three weeks,no food, medicine or other essentials has been sent to the people inthese areas.

These persons are facing malnutrition, disease and starvation. Agrave humanitarian disaster is imminent.

I have to request that food, medicine and other essentials be urgentlyrushed to the people of Vakarai and Kathiraveli and that you kindlyintervene personally and take every necessary step to ensure thatthis is done.

Following from the facts that I have just narrated, Sir,there are certain questions that I want to pose. First is, Sir,there was an assurance given to us by the Principal Adviserto the President, Mr. Basil Rajapaksa that on 16th November,itself goods would reach Vakarai and Kathiraveli. That wasnot done. There were some difficulties perhaps. I am notblaming anyone for that. But on 17th November, ten lorrieswent with food and other supplies. They were turned back.Subsequently on that very day, Brigadier Ratnayake phonedup the Government Agent and the District Secretary,Batticaloa and told them, Do not send any more lorriesto Vakarai and Kathiraveli. Get those people out. We donot want them to stay there. We raised the matter inParliament on 18th November and the Governmentintervened. The Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, PublicSecurity, Law and Order was contacted and we were assuredthat food will be sent and military will not stop the lorries.According to the assurance given to us on the Floor of theHouse by the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, eight lorries went.But they were stopped at Mankerni checkpoint and theycould not proceed.

Sir, there is some very clear contradiction between whatHis Excellency the President told us and what his principaladviser told us. What the Government told us through anHon. Minister on the Floor of this House and whathappened on the ground particularly, when one considersthe message conveyed by Brigadier Ratnayake to theGovernment Agent, Batticaloa that no lorries should be sentany longer with food to Vakarai and Kathiraveli and thenpeople there should be asked to vacate or brought out iscontradictory. This Sir, in my mind makes the conclusionirresistible that when on 8th of November there weremultibarrel rocket launchers fired into Vakarai andKathiraveli resulting in the death of over 50 persons andinjuries to over 130 or 140, that must have been a deliberateact aimed at them, compelling those people to leave those

areas because that was what Brigadier Ratnayake told theGovernment Agent, he wanted done. Therefore, Sir, we arefacing a very serious situation and I can understand whatthe military would say. They would say, The LTTE isusing them as human shields or The LTTE is firing at usand we are firing at them. I would say Sir, that these peopleare living in their areas of historical habitations where theyhave lived for hundreds of years and the people fromTrincomalee District or the people in adjoining villages werebeing compelled to leave on account of the fighting thattook place, the military confrontation that took place inthe areas where they were living. They have moved to theadjoining villages where they have got their relations andfriends. Therefore, these are not people who have been takenthere recently. But these are people who have beenhistorically living in these areas and there is no questionof anyone being able to say with any sense of responsibilitythat these people, historically living in these areas, are beingused as a human shield by the LTTE or any organization.

On the other hand Sir, any allegation by the Governmentthat the LTTE is firing rockets and thereby preventing thelorries of food reaching these people, in these circumstances,is definitely unacceptable because given the fact thatBrigadier Ratnayake had told the Government Agent, Donot send any lorries any longer and get those people out,it is the Government which had an objective of wantingthe people out or getting the people out and if there hasbeen any firing in these areas, I am inclined to submit Sir,with a sense of responsibility and much respect in this Housethat that must have been orchestrated.

Whatever the reason may have been Sir, whatever mayhave happened in the past I am happy the Hon. PrimeMinister is here and Hon. Leader of the House is here. Thatis to some extent indicative of the fact that the Governmentrealizes that this is a very serious matter. Also I am happyHon. Minister, Jeyaraj Fernandopulle is here because heintervened on behalf of the Government and gave us anassurance on the Floor of this House. I have to veryearnestly request Sir, I have to make an appeal to theGovernment kindly, do not starve these people. There areexpectant mothers who are unable to come and deliver theirbabies. Even ambulances are not allowed to go. Peoplehave no food. They have no rice. Only yesterday, I amtold, one lorry had gone with 200 bags of rice and 100 bagsof flour. That will be just enough for 2 or 3 days or maybe2 days. That will not suffice. The people of these areashave a right to live in those areas. That is their home. Thatis where they were born. That is where they havehistorically lived for generations and centuries. They cannotbe ousted from there for any military purpose. They have aright to live there. Please permit them to live there. Pleasedo not interfere with their freedom to live where they wantto live, particularly when that is the area in which theyhave lived for long, long years and decades. I would appealto the Government to kindly take these matters intoconsideration, particularly the inability on the part of the

843844

Government, as informed to us by the President and inParliament on behalf of the Government to send food tothese people and to make sure that sufficient stocks of foodare immediately sent to these areas and thereby a gravehumanitarian disaster is averted.

I thank you, Sir. The Motion will be seconded byone of my Colleagues.

His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapakse,President, Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka,Presidential Secretariat,Colombo.

Your Excellency,

STARVATION OF 12,000 TAMIL FAMILITIES IN THEVAKARAI AND KATHIRAVELLI AREAS IN NORTHBATTICALOA DISTRICT

When we met you on the 16th of November, 2006 together withyour Secretary and Principal Advisor, we raised with you the plightof the 12,000 Tamil families in the above areas who had not beensupplied with food, medicine or other essentials for almost threeweeks, and who were consequently undergoing much humansuffering. Your Principal Advisor clearly tokd us that Vakarai andKathiravelli would receive supplies by that evening, the 16th ofNovember, 2006. We were greatly relieved.

On the 17th of November, ten lorry loads of food were sent fromthe Batticaloa Kachcheri to Vakarai and Kathiravelli, along with theDivisional Secretary of the area. The lorries were stopped at Navalladdy Cobra Bridge some kilometers south of maankerni Armycheckpoint by the Armed Forces, and directed to return. One BriadierRatnayaka had later telephoned the Government Agent and told himthat no more lorries should be sent to Vakarai and Kathiravelli areas,and that steps should be taken to evacuate the people living in thesaid areas.

We raised this matter in Parliament of the 18th of November,2006. Hon. Minister Jayaraj Fernandopulle, who intervened on behalfof the Government having spoken to the Defence Secretary and othersin the military establishment, gave an assurance in Parliament thateight lorry loads with food would go to Vakarai and Kathiravelli onthat very day the 18th. Accordingly eight lorries left the BatticaloaKachcheri, with the Additional Government Agent, the DivisionalSecretary and Assistant Divisional Secretary. They were stopped atthe Maankerni checkpoint and could not proceed further. They weredirected to return to Batticaloa.

No food has been sent to Vakarai and Kathiravelli after the 27thof October, 2006, on which date a meagre supply sufficient onlyfor a limited number of people was sent. An adequate supply waslast sent on the 20th of October.

You will thus appreciate that for a period of over three weeks,no food, medicine or other essentials has been sent to the people inthese areas.

[ . ]These 12,000 Tamil families comprise of around 38,000 persons men, women and children. Of these families around 3,500 familiesare permanent residents of Vakarai and Kathiravelli, and the other8,500 families are internally displaced people from the villages inthe south, southeast and southwest of the adjoining TrincomaleeDistrict.

These persons are facing malnutrition, disease and starvation. Agrave humanitarian disaster is imminent.

I have to request that food, medicine and other essentials beurgently rushed to the people of Vakarai and kathiravelli, and thatyou kindly intervene personally and take every necessary step toensure that this is done.

Your sincerely,

R. SAMPANTHANTNA Parliamentary Group Leader &MP for Trincomalee District.

Hon. Prime Minister, before you conclude may I kindlyinterrupt you once more ?

( )(The Hon. Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka)

Yes.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

We are not here in order to blame people. That is not mypurpose. I only want the Government to kindly send sufficientfood, medicine and supplies for these people in Vakarai andKathiraveli because we know that they are starving. Many ofthem are on the verge of death. Some have died. We do notwant a humanitarian disaster. I gain nothing. If the LTTEand the Sri Lankan Armed Forces want to fight it out, let themfight it out but let not these poor people suffer. That is whatI am saying and I would like you to kindly give us an assurance

that food will be sent very early. One lorry has gone yesterday.More lorries can go. Kindly have that done. That is what Iam interested in.

( )(The Hon. Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka)

Mr. Speaker, I did not make any allegation against anyone.I only said that a name was mentioned; a particular name wasmentioned. That has given light for us to investigate thismatter. It is a very serious thing when a statement is made inParliament. I have to take cognizance of it. I am not blaminganyone. I would give the assurance to the entire House thatwe will do whatever we can to send the food as soon aspossible. We expect and we hope that if there are anyobstacles that have been laid earlier they should be cleared.I hope they also will realize and extend the support and co-operation that is needed to see that the necessary food itemsreach those innocent people in that part of the country.

I thank you, Sir.
