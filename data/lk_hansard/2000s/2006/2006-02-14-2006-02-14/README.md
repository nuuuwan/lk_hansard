( )(Mr. Speaker) , . 15 . ? ?

( )(Mr. Ravi Karunanayake )Yes Sir. Good morning. , , .

( )(Mr. Speaker) .

[. . 9.50]

( )(Mr. Ravi Karunanayake )I think the situation that prevails necessitates speaking afew words not from the angle of defence, but from a nationalpoint of view. Today Sir, we being a responsible Oppositiondo not want to be shouting around to make the difficult lifeof the Government more difficult. But there is a sense ofresponsibility that behoves us and that is the presentpredicament. We have on one side, an economic war and onthe other side an uncertain security situation. How are wegoing to look at it while trying to maintain a balance betweenthe two ? That is what we from the United National Partyhave to basically say.

Sir, as you, we are talking on the extension of the state ofEmergency and the United National Party has been and willalways be a responsible party that looks after the nationalinterest in spite of the things that are being done to provokeus. But, as you know only when the going gets tough that thetough get going and that shows that the Opposition is there,ready, willing and able to look at it in the national interest.But, Sir, at the same time people who govern must understandthat we must not go blindly into a situation or that we loseout on a situation which puts us in a precarious position onthe security situation as well as the economic situation. Lookat the economic situation today. Dear Hon. Prime Minister,you would know that there is an onerous task before you.Look at the economic situation, the employment creation,the interest rate, the cost of living et cetera. Today people areasking, Is this a part of Mahinda Chinthanaya? I do notwant to politicize this issue. But, certainly, Sir, it behoves usotherwise the people will say, We have elected you to ensurethat you do a good job. People rejected us. It may be that186,000 people said, No to us. But the destiny hangs, onthose people that basically voted for you.

Today, you talk of a unitary State and a solution that iscoming out of it. They said Solheim should not be in thiscountry and that was why the people voted for you. Today

people say that the Ceasefire Agreement should not exist. Isthat why they go to Geneva ? The partners said that thereshould be no discussion anywhere other than in Sri Lanka orin an Asian Country. I ask, is Geneva part of Asia ? Then theywent on saying that the Maniraskulam Camp and all thatshould be removed. All these things should come through aunitary state. I just want to begin by asking whether thesepeople had died and been reincarnated. What are they doingtoday ? They are going to Geneva. They are talking of theCeasfire Agreement signed by the then Prime Minister of theUnited National Party which they laughed at. Four years later,they will be ironically speaking on the Ceasefire Agreement,not on the peace process, on the 22nd of February whichhappens to be its fourth anniversary.

So, Sir what is this all about ? They made such a big noiseduring the election. They said, If the United National Partycomes to power, through the Ceasefire Agreement, they willbasically divide this country. Now, Hon. Prime Minister,that is on your lap. Now, are you not going to Geneva ? Areyou not basically utilizing the Ceasefire Agreement ?

Today 198 soldiers, armed personnel and others are notwith us. Who will basically be answering their questions ?They thought that there will be a peace process and todaythey are no more with us. Who is going to speak for thosesilent voices ? All what we say is that there must be a sense oftruth and honesty even in politics in this country, Sri Lanka.It is a sad situation today. And if we do not speak on behalf ofthose silent people, those people will look at us and say,you did not least have the courage to speak on this matter.That is why I take this opportunity to speak today on behalfof the Opposition.

You have a historic situation. Even though you laughed atus and said that we will divide the country it is our actionsalone that has helped us to keep this country together. Todaythe Ceasefire Agreement is what the Hon. JeyarajFernandopulle, the Hon. Nimal Siripal de Silva and the Hon.Rohitha Bogollagama are going to speak on in Geneva. Whathappened to the JVP that made such a big noise on this ?[Interruption.] I am sorry.

I am happy to hear that there is a little bit of colour addedon with the Hon. Mrs. Ferial Ashraff also joining in. I hopeher sense of charm will not only charm you all, but also willcharm the people who are using the gun to be in power ratherthan the ballot. So, I guess, you have got that extra bit thatyou need to draw the attention of the LTTE. I am sure, youwill come back charming not only them but also our team aswell. But that will not be as easy as we say. All we need is toensure that we look at the issues nationally.

You must ensure that these chauvinistic elements areshoved aside. They are the ones who have brought not onlythe economy but also the security situation to its knees and ifthat is what is going to continue then this country has nofuture. But you are responsible people in Government,

2006 14299300

6 PL 000989 (2006/02)

democratically elected as you are. We are theredemocratically, even though we are in the Opposition, toassist. But remember that the United National Party is notthere just to say Okay, you do what you want and we arethere to help. That was in the past. We are there to look at anational agenda from a national perspective. We are not goingto be there rubber stamping anything and everything that isbeing done by the Government and do not expect us to be aresponsible Opposition and support you. No, that has beenthere for eleven years and we have seen that that wentnowhere. When we spoke of the then Executive Presidencyand said, it did not go the way we said. People laughed at usand said that we were mavericks and said that there wereproblems. But today what is happening ? They are lookingat that deal. They are looking at this deal. And what we saidthen has come true now, Sir. So, all we say is, do not thinkjust because people are in the Opposition, you have got tolaugh at them. Do not think just because they say somethingfrom the Opposition that that is unture. We from theOpposition have a more responsible role and we feel morefor the country than people who just want to stay in powerfor the sake of staying in power.

Look at the hawkish people who said that no sooner wecome to power the Ceasefire Agreement will be torn apart.Where are they ? Today they are not even a part of theGovernment that is going forward. But they are there to keepshouting, make nationalistic issues and show this and thatand the other. Forget them Hon. Prime Minister. Take thingsin to your own hands. We are there to support from a point ofview. of the whole country we are there from a national pointof view. Our love for the country is far greater than that of thepeople in 1971 and 1988 who tried to tear down democracy.And instead of the ballot they tried it by the bullet. Buttoday what they cannot do by the ballot they are trying to doby the bullet again. Those are the guys that we have got towatch. That, we say here without any fear. All we have got todo is work together. Our Sri Lankans are looking at us andasking. What are your big parties doing? We must neverlet the tail wag the head. We are there to give solid support.If they do not understand what democracy is, they do notunderstand what internationalization is, then we have got toteach them. Sometimes together we can teach them betterthan when we are separated and that is why we now standfirmly behind you.

The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandpulle was in Hong Kong. Hetalked of WTO. I know that he basically is business-oriented.So there is no point in splitting hairs on that. But whathappened to the partners who were there who said that theWorld Trade Organization was something to which the UnitedNational Party gave an open cheque. What happened? Todaythe world is such that they have got to embrace all. What arethey talking? Do they even bother talking of that in debatestoday? One person tried to bring an Adjournment Debatebut they ar silent. The stark reality is the world is theretogether.

Today people ask. What has happened? Why did theyvote against Iran? If we were in government and if we votedagainst Iran they would have said. This is another Yankeedeal that was put in. Now what has happened to the YankeeNow what has happened to the people who laughed at Iraqthen? The world is such that you have got to move together.Only stupid idiots who do not see the other side of the hill,who try to make nationalistic issues out of no issue, are theonly ones who will basically make use of this, Sir. Todayevery step the Government is taking indicates and vindicatesthe United National Party stand.

When we went forward with the Ceasefire Agreement wesaid this is for the betterment of the country. There was nointention to give a single square foot to the terrorists or naysort of organization. But then what did they say? Today I amasking those people who shouted, themselves hoarse, whydid they hoodwink the people? Today who do they not dothe same posters that they did then? Just because they wantto stay in power. That is the way they duped the people?

Hon. Prime Minister, all we have got to do is to ensure thatthe economy is put in place. Today people are unable to live.Today sugar is Rs. 54; rice, you cannot get anything for lessthan Rs. 45. Flour was increased by your own government byRs. 10. One day they said they have reduced the duty elementowing to high cost of living and the next day they put it backagain. Interest rates which were at 6 or, 7 per cent during ourtime is today at 16 or 17 per cent. How can small investorsinvest into the future? How can job creation take place? Soon that basis Sir, please ensure that the macro economy isput in place because if we lose the economic war we have lostall wars and that is the intention of those people who aremasterly trying to erode the economy of this country and wehave been saying this day in and day out. All we want tobasically say is keep your proper perspective, have the macroeconomic picture in proper place, then improve on thesecurity, situation that prevails and bring in a conduciveeconomic climate to this country. On one side you say, Pleasebring investments into this country. The Chintanaya haspromised jobs galore but what is happening today? The fewjobs that are there are also going out through the economicdoor because of the fact that there is no proper and conduciveeconomic climate.

So Hon. Prime Minister, while putting the economy intoplace, while being alert and the security situation basically inaccordance with international norms. I call upon you to lookat it from a national point of view. The United National Partyis ready, willing and able to basically assist and be togetherand not oppose, but support when, called upon at givenmoments. But together let us have an economic agenda. Letus have a national agenda and for that we are ready, willingand able to assist. So do not take that as a point of weakness.That is our strength as a party that likes and loves Sri Lanka.After all people voted us in order to get a job done. Justbecause we are in the Opposition it does not mean that westand against you remember together we can make adifference. Ensure the chauvinistic elements that are thereare cast aside and trust us, which I am sure will be morebeneficial to you than trusting the evil spirits that are there.

Thank you very much.
