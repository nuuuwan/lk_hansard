. Order for Second Reading read.

( )( - " )(The Hon. (Pro.) Tissa Vitharana - Minister of Science andTechnology)I move,

That the bill be now read a Second time.

Thank you Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to introduce thisvery important and currently necessary, ElectronicTransactions Bill. We, as a country are moving rapidly towardsthe use of computers and information communicationtechnology in the areas of commerce as well as governmentactivities. There is the e-Commerce programme as well as thee-Government programme which are being pursued in theinterest of developing our economy, in speeding uptransactions and in enabling commercial transactions, bothwithin the country as well as from Sri Lanka to other countries.Unfortunately, there has been no legal provision to ensurethe validity of these transactions. The intention of this Bill isto provide a legal framework to permit these transactions togo ahead and be considered legally valid.

Other countries have been moving rapidly to get suitablelegislation in place. For instance, recently Pakistan,Singapore, South Korea, and India much earlier, haveintroduced suitable legislation. Consulting those countriesand also learning from their experiences, we decided thatsuitable legislation should be framed in Sri Lanka to enablethe benefits of information communication technologydevelopments and the facilities provided by the computer, toflow to the society in general through speeding up ofcommercial and government at activities.

The problems that can arise in doing this have to beaddressed and we have to ensure that there are legalsafeguards, so that any transacation that is done throughelectronic media will be considered valid. If there are anydisputes arising, there will be suitable legal provision toensure that those disputes can be settled. This is basically,the purpose of this legislation and I am happy to introducethis Bill to Parliament.

I will take a little time of the House to clarify some of thepoints that are included in the Bill. I would also like to mentionthat earlier any legally valid document had to be handwrittenand signed. Then, later on with the development of thetypewriter the whole message could be typed and at the bottomthe singnature was put. There was a whole mechanism set up

2006 07393394

for the validation of that signature. But now we are comingto the stage where using the computers it will be possible toget a document across but we have to have some means bywhich the legal validity of that document is ensured. For thatpurpose, electronic singnatures are developed. To give youan example, there are certain definite marks and certain codeswhich can be introduced to identify a particular individualso that when a communication is sent from one individual toanother, then that identification mark is separately sent tothat individual. There are different types of technologiesthat are being developed. For instance, supposing, I send aletter to a second person and I want it to be a legally validdocument, then, I will send it in a form of a code. That codecan be unlocked by the person who receives it at the otherend once he knows what the code is and thereby, he knowsthat this is a formal, legally valid document. He cannot evenreceive the document unless he has the appropriate code andis able to introduce that code at the time he receives thatdocument in his computer. So, this type of process has nowbeen put into place and it is being practised in many countriesthroughout the world, in all developed countries and in manydeveloping countries and our object is to introduce thelegislation that will enable these benefits to accrue to oursociety as well.

This Bill was finalized pursuant to a joint CabinetMemorandum of the Hon. Prime Minister at that time whowas in charge of the ICT Agency, the present President, Hon.Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Hon. Minister of Trade Commerceand Consumer Affairs and I. Consequently, the Cabinet ofMinisters authorized the draft legislation to be prepared bythe Legal Draftsmans Department in conjunction with theICT Agency of Sri Lanka, the ICTA.

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana)Madam Chairperson, can I continue?

(+ )(The Presiding Member)Yes.

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana)

The Cabinet of Ministers authorized the draft legislationto be prepared by the Legal draftsmans Department inconjunction with the ICT Agency of Sri Lanka - ICTA -ensuring that the draft legislation is in conformity withinternational standards and practices and also accrods withthe requirements of the IT industry - the InformationTechnology industry. Most countries, as I mentioned,including India, Pakistana, Malaysia, Korea and Singaporehave introduced electronic transaction, that is e-transactionlegislation to recognize this activity based on the UnitedNations Commission on International Trade Law,UNCITRAL, for short, the Model Law on e-Commerce of1996 and the Model Law on e-Signatures of 2001 have beenthe basis of the laws that we have prepared. The Bill presentlybefore Parliament is in conformity with both UNCITRALModel Law on e-Commerce 1996 and the UNCITRAL ModelLaw on Electronic Signatures 2001.

The Bill provides for the recognition of contracts, thecreation and exchange of data messages and othercommunications in electronic form, facilities the electronicfiling of documents in Government and provides for theappointment of a Certification Authority and for theaccreditation of Certification Service Providers I mustmention here that there will be and there already are in mostcountries certification service providers who provide themechanisms by which safety as well as validity of all thesedecuments that are exchanged through the computers andthe information communication technology systems aresafely done. These providers have to be checked, kept inplace and monitored by a Certification Authority.

So, as part of this Bill, we have included this accreditationprocess to conform with the provisions of the Sri LankaAccereditation Board for Conformity Assessment Act, No. 32of 2005, which I brought up in this House late last year.During the prepartion of the Bill UNCITRAL adopted aConvention of Electronic Contracting. As a result, the conceptsand principles contained in the said e-ContractingConvention were closely examined and incorporated in thisBill.

395396

[ ]With these words of introduction, I would like to go intothe different sections of the Bill itself. Clause 2 of theElectronic Transactions Bill says, I quote :

2.The objectives of the Act shall be

(a) to facilitate domestic and international electronic commerce byeliminating legal barriers and establishing legal certainty ;

(b) to encourage the use of reliable forms of electronic commerce ;

(c) to facilitate electronic filling of documents with Governmentand to promote efficient delivery of Government services bymeans of reliable forms of electronic communications ; and

(d) to promote public confidence in the authenticity, integrity anddate messages and electronic communications.

So these are the main objectives of this Bill.

You can see with regard to the wide area of government aswell as commercial communication activities in this countrywhich have normally been conducted through typedcommunications, typed doucments or may be writtendocuments, there was actual signing of these documents bypeople who claimed ownership of them, which coud then beauthenticated in the event of those having to be used for anylegally valid purpose and there was a method of ensuringthat those signatures were recognized. There is a wholeorganization set up to check whether signatures are valid ornot.

Now we have to have a similar system for the whole area ofelectronic exchange. For instance, I, using the computer, typeout a letter, which I want to e-mail to my Friend,. the Mr. P.Dayaratna. I address it to him and he receive it in his computer.But I have introduced a certain code, a certain singnature, SoI will separetely telephone him and say, This is my code andif you want to download my correspondence to you, thenyou have to apply that code. There will be suitable softwarealso established for this purpose. Once that is done, it is onlywhen you apply athat proper code that you will be able todownload my communication to you. So this is the systemtaht will be applicable to transactions between any twoindividuals, between any two companie; between indicidualsand a Government department; between Governmentdepartments and also between any type of institution withinour country dealing with any foreign institution. So oncethis is set in place, instead of spending days, weeks or monthson the normal procedure, going through the normal letterwriting procedure, in a moment one can get a legally validcommunication right across the globe to any other countryor to any other person anywhere, either in our country or inany foreign country.

As you will see, this whole procedure will be speeded upand still be made legally valid. Even Governmentdocumentation will have to be stored and kept in theelectronic system in a way where it can be recalled at anytime and which will then be considered valid for any officialpurpose, for any purpose in which legal proof is required. In

that way, the processes of Government as well as processes ofcommunication between peoples as well as institutions willbe authenticated for all transactions.

Clause 3 of the Bill is to give legal recognition to datemessages and other communications in electronic form.

I quote Clause 3 :

3.No data messages or other communications shall be deniedlegal recognition, effect, validity or enforceability on the ground that itis in electronic form.

So, if it is in electronic form, it can still be consideredlegally valid and given due recognition.

Clause 4 provides for the legality of an electronicequivalent of documents and other instruments requiredto be in writing, provided that the electronic version isaccessible for subsequent reference, I shall read it out. Itsays, I quote :

4. Notwithstanding the fact that the provisions of written lawsfor the time being in force in Sri Lanka attach legal validity tocertain instruments, only if such instruments have been r educedto writing, such requirement shall be deemed to be satisfied bya data message or other communication in electronic form if theinformation contained therein is accessible so as to be usable forsubsequent reference.

Clause 5 provides for legal standards and safeguardsrequired for the electronic equivalent of information tobe retained in its original form. I shall read that particularClause. It says, I quote :

5. (1) Where the law requires information to be presented orretained in its original form, that requirement shall be deemed tobe satisfied by a data message or other communication in electronicform if there exists a reliable assurance as to the integrity of theinformation from the time when it was made available in electronicfrom and the information contained in the electronic record isavailable and can be used for subsequent reference.

(2) For the purposes of subsection (1)

(a) the criterion for assessing the integrity of information, iswhether such information has remained complete andunaltered, apart from the addition of any endorsement orany change which arises in the normal course ofcommunication, storage or display ; and

(b) the standard for reliability of the assurance shall be assessedhaving regard to the purpose for which the information wasgenerated and all other relevant circumstances.

Then I would like to refer to Clause 6. This Clausedescribes the legal requirments and standards requiredwhen the information is retained in the electronic form.Under Requirments for retention., It says, I quote :

6. The requirement under any law that information be retainedshall be deemed to be satisffied by the retention in electronic formof information contain in a data message or other communicationnotwithstading the fact that such information was not originallygenerated in electronic form, if

(a) the information in the data message or communication isaccessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference ; and

2006 07397398

(b) the data message or communication is retained in the formatin which it was generated, sent or received, or in a formatwhich can be demonstrated to represent accurately theinformation generated, sent or received ; and(c) such information, enables the identification of the origin anddestination of the information or communication and thedate and time when such information was generated, sentor received, is retained :

Provided that the provisions of this section shall not apply toany information, which is automatically generated solely for thepurpose of enabling an electronic record to be dispatched orreceived.

So, the legal provision here covers messages which arebeing retained with the deliberate purpose of acting asauthentic evidence of a communication that has takenplace between individuals or institutions or where thereis definite storage of information for future reference anduse, So any type of automatic generation of informationfor purposes solely of dispatching an electronic record ofreceiving an electronic record will not be covered underthis Clause.

Clause 7, lays down the conditions under whichelectronic signatures would be legally recognized.

7. Where any Act or enactment provides that any informationor communication shall be authenticated by affixing the signature,or that any document should be signed or bear the signature ofthat person, then, notwithstanding anything contained in such law,such requirement shall be deemed to be satisfied, if suchinformation or matter is authenticated by means of an electronicsignature.

So, this is extremely important because here, where interms of the currently existing law, any document to begiven legal recognition has to carry the signature of theperson concerned who is signing that document. Now, interms of electronic transactions, electronic communications,it is not possible for that particular individual who issending out that communication to sign it. Therefore, wehave to have a different mechanism and that is the useof new technology where there are electronic signatures.Now these electronic signatures take various forms. Theyare indetifiable marks through which a particularindividual is given a unique identity which is particularto that individual and this can be, say, in the form of acode. It can be any type of electronic mark.

Now, when a person is sending a document which undernormal cricumstances that individual would have signedthrough the computers, through the electronic media, thenwhen it gets to the other end there has to be somemechanism by which we ensure that the safety of thatcommunication is retained, that its authenticity is ensuredand this is done by the system of electronic signatures.

Clause 8, describes the modalities for the use ofelectronic records and electronic signatures in Governmentinstitutions and statutory bodies and the procedures to befollowed to give effect to such activities. This Clause says,I quote :

8. (1) Where any writeen law for the time being in forcerequires

(a) the filing of any form, application, or any other documentwith any Government department, office, body or agencyowned or controlled by the Government or a statutorybody in a particular manner ;

(b) the issue or grant of any licence, permit or approval; or

(c) the receipt of payment of money, procurement or othertranscation tobe effected in a particular manner,

then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any otherlaw for the time being in force, such requirement shall be deemed tohave been satisfied if such filling, creation, retention, issue, grant,receipt, payment, procurement or transaction, as the case may be, iseffected in the form of electronic records as may be specified by therelevant Ministry, Government department, Institution, statutory bodyor public corporation or other similar body.

(2) The relevant authority requiring the use of electronic recordsspecified in subsection (1), may recommend the making ofregulations for the purpose of authorizing or facilitations theuse of electronic communications or electronic records, to theMinister in charge of the subject, by specifying -

(a) the manner and format in which such electronic recordsshall be filed, created, retained or issued;

(b) where such electronic documents or records have to besigned, the type of electronic signature required;

(c) the manner and format in which such signature shall beaffixed to the electronic documents or records and theidentity of, or the criteria which, a Certification Authorityor service provider used by such person filing the documentshould possess;

(d) the control process and procedures required in order tosecure confidentiality, authenticity and integrity ofelectronic documents, records, procurements, transactionsor payments;

(e) the manner or method of payment of any fee or chargesfor the filing, creation, retention or issue of any electronicrecord under paragraph (a);

(f) the manner of doing anything which under any suchprovisions is required to be done or evidence in writing orotherwise using a document, notice or instrument;

(g) the manner of doing anything which under any suchprovision, is required to be or which may be, done by postor other specified means of delivery;

(h) the doing of anything which under any such provision isrequired to be, or which may be, authorized by a personssignature or seal;

(i) the making of any statement or declaration which underany such provision is required to be made under oath;

(j) the making of any payment that is required to be, or whichmay be, made under any such provision;

(k) any other matter relating to electronic records or paymentsthat are presently specified for the corresponding paperdocuments.

So, hon. Members, you will see that practically all theactivities that are now taking place through the normal lettersand other documents which are either written or typed, whichare in hard copies will be possible through the electronicmechanisms, through the computer and are adequatelycovered in terms of this Legislation.

399400

Clause 9 of this Bill provides for the recognition of theGovernment Gazette in electronic form. It states, I quote :

9. Where any Act or enactment provides that any Proclamation,rule, regulation, order, by-law, notification, or other matter shall bepublished in the Gazette, then such requirement shall be deemed tohave been satisfied if such rule, regulation, order, by-law, notificationor other matter is published in an electronic form of the Gazette.Clause 10 stipulates that the preceding sections would notconfer a right on any person to insist on records being inelectronic form.

10. Nothing contained in the preceding sections shall confer a rightupon any person to insist that any Ministry, Government Department,Institution, Statutory Body or Public Corporation or other similar bodyshould accept or issue, any document in the form of electronic recordsor effect any monetary transaction in electronic form.

In other words this cannot be made a mandatoryrequirement. What is being attempted here is to makeprovision for electronic transactions to take place but, a personcannot insist that all transactions must be in electronic form.

Clauses 11 to 17 cover Electronic Contracts. They dealwith the legality and the modalities to engage in electronicforms contracting, including the recognition of an offer andacceptance in electronic form, attribution of electronic records,acknowledgement of receipt by the originator of acommunication, time and place of dispatch and receipt ofelectronic records and liability of network service providersfor merely providing access. The whole idea is to ensure thataccess can be provided to that information.

I am not going to read throuth chapter III of the Bill whichis headed Electronic Contracts. These items which comeunder Clauses 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 are spelt out infull and I am sure the hon. Members could go through themin detail and familiarize with the total scope of this legislationin relation to electronic contracts.

Then I get on to Chapter IV on Certification Authority andCertification of Service Providers. Clause 18 (1) of the Billstates, I quote :

18. There shall be a Certification Authority designated by theMinister for the purposes of this Act in consultation with the Minister incharge of the subject of Information Communication Technology.

So, there has to be a designation of a CertificationAuthority. As I have mentioned earlier, we have establishedthe Sri Lanka Accreditation Board for Conformity Assessmentthrough Act No. 32 of 2005. The way I see it, the CertificationAuthority could be made an arm of the Sri Lanka AccreditationBoard. Through that it can be brought in line with thecertification procedures that have been introduced to coverall goods and services in this country and to ensure that theyconform with international standards.

[ ]Clause 18 (2) states, I quote:

(2) In designating Certification Authority the Minister may byOrder published in the Gazette, designate any Government Department,Public Corporation, Statutory Body, Institution, or authority or anybranch or unite there of which shall be charged with the implementationof the provisions of this Chapter; the Minister shall in making the Ordertake into consideration the capacity of the Government Department,Public Corporation, Statutory Body, institution or authority to bedesignated in relation to its overall ability to discharge the obligationsunder this Act in ensuring the proper functioning of certification servicesby accredited Certification Service Providers.

So there has to be a systems service providers who willensure that the legality, the safety and the authenticity of allthese transactions are ensured through various technologicalmethods.

These Service Providers need to be accredited to ensurethat proper standards are maintained and that these standardsconform with international standards. Therefore, this wholeprocess will be monitored by the Certification Authoritywhich will have the powers which are given in Clause 19.They are :

(a)identify the criteria which will form the basis foraccreditation of Certification Service Providers andthe qualifications required by them ;

(b)specify the procedure to be followed in the grantingof accreditation for the purposes of this Act ;

(c)specify the procedure for the hearing of appeals inthe event of a refusal to grant or renew accreditation,as the case may be ;

(d)issue licences or any other form of authorisation toprovide prescribed services to Certification ServiceProviders ;

(e)require Certification Service Providers to maintainsuch records and registers as may be prescribed ;

(f)from time to time call for information as may benecessary from Certification Service Providers andissue directions to such Certification ServiceProviders.

So, Madam Chairperson, you will see that we are puttingin place a whole mechanism that will ensure that all types ofelectronic transactions that take place within the privatesector, between individuals, within the Government Sector,between Government institutions, between privateindividuals and the Government are monitored. So, thissystem of electronic signatures and electronic identificationwill be monitored to see that the Service Providers whoprovide electronic security system and identification systemconform with international standards. If we are as a countrygoing to have electronic transactions with other countries tofacilitate trade, commerce and intergovernmentalrelationships, then it is essential that there should be propersupervision and control and monitoring of these servicesand, as you can see, this Bill makes the necessary provisions.

2006 07401402

Clause 20 provides for the accreditation of CertificationService Providers. The Certificate of Accreditation would begranted, as I mentioned, in terms of the Sri Lanka AccreditationBoard for conformity assessment and that particular sectionspells this out and I shall not go into that in detail.

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana) .

Clauses 21 and 22 relates to inapplicability of certainprovisions of the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act, No. 14of 1995 and the admissibility of electronic transactions underthis legislation. There will be a Committee Stage amendmentwhich I will be introducing later when this is taken up atCommittee Stage. The Rules governing Evidence are speltout here. Due to lack of time I will not go into that.

Clause 23 stipulates exceptions from the application ofthe Act. There will be certain specific situations which areexcluded from the terms of this Bill and these are coveredunder Clause 23.

Clause 24 provides for matters under which Regulationscould be made by the Minister. The details are given thereand I would recommend that hon. Members go through themcarefully and you will see that all possible situations havebeen taken into consideration.

Madam Chairperson, I will conclude my presentation. Ithink, at this stage, I must acknowledge the support that hasbeen given by a very active group of individuals in preparingthis very important Bill. In particular, I must make mentionof Mr. Jayantha Fernando who is the Legal Advisor to ICTA.He has been playing a very dynamic and proactive role in thepreparation of this entire Bill and has guided me during thisentire exercise.

I would also like to acknowledge the contribution madeby the Legal Draftsman Mrs. Therese Perera, PresidentsCounsel and the staff of the Legal Draftsmans Department

for a very professional and meticulous drafting of thelegislation, the Attorney-General for his observations, Mr.Suhada Gamlath, Secretary to the Ministry of Justice for hisactive interest and support during this whole endeavour,Professor V. K. Samaranayake, Chairman, ICTA and the staffof the Language Technology Research Laboratory of theUniversity of Colombo, Computing Service Centre for reviewof Sinhala translation, Mr. Kolitha Dharmawardhana for expertreview of the Clause on Evidence, Mr. Nihara Rodrigo andthe staff of ICTA for the co-ordination of the preparation ofthe Bill.

I would like to mention here that already variousorganizations have been set up, for instance, the Central Bankhas already set up.I think, it goes by the common name, I amnot sure of the name, Lanka Secure where electronicsignatures have already been issued to banks and otherorganizations dealing with the Central Bank so that they canparticipate in electronic transactions with them.

Similarly, Services Lanka Limited under the Ministry ofTrade and Commerce has been established and Mr. NiharaRodrigo is leading this activity. Already some of the serviceprovisions are in place and once the legal framework isestablished their functions will be made much smoother.

Madam Chairperson, I thank you for your patience andalso for giving me the necessary time to present this importantBill to Parliament and I thank the hon. Members for theirpatient hearing.

Thank you very much.

( )(The Deputy Speaker) .

. .

( )(Mr. Nadarajah Raviraj)Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for giving me thisoppotunity. I Think the introduction of this Bill is very muchessential especially at this juncture when the entire globe ismoving towards Information Technology and making use of,the facility of electronic media.

I find that this Bill introduced by the Hon. Minister hasfar-reaching provisions to promote electronic transactions inour country. While appreciating the inclusion of variousprovisions, especially in respect of electronic forms, signingof electronic contracts and acceptance of documents thathave originated in the electronic media as evidence in a courtof law, I would like to say that even goes to the extent ofauthorizing the e-signatures. Electronically originatedsignatures can be authorized or accepted as signatures placedin normal forms of transactions.

My worry, Hon. Minister, is that there are no provisions inthis Bill with regard to the offences that may be committed inexecuting or performing these e-transactions. Sometimes onemay argue that there are provisions in our general law. Evenin the Penal Code there are provisions which cover generaloffences that are committed under these transactions. But Iwould like to emphasize on this issue. In these electronictransactions. there are possibilities of committing fraudulentacts and cheating. My contention, Hon. Minister, is that theprovisions that are prevailing in the present laws of this countrywill not be sufficient enough to curtail this situation.

Now there are certain special laws that we have. The Hon.Minister, is very well aware of this fact. If we take drugs, wehave penal provisions in the relevant Act itself. Even inimmigration law, we have got penal provisions provided for.Therefore, I think it is necessary that the Hon. Minister shouldconsider this fact, because the possibility of committingcrimes under this is very high. If you take it percentagewise,that will be very high. Especially signatures can be forged.

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana)Hon. Member, I am sorry for interrupting. I hadoriginallly meant to mention this when I was winding up.But since several speakers are bringing up this question,I would like to inform you that I have presented aComputer Crimes Bill. That was presented in August lastyear. Unfortunately the debate started, but it could notme concluded and later adjourned. Therefore, I hope tobring this computer Crimes Bill up again in the very nearfuture. Many of the points that you raised are extremelyvalid. I recognize them and these are being included inthe Computer Crimes Bill.

( )(Mr. Nadarajah Raviraj)Thank you Hon. Minister. In fact, I also took part in thatdebate. So. therefore it you have the intension of bringingupthe Computer Crimes Bill again, then of course most of theprovisions in this Bill will be covered.

But, as my learned friend hon. Hemakumara Nanayakkarasaid, this will create a situation where we may have to trainespecially, I should say, tha police officers as well as thecourt staff. This is of paramount importance, Hon MinisterWhen we talk about crimes that are committed under thisBill, we may need a computer educated court staff as well aspolice officers who are very well versed with these matters,thereby they they can assist the courts in the investigationprocess as well as in court proceedings. This is very veryimportance issue.

The Hon. Minister should appreciate this fact becausealthough we have introduced computers into our judicialsystem, that is being widely used only in the Supreme Courtand the Court of Appeal, not even in the provincial HighCourts of this country. Computers have been provided forthe judge or the registrar, but they are not being used in theday-to-day proceedings of the cases. So we mustsystematically improve this infrastructure facility in order tocatter to their needs. Information Technology has to beintroduced. This has to be done parallely because we have tostart at some point of time. We cannot always be makingexcuses saying that we do not have staff members who arecapable of handling these and ultimately, we will be pushedback, to the 17th Century.

Therefore, the Minister of Science and Technology shouldcollaborate with the Ministry of Justic and Law Reformsbecause I feel the Ministry of Justice and Law Reforms is notsufficiently provided with expert staff or expert advisors inrespect of information Technology. Hon. Minister, yourMinistry could be helpful in having some kind of a jointprogramme with the Ministry of Justie and Law Reforms inorder to educate the courts staff. There are enough young,unemployed graduates. Why do we not take those graduates

2006 07409410

and give them a full-scale training on this matter? And as astart, we can post them to each and every court-house or tothe High Courts providing them wih all the facilities. I thinkthis is very important. Having laws in our country is notgoing to help us if we do not implement them or if we do nothave ways and means to implement them. Therefore, I humblysuggest to the Hon. Minister to train them right now. Take insome young graduates who are unemployed train them andpost them to each and every court irrespective of where theyare. Sometimes you may say that there may be courts in ruralareas where you would not get this kind of problems croppingup. It may be so, but in time to come, we have to provide forthat also, We have to think far. Then only we can have acompletely good system. Sometimes, there are people whomake use of these loopholes. They may even originate acontract from a rural part of this country. So, the problem ofjurisdiction will come up the place where it had originatedor where it had been committed would come under thejurisdiction of that area. Somebody can go to Monaragala ofPoint Pedro get his e-contract signed and there may be someproblems that may crop up over that. How are we going tohandle this? Therefore, I would like the Hon. Minister tolook into this aspect, because these are new things for us.Even the lawyers have to be trained in this matter. Of course,they have to learn these, Otherwise, they cannot be successfulin handling this kind of cases.

Hon. Minister, I would give you a small example of whatwe are experiencing today. You can see that today theParliamentarians are treated like criminals. When we enteredthe Parliament today our vehicles were checked and we hadto get down from the vehicle and walk. I do not know whattype of security this is. I do not understand the reason for thiskind of security You need security; I totally agree with you.There is latest technology available. Without resorting tothose kinds of facilities, we resort to facilities which aretotally outdated. I do not for a moment say that we shouldcompromise our security or the security of this Parliament.Very well, we have to do it. But there is a way to do it. For thesake of security, you cannot ask the Members of Parliamentto get down from their vehicles and walk through a passage.What does that mean? We can have an electronicallycontrolled system. If you go around the world, you wouldsee that there are Parliaments and high security areas wherepeople are being checked without being harassed. This isthe supreme body and the supreme forum in this country.

( )(An Hon. Member)Dignity has to be maintained.

( )(Mr. Nadarajah Raviraj)Yes, dignity has to be maintained. It is veryimportant. I do not know the how Party Leaders haveagreed to this kind of a security system. I do not ask

you to compromise our security system, We shouldhave security. There is no question about it. But howto do it? This is not the way of doing it. There are 225Members of Parliament here. There are Ministers; thereis a Prime Minister; there is a President and all of themare subjected to this security. There is no problem, butthere are ways and means of how we should do it. Ican give you a practical example connected to thisissue. When we do things we must reach that standard.We must try to develop ourselves to that standard. Bybeing on the same status, we cannot expect to bringnew things into this country. Now, we are talking aboutelectronic transactions. So, we have to use our machineryand our infrastructure facilities to go into that. That isvery important. This is what we lack, Hon. Minister,and I am very soory to say that this should be changed.If Parliament authorities want to have more security,they should think about latest technology in order tocheck the Parliamentarians who are entering Parliament.There are enough latest technologies available. Thisbrings total disrespect to our Parliamentarians and ourdignity is in question.

This is what this country is lacking. Therefore, Hon.Minister, while appreciating you for the introduction ofthis kind of a Bill, I must also say that it is the needof the hour. There is no question about it, there is nosecond word about it. In order to have this implementedvery well you should train people who are living inrural areas down South or up North. This has to beparallely done. This piece of legislation cannot beimplemented only in Colombo. This is my contention,hon. Minister. I know very well that computer educationis very poor in the rural areas of this country. But thatdoes not mean we have to allow it to remain. We haveto change it. How do we change it? We must trainpeople in this field and we must employ them. Wemust provide the facilities to the courts. I must say thatfirst and foremost we should start with the rural courts.There should be a well trained person, an authoritativeperson employed in each and every court-house whocould assist the local police. When some peoblem incrops up with regard to this kind of transaction, thatperson can help the local police to do theirinvestigations. They cannot be coming to Colombo.This kind of thing has to be decentralized because thevery purpose of bringing in this legislation is to havetransactions attended to as quickly as possible withoutany hindrance in promoting the e-business among thetrade. This is the most important objective of this Bill.Therefore, it has to be decentralized to each and everyarea whereby, by operating a computer one can enterinto a contract with even a person who is living in asfar in as in America. He can enter into a contratthrough the computer. That is what is provided for.therefore, these infrastructure facilities as well as thetraining facilities have to be improved simultaneouslywith the co-ordinantion of the Ministry of Justice andLaw Reforms.5 PL 001032 (2006/03)

( )(The Deputy Speaker)Hon. Member, the time alloted to you is over.

( )(Mr. Nadarajah Raviraj)I will take only a minute and wind up Sir, I am ofthe view that the Electronic Transactions Bill is a mustbecause if any offence is committed, we should havesome provisions in the Bill to deal with the personwho commits the offence.

Apart from that we must ensure that the poor peoplein the rural areas would have the benefit of enjoyingthe provisions of this Bill and then in time to come,this will be fully implemented throughout the island.This is my contention, Hon. Minister.

Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker.
