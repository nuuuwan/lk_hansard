I have asked him many timesabout this and during those conversations and after wesigned the Ceasefire Agreement, he said, The LTTE is anessential party. Without the LTTE you cannot bring thiswhole North-East conflict to an end. But the question ishow you bring them in. He appreciated the CeasefireAgreement which we signed and he used to come and talkto me at length on what other steps that could be taken.When there were certain views regarding the rights of theTamils which he felt the LTTE had come to be identifiedwith and that there were people like him who felt it couldnot be disregarded, in addition to the fact that they hadalready become a military group.

He wanted the rights ofthe Parliament and the rights of the media safeguarded.So he took on all the national issues. He did not confinehimself to one issue though it may have been the majorissue in the country. He covered all issues; he took part inthe committees of Parliament and he also played a veryactive role in the politics of this country at a crucial time.That is why I say his death is a great loss because in theweek he died, when we were in Parliament, I used to speakto him over the telephone and he said, Look, the situation",

Please rememberthat even at this very moment there are more than 50 internalwars and conflicts going on in the world. They are basedon ethnic considerations like this, religious issues or eventribal issues. It has been proven that several of these conflictshave been promoted by warmongers. We have to takecognizance of the fact that one of the biggest industries inthe world is the armaments industry. Even the most powerfulcountries in the world depend on the armaments industryfor the survival of their economies. In that context,armaments find a sale only if there are wars and conflicts.",

So, we have to beaware that there are forces both outside Sri Lanka and withinSri Lanka who would like a resumption and intensificationof a war in Sri Lanka. There are people who live off the warand who make money out of it not only by the sale ofarmaments but also by all the other activities that go alongwith conflict and war. These forces are operating in ourcountry. They will be operating at various levels. There arepeople who are in the chain of profit. All those who areinvolved in that chain of profit will be promoting the war.This can even have an impact on the media. The media alsocan be used to provoke tensions among our people. We alsohave to take cognizance of another fact. Today, oil has beendiscovered in the sea around Sri Lanka. Oil is in high demand.The demand is exceeding the supply. Prices are going up. Inthis context we know what has happened in Iraq. Americaand Britain in particular, supported by a few other countriesattacked Iraq on the pretext that there were weapons of massdestruction. It has now been proven that there were noweapons of mass destruction; not since 1991. But what isthere in Iraq? Eighteen per cent of the worlds oil resources!",

Racists and their racialantagonism which blind them to other issues can be used bythese warmongers even without their knowledge. Those whohave racist attitudes are really two sides of the same coin andone feeds on the other. The warmongers feed on both ofthem. It is in this context that we have to look at the death ofMr. Joseph Pararajasingham which is up to now unexplained.But I think, if we look at it from this point of view, it willbecome explainable. So are the deaths of Mr. Vigneswaran inTrincomalee and Mr. Senthilanathan in Vavuniya. If youlook at the attack on the office of the Sudar Oli newspaper,can anyone who has anything to do with the Governmentwant to have an incident like that occurring just when themedia personnel of the world are gathered in Colombo? Theseare all matters which we should cogitate on. Who wouldwant to kill Mr. Joseph Pararajasingham in a way just not toget rid of him but in a way that would evoke the horror of notonly the entire Christian world but also the whole world bykilling him on the most precious day in the Christiancalendar, on Christmas Day, within the portals of a church?This was designed particularly, definitely, deliberately toarouse the horror and dismay of the whole world. Incidentslike these are against the interest of Sri Lanka and against theinterest of the Sri Lankan people and we must be aware ofthese and not be play things in the hands of those who aretrying to manipulate and gain control of our country, oureconomy and our people. We have to think about how we aregoing to solve this problem and on this occasion when weare paying our respects to a great leader, JosephPararajasingham, we should keep in mind what he alwaysbelieved, that this problem should be solved within theframework of a united Sri Lanka through negotiations andhe was always for direct negotiations. Why can we not, theTamil people and their representatives, the Sinhala people,the Muslim people and their representatives, have a directdialogue? We should get together. We do not need to haveintermediaries. Remember that the oil prospecting that wasdone in the sea around Sri Lanka was done by a Norwegianfirm in which the Government of Norway has a stake andone of the requests made was once they found oil, theyshould be given first rights in exploiting this. So we have tokeep that in mind. What is being said by the LTTE , by theTamil people through the Norwegians, when it comes, maynot be what is really said. In the same way what is being saidby the Sri Lankan Government, ultimately when it reachesthe LTTE or the Tamil people may not be what theGovernment itself intends. We have to keep those possibilitiesin mind. I am not making definite statements on these. Theseare possibilities and therefore in this context we must try towork towards a direct dialogue in the way that the lateJoseph Pararajasingham always espoused.",

Last time when I spoke here I made an appeal tothe Members of the Tamil National Alliance to come andjoin us and participate in that discussion expressingwhatever opinions they have because it is through that processof dialogue that we can go ahead. On this occasion let goodsense prevail. Let us get together as one Sri Lankan people,as people who are feeling the suffering of every person,whether he or she be Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim or any other. Weare all Sri Lankans. We cannot allow this process to go onany further. We cannot allow it to become a major conflict, awar. We cannot afford to allow our economy which is alreadystrained to collapse. There are many predators who are waitingon the sidelines to restore colonial rule in our country. Weshould not allow that. So let us get together and pledge ourdetermination when we are remembering a great leader likeMr. Joseph Pararajasingham that his death will not be invain. Let us unite our country, let us have one Sri Lankannation and work out a suitable governmental system in whichthe aspirations of all our people can be fulfilled.
