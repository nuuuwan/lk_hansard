( )( + - )(The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition)Mr. Speaker, I wish to associate myself with the Hon. Leaderof the House in moving this Vote of Condolence on the lateJoseph Pararajasingham, a Member who made a valuablecontribution to this House as well as to his constituents andto his party and to the causes he believed in.

I got to know Mr. Joseph Pararajasingham in 1989 whenhe entered Parliament on a vacancy created on the districtlist. Mr. Pararajasingham told me at that time that he hadknown my late father having had common friends inBatticaloa and in Kalkudah. It was an association whichfinally grew into a friendship. I got to know him verywell and both he and his wife were also known to me andmy wife. It is not only I but there are other Members of theHouse who became friendly with Mr. JosephPararajasingham the time that he was a Member and manyof us on both sides of the House knew him well.

Mr. Joseph Pararajasinghams views and my views werealways not the same. There were points on which we agreedand there were matters on which we disagreed but there isone fact which struck me, that he stood by his conviction.When he came into Parliament he always put forward theview that the LTTE must be brought in to the negotiatingtable and a settlement must be reached with the LTTE. Thiswas in 1990 when it was not even fashionable to speak ofthese views. I used to talk to him and I used to argue withhim. But he said, Look, this issue cannot be settled unlessyou bring the LTTE. in to the negotiating table.

[ ]He was in a minority in his party for a long time on thisview. I have heard the discussions they used to haveamong themselves, but finally he and his party all came tothe same view. What was the internal process that took placethere, I do not know. But all I knew was that he held thisview and he articulated it when it was not fashionableeven within his own party. I have asked him many timesabout this and during those conversations and after wesigned the Ceasefire Agreement, he said, The LTTE is anessential party. Without the LTTE you cannot bring thiswhole North-East conflict to an end. But the question ishow you bring them in. He appreciated the CeasefireAgreement which we signed and he used to come and talkto me at length on what other steps that could be taken.When there were certain views regarding the rights of theTamils which he felt the LTTE had come to be identifiedwith and that there were people like him who felt it couldnot be disregarded, in addition to the fact that they hadalready become a military group. So this was the viewwhich he held throughout. He did not change that. Wehave argued with him. We have agreed with him. We havedisagreed with him. But that was one viewpoint he held.

Another which he said very forcefully was that the finalsettlement must be acceptable to the Muslims in the Eastas well as to the Sinhalese. He said that the Muslims andthe Tamils have lived together. A settlement acceptable tothem has to be reached. Their rights have to be safeguardedand just as much as the rights of the Muslims have to besafeguarded the rights of the Tamils and the rights of theSinhalese also have to be safeguarded. He was always ofthat view. I remember, in 2005, I used to have a number ofdiscussions with him as to how to handle these issues inthe East between the Muslims and the Tamils. And he said,We have to talk and we have to come to a final settlement.And that view, he upheld.

As he propagated these views his life itself came underthreat. He used to tell us on many occasions that he felthis own life was under threat, especially after the breakaway of the Karuna faction. He was opposed by the Karunafaction and he used to come and speak to me as the Leaderof the Opposition about his security. And I did mentionit at that time that he had to be given additional security.Despite this he carried on his work and I must say infairness to him, he was not only concerned of this issuebut also he was concerned of many other issues, of theeconomy, of many national issues that arose, human rightsand the rights of the Parliament. He wanted the rights ofthe Parliament and the rights of the media safeguarded.So he took on all the national issues. He did not confinehimself to one issue though it may have been the majorissue in the country. He covered all issues; he took part inthe committees of Parliament and he also played a veryactive role in the politics of this country at a crucial time.That is why I say his death is a great loss because in theweek he died, when we were in Parliament, I used to speakto him over the telephone and he said, Look, the situation

2006 0911611162

is getting out of control and we have to do something. Ihad a long discussion with him the day I left for Thailand.He told me that he was leaving the next day for Batticaloaand be there for Christmas and he would like to meet meafter I returned to Colombo and discuss how we couldcontain the violence and what could be done to make theceasefire operative. He was worried at that time. But,unfortunately he did not live through that Christmas.Otherwise he would have made a vital contribution in tryingto control the violence and to make it de-escalate.

Having said this of Mr. Pararajasingham, I must also saythat he was a devout Catholic. He attended church regularly,as the Hon. Leader of the House said, both here in Colombo,in Batticaloa and wherever else he was.

Mr. Pararajasingham was also a person who believed inSri Lanka. He did not believe in a separate state. Hebelieved in the rights of the Tamils. In his view, the rightsof the Tamils had been disregarded, Tamils had to be givenrights and that included the ability to administer those areasin which the Tamils were in a majority. But, he believedin a Sri Lanka. He believed in one country. He believedin an indivisible Sri Lanka. He believed in a united SriLanka. He did not part from it. Therefore, it also placedhim in many contradictory positions in the last few yearsand I know the issue that he faced. One dilemma he facedwas when the LTTE asked the voters to boycott thePresidential Election of November, 2005 and his death mayhave been an unintended consequence of that decision.

Nevertheless, we have to remember two matterspertaining to his death. Firstly, he was brutally murderedon Christmas Day in a church. There have been manymurders in this country. A Prime Minister had been murderedby a member of the Sangha. There are many other deathsthat have taken place, but we have never had a murdertaking place in a place of worship on the day that was mostprecious to the members of that religious community. OnChristmas Day, he was brutally murdered in the church. Thathas to be condemned. That is a shame on Sri Lanka. WhenI was abroad, this was mentioned to me even in places likeThailand, which is a Buddhist country. They asked, Is thiswhat is happening now in your country? It brought shameon all of us.

The second issue is that he was another Parliamentarianwho has been assassinated. In a time of war and terrorism,whether in the North or the South, we have had to faceassassinations of our Members. There were many. Theterrorism in the South cost the lives of many Members ofthis House. The terrorism in the North also cost the livesof many Members of the House. In the last few years,needless to say, even Members of the TULF, Members ofmy party and others have been killed. Nevertheless, whenthere is a war, a conflict and terrorism, whether it comesfrom the North or the South - at one time, the JVP wasresponsible for some of the deaths - those are risks that we

have to take. That is a fact. But, Mr. Pararajasinghamsdeath do not fall into any of those categories as his deathis still unsolved. The Members of the Governmentthemselves, including the President, raised the issuewhether there were some members of the security forcesinvolved, because there were other groups involved in it.But, what concerns me is that a then Member of the Househad been killed, assassinated and the finger does not pointin the direction of the groups that are waging a war,terrorism or insurgency. That is the issue that we, in theHouse, have to face. That is why the Government mustresolve this death and find out who was responsible. IfMembers of this House can lose their lives because of theviews they hold, if they get killed by some other group andnot by groups that are challenging the order of the Stateand if this death, the assassination, goes unsolved, then webecome like the fascist Germany. In Hitlers period,Members of the Opposition died mysterious deaths, wereassassinated and unaccounted for.

That is why I urge the Government - you have committedyourselves to have an inquiry - to find out who wasresponsible, because this aspect troubles me and troublesmany Members. We ask ourselves, How many more oneither side of the House may have to face theseconsequences? While we in this House have to face thethreats that come out of insurgency, war or terrorism inwhichever part of the country or abroad, I do not think weshould have to pay a penalty for expressing our views,which may not be acceptable to groups that do not fall intothat category. So, there is a matter that has to be lookedinto. Otherwise, Mr. Pararajasinghams death would start anew fashion in this country. This is a matter which has beenconcerning many of us and I thought I should mention it.

I mentioned the past because these were facts and notin any way to attack any party in Parliament. But, thesewere things that happened in the past. What concerns us isnot the past, but what happens today. This issue, I leave tothe House and I think, Hon. Speaker, you will have to askthe Government to come up with a report, which we, theParty Leaders, could study and satisfy ourselves with.

Having said that, I would like to join the House inexpressing my condolences to Mrs. Pararajasingham and themembers of the family.

Thank you.

( )( () - " )(The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana - Minister of Science andTechnology) . , .

I would like to with deep sorrow on this occasionassociate myself with the Vote of Condolence that has beenmoved by the Leader of the House of Parliament Hon.Nimal Siripala de Silva and express my deepest sympathiesto the wife and family of Mr. Joseph Pararajasingham, otherrelatives, the party to which he belonged, the TULF andto the Tamil people, particularly the Tamil people of theBatticaloa District in the Eastern Province.

His death has been a loss not only to the members ofhis family and to the Tamil people but also to the peopleof Sri Lanka as a whole. It has been a loss to the Sinhalapeople, the Muslim people and all the people of thiscountry.

2006 0911771178

I had occasion to associate with the late JosephPararajasingham even before I came to know him inParliament. I had discussions with him on behalf of theLanka Samasamaja Party to which I belong. These exchangeswere on the basis of the need to respect the rights of theTamil people and to ensure that those rights were grantedand achieved as soon as possible. He always respectedthe stand of the LSSP with regard to this ethnic problemand we were able to examine it as a common problem ofSri Lanka.

I must also mention that while I was the Convener ofthe National Alliance for Peace, we had several discussionswith leading Members of parties representing the Tamilpeople in connection with our efforts while the war wasgoing on, to try to work out some peaceful approach andachieve a dialogue. We had several discussions with himand I must say that during this period I found him veryreceptive to the ideas. He was not a communalist. He lookedat the problem from the point of view of the Tamil peopleand also from the point of view of Sri Lanka as a country.

As the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva mentioned much ofthe background, I would like just to add one or two points.He was born on the 26th of November, 1934 of rather humbleorigins. He had his career as a draftsperson at the BatticaloaSecretariat. He worked in the public service and also as apart-time journalist in the Tamil daily newspaperThinapathi writing stories under the name of SugunamJoseph. He first entered Parliament in 1990. He was re-elected in 1994 and again in October 2000. He wasappointed a National List Member in 2002. So, he has beena long- standing representative of the Tamil people inParliament and has played an invaluable role in defendingtheir rights in a broad perspective of achieving a solutionwithin the framework of a united Sri Lanka.

During the entire period of my association with him Ifound him a simple, soft-spoken person, gentle in hisdemeanour and who genuinely expressed his views, hisconvictions and was doing it with an intention of workingout a solution to the problem and did not try to rousecommunal passions. He was really a person in the Gandhiantradition. He did not condone violence . He was a man ofpeace and as a devoted Catholic had his religious approachin working out solutions to the problems of the people. Asa Parliamentarian he represented his electorate diligently.He worked for the needs of the people of that area and triedto get as much for them as it was possible for him as aMember of Parliament in the Opposition and I think, hewon over the goodwill and the support of his constituency.His gentle manner, the warmth of his heart and the fact thathe genuinely felt for the people was reflected in the deeprespect that the people of the Eastern Province, particularlyof the Batticaloa District, felt for him.

I would also like to say that from a point of view ofpolitics he was a true democrat. He respected Parliamentaryprocedures. He maintained the dignity of Parliament and

he felt that it was a forum where he could voice his opinionsand the grievances of the Tamil people and at the sametime he was prepared to listen to what others had to say.He was committed to a peaceful resolution of the nationalproblem in Sri Lanka and in his political philosophy hewas basically a pragmatist. He reflected the needs of theTamil people and he would act pragmatically to fulfill thoseneeds. He was convinced that the national problem couldbe solved by a direct dialogue between the Governmentand the LTTE. He was a person who always stood for a directapproach to solve the problem. I think that is particularlyrelevant today when we have to reconsider this issue of howthe Ceasefire Agreement and the peace process have beenprogressing up to now and I will say something more aboutit in a short while.

He was also of the view that there had to be power-sharingif there had to be a federal solution to the problem. Hewas prepared to support those who moved to work out afederal solution within the framework of a united Sri Lanka.I would like to say that he was also, as I mentioned, a manof peace - he was totally committed to the peace process,to the process of dialogue and was absolutely convincedthat the ethnic problem in Sri Lanka could only be settledby negotiation. The fact that we have internationalizedthe problem to the point where various countries have takenup this issue. In fact this issue should be considered aninternal problem that concerns the Sri Lankan people. Hewas one of the few Tamil leaders who was firmly convincedthat we should try to work out a solution within thisframework by a direct dialogue between the people, inparticular the Sinhala and the Tamil people.

Now, I would like to move on to the tragic events thatwe are referring to, today; that is his tragic death. He wasshot inside a cathedral that was crowded with people in theBatticaloa Town attending the Christmas mass on the 25th

of December, 2005- on Christmas Day! . The service waspresided over by the Bishop of Batticaloa, KingsleySwamipillai and along with him was his wife Mrs. P.Suganam. Though both of them had decided not to go tochurch at that point of time, they received a telephone calland they subsequently went to church. Then they weremet with the cruel bullets which killed Mr. JosephPararajasingham and wounded his wife. These are the eventsthat led to the unfortunate end of the life of theParliamentarian, Mr. Joseph Pararajasingham.

Among the previous speakers, the Leader of theOpposition, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe brought up thequestion, which was also brought up by the Hon. MavaiSenathirajah, that is, the death of Mr. JosephPararajasingham is a problem that still needs to be cleared.I fully agree with this. But the fact that it has not beenpossible to determine who killed him does not mean thatthe Government has not been active in trying to find outwho was responsible. Investigations were immediatelyinstituted and are still going on. Other Tamil leaders werekilled earlier by the LTTE, but in my view, in this particularinstance, the LTTE is not responsible.

11791180

[ ]I would like to draw your attention to an article whichappeared in The Island of Thursday, 29th December, 2005.Soon after these events, the University Teachers for HumanRights, Jaffna made the following statement. I think thisis relevant in trying to determine who was responsible. Itstates, I quote;

Having entered politics in calmer times as a Gandhian and afederalist and later caught between the vicious violence of the Stateandthat of its totalitarian Tamil nemesis - the LTTE -Pararajasingham opportunistically and rhetorically sided with the latter.Nevertheless he remained likeable and gentle in his dealings with allpeople. Among sections of the security forces in Batticaloa whodealt with him, the grief was sincere. When the LTTE split in 2004,Pararajasingham declined to side with Karuna whom he had earlierreferred to publicly as Mannin Mainthan (Prince of our Land) andMannin Thalapathy (Chief Warrior of our Land). But then as MPon the TNA national list he remained largely silent and never attackedKaruna. He was not a significant challenge to anyone and there wasno real motive for anyone to kill him

I repeat. He was not a significant challenge to anyoneand there was no real motive for anyone to kill him. Itfurther states;

The symbolism of his murder at Christmas Mass renders it allthe more repugnant..

I am of the view, and as indicated in the statement bythe University Teachers for Human Rights, Jaffna, neitherthe LTTE nor Karuna nor the Government nor anyoneassociated with the Government, was responsible for thiskilling. To get rid of someone who had an approach thatwould lead the way to negotiation and talks, was not inthe interest of the Government or anyone who wanted asolution to this problem. A person with a gentlecooperative nature as someone like Hon. JosephPararajasingham and his being an accepted leader and arepresentative of the Tamil people would aid in workingout a negotiated settlement, is what the Government wants.I would like to place before this House a fact that we needto consider. That is, there may be a third force. I repeat, athird force that is leading to an aggravation of tensionbetween the Sinhala and the Tamil people, aggravation oftension between the Government and the LTTE and aretrying to precipitate a war and divide the nation. I do notagree with the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. RanilWickremasinghe when he stated that these types of killingsare reminiscent of Nazi, Germany. There is a much morerelevant closer analogy to be drawn.

A few days ago, the Hon. Minister of ConstitutionalAffairs in South Africa and one of the leaders of the AfricanNational Congress, Mr. Ebrahim Ismail Ebrahim were in SriLanka. I was one of those who met them. During thediscussion that we had at the BMICH, they were verypublicly discussing the peace process and the lessons tobe learnt from the peace process in South Africa which maybe relevant to us in Sri Lanka. One of the major pointsthat they mentioned was that when they not only had a

ceasefire agreement but also started their peace process andthe discussions were going on - that whole peace processtook three years - through a major part of it, there werekillings going on. There were acts of violence going onfor which one side blamed the other. The ANC blamed theWhite Government. The White Government blamed theANC. They could not fathom what was going on. Then itbecame evident that there was a third force operating, athird force that did not want a settlement of the issue, athird force that wanted violence, that wanted the sale ofarmaments, that wanted the tensions to continue and thecountry not to be united as it is today but divided.

I would like to state here in Parliament, with allresponsibility, that we have to consider that a similarphenomenon is taking place in Sri Lanka. Please rememberthat even at this very moment there are more than 50 internalwars and conflicts going on in the world. They are basedon ethnic considerations like this, religious issues or eventribal issues. It has been proven that several of these conflictshave been promoted by warmongers. We have to takecognizance of the fact that one of the biggest industries inthe world is the armaments industry. Even the most powerfulcountries in the world depend on the armaments industryfor the survival of their economies. In that context,armaments find a sale only if there are wars and conflicts.

The role of those who sell armaments has been proven notonly in internal conflicts but also in conflicts among nations,border conflicts and even in world wars. So, we have to beaware that there are forces both outside Sri Lanka and withinSri Lanka who would like a resumption and intensificationof a war in Sri Lanka. There are people who live off the warand who make money out of it not only by the sale ofarmaments but also by all the other activities that go alongwith conflict and war. These forces are operating in ourcountry. They will be operating at various levels. There arepeople who are in the chain of profit. All those who areinvolved in that chain of profit will be promoting the war.This can even have an impact on the media. The media alsocan be used to provoke tensions among our people. We alsohave to take cognizance of another fact. Today, oil has beendiscovered in the sea around Sri Lanka. Oil is in high demand.The demand is exceeding the supply. Prices are going up. Inthis context we know what has happened in Iraq. Americaand Britain in particular, supported by a few other countriesattacked Iraq on the pretext that there were weapons of massdestruction. It has now been proven that there were noweapons of mass destruction; not since 1991. But what isthere in Iraq? Eighteen per cent of the worlds oil resources!

Today, Mr. George Bushs deputy, Vice PresidentMr. Cheney runs one of the biggest oil companies in theUnited States. They are reaping huge profits. BritishPetroleum is reaping huge profits. So, there are people whoare interested in Sri Lankas discovery of oil in the sea aroundus. They would like Sri Lanka to be weakened, theGovernment to be weakened and if possible to see the country

2006 0911811182

divided so that they can more readily access our naturalresources, in particular, oil. Therefore, we have to view whathas been happening in this context. Racists and their racialantagonism which blind them to other issues can be used bythese warmongers even without their knowledge. Those whohave racist attitudes are really two sides of the same coin andone feeds on the other. The warmongers feed on both ofthem. It is in this context that we have to look at the death ofMr. Joseph Pararajasingham which is up to now unexplained.But I think, if we look at it from this point of view, it willbecome explainable. So are the deaths of Mr. Vigneswaran inTrincomalee and Mr. Senthilanathan in Vavuniya. If youlook at the attack on the office of the Sudar Oli newspaper,can anyone who has anything to do with the Governmentwant to have an incident like that occurring just when themedia personnel of the world are gathered in Colombo? Theseare all matters which we should cogitate on. Who wouldwant to kill Mr. Joseph Pararajasingham in a way just not toget rid of him but in a way that would evoke the horror of notonly the entire Christian world but also the whole world bykilling him on the most precious day in the Christiancalendar, on Christmas Day, within the portals of a church?This was designed particularly, definitely, deliberately toarouse the horror and dismay of the whole world. Incidentslike these are against the interest of Sri Lanka and against theinterest of the Sri Lankan people and we must be aware ofthese and not be play things in the hands of those who aretrying to manipulate and gain control of our country, oureconomy and our people. We have to think about how we aregoing to solve this problem and on this occasion when weare paying our respects to a great leader, JosephPararajasingham, we should keep in mind what he alwaysbelieved, that this problem should be solved within theframework of a united Sri Lanka through negotiations andhe was always for direct negotiations. Why can we not, theTamil people and their representatives, the Sinhala people,the Muslim people and their representatives, have a directdialogue? We should get together. We do not need to haveintermediaries. Remember that the oil prospecting that wasdone in the sea around Sri Lanka was done by a Norwegianfirm in which the Government of Norway has a stake andone of the requests made was once they found oil, theyshould be given first rights in exploiting this. So we have tokeep that in mind. What is being said by the LTTE , by theTamil people through the Norwegians, when it comes, maynot be what is really said. In the same way what is being saidby the Sri Lankan Government, ultimately when it reachesthe LTTE or the Tamil people may not be what theGovernment itself intends. We have to keep those possibilitiesin mind. I am not making definite statements on these. Theseare possibilities and therefore in this context we must try towork towards a direct dialogue in the way that the lateJoseph Pararajasingham always espoused.

I am happy to say that there was a recent discussion whereall leading members of the clergy, the Buddhist clergy,Christian clergy, Hindu and the Muslim clergy met at SEDEC,Kynsey Road, Colombo 08. I was invited and I think I was

the only Minister who participated in this. Following thosediscussions a common position was reached. There was adelegation which conveyed this first to His Excellency thePresident and thereafter to the LTTE and Mr. Tamilselvan.There, there was a frank exchange of views. They listened toeach other. Then what the LTTE and Mr. Tamilselvan had tosay was conveyed back to His Excellency the President. Ithink we should explore these possibilities. In that way wecan avoid a lot of misunderstandings.

Today I think we are all very disappointed to find outwhat had happened in Oslo. This is not just a faux pas. It isa tragedy that the process of dialogue could not take off. Weshould try somehow or the other to get that process going. Ithink, rather than going to other countries why do we nothave it here? Rather than having intermediaries why do wenot directly dialogue? I think we would be honouring thelate Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham by doing so.

We can seriously take the responsibility into our hands.It is our people who are suffering and dying as a result of thisconflict. We, as elected Members of Parliament representingvarious political parties here have a duty by the people whohave supported us to solve this problem. We should gettogether. The All Party Conference is a good move in thatdirection. Last time when I spoke here I made an appeal tothe Members of the Tamil National Alliance to come andjoin us and participate in that discussion expressingwhatever opinions they have because it is through that processof dialogue that we can go ahead. On this occasion let goodsense prevail. Let us get together as one Sri Lankan people,as people who are feeling the suffering of every person,whether he or she be Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim or any other. Weare all Sri Lankans. We cannot allow this process to go onany further. We cannot allow it to become a major conflict, awar. We cannot afford to allow our economy which is alreadystrained to collapse. There are many predators who are waitingon the sidelines to restore colonial rule in our country. Weshould not allow that. So let us get together and pledge ourdetermination when we are remembering a great leader likeMr. Joseph Pararajasingham that his death will not be invain. Let us unite our country, let us have one Sri Lankannation and work out a suitable governmental system in whichthe aspirations of all our people can be fulfilled. Thereshould be sharing of power at the centre as well. Thereshould be adequate devolution of power and through thisprocess let us work out a solution that will help Sri Lanka toprosper and our people to live happily.

I, once again, on behalf of the Government and on behalfof the LSSP that I represent, express my grief and my deepestsympathies to the family of the late Mr. JosephPararajasingham and to all who supported him.

Thank you very much.

( () )(The Hon. (Mrs.) Nirupama Rajapaksa)Venerable Sir, it is with a sad heart I wish to say a fewwords on the late Mr. Joseph Pararajasingham. Mahatma Gandhi once told a politician who was praisinghim as Gods messenger, You are wasting your time andeffort in praising me. Your mission should be to serve thepeople who trusted you and be their servant.

The late Mr. Joseph Pararajasingham was a true servantof the people. He was a dedicated politician committed tothe cause of the Tamils in the North and the East. He sacri-ficed his entire career and finally his life for this cause.We may not agree with his political ideology but he wantedpeace to return to Sri Lanka and an end to this two and a halfdecade old conflict. It is up to us in our own way to bringpeace to this country so that the efforts of Mr. JosephPararajasingham will not be in vain.

Mr. Pararajasingham was for a untied Sri Lanka. He al-ways believed in a peaceful political solution to the conflictin Sri Lanka. He is a man who sadly watched the beginningof the conflict throughout its aggravation to the present state.He always lamented when someone gets killed no matterwhether he or she is a Sinhalese, Tamil or Muslim.

Venerable Sir, the people of Sri Lanka have always be-lieved that a peaceful solution to our existing problem couldonly be achieved by negotiation. Mr. Pararajasingham wasan advocate for a negotiated settlement. In his address inthis august House, he echoed this sentiment reflecting thevoice of his people. His voice is still heard among us. Hisefforts towards the cause of the minority will be in vain if wedo not carry that forward. He, in his profession would havebeen in comfort without entering politics. But, he thought ofthe underprivileged people in the country. That is what weshould not forget.

He is no more. There were many more who followed hisfate, before and after. But the struggle for a political solutioncontinues. No one wins a war. That was the firm belief of thisnoble person. His voice will remain with us for many moreyears and we will see the truth some day and at that time, wewill know the truth behind what he was trying to tell themasses in this country.

Venerable Sir, Sri Lanka has lost many noble people dueto tragic circumstances. It is our duty that we all support HisExcellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa to bring in apeaceful settlement to this ethnic problem so that we neednot repeatedly mourn the loss of dedicated people like Mr.Amirthalingam, Mr. Neelan Tiruchelvam, Mr. Yogeswaran,Mr. Joseph Pararajasingham, to name a few.

I wish to convey my sincere sympathies to Mrs.Pararajasingham and family members.

Thank you.

In the earlier days, when troubles started our people ran toJaffna and Batticaloa. But after Sathyagraha and all otherpeaceful attempts failed, we had to do something. We musthave some option, some alternative.

Why wont LTTE have - [Interruption]

. ( )(The Hon. T. Kanagasabai)

We can go on like this, Sir. We have been doing this from1956 onwards. It is only in 1980 or 1983 that we started theother alternative. We must have some option. We have toachieve our rights. Now everything is right based. Evendevelopment is right based. We must have the rights, morethan the salary or anything.

Once I can remember Mr. Pieter Keuneman said at a meetingof Trade Unions, First comes rights. Second only salary orfinancial matters. So we must have the right to live peacefullyin our country. In the name of Mr. Joseph Pararajasingham,we appeal to you all, consider our request and do this. Giveus a Federal State with self-determination. That is all we ask.That will be considered by our great leader.
