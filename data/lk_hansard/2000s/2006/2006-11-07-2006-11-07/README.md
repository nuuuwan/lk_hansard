Rauff Hakeem)Bismillahir Rahmanir RaheemMr. Speaker, with your permission I would like to ask theHon. Prime Minister about the appointment of a Commissionof Inquiry into the incidents of alleged human rightsviolations.

2006 0728232824

Arising from newspaper reports today on the impendingannouncement by His Excellency the President of acommission to inquire into human rights violations, we wishto have a response from the Hon. Prime Minister on thefollowing questions:

Why does the Government restrict the mandate of thecommission to include only fifteen identified incidents, thedetails of which have been given?

Will the Government include the killing of fifty fourinnocent Muslim civilians in and around Mutur and Toppuron or about the first week of August 2006, including theincident at Kiranthimunai where several innocent MuslimIDPs fleeing the hostilities in Mutur died?

The attack on mosques, schools and madrasas resulting inthe death of several Muslim civilians who had taken refugewithin these buildings.

The massacre of ten Muslim workers at Rathal Kulam inPottuvil on or about the 17th of September, 2006.

Opening fire at demonstrators and causing grave injuriesto several civilians engaged in such demonstrationsdemanding an impartial inquiry into the said incident inPottuvil.

Will the Government consider it appropriate and useful toensure credibility in the selection process of the members ofthe panel to consult political parties represented inParliament?

We appeal to the Government to respond to these questionsconsidering that it is of urgent public importance.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)Mr. Speaker, I also support this proposal that a PartyLeaders Meeting be summoned. I understand that the Hon.Prime Ministers statement has been made under verydifficult and trying circumstances. We do understand thedifficulties in which the Government has been put into asa result of the Supreme Court Judgment. There are practicalpolitical implications and as a responsible Party LeaderI would want a discussion at the Party Leaders Meetingand seek some clarity on the steps that are to be taken inthe future on this issue since it impacts on the lives of allthe people inhabiting the Northern and Eastern Provinces.

ARGUED ON : 15th September 2006DECIDED ON : 16th October 2006

Sarath N. Siva C.J.

The there Pettioners being residents of the Trincomalee and theDiigamadulla District within the Estern Province, have been grantedleave to proceed on the alleged infringment of their fundamental rightsto the equal protection of the law, guranteed by Article 12 (1) of theConstruction.

The exacutive action impugned as denying to the Pettioners equalprotection of the law relars to the Proclamation declarning that theprovisions of Section 37(1) of the Provincial Councils Act No. 42 of1987 shall apply to the Nothern and Estern Provinces, which resultedin these two Provinces forming one administrative unit, a processcommonly described as the merger of the two Provinces. The case forthe Pettioners articulated by Mr. H.L.de Silva, is that the Proclamation(P2) resulting in the merger is fataly flawed due to the non- observenceof the mandatory conditions as contained in Section 37(1) (b). That,the amemdment of the condition as laid down in Section 37(1) (b),purponedly done by an Emergency Regulation (P1), rendering theconditions ineffective, is ultra vires Section 5 of the Public SecurityOrdinance which empowers the President to make EmergencyRegulations and is therefore null and void. And, although there was novalid merger the poll required to be held in terms of Section 37(2) (a),not later than 31.12.1988, to enable the electors of each Province todecide whether or not the respective Provinces should remain linked asone administrative unit, has been purportedly postponed from time totime by successive Presidents, the last being Ordfer P5 made by theformer President by which the poll in the Estern Province is postponedto 17.11.2006 and in the Nothern Province to 1.12.2006 Thereby, thePettioners and simillary circumstanced voters of the Eastern Provincehave been continously deined their rights to have a lawfully electedProvincial Council constituted for the Eastern Province as requried byArticle 154 A (2) of 13th Amendement to the Constitution.

The Pettioners submitted that the election for the purportedly mergedNorth-East Provincial Council held in terms of notice dated 19.9.1988(3R2) published under Section 10 of the Provincial Councils ElectionAct No. 2 of 1988 was a sham, since candidate of only one politicalparty the E.P.R.L.F, submitted nomination papers for the 3 Districts(Jaffna, Mannar and Vavniya), in the Nothern Province resulting inthese candidate being returned untentested and the Eastern Province,In Ampara, being the only predominantly Sinhala Polling Division outof 94,068 only 56617 voted (less than 6%)- vide 3R2. The Pettionersrely on P3 a contemporary publication which states that the CheifMinister appointed for the North- East Provincial being the leader ofthe E.P.R.L.F, made several eemands on the Government of Sri Lanka,proclaimed a unilatral declaration of independence and finallysurreptitiously left the country with about 250 of his supporters inMarch 1990 According to paragraph 17 of affidavit 2R3, thereuponthe Governer of the North-East Provincial Council made acommunication in terms of Section 5A of the Provincial Councils(Amendment) Act No 27 of 1990, that more than one half of themembership of the Council expressly repudiated orr mainifestlydisavowed obedience to the Constitution. In terms of Section 5Aintroduced by the Amendment certified on 6.7.1990, a few monthsafter the events referred to above, which appears to have been especiallyto provide for the situation that had arisen, upon such communicationby the Govenor the Council stands dissolved. Section 4 of the Amendment

provides that where a Council stands dissolved in terms of Section 5Arefrred to above, the Commissioner of Elections is deemed to havecomplied with Section 10 of the Provincial Councils Elections Act No.2of 1998 (being the notice calling for nomionations for an election tothe Council) if the publishes a notice referred to in that Section withina period of one week.

The Legislative and Executive action referred above, which worked incombination, seemingly set the stage for a new election to the mergedNorth-East Provincial Council. I used the word seemingly becausealthough it appeared to be thus, it was never intended to be so, asrevealed by the immediately succeeding events. The Commissioners ofElections by notice dated 11.7.1990 (P4) under Section 10 of theProvincial Council Election Act specified the nomination period for theelection as being from 25.7.1990 to 1.8.1990. Thereupon the thenPrisident on 12.7.1990 (the very next day) made an EmergencyRegulation under Section 5 of the Public Security Ordinance (DocumentD annexed of affidavit 2R3) which stated that the notice publishedby the Commissioner of Elections fixing the date and time of nominationsShall be deemed for all purposes to be of no effect. The electoralprocess stopped there and has remained ever since as it were frozen,upto date. There has been no election for either the North-East ProvincialCouncil or separately for the Northern Provincial Council or the EasternProvincial Council. Whereas in respect of the Councils for the otherseven Provinces in the country elections have been held on the duedates in 1988, 1993, 1998 and 2004.

Reverting to the merger referred to above, it is to be noted thatthe poll required to be held under Section 37(2)(a) of the ProvincialCouncils Act not later than 31.12.1988 to enable the electors ofthe Northern and Eastern Provinces to decide whether or not suchProvinces should remain linked as one administrative unit, has beenpostponed from time to time under Section 37(2)(b), the last beingthe Order P5 referred to above. The Respondents produced therelevant orders of postponement marked 3R7A to 3R7Z theparticulars of which are set out below in sequence.

Thus the electoral and consultative processes being the vitalconcomitants of Democracy ingrained in the name of the Republicin Article 1 of the Constitution, have been effectively stymied.

The infringement placed is the failure to constitute a ProvincialCouncil for the Eastern Province as required by Article 154A(2)of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution and the continued denialto the electors of the Eastern Province including the Petitioners theright to vote at an election for the members of such Council whichstems from the invalla merger effected by P1 and P2 made inderogation of the mandatory conditions in Section 37(1)(b) of theProvincial Councils Act.

Additional Solicitor General appearing for the Respondentssubmitted that the condition as contained in Section 37(1)(b) havebeen validly amended by the Emergency Regulation P1 and in anyevent the Petitioners cannot seek a declaration of nullity in respectof P1 and P2 due to time bar and/or the immunity enjoyed bythe President in terms of Article 35(1) of the Constitution. Hesubmitted that the poll required to be held in terms of Section37(2)(a) to enable the electors to decide whether or not the twoProvinces should remain linked as one administrative unit has beenvalidly postponed from time to time by orders under Section37(2)(b) produced marked 3R7(a) to (z) and as such the Petitionersdo not have a right to secure an order from Court that a ProvincialCouncil be constituted by election as required by Article 154A(2)of the Constitution for the Eastern Province.

Mr. Kanag-Iswaran for the intervenients, who according to hissubmission are three Tamil persons from the Trincomalee Districtand Ampara District, claimed that the merger is based on the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord of 29.7.1987 (P6) which in clause 1.4 recognisedthat the Northern and Eastern Provinces have been areas ofhistorical habitation of Sri Lankan Tamil speaking people who havehitherto lived together in this territory with other ethnic groups.He supported the submission of the Additional Solicitor General thatthe condition in Section 37(1)(b) has been validly amended by P1and that Petitioners are not entitled to relief sought. Mr. BattyWeerakoon submitted that the Court should be slow to declare P2invalid since the merger was effected pursuant to the Indo-Sri LankaAccord.

The material adduced by the intervenients represented byMr. Kanag-Isvaran as to areas of historical habitation resulted inthe Petitioners producing volumes of material to establish thedivisions that existed in historic times and that the Eastern Provincewas a part of the Kandyan Kingdom at the time of British conquest.Mr. Gomin Dayasiri representing the Muslim Petitioner adducedmaterial in support of ethnic cleansing resorted to by Tamilmilitants in the Jaffna District resulting over 90,000 Muslims beingdriven away from the District in 1990. It was submitted that theprocess of ethnic cleansing is yet being perperated by the Tamilmilitants against the Muslims in the Eastern Province. It was

submitted by Mr. H. L. de Silva, that the forced merger wouldresult in a destabilization of the ethinic balance in the EasternProvince. Both Mr. de Silva and Dayasiri relying on the materialproduced submitted that according to the 1981 census thedemographic composition of the Eastern Province was :

Tamil40%Muslim32%Sinhala26%

Whereas in a merged NorthEast Province the demographiccomposition would be

Tamil65%Muslim18%Sinhala13%

It was submitted that the merger would result in the Muslim andSinhala communities in the Eastern Province being permanentlysubjugated to a minority which situation would be exacerbated bythe process of ethnic cleansing carried out by the Tamil Militantsas referred to above. On the other hand Mr. Kanag-Isvaran submittedthat the merger sets right the imbalance brought about by the highincrease of the Sinhala population in the Eastern Province in theperiod 1947 to 1981. He submitted that whereas the national increaseof the Sinhala population in country was during the period was238%, the increase in the Eastern Province was 883%.

Taking note of the volatile and ethnically incendiary materialproduced and trend of submissions based thereon, reminiscent ofthe ethnic mistrust that led to terrorism, violence, death anddevastating destruction that has characterized our body-politic, theCourt indicated to Counsel that the case would be considered onlyfrom the perspective of securing to every person the equal protectionof the law guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Theessential corollary of the equal protection of the law is the freedomfrom discrimination, based on the grounds of race, religion,language, caste, sex, political opinion, place of birth or any oneof such grounds guaranteed by Article 12 (2). The elements ofrace, religion and language characterize ethnicity that send to dividepeople. Caste, sex, political opinion and place of birth are sub-elements of further divisions between people. In contrast the equalprotection of the law uniffies people on the basis of the Rule ofLaw and the peaceful resolution of disputes that characterizes theexercise of judicial power in terms of Article 4(c) read with Article105(1) of the Constitution. From this perspective the physicalidentification of a unit of devolution of legislative and executivepower, being the bone of contention, diminishes in significance.Whilst ethnic criteria would be relevant to define the territory ofa unit of devolution since a homogeneous unit could be bettermanaged and served, the overriding consideration would be currentcriteria (not historic material or speculative assumptions for thefurture) that contribute to the functional effectiveness and efficiencyof a unit from the perspective of service to the people, being thesole objective of representative Government.

The 13th Amendment to the Constitution was certified on 14.11.1987,being the date on which the Provincial Councils Act No. 42 of 1987was also certified. The Amendment introduced a new chapter XVIIA tothe Constitution providing for extensive devolution of legislative andexecutive power to Provincial Councils in respect of the subjects andfunctions as contained in List 1 of the 9th schedule. The legislativecompetence of Parliament was restricted to the subjects and functionsin List14 (Reserved List). There could be joint action in respect of thesubjects and functions in List III (Concurrent List) exercised in themanner specifically provided in the Amendment. These Lists are basedon the consext of from Article 246 and the seventh schedule of theConstitution of India.

Article 154A(1) of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution empowersthe President to establish a Provincial Council for each of the Provincesin the Eighth Schedule. Accordingly, by Order 3R1 the then Presidentestablished Provincial Councils for each of the nine Provinces, including

2006 0728392840

4 PL 001590 (2006/11)

the North and East, separately, with effect from 3.2.1988. Steps weretaken to constitute a Provincial Council by election for each of the 7Provinces in terms of Article 154A(2), excluding the Northern andEastern Provinces. In respect of the Northern and Eastern Provincesaction was taken as provided in Article 154A(3) by the process impugnedin these cases. Sub Article 3 reads as follows :

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding provisions of thisArticle, Parliament may by, or under, any law provide for two orthree adjoining Provinces to form one administrative unit withone elected Provincial Council, one Governor, one Chief Ministerand one Board of Ministers and for the manner of determiningwhether such Provinces should continue to be administered asone administrative unit or whether each such Province shouldconstitute a separate administrative unit with its own ProvincialCouncil, and a separate Governor, Chief Minister and Board ofMinisters.

An analysis of the provision reveals that the law to be enacted byParliament thereunder should have two components providing for-

i) the formation of one administrative unit consisting of two orthree adjoining Provinces; and

ii) when the Provinces are so brought together as one administrativeunit, the manner of determining Whether such Provinces shouldcontinue to be administered as one unit.

As noted above, the law enacted by Parliament in terms of sub-Article 3 for the merger of two or three Provincial Councils as oneadministrative unit and for the manner of determining the continuanceof such merger is contained in Section 37 of the Provincial CouncilsAct. The material provisions of which read as follows :

37(1) (a) The President may by Proclamation declare that theprovisions of this subsection shall apply to any two or threeadjoining Provinces specified in such Proclamation (hereinafterreferred to as the specified Provinces), and thereupon suchProvinces shall form one administrative unit, having one electedProvincial Council, one Governor, one Chief Minister and oneBoard of Ministers, for the period commencing from the date ofthe first election to such Provincial council and ending on thedate of the poll referred to in subsection (2) of this section, or ifthere is more than one date fixed for such poll, the last of suchdates.

(b) The President shall not make a Proclamation declaring thatthe provisions of subsection I (a) shall apply to the Northernand Eastern Provinces unless he is satisfied that arms,ammunition, weapons, explosives and other military equipment,which on 29th July, 1987, were held or under the control ofterrorist militant or other groups having as their objective theestablishment of a separate State, have been surrendered to theGovernment of Sri Lanka or to authorities designated by it, andthat there has been a cessation of hostilities and other acts ofviolence by such groups in the said Provinces.

(2) (a) Where a Proclamation is made under the Provinsions ofsubsection (1)(a), the President shall by Order published in theGazette, require a poll, to be held in each of the specifiedProvinces, and fix a date, or not later than 31st day of December1988, for such poll, to enable to the electors of each suchspecified Province to decide whether-

(i) such Province should remain linked with the other specifiedProvince or Provinces as one administrative unit, and continueto be administered together with such Province or Provinces; or

(ii) such Province should constitute a separate administrativeunit, having its own distinct Provincial Council, with a separateGovernor, Chief Minister and Board of Ministers.

The arguments of Counsel narrow down to the exercise of powerreposed in the President under Section 37(1). Whilst sub-paragraph (a)empowers the President to make a Proclamation declaring that two orthree adjoining Provinces would form one administrative unit, sub-paragraph (b) contains an exception in respect of the Northern andEastern Provinces where special conditions have to be satisfied as tosurrender of weapons and cessation of hostilities before an order ofmerger is made. The provisions of Section 37(2) as to a poll being heldprior to 31.12.1988 to enable electors of each Province merged todecide on the continuance of the merger is common to a Proclamationfor the merger of any two or more Provinces.

The first matter to be considered in the light of the submissions madeis whether the President in making a Proclamation under Section 37(1)(a) exercises executive power or delegated legislative power. This aspecthas to be considered by examining the provisions of Article 154A(3) ofthe Constitution cited above which provides for the merger of two orthree adjoining Provinces to form one administrative unit as an exceptionto the general rule in Article 154A(1) and (2) that there should be aseparate Council for each of the nine Provinces. A plain reading of sub-Article (3) shows that there is not even a reference to the Presidentcontained therein. Thus the Constitution reserves the power of effectinga merger strictly within the legislative power of Parliament, to be doneby or under, any law.

Article 76(1) of the Constitution states as follows:

Parliament shall not abdicate or in any manner alienate ita legislativepower. and shall not set up any authority with any legislative power.

An exception to the bar on abdication of legislative power is theempowerment of a person or body to make subordinate legislation forprescribed purposes as contained in Article 76(3) which states as follows:

It shall not be a contravention of the provisions of paragraph (1) ofthis Article for parliament to make any law containing any provisionempowering any person or body to make subordinate legislation forprescribed purposes, including the power.

(a) to appoint a date on which any law or any part thereof shallcome into effect or cease to have effect;

(b) to make by order any law or any part thereof appplicable toany locality or to any class of persons; and

(c) to create a legal person, by an order or an act

It is plain to see that the power reposed in the President to specify theProvinces in respect of which Section 37(1) will apply comes fairly andsquarely within sub-paragraph (b) of Article 76(3). Hence the powerreposed in the President is in the nature of a delegated legislative powerand the Proclamation issued has to be characterized as sub-ordinatelegislation.

Section 37(1)(b) contains a specific condition to be satisfied prior tothe making of a Proclamation declaring that the provisions of sub-section (1) (a) shall apply to the Northern and Eastern Provinces, whichwould have the effect of the two Provinces being merged as oneadministrative unic untill a poll is held on the question of merger ineach of the Provinces not later than. 31. 12. 1988. They are:

(i) that arms, ammunison, wepons explosives and other militaryequipment which on 29. 7. 1987 were held or under the controlof terrorists militants or other groups having as their objectivethe establishment of a separate State, have been surrenderedto the Government of Sri Lanka or to authorities designated byit, and;

(ii) that there has been a cessation of hosrilities and other acts ofviolence by such groups in the said Province

It is common ground that, the date specified in (i) above, 29.17.1987is the date of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord (p6) which in clause 2.1 to 2.6contains provisions for the interim merger of the Northern and Eastern

28412842

Provinces as a single administrative unit. The conditions contained inSection 37(I) (b), as to the surrender of weapons and the cessation ofhostilities are contained in clause 2.9 of the Accord which states asfollows:

The emergencey will be lifted in the Eastern and Northern Provincesby August 15, 1987. A cessation of hostilities will come into effect allover the island within 48 hours of the signing of the agreement. All armspresently held by militants groups will be surrendered in accordancewith an agreed procedure to authorities to be designated by theGovernment of Sri Lanka. Consequent to the cessation of hostilities andthe surrnder of arms by militant groups, the Army and other securitypersonnel will be confined to barracks in camps as on May 25, 1987.The process of surrendering of arms and the confining of securitypersonnel moving back to barracks shall be completed within 72 hoursof the cessation of hostilities coming into effect.

A copy of the Accord was tabled in Parliament by the then Presidentwhen he addressed the House on 25. 2. 1988 (Document A annexedto 2RS). In the address in reference to the surrender of weapons and thecessation of hostilities the President stated as follows:

Peace prevailed in the North and the East for a few weeks after theagreement was signed. A formal handing over of arms took place inPalaly, Jaffna, on 5th August 1987, and the process continued in thetwo provinces with the terrorist group handing over arms. This processwas not completed as one group, the LTTE, violated the Agreement andpublicly said they were doing so in early October. Since then violencehas continued in these areas and the Indian Peace Keeping Force wascompelled to take firm action to recover arms and explosives and hadtherefore to increase their number in the North and the East. This hasgone on for almost six months and I hope that very soon the IndianForces with such help as the Sri Lanka forces can give, both on landand sea, will be able to ensure that the LTTE gives up arms and violenceand accepts the Agreement. They will then be entitled to the amnestymentioned in the agreement and could enter the main stream ofdemocratic politics and seek election to the Provincial Councils.

Thus in the words of the President himself there had been only aformal handing over of arms as submitted by Counsel for thePetitioners. The LTTE had violated the agreement and publicly said soin October 1987 within 3 months of the Accord and violence hadcontinued in these areas for the past 6 months, that is upto the date theaddress was made in Parliament. There could be no better evidence toestablish that the conditions contained in section 37(1) (b) had not beensatisfied as at 25. 2. 1988 (being the date of the address), although interms of the Accord there should have been a cessation of hostalitieswithin 48 hours and a surrender of weapons within further 72 hours ofthe Agreement being signed on 29. 7. 1987. Nevertheless in the verysame address the President staed as follows:

I will be holding elections to these Councils in April and I hope toconstitute the newly elected Councils for the Provinces. including thetemporary North East Province in May 1988.

On the basis of this Address Mr. de Silva submitted that the Presidentvery clearly intended to make an order of marger in respect of theNorthern and Eastern Provinces whether or not the conditions as to thesurrender of weapons and cessation of hostilities was satisfied.

The Address to parliament by the President was on 25. 2. 1988 andthe impugned order of merger (P2) was made on 8. 9. 1988. Hence itis necessary to ascertain from the material before Court whether thesituation described by the President continued upto 28. 9. 1988.Throughout this period the President issued monthly Proclamationsunder Public Security Ordinance to extend the State of Emergency.Every month these Proclamations were presented to Parliament forapproval and a statement was made by a Minister on behalf of theGovernment specifying the tarrorist activities in the North and the Eastwith reference to the number of murders committed, attacks on policestations and so on and a summary of incidents in the other parts of thecountry. In the year 1988 Proclamation had been made by the President

every month, the first being on 17. 1. 1988 and the last for the year wason 13. 12. 1988. The Hansards containing the statements made by therespective Ministers seeking approval of Parliament for the Proclamationshave been produced marked B1 to B12 annexed to the affidavit 2R3.The statements establish that far from the LTTE surrendering weaponsand there being a cessation of hostilities, there were intensified attacksnow on the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF). As regards the specificperiod in which the order P2 was made that is from 16. 8. 1988 to 15.9. 1988, the situation that existed could be gathered from the followingextract of the speech made by the Minister (B9).

The terrorists have concentrated their campaign of violence inJaffna, Vavuniya, Batticaloa, Ampara and Trincomalee duringthe period 16th August,1988 to 15th September, 1988, 62 civiliansand 19 security personnel were killed during this period. Inevery instance when the terrorists carried out mass attacks,security forces repulsed the attacks. Considerable amounts ofarms and explosives have been captured by security forces.

Thus it is beyond any doubt that the two conditions for the merger asstated in Section 37(1)(b) referred above as to weapons beingsurrendered by terrorist millitans and a cessation of hostilities had notbeen met.

Neither the Additional S. G nor Mr. Kanag-Isvaran sought to justifythe order P2 on the basis that the factual conditions as stated in Section37(1)(b) were met at the time the President made such order. Theysought to support the order on the basis that the provisions of Section37(1)(b) had at that time been amended by the President by anEmergency Regulation (P1) made under the Public Security Ordinace6 days prior to Order P2 effecting the merger. The Pettioners havesought a declaration of nullity in respect of P1 as well on the basis thatthe Regulation is ultra vires since it cannot be rationally related to anyof the purposes for which Emergency Regulations could be validlymade in terms of Section 5 of the Public Security Ordinance.

It is necessary at this stage to advert to the contents of P1. It has beenmade under Section 5 of the Public Security Ordinance and states thatSection 37 (1)(b) referred to above shall have effect as if thewords :

Or that operation have been commenced to secure completesurrender of arms, ammuntion, weapons, explosives or othermilitary equipment by such groups. are included at the end of theprovisions.

The purpose of P2 appears to be to include an alternative to the twoconditions contained in Section 37 (1)(b) as to the surrender of weaponsand a cessation of hostilities. In trms of Article 154 A(3) only Parliamentcould by or under any law provide for two or three adjoining Provincesto form one administrative unit ............ The Parliament exeroising thepower reposed in sub-Article (3) provided by law (i.e. Section 37(1)(b)) that two special conditions shall apply in respet of the mergerof the Northern and Eastern Provinces. Hence a further alternativecondition could, if at all, be provided only by law.

Article 170 of the Constitution defines the term law as follows:law means any Act of Parliament, and any law enacted by anylegislature at any time prior to the commencement of theConstitution and includes an Order in Council;

The term written law has a wider meaning and is defined as follows:written law means any law and subordinate legislation andincludes Orders, Praoclamations, Rules, By-laws and Regulationsmade or issued by any body or person having power or authorityunder any law to make or issue the same.

An Emergency Regulation made by the President would be writtenlaw. The term law in Article 154A(3) should in my view be restrictedto the meaning in Article 170, considering the context in whioch itoccurs in relation to Parliament. Therefore any provision for the mergerof two or three Provinces could be made in terms of Article 154A(3),

2006 0728432844

which is in itself an exception to the general rule in Article 154A(1) and(2) that a separate Provincial Council be established and constituted foreach Province, only by a law enacted by Parliament. The provisionpurportedly made by the President by Emergency Regulation P1 whichis not law within the meaning of Article 170, setting out an alternativecondition to what what was already stated in the law (i.e. Section 37(1)(b)) is inconsistent with Article 154A(3) of the Constitution and isinvalid as correctly submitted by Counsel for Petitioners.

Additional Solicitor General and Mr. Kanag-Isvaran relied on Section5(2)(d) of the Public Security Ordinance which empowers the Presidentto make an Emergency Regulation amending any law.In terms of Article 155 (1) of the Constitution the Public SecurityOrdinance, being existing legislation, is deemed to be a law enacted byParliament.Article 155 (2) reads as follows :

The power to make mergency regulations under the Publc SecurityOrdinance or the law for the time being in force relating to publicsecurity shall include the power to make regulations having thelegal effect of over-riding, amending or suspending the operatonof the provisions of any law except the provisions of the Constitution.

Hence the power reposed in the President by Section 5 of PublicSecurity Ordinance to make an Emergency Regulation amending anylaw has to be read subject to the provisions of Article 155(2) of theConstitution and an Emergency Regulation cannot have the effect ofamending or over-riding a provision of the Constitution. The purportedamendment of Section 37(1)(b) effected by regulation PI in effectover-rides the provisions of Article 154A(3) which only empowers theParliament to provide by law for the merger of two or three Provinces.

Mr. de Silva assailed the validity of PI on the ground that it cannotresonably come within any of the purposes provided in Section 5(1) ofthe Ordinance. This section empowers the President to make emergencyregulations for -

(1) public security and the presevation of public order;(2) the suppression, mutiny, riot or civil commotion;(3) for the maintenance of supplies and service essential tothe life of the community ;

The impugned regulation cannot be reasonably related to any of theaforesaid purposes. Manifestly, it has been made for the collateralpurpose of amending another and unrelated law by means of which thePresident purported to empower himself to act in contravention ofspecific conditions laid down in the law.

The preclusive clause contained in Article 80(3) of the Constitutionwhich bars judicial review of a Bill that has become law uponcertification does not extend to Emergency Regulations, being in thenature of delegated legislation. In England judicial review ofadministrative legislation (a broad label for delegated legislation) isgoverned by the same principles that govern judicial review ofadministrative action. (Administrative Law by Wade and Forsyth 9thed. P. 858)

This Court has in the cases of Wickremabandu vs Herath (1990) 2SLR page 348, Joseph Perera vs Attorney General (1992) I SLR 199and Karunatilake vs Dissanayake (1999) I SLR page 157, entertainedand decided questions regarding the validity of Emergency Regulationsand of executive action taken thereunder, which was held to be notprecluded by the immunity from suit enjoyed by an incumbent Presidentin terms of Article 35(1) of the Constitution. Such review pertains totwo levels. They are

(1) Whether the impugned regulation is per se ultra vires in excessof the power reposed in the President.

(2) If the regulation per se is valied whether the impugned actdone under the Regulation is a proper exercise of power,

I hold that both grounds urged by Mr. de Silva as to the inconsistencywith Article 154A(3) of the Constitution and being in any event outsidethe scope of Section 5 of the Public Security Oridnance establish that

Regulation Pl is ultra vires and made in excess of the power reposed inthe Presiden. Accordingly, the purported amendment of the provisionsof Section 37(1)(b) of the Provincial Councils Act by the President isinvalid and of no effect or avail in law.

The next question to be decided is in relation to the validity of OrderP2 effecting a merger of the Northern and Eastern Provinces. Section37(1)(b) contains two mandatory conditions that have to be satisfiedbefore a Proclamation effecting merger is issued. The address made bythe President to Parliament and the statements made as to the securitysituation seeking an approval of the Proclamations of the state ofEmergency in the year 1988 referred to in the preceding analysiscleary establish that the President could not have been possibly satisfiedas to either of these madatory conditions. The endeavour to amend themadatory conditions by recourse to the Emergency Regulationsdemonstrates that the President in his own mind knew that the twomandatory conditions have not been satisfied. An axiomatic principleof Administrative Law is thus formulated by Wace and Forsyth early inthe treatise as follows:

Even where Parliament enacis that a minister may make such order ashe thinks fit for a certain purpose, the court may still invalidate theorder of it infringes one of the many judge-made rules. And the courtwill invalidate it, a fortiori, if it infrings the limits which Parliament itselfhas ordained. (9th Edition page 5)

The Proclamation P2 made by the then President declaring that theNorthern and Eastern Provinces shall form one administrative unit hadbeen made when neither of the conditions specified in Section 37(1)(b)of the Provincial Councils Act No, 42 of 1987 as to the surrender ofweapons and the cessation of hostilities, were satisfied. Therefore theorder must necessarily be declared invalid since it infringes the limitswhich Parliament itself has ordained.

Finally, I have to address the objection of time bar raised by theAdditional Solicitor General. The impugned orders P1 and P2 weremade in September 1988 and the poll to be held in terms of Sections37(2)(a) has been postponed over the past 17 years by the documents3R7A to 3R7Z. The last postponement was made on 23.11.2005 fixingtha date of poll on 16.11.2006 and 5.12.2006 for the Eastern andNothern Provinces respectively. The Petitioners have failed to invokethe jurisdiction of this Court within one month of any of the impugnedorders as required by Article 126(2). It is therefore submitted that thePetitioners we are precluded from obtaining relief.

The counter submission of Mr. de Silva is that the rights of thePetitioners and those similary circumstanced in the Eastern Province tohave a Provincial Council constituted in terms of Article 154A(2) byelection of members is a continuing right and its denial by the ultravires orders P1 and P2 is a continuing denial to the petitioner and thosesimilary circumstanced the equal protection of the law guaranteed byArticle 12(1) of the Constitution. He further submitted that the purportedpostponement of the poll by 3R7A to 3R7Z are of no force or effect inlaw since they seek to derive validity from P1 and P2.

As noted above the 13th Amendment which introduced a new chapterXVIIA to the Constitution provides for extensive devolution oflegislative and executive power Provincial Councils. Although theAmendment was certified on14.11.1987 and a Provincial Councils wasestablished for the Eastern Province and each of the other 8 Provincesby Order dated 3.2.1988 (3R1) made in terms of Article 154A(1) of theConstitution a Provincial Council had not been constituted for theEastern Province by an election of members as required by Article154A(2) due to the impugned order of merger P2. The right to have aProvincial Council constituted by an election of the members of suchCouncil pertains to the franchise being part of the sovereignty of thePeople and its denial is a continuing infringment of the right to theequal protection of law guaranteed by law Article 12(1) of theConstitution, as correctly submitted by Mr. de Silva. Therefore theobjection of time bar raised by the Additional Solicitor General isrejected.

For the reasons stated above I allow the applications and grant to thePetitioners the relief prayed for in prayers (c) and (e) of the respectivepetitions. No costs.

Mr. Speaker, I propose, in the course of this Debate on theEmergency, to revisit the issue of the merger of the Northernand Eastern Provinces as one administrative unit with oneProvincial Council by President J. R. Jayewardene inSeptember 1988. This has become imperative, as there hasbeen a serious twist of events, which strikes at the very rootof and sets at nought the peace process, the fruition of whichis the desire of all peoples.

* .{ Placed in the Library .

28492850

It is, therefore, necessary to briefly recount the facts whichare relevant to this issue. They are as follows :

1. The Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement of 29th July 1987signed by the Prime Minister of the Republic of India,His Excellency Shri Rajiv Gandhi and the President ofthe Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, HisExcellency J. R. Jayewardene recognized,

* that the Northern and Eastern Provinces have beenareas of historical habitation of the Sri Lankan Tamil- speaking peoples;

* that the Northern and Eastern Provinces as nowconstituted will form one administrative unit havingone elected Provincial Council;

* for the manner of determination whether the saidtwo Provinces should continue as one unit or beseparate;

* for the circumstances that should prevail to enablesuch determination; and

* for the postponement of such determination.

2. The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution whichcreated Provincial Councils was enacted on 14thNovember, 1987 consequent to the Indo-Sri LankaAgreement. The Thirteenth Amendment to theConstitution in Article 154A(3) provided inter aliathat ........ Parliament may be, or under, any law providefor two or three adjoining Provinces to form oneadministrative unit with one elected ProvincialCouncil and for the manner of determining whetherthey should continue to be one unit or be separate.This was a general constitutional provision applicableto all Provincial Councils that would come within theambit of that provision. There was no reference in thisconstitutional provision specifically to the Northernand Eastern Provinces.

3. The Provincial Councils Act, No. 42 of 1987 wasenacted thereafter and certified on the same date as theThirteenth Amendment, that is, 14th November 1987.Section 37(1)(a) of the Provincial Councils Actprovided that the President may by proclamationdeclare that the provisions of this Sub-Section shallapply to any two or three adjoining Provinces specifiedin such proclamation and that thereupon such Provincesshall form one administrative unit having one electedProvincial Council et cetera. This Subsection too isapplicable to all Provinces. There is no specificreference in this Subsection to the Northern and EasternProvinces.

4. Section 37(1)(b) of the Provincial Councils Actprovided that the President shall not make aproclamation under Section 37(1)(a) applicable to theNorthern and Eastern Provinces unless he is satisfiedthat arms, ammunition, weapons, explosives and other

[ . ]military equipment held on 29th July 1987 have beensurrendered, and that there has been a cessation ofhostilities. It is only in this Subsection that the Northernand Eastern Provinces are specifically referred to.

5. The subsequent Sub-sections of Section 37 providedfor a poll to determine whether the Province shouldaontinue as one unit or be separate, and for thePresident, from time to time, at his discretion bysubsequent orders published in the Gazette to postponethe date of the poll.

6. It needs to be particularly emphasized that the Indo-Lanka Accord did not make the constitution of theNorthern and Eastern Provinces as one administrativeunit having one Provincial Council conditional uponthe fulfilment of any other event.

7. The Indo-Lanka Accord did, however, inter aliaprovide that In the event that the Government of SriLanka requests the Government of India to affordmilitary assistance to implement these proposals, theGovernment of India will co-operate by giving to theGovernment of Sri Lanka such military assistance asand when requested.

8. Consequent to arms not having been fully surrenderedand hostilities not having ended, the Government ofSri Lanka requested the Government of India toprovide military assistance to implement the proposals,which request India complied with. That the IndianPeace Keeping Force participated in providingassistance in this regard cannot be disputed.

9. The stage had thus been set for the implementation ofthe political proposals contained in the Indo-LankaAccord concerning the North-East, which could onlycommence when the Northern and Eastern Provinceswere constituted as one administrative unit having oneProvincial Council. Insofar as the Tamil people wereconcerned, this was the most significant andfundamental provision in the Indo-Lanka Accord.

10. It was in full realization of these circumstances and inunequivocal endorsement of same that President J. R.Jayewardene made the Emergency Regulation datedSeptember 02, 1988 under Section 5 of the PublicSecurity Ordinance by which he amended Section37(1)(b) of the Provincial Councils Act - by adding atthe end of the said Sub-section the words or thatoperations have been commenced to secure completesurrender of arms, ammunition, weapons, explosivesor other military equipment by such groups.

11. It is crystal clear that in doing so the President wasamending only the provisions of Section 37(1)(b) ofthe Provincial Coincils Act. In fact, the Regulationspecifically states so. In doing so, the President did

2006 0728512852

not, by any stretch of imagination, seek to amend or infact did amend Article 154 A(3) of the ThirteenthAmendment to the Constitution, or for that matter, evenany other limb of Section 37 of the Provincial CouncilsAct. Article 154A(3) of the Constitution was not evenreferred to in the said regulation.

12. President J. R. Jayewardene stated his position veryclearly when he tabled the Indo-Lanka Agreement andaddressed Parliament on 25th February, 1988. In thecourse of the said address he also referred to thedeployment of the IPKF - Indian Peace-Keeping Force-to recover arms. Hon. Members will recall, that duringthe said period President J. R. Jayewardene enjoyed afive-sixth majority in Parliament and could haveamended Article 154A(3) of the Constitution throughParliament without any difficulty if it was necessary todo so. It was this same Parliamentary strength thatenabled him to have the Thirteenth Amendment to theConstitution enacted.

13. Consequent to the inclusion of the new groundpertaining to the commencement of operations tosecure the complete surrender of arms, in Section37(1)(b) of the Provincial Councils Act, the Northernand Eastern Provinces were constituted as oneadministrative unit, having one Provincial Council byProclamation made by the President under Section37(1) of the Provincial Councils Act and published inGazette No. 322/9 dated September 08, 1988. Thisnew requirement of the commencement of operationsto secure full surrender of arms had been satisfied andaccomplished when the two Provinces were mergedand is beyond dispute.

We submit therefore Sir, that a meaningful, truthful and acorrect interpretation of the several legal provisions wouldbe as follows :-

* It is abundantly clear from the Emergency Regulationsthat it amended only Section 37(1)(b) of the ProvincialCouncils Act. It is also abundantly clear that theEmergency Regulations did not override or amend Article154A(3) of the Constitution. Section 5(2)(d) of the PublicSecurity Ordinance empowers the President to make anEmergency Regulation amending any law. Article155(2) of the Constitution in the Chapter dealing withPublic Security states that the power to make EmergencyRegulations under the Public Security Ordinance shallinclude the power to make regulations having the legaleffect of overriding or suspending the operation of theprovisions of any law except the provisions of theConstitution.

The President clearly acted within the legal limit of hispower. He only amended a provision in the ProvincialCouncils Act. No provision in the Constitution was amended.

Section 5 of the Public Security Ordinance empowers thePresident to make Emergency Regulations inter alia forPublic Security and the preservation of Public Order. The

Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement was entered into to establish peaceand normalcy in Sri Lanka, as stated in its heading. Whenthe President made the regulation that stipulated the furtherprovision operations had been commenced to securecomplete surrender of arms, ammunition, weapons, explosivesor other military equipment by such groups he was referringto the factual situation prevalent in the North-East, whereoperations had already commenced. No one will state thatsuch operations had not commenced. It is unbelievable thatsuch a factual situation where admittedly operations had beencommenced to secure complete surrender of arms cannot bereasonably related to Public Security and the preservation ofPublic Order. Surely, the commencement of operations tosecure complete surrender of arms et cetera. cannot be relatedto any purpose other than the establishment of Public Securityand the preservation of Public Order as contemplated by thepublic Security Ordinance. To state that this further provisionwas made for the collateral purpose of another and unrelatedlaw is manifestly unreasonable and illogical. Quite apart fromthe regulation relating to the commencement of operationsto secure the complete surrender of arms being clearly withinthe ambit of the Public Security Ordinance, the ProvincialCouncils Act itself was enacted consequent to the Indo-LankaAgreement to establish peace and normalcy in Sri Lanka. It isunbelievable in the overall context that this could beunrelated to Public Security and the preservation of PublicOrder.

We take the view quite strongly that on an independentimpartial and dispassionate consideration of the relevantprovisions of law and other relevant circumstances, theamendment of Section 37(1)(b) of the Provincial CouncilsAct by adding the words or that operations have beencommenced to secure complete surrender of arms,ammunition, weapons, explosives or other militaryequipment by such groups by President J. R. Jayewardenewas in accord with the factual situation and was perfectlyjustified and valid.

( )(The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe)Hon. Member, you may continue with your speech.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

The historical inhabitants of the Eastern Province wouldsubmit that a contrary view would inflict a grave injusticeupon them.

Sir, I think we also need to refer to certain other relatedmatters. The historical inhabitants of the Eastern Provincestrongly take the view that when the merger of the Northernand Eastern Provinces is challenged, they have a fundamentalright to be heard. No just decision can be made withoutgiving them a full and effective hearing, as they are vitalstakeholders. As opposed to individual rights, the questionof the North-East merger affects the collective right ofhundreds of thousands of Tamil-speaking people, both Tamilsand Muslims. The historical inhabitants should not feel thatjustice is being denied to them; that justice is not merely notdone, it was not even seen to be done. Sir, This is the primecause for the situation in which the country is.

It was the struggle of the Tamil people in the North-East forsubstantial self-rule, which brought about newConstitutional arrangements. The Indo- Lanka Agreementand the subsequent legislative measures and arrangementswere the consequence of this struggle and were intended toaccommodate legitimate Tamil aspirations. No meaningfulconsideration of any individuals right is possible in isolationfrom the fundamental rights of others-the historicalinhabitants, which had been denied since independence forseveral decades, and which was going through the incipientstages of acceptance.

The Tamil-speaking people of the North-East werediscriminated against, denied equality before the law andequal protection of the law for over five decades. TheSinhalese people were given favoured treatment. Particularlyin the matter of the allocation of State land and otherresources of the State, the Sinhalese people sinceIndependence were given favoured treatment in the EasternProvince. In the matter of alienation of State land, the rightsof Tamil-speaking people both Tamils and Muslims, who asresidents of the locality had a prior right under the law wereignored, and Sinhalese people from other parts of the countrywere given State land and all facilities on a preferential basis.The Bandaranaike - Chelvanayakam Pact of 1957 and theDudley Senanayake - Chelvanayakam Pact of 1965, whichwere intended to terminate State aided Sinhala colonizationwere not implemented.

Sir, between 1948 the year of Independence and 1981 thelast available census in the North-East, the national increaseof the Sinhala population was 238 per cent; in the same

period the increase in the Sinhala population in the EasternProvince was 883 per cent. The Sinhala population in theEastern Province in 1827 was 0.53 per cent; in 1881 it was4.66 per cent; in 1921 it was 4.53 per cent; in 1946 the time ofIndependence, it was 9.87 per cent; in 1953 the time of theBandaranaike - Chelvanayakam Pact, it was 13.11 per cent;in 1963 the time of the Dudley Senanayake - ChelvanayakamPact, it was 19.90 per cent and in 1981 according to the lastavailable census of the North-East it was 24.92 per cent. TheTamil population which was 74.52 per cent in 1827 had beenreduced to 42.13 per cent in 1981. The 1827 figures, Sir, areupon a religion based census. All other figures are based uponcensus reports. This was because the Tamil people were deniedequality before the law and equal protection of the law sinceIndependence.

New electoral and administrative divisions were unjustlycarved out, so as to discriminate against the Tamil speakingpeople and confer disproportionate benefits on the Sinhalapeople. The Trincomalee District, Sir, had four AssistantGovernment Agents (Vanniyar) divisions at Independence.They were (1) Town and Gravets, (2) Kaddukulam Pattu, (3)Koodyar Pattu and (4) Tampalakamam Pattu. All four weremajority Tamil speaking divisions; the first three were majorityTamil and the fourth was majority Muslim. Today the Districthas eleven divisional secretary divisions. To prove what I amsaying, I shall analyse the position in one division - theKoddyar Pattu AGAs Division. According to the census of1881, the population distribution in the said Division was asfollows:

Tamils - 3027Muslims - 1673Sinhalese - 11

Today, this Koddyar Pattu AGAs division has been dividedinto three divisional secretarys divisions. I shall now giveyou the names of the divisions, the land area and thepopulation distribution within each division. They are asfollows:

square kilometres

NameLand areaPopulation

1. Mutur179.4 squareMuslims35,319kilometresTamil28,199Sinhales172Total63,690

2. Seruwila377 squareSinhales8,414kilometresTamil3,516Muslims1,956Total13,886

3. Echchilampattai 98 square11,923 all Tamilskilometres

Total population in all three divisions is 89,499. The totalTamil population is 43,638. The total Muslim population is37,275. The total Sinhala population is 8,586. The total Tamil

2006 0728552856

speaking population is 80,913. The total Sinhala speakingpopulation is 8,586. To sum up, Sir - a majority Sinhaladivision with a total population of 13,886 has 377squarekilometres of land, a majority Muslim division with a totalpopulation of 63,690 has 179.4 square kilometres and a Tamildivision with a population of 11,923 has 98 squarekilometres. The Tamils are territorially so divided as to makethem ineffective. Is this equality before the law and equalprotection before the law? This is how Sinhala supremacy inthe guise of democracy within a Unitary State works inpreponderantly Tamil speaking areas. The Tamil speakingpeople are helpless within an all Sinhala structure ofgovernance - the Legislature, the Executive and the judiciary.It can be proved that this blatantly unjust pattern prevails invery many divisional secretarys divisions particularly in theTrincomalee and the Amparai Districts of the Eastern Province.There are forces that are crowing about such injustice, anddesire to make it permanent. That is why these forces opposethe North-East merger.

The first Sinhala Parliamentarian ever from the EasternProvince was in 1960 March from the newly created AmparaElectorate after much State sponsored colonization had takenplace. In the Trincomalee District, Seruwila was created as aSinhala constituency with a vast area of land and only then,in 1977, the first Sinhala Member of Parliament was electedfrom that District.

In upholding an individual right to equality, thefundamental rights of the historical inhabitants of the EasternProvince should not be unconscionably trampled upon. Thatwould be a travesty of justice.

The individuals purported right under Article 12(1) of theConstitution is not an absolute right Article 15(7) of theConstitution states that the right is............... subject to such restrictions as may be prescribed................for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rightsand freedoms of others or of meeting the just requirements of thegeneral welfare of a democratic society.

The advancement or the achievement of the rights of othersand the just requirements of the general welfare of ademocratic society, were the objectives of the Indo-LankaAccord, the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution theProvincial Councils Act.

The merger of the Northern and Eastern Provinces waseffected by the late President J. R. Jayewardena in 1988.Three successive Presidents late President R. Premadasa,President D. B. Wijetunga and President ChandrikaBandaranaike Kumaratunga have over a period of 18 years -1988 till 2006 - postponed the date for the holding of thepoll (referendum) from year to year. In doing so, have theynot acknowledged the validity of the merger initiallyeffected in 1988? Is it justifiable to nullify the actions of foursuccessive Executive Presidents in a matter that so criticallyaffects the future of the country? Will such action contributeto healthy governance? What trust can ever be reposed in

any political settlement if such grave danger lurks in thebackground? What guarantee is there that even after a quarteror half century a political settlement will not be revokedeven if it has been acted upon by successive Governments?

The Indo-Sri Lanka Accord Sir, is a bilateral treaty betweentwo sovereign nations, It is governed by the ViennaConvention, the Law of Treaties Vienna, 23rd, May 1969 andthe duty of all organs of the Sri Lankan State to honour everyobligation cast on it cannot be denied. Particular reference ismade to Part III of the said Convention which deals with theObservance, Application and Interpretation of Treaties andto Article 27 which provides A party may not invoke theprovision of its internal law as justification for its failure toperform a treaty. It is submitted that the Sri Lankan Statecannot invoke any provision of its internal law to justify itsfailure to merge the North and East Provinces, since as aparty to the Indo Lanka Accord it has undertaken to establisha merged North-East Province Subject to the conditions statedin the Accord. A strange silence is sought to be maintained inregard to Sri Lankas obligations under an InternationalTreaty. This has raised severe misgiving in the minds of thehistorical inhabitants of the Eastern and Northern Provinceswho are fearful that this could result in grave injustice.

The historical inhabitants Sir, of the Northen and EasternProvinces think it imperative that their case has to be placedin this assembly, and thereby before the whole would.

Procedural or technical flaws in regard to the process ofmerger cannot in any event be an excuse for the non-merger.Any contrived dismantling of the North-East merger wouldremove the cornerstone of the peace process. If such a situationcontinues, the peace process must inevitably crumble.

There is a duty cast on the Government to uphold themerger. There is a duty cast upon the President to uphold thecourse of action adopted by each one of his four predecessorsover a period of 18 years. There is a duty cast on the Presidentto fulfil Sri Lankas obligations under an International Treatysigned with neighbouring India. Technical groungs cannotbe a valid excuse for non-fulfillment of Sri Lankas obligationsunder an International Treaty.

There is a duty cast on the President to ensure that thetamils do not once again feel cheated. We have been cheatedlong enough in the past and I must record Mr. PresidingMember, that if we are once again cheated it can have direconsequences.

It is indisputable that every district in the North-East evenas per the 1981 census has a Tamil-speaking majority. In1827 the Tamil-speaking people in the Eastern Province were99.24 per cent (74.52 per cent Tamils and 24.72 per centMuslims) and the Sinhalese were 0.53 per cent. Thisestablishes beyond question that for very many centuriesprior to 1827 - in fact from the dawn of human habitation -the Tamil-speaking people were the historical inhabitants ofthe Eastern Province.

Dr. Paul Pieris, the famous Sinhala historian states in hishistorical works, Long before the arrival of Vijeya there wasin Sri Lanka five recognized Iswarams of Shiva which claimedand received the adoration of all India. These were ........Thirukoneswaram opposite the great bay of Kottiyar. Therenowned Thirukoneswaram tempel in Trincomalee has beenreferred to as Thaksina Kailas in the puranas (Hindutexts from time-immemprial) and Hindu saintsThirugnanasambandar and Arunagirinathar have sungpraises of the Temple from the 7th century onwards.Thirukoneswaram and Thirukonamalai (Trincomalee) areintertwined. The historical, religious and cultural ties whichthe Tamil Hindus have with the renowed Thirukoneswaramtemple are as ancient and glorious as the temple itself. Thisas per Sir Paul Pieris has been from before the arrival of Vijaya.This is incontrovertible proof of the antiquity of the Tamillink with Thirukonamalai or Trincomalee.

The antiquity of the Tamil people in the North-East isfurther established by the report submitted by Sir HughCleghorn - the Secretary to the first British Governor of CeylonFredrick North on 1st June 1799. He stated in his reportTwo different nations from an ancient period have dividedthe possession of the island. First the sinhalese in the Southernand Western part, from the river Wallouve to that of Chilaw;and secondly the Malabars who possess the Northern andEastern Districts. These two nations differ entirely in thierreligion, language and manner.

The Northern and Eastern Provinces enjoy the samelinguistic character under both the 1972 and 1978Constitutions and Tamil is the language of administrationand the courts, whereas in all the other Provinces it is Sinhala.The linguistic contiguity continues through the Northernand Eastern Provinces. Even the present Constitutionrecognizes that the majority of inhabitants of both theNorthern and Eastern Provinces are Tamil-speaking.

The concept of a Tamil linguistic region first came aboutin 1957 under the Bandaranaike-chelvanayakam Pact whichprovided for the creation of regions in the Northern andEastern Provinces and for the amalgamation of regionsbeyond Provincial limit. If the Bandaranaike-ChelvanayakamPact was implemented this would have become a reality in1957.

The question is: what are the terms on which peace is soughtto be ushered in this country. Is it on the basis of justice or isit on the basis of majoritarian supremacy and retention ofunjust gains? An honest answer to this question will determinethe future of this country.

We submit that it is the duty of this Government to takenecessary action to restore the status quo ante pertaining tothe merger. If the Government makes the appropriate decision,this Parliament have little doubt will support such a measureto restore the status quo ante. We urge the Government to actin this matter without delay.

We appeal to India and the international community toappreciate that the restoration of the status quo ante relatingto the merger is an indispensable concomitant of the peaceprocess and urge that they contribute their best efforts toensure that the same is done at the earliest.

I wish to repeat my request, Mr. Presiding Member, thatI made to the Speaker at the commencement of my speechthat a Party Leaders Meeting be convened some time todayfor us to consider the statement made by the Hon. PrimeMinister because I think it is a matter of tremendousimportance.

I thank you, Sir.

( + )(The Presiding Member)Thank you very much, I will keep the Hon. Speakerinformed of that issue, Hon. Member.

Bismillahir Rahmanir RaheemMr. Presiding Member, the country has been veryanxiously waiting for an official response from theGovernment in the aftermath of the Supreme Court judgmentwhich has ruled that the temporary merger of the North -East is unlawful. We heard the Hon. Prime Minister thismorning. He made a lengthy exposition of the judgment aswell to make certain positions of the Government knownto this House. Throughout his speech my only prayer wasthat the Governments response to this should not end upin a situation where the remedy would be worse than thedisease itself. Quite fortunately, I must say the Governmentis from my understanding of the statement, still ponderingthe next move and I would urge the Government that itwould be useful to engage with minority political partiesrepresented in the House before they come to any conclusionsince we have had a long history of unilateral decisionsbeing made and thrust upon affected communities in thiscountry which have resulted in very dire consequences.That is why I echoed the request made by the Hon.Sampanthan that the Government must agree for a PartyLeaders Meeting to discuss the future steps that Governmentintends to take regarding this very precarious and diffucultsituation in which the Government itself has been placedas a result of this judgment. But in the meantime there arecertain forces who tend to think that a solution for theseparatist struggle in this country is strictly a military one.That is to say to the Tamil people we can resort to a militarysolution. Likewise some of those very same forces tend tothink that the solution to the beleaguered Muslim minorityliving in the North - East is a de - merger. Nothing can befurther from the truth, Sir. And, this is why I would like theGovernment to engage with parties that have got a mandatefrom the people of the North -East so that we can come toa collective decision as to how to go forward. I urge mybrothers in the Tamil National Alliance to likewise engagewith the Muslim political leadership to see that we have avery healthy and collective approach to this vexed problemof the North - East.

Sir, since my time is limited and I am also quite anxious- sometimes the lobby reporters particularly those from theTamil media misrepresent something which I say in English- I would rather say a few words in Tamil as well about thevery same issue.

Mr. Presiding Member, we have been discussing frommorning several issues relating to the security situation inthe Northern and Eastern Provinces as well as in the wholecountry. I raised a very pertinent question in the morningregarding the Commission of Inquiry into human rightsviolations in the country that has been announced by HisExcellecy the President. I trust that the Hon. Prime Ministerwill response soon to some of those questions that havebeen raised in good faith. The purpose of our query is toinstill some credibility into this Commission of Inquiry inorder to install confidence in our own law and ordermachinery and our own security forces and also to see thatthe LTTE does not, as in the past, get away with serioushuman rights violations against all sections of people. I hopethat the Government will take it in that spirit and respondto those questions that I have raised regarding theCommission of Inquiry that the Government has decidedto appoint. In that regard I noticed that an eight memberlocal team to probe abductions and killings is envisagedand a very novel hybrid structure with internationalobservers is also being planned. we welcome that move.We only hope that some of the incidents that are sought tobe left out will also be brought into the mandate of thiscommission and the process relating to the conduct of theinquiry too would be made known to the people very clearlyso that submissions and representations could be madewithout any worries about reprisals or pressures beingbrought.

In this regard I must say that witness protection is a veryimportant element that would have to be paid attention toand I hope all those matters be looked into sufficiently.Together with that I must also express our condemnationfor what happened at Digampatana to those unfortunatesailors. Similarly, our condolences go out to the familiesof all those who died in several attacks in various parts ofthe country. But then, what we have got to realize is thatwith the Geneva Talks II palpaby ending in a failure, weare faced with a very grim future where we may be pushedinto the situations of returning to wholesale hostilitiesresuming very soon.

Mr. Presiding Member, I also want to refer to anotherincident. May I know how many more minutes I have got?

( + )(The Presiding Member)

You have 15 minutes.

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)Thank you.

Sir, may I at this point refer to a serious injustice thatwas caused to the Muslim community of the NorthernProvince way back in 1990. In fact, on the last 23rd of

October, a 100,000 strong IDPs, internally displaced Muslimpopulation of the Northern Province, completed 17 yearsof miserable life in very substandard, squalid conditionsin refugee camps. This is nothing - though it is beingdescribed as ethnic cleansing - but according tointernational conventions a grievous violation of the rightsof the Muslims which tantamount to genocide of the entireMuslim population.

The precarious life with a sense of abysmal insecurityabout their future that these people are subjected to, was atheme of an awareness campaign that was launched in theUnited Kingdom on the 27th of last month and going upto the 7th of November, that is today. I was fortunate enoughto be invited to participate in this awareness campaign whichsought to sensitize the British society about the serioushuman rights violations that had been committed againstthis unfortunate, hapless community, the plight of whomhas virtually been ignored for several years.

I do not for a moment say that no steps have been takento look at the issues of resettlement and rehabilitation ofthis community. As a matter of fact, my party and my formerparty Leader himeself undertook several schemes to see thattheir plight is addressed in the best possible sense. Buthowever, it remains to be addressed fully to see that theyultimately are ensured their right to return to their originalareas of habitation. With that in mind, not with an intentionto seek retribution but with an intention to achieve a healthyreconciliation process, we focused on creating an awarenessamong several members of the international community andwe thought it proper to start from the United Kingdom andI must thank the Sri Lanka Islamic Forum which facilitatedseveral meetings in London. I must thank some Membersof the House of Commons who participated in an awarenessmeeting that was held in a committee room in the House ofCommons and I must particularly thank the four British MPsled by Mr. Andy Love who also happens to be the Chair ofthe Sri Lanka Caucus in the House of Commons, Miss FionaMactaggart, Miss Laura Moffat and Mr. Martin Salter whoparticipated at the meeting and shared their observationsregarding possible steps that they and their party as wellas the Government could take in order to address thegrievances of these unfortunate victims of war.

We also incidentally, Sir, had several other meetings. Onesuch meeting was facilitated by the Sri Lankan HighCommision at the High Commission itself where we wereable to meet with representatives of different shades ofpolitical opinion who were among the diaspora of the SriLankan community representing the Sinhala, the Tamils andthe Muslims.

Then, again we had another meeting at the ChathamHouse where certain policy makers and representatives ofthink tanks in Britain as well as members of humanitarianagencies participated in a very healthy dialogue about theresettlement and rehabilitation including compensationissues relating to the Northern Muslims.

29172918

[ ]Having said that, Sir, I must say here that the linkagebetween transitional justice and development is a verypertinent issue which we will have to address in our questfor peace. This, I believe, was experimented by us,particularly the latter. The development part wasexperimented by us at the cost of the former, that is theissue of transitional justice. We have unfortunately paid avery heavy price for this type of approach to this entireissue. To many, these two themes would appear to be widelydesperate. But development seems to be on an entirelydifferent plane in addressing the questions of transitionaljustice which in its current usage means the effectivedelivery of justice to societies in transition from conflictto post-conflict. But some thinkers see that the two as beinginextricably linked. What is the purpose of our developmentefforts, if the very targets of those efforts are not affordedgenuine heeling in terms of their loss? Can there be actualdevelopment without addressing their demands for justice?This was precisely what the Northern Muslims who had beenforcibly evicted from the North way back in 1990 areasking the Government and the international community.It is with that objective in mind that we set about creatingand awareness campaign and successfully launched it inLondon. I must once again thank our Colleagues in theHouse of Commons and particularly to those MP s and someof those others who promised to get involved in thiscampaign in the coming years. This particular issue of theunfortunate victims of war is being pushed to the marginsby deliberate stonewalling by the LTTE, to some extentassisted by the Government also in refusing to recognizethe separate dimension of the Muslims in the peace processand therefore, it is my fervent hope that the Government,the LTTE, and the international community would, at leastat this late stage where it appears that a fertile ground forradicalization is being created among the Muslims as aresult of this neglect would change their policy andapproach towards the accommodation of Muslims in thepeace process.

Thank you very much.

Mr. Presiding Member, it is my privilege to participate inthis Emergency debate today. I take this opportunity to talkabout certain practical difficulties and inconveniences caused

to the people of this country. As you know, kidnappings,extortions and all that are taking place in Colombo and otherareas. I understand that an eight member committee has beenappointed by the Government to look into this. I hope thatproblem would be dealt with by them. I salute my good Friendthe Hon. Mano Ganesan and other people who are veryactively taking action on behalf of the people, especially theTamil people who are affected by this.

On the other hand, Hon. Minister, I would like to bring toyour notice a problem especially the Eastern Province peoplehave to face. The vehicle owners of the Eastern Provincehave to obtain passes. We do not say it should not be done.we do understand the difficulties our security forces have toface due to the number of bombs and dangerous materialCarring in vehicles. But of course Sir, what I appeal to you isthat when there is clear evidence of ownership of a vehicle,those owners could be issued with passes once and for all.This is a practical problem in our area. A person has to stay inthe queue for three, four or five hours at the police stationwhere these permits are issued. It is a practical problem. Theyhave to waste their valuable time. It is happening not onlyonce. Even after they show their identity card and the proofof ownership of the vehicle, they have to go through thisprocedure every time when they have to travel to Colomboor elsewhere. So, this is an appeal I make to the Hon. Minister,to consider this. Even the bus drivers who have the routepermit have the same problem. Of coures, they can have theirroutine check wherever. I see elderly people, children andpregnant Iadies have to get down and get in, get down andget in at so many security points. Sometimes, as you know,the security personnel who are also human beings, get irritatedand shout at these people and all that. This is one of thecomplaints we have been continuously receiving from ourpeople. So, you will have to consider this and categorizethem. There are vehicles that are being used by some people,but they are not the owners. You have to have a tight securityon them. They have to obtain a pass each time.

At this juncture, I would also like to bring the the notice ofthe Hon. Ministers concerned regarding the paddy purchasein our area. As you know, the normal life has been disturbedthere. Paddy purchase by the Government is not properlydone, specially in the ampara District. They say there are nostorage facilities. As a result the farmers are suffering. On theone hand the farmers do not have space to stock their paddyand they have to sell paddy lower than the production cost.This is one of the problems the farmers are facing. As a resultalmost 15,000 acres of paddy land is in danger of beingneglected; without cultivation Decisions are taken at thefarmers association to this effect. What have they done?During the last three or four seasons, they could not evenrecover their cost of production. So, they have come to astage Where they are not going to cultivate. so, theGovernment has to intervene and provide proper relife, sothat they would be able to continue with their paddycultivation.

There is a complaint from the Oluvil Port workers. This nota time to take political revenge. You know what amount ofdifficulties the people of the Eastern Province are undergoing.If all of a sudden 263 port employees are transferred fromOluvil to Colombo what would be their plight? Their childrenare studying in the schools in that area and the cost of livingis also a factor to be considered. when they come to Colombothey have to rent out rooms as they have to live here inColombo. You cannot get a small room for less then Rs. 5000or Rs. 6000. They have to travel up and down from Oluvil toColombo. How much will it cost? The childern who are aboutto sit for their O/L examination, A/L examination are made tosuffer. So I would appeal to the Minister concerned becausethey say that according to the Letter of Transfer, two hundredand sixty three people are at once transferred. They say thatthey are excess. I understand that there is excess staff in everyport. In Colombo, Trincomalee or Galle everywhere there isexcess staff. But, these workers suspect that there are certainpeople behind this move. This is done on a political basis.So, I do not think these transfers should take place. Theymust cancel it until such time the children of the port workerssit for their examinations, Sir. As you know, the difficulty isthe high cost of living. They cannot meet their expenseswhen they come to Colombo. They have to resign from theirjobs and for something else. The employees who have beentransferred met me and said that the Ministry offered aVoluntary Retirement Scheme to other employees-but not toOulivil port workers -where they were paid compensationand other benefits. But, of course, these Oluvil port workerswere deprived of that opportunity. So if you cannot cancelthese transfers they would like to go on retirement where youhave to pay compensation as you paid for other port workers,Sir. This another complaint. You have to consider the situationnow. Travelling is a problem.

The cost of living is high. they cannot get a room inColombo. Their childrens education is affected. so pleaseconsider the problems faced by the employees of Oluvilport. as you know His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa hasinstructed to go ahead with the work at Oluvil port. So youneed more and more people. Do not transfer them and alsoI receive information that a cadre is being created for theMahapola Centre and there is also a housing scheme. Thereare a number of other projects also under ports. You havecreated cadres but they have not considered all that. So youdo not need to transfer these 263 people if you are creating acadre, you can fill there with these people.

Finally, I have to touch on the speeches made by Hon.Sampanthan and the Hon. Rauff Hakeem regarding the de-merger and the request made to the Government. I would saySir, Hon. Rauff Hakeem was in such a position that he couldnot come out with the needs of the Muslim community. Thede-merger, I thank Almighty Allah, was not intiated by aMuslim. Had it been initiated by a Muslim and had a Muslimgone to court and the verdict was this, the Muslims in theEast would have been massacred. There would have been a

bloodbath in the East, Sir Thank God, it had not happened.What we say is that we are against the merger. But, of coursein 1987 without the consent of the Muslims the it was done.What was the result? The Muslim community in the Eastsuffered very much, Sir. so, at this juncture what is the positionof the Muslims? We are not against the merger. But, tell uswhat is our position in the future? In case the two provincesare merged what would be our position? Hon. Rauff Hakeemis talking about a separate non-contiguous administrationcomprising of all the Muslim villages under oneadministration. Not even the LTTE or these Members ofParliament belonging to the TNA have uttered a single wordabout this. So how can you target; how can just go and raiseyour hand in favour or not in favour of the merger? We shouldknow what is position of not only the Muslims but also theposition of the Sinhalese in the East. So until such time, wewould not say, Yes or No to this. So Hon. Rauff Hakeem,you should reflect the impression of the Muslims. You do notjust come and ask the Government to go ahead. Do notpressurize the Government to take some unwanted decisions.Because of the decision that was taken in 1987, we are stillsuffering. What is happening in the North-East ProvincialCouncil? We, the Muslim community, are being treated as asecondary community. We cannot get anything done. Theresources that are being distributed through the North-EastProvincial Council is not done properly.

( + )(The Presiding Member)Hon. Member, your time is over.

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)Kindly give me one more minute, Sir. It is not done properly.It is not distributed properly. Even in giving appointments,graduate appointments or the English teaching appointmentsor the nurses appointments or minor employeesappointments or whatever appointments, the Muslims arebeing sidelined. They are not considered favourably. So untilsuch time we get the right composition of the administration,until such time they say that this is for the Muslims, this is forthe sinhalese, we do not want to say anything. We do notwant to agree or disagree. You keep it in your mind. We areneither for or against. We would say, Okay when it isacceptable to the Muslim community. So at this juncture weare not pressurizing the Government. The Government shouldtake its decision impartially.

I thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak andI wind up.

( + )(The Presiding Member)Thank you. Hon. Ameer Ali.
