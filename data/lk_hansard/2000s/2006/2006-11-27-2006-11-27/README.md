(c) If not, why?

. . . ( )( - , )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie - Minister of Railways andTransport and Minister of Petroleum and Petroleum ResourcesDevelopment)Can I table* the Answer hon. Member?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

I do not mind it, Sir. But the only problem is that thereare some very pertinent questions that will not beanswered if you do not read it out.

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)I am tabling* the Answer, Sir. It is there any particularquestion that you want to ask?

* : :Answer tabled :

A (i) Sales qunatity in Million/Liters20052004200320022001Petrol439.00460.317444.034375.878327.804Diesel1,586.081,908.8351,853.8012098.231,978.634Kerosene226.60218.785235.038291.264289.724Furnance Oil1025.96813.935724.22799.059789.009Avn. Gasoline379.95376.72174.604144.456258.009

(ii)PetrolDieselKeroseneExcise Duty20.0002.501.25Effect on cost per liter%41.635.132.44

(iii) Profit per LiterKindly note that CPC sets prices based on the formulaewhich allows 1 1/2% profit margin subject to a monthlymaximum increase of 2/-. This pricing policy is adopted togeneral public and CPC has different pricing policies CEB& Private Power producers on diesel sales. In this formuleaCPC recovers only the cost based on previous months PlattsIndex/or cost of import (for CEB). There were occasionswhere CPC made losses in this pricing mechanism sincethere were no margin to absorb price variations.

In addition, considerable amount of profit has been madeby the Refinery operations and the comparative low priceof stocks as at 01. 01. 06 and its impact has been absorbprice in CPCs cost of sales.

Based on the above facts please find the profitability ofproducts that has been sold at Fuel Stations/Airport duringperiod of 6 months ended on 30th June 06.

Due to many assumptions on a apportioning the costs, shorterperiod of time the huge fluctuations of international oilprices and to the difference pricing structures the profitabilityfigures given above may not represent the overallperformance of CPC.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Yes, Sir. If you can read out the Answer to section (b), thatwould suffice.

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

Section (b)?

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Yes. (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv).

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

All the subsidies have been paid now. The other Questionsdo not arise.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

What is the answer to number (iv) of that Question, Sir? Itis regarding the total liability debt of CPC to date.

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

The Bills payable are Rs. 31 billion and long term loansare Rs. 20 billion.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Sir, if you do not mind, I would like to know the Answer for(a) (iv).

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

It is regarding profit before tax for the last five years. Thisis before paying tax. That is, in 2005, Rs. 9,839 million.Then in 2004 it is, Rs. 4,444 million, in 2003 it is, Rs. 4,874million, in 2002 it is 7,256 million and in 2001 it is Rs. 1,559million profit.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Minister, that is the reason why I wanted that Answerto be read. When an institution is making such a colossalamount of profit which is expected and understandable, thegeneral impression is that when the Government issubsidizing patrol and diesel in this country, how can youmake an unconscionable profit of this nature?

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)This is with the subsidy.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)But the subsidy makes no difference. Whether you pay theIndian Oil Company or the CPC, you are paying the sameamount. So the Government is paying an X amount that isthere. Now the profit, Rs. 9839 million is the amount allocatedfor subsidy for Samurdhi. So on that score, Sir, today thetrishaw people are suffering. The innocent people who areusing the vans are suffering. So this concept of saying thatwe are subsidizing is blown. The myth is blown. I know thatyou are fighting a lone battle. But I like the rest of the peopleto know that there is no more subsidy that is given by theGovernment.

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)No, they have stopped the subsidy now and we are keepingto the market price.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)You are keeping to the market price. So, there is no moresubsidy that is given. Now it runs as a commercial entity.

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)Yes.

2006 2716631664

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)So, on the commercial entity, the situation is that the taxesthat have been imposed can be looked at in order to alleviatethe poverty that is going on.

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)Yes. we have asked them to see whether they could give ussome concession so that we could further bring down prices.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Now the price of a barrel as of today is US dollars 58.88Last time, a barrel was roughly pegged at US Dollars 56. Soeven though it went up to US Dollars 76. and came down toUS Dollars 56, the price has been pegged at US Dollars 56 abarrel. So how do you intend going forward on this?

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)The unfortunate problem is that a US Dollar has gone up toRs. 109. therefore, I cannot bring it down. It the US Dollarcomes down-

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)Sir, Dollar management is in the hands of your Government.When we did it, we maintained it at Rs. 93. Now it is Rs. 110.This is why the macro economy- Now once again this hashappened because of the subsidy that has been given. So itcomes back again. What we said on the 17th of Novemberhas come to pass today.

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)So what you suggest is not to give any subsidy?

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)No. I do not say that. We only say, what we can do and thatis what we said, we will do. Today, what you cannot do hasbeen done and you are playing around with the macroeconomy.

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)Do you want to know anything else?

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , . . . . .

I think, it is incumbent on you, Hon. Minister to ensurethat you look at-

16651666

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)Yes. Even we are reducing the refinery productionbecause the cost of refined oil and the crude oil issomewhat equal. So, we are reducing the import of crudeoil.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)So, do you mean that manufacturing and selling is cheaperthan importing and selling?

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)Yes, it is cheaper now to buy the refined oil.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)But, the officials of the Petrolium Corporation came toCOPE and what they said was completely different. It ischeaper to import and sell-

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)No, in the last two months in fact, by not doing that wehave lost about US Dollars 14 million.

( )(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)I leave it to your judgement. I guess you are competentenough to handle that. But, all what we want to say is, pleaseensure that this Institution does not make any further lossesor grant subsidies. Ensure that unconscionable profits arepassed on the innocent consumer, who are suffering today.

Thank you.

. . . ( )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)Thank you.

Mr. Deputy Chairman, let me in the first instancecongratulate His Excellecncy the President MahindaRajapaksa for so boldly making a realistic attempt topresent a people- friendly Budget drifting away from thepast trends in budget presentation in many respects.

2006 2717311732

In line with the Mahinda Chintana, it forms thefoundation for the implementation of programmes towardsbuilding a New Sri Lanka with rapid socio- economicdevelpment. While His Excellencys first Budgetrecognized the reality that a starving population, a sicklypopulation, a discontented population cannot make ahealthy and stronger nation. the Budget this time hasconcentrated on infrastucture development strategylinking with the upliftment of the rural economy.

For the first time the President has taken the Budgetdebate outside the Parliament to the people, invitingprofessionals, private sector, trade union and the civilsociety to make their contribution to formulate the long-term development strategy.

The most important need of today is to have apermanent National Development Strategy that will becarried forward and not changed as frequently asgovernments change.

Sir, unfortunately I am given only eight minutes. . So, Iwill try to in brief to the matters that have been raised bythe Hon. Vijitha Herath and thereafter I would table* therest of my speech to be included in Hansard.

The first matter he raised was ther TGS-NOPECAgreement. The TGS-NOPEC Agreement has already beencancelled. We have paid the money, taken over all thedata and it is with us. Nobody can interfere in that.

* : : Rest of the speech tabled:

The Transport sector is one example where such frequent change ofpolicy and strategy affected the service.

The Railways was made into an Authority creating many a crisis.

Transport sector has been facing many a problem due to frequent pricehikes of petroleum and an glad the President has created a new Ministryfor Petroleum and Petroleum Resources Development and entrusted toit the task of petroleum exploration.

As Minister in charge of Railways Transport and Petroleum matters,my first priority has been to re-energize the Ministries and to regulatethe services of institutions under the Ministries. In any case, transportproblem has reached a crisis situation and thanks to MAHINDACHINTANA. we have been able to re-energize both the SLTB and theRailways.

Mr. Speaker, a thorough knowledge of the problems faced by therelevant sector was needed before prescribing any remedial measure.

I must thank the President for giving me every encouragement towardsputting to order the already disrupted relevant service agencies.

The President has created the new Ministry of Petroleum and PetroleumResources Development with a big hope of exploring the yet untappedwealth of the nation for which the political leaders of the past did notgive enough consideration.

Fortunately, a comprehensive national policy of getting optimum benefitsfrom our own resources was unfolded in MAHINDA CHINTANA.

As pledged in the MAHINDA CHINTANA. we are dedicated to oilexploration in Sri Lanka through which we can hope for a prosperousfuture.

We have been spending annually US Dollars 2 billion on importationof crude oil and other petroleum products, which can be diverted toour development programmes, if only we can be successful in ourefforts.

We are committed to provide the nations energy requirement,particularly to the transport and the industrial sector.

petroleum and transport are closely linked to each other that every timethe price of petroleum goes up I have a problum of raising bus and railfares.

Apart from the price hike, there are other problems of discomfort andinconveniences to the bus and train travellers.

I am aware that the railway commuters were faced with many difficulties.The major reasons for these were poor conditions of rail track,unavailability of required number of locomotives and coaches and theweak and obsolete systems for communication and signalling.

The railway needs a huge investment for these improvements andtowards modernization.

We are not in a posistion to increase the railfares until we areequipped with rolling stock and strengthened track to provide an effi-cient, reliable and quality service.

17371738

I am happy to state that under the direction of His Excellency thePresident all these matters are being addressed, to improve the situa-tion.

The bus transport being the major part of the transport service hasbeen suffering from intermitten fuel price hikes, labour disputes, andshortage of buses.

Re-structuring of the Sri Lanka Transport Board has already beencommenced.

A centralized spare parts store was set up to provide quality spareparts for buses.

Six hundred and twenty new buses have been added to the existingfleet and at present over 4200 buses are being running on roads.Another 1380 buses are to be brought in to be added to the fleet. Therehundred and thirty eight buses that were abandoned in garages havebeen rehabilitated.

Steps have beeen taken to sell 1500 condemmed buses lying atdepots all over the country while the scrap materials are to be sold to theIndustrial Development Board.

During the nine months from January this year 10 SLTB regionalworkshops have shown increased output and they have repaired 456engines.

A Chinese friend of mine has with the help of a local agent gifted 91greatwall engines which are now being fixed to Isuzu buses that havebeen garaged for many years.

I take this opportunity to thank them profusely.

Work has already started on reparing 162 buses sunder the JathikaSaviya programme.

Besides providing night bus services, I have also started a ladiesonly bus service on several routes.

Under the Mahinda Chinthana, the SLTB has initiated action toprovidea 50 percent concession on the fare to senior citizens of thecountry.

Mr. Speaker, the Lakdiva Engineering Services Private Limited, anorganisation under the purview of my Ministry is to be re-structed withthe assistance of Indian Bus Companies to undertake manufacture ofbuses in Sri Lanka.

During the National Transport Week, the Central Bus Stand Pettahwill be refurbished with assistance from the Private Sector.

I have not forgotten the immense contribution of the private busoperators whose service help greatly to ease the demand for transport.More than 70 pre cent of the passenger transport has been handled bythe private sector.

Over 17000 private buses are thus rendering a great service to thecountry amidst various problems including the price hike of fuel.

I have been in constant consultation with them and have beenproviding them with all possible relief.

I am happy that the President has provided them with relief byexempting from duty and VAT the importation of a new bus by apermit holder to replace an old bus. Also VAT has also been reduced by5 per cent on import of ticket machines.

Mr. Speaker, I whish to thank my two Secretaries of the twoMinistries, Chairmen of Bords and Corporations, Heads of Departmentand all the other employees of my Ministries, and all institutions undermy purview for their whole - hearted cooperation towards making ourtargets a reality.

Let me also thank you. Mr. Speaker for the limited time granted tome.

However due to time constraints, I seek your permission, Mr. Speaker,to table my entire speech which contains valuable information regardingthe various programmes undertaken by ministries under my purview.

Before concluding I whish to thank His Excellency the PresidentMahinda Rajapaksa for reposing his trust in me by entrusting me withresponsible Ministries to accomplish tha tasks pledged in the MahindaChinthana.

Mr. Speaker, I have already taken action to improve on the dailyavailability of locomotives by improving the maintenance standaardsand the speedly rehabilitation of locomotives in the Railway workshops.

Adual track from Wadduwa to Matara is to be constructed under theIndian Line of Credit while five new bridges under the AustralianCredit Line are expected very soon in order to facilitate safer and fastertrain movements.

The new signalling system installed on coastal line which was damagedby tsunami is being repaired under the Netherland Grant.

We are now studying a proposal by an Australian Company torehabilitate the Valachchenai-Batticaloa line.

I have also initiated action for the development of railway stationswith private sector participation.

I am happy to state that, I have declared November 27th to December03rd as the National Transport Week.

During this week, various projects to improve facilities at railwaystations such as refurbishing of the stations at Colombo Fort, Maradana,Ragama and Kandy will be undertaken with the help of the PrivateSector.

As suggested by His Excellencey The President, I have also takenaction to seek the assistance of the private sector to clean and maintainpassenger coaches.

Already agreements have beeen signed to import 15 Diesel MultipleUnits and 100 passenger coaches from Chaina which are expected toarrive by the middle of next year.

Selected locations of 210 railway Crossings have been prioritizzedto construct safer rail crossing by the Universisty of Moratuwa whichhas agreed to do it.

There are over 600 locations of the railway track under speedrestrictions (5 to 10 Km per hour)

I have taken meaningful steps to strengthen the track in order toreduce these restrictions.

Agreements have also beeen signed to laucnch a rail-bus shuttleservice betweeen Colombo Fort and Katunayake with construction ofspecial terminals at both ends for the convenience of tourists as well asthose who are travalling to and from Bandaranaike International Airport.

Under Mahinda Chinthana a programme to issue warrants to seniorcitizens once a year to go on a pilgrimage has been initiated.

Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity to happily report to this Housethe singing of historic Asian Railway Network Agreement in the city ofBusan, in the Republic of Korea with the participation of 18 countriesand Sri Lankan cities namely Kataragama, Hambantota, Matara,Colombo, Sri Jayawardanapura, Kotte, Katunayake, Kurunagala, Maho,Dambulla, Trincomalee and Talai Mannar will be linked to this RailwayNetwork.

5 PL 001664 (2006/12)

The National Transport Commisiosn has organized the private busesto provide services under the Nisisariya, Gamisariya and Sisusariyaprogrammes and I am vey happy with the progress made by theseprogrammes.

Mr. Speaker, talking about the Department of Mootor Traffic, I amhappy withe the progrss made by the Department. The one- day driv-ing liccence service is still contiuning succcesfully.

The revenue of the Motor Traffic Department is more than double itexpenditure.

I am also satisfied with the performance of the Natioanl TransportMedical Institiute which was established under National Transport Medi-cal Institute Act. No.25 in 1997. This Isnstitution is a profit-makingone.

During the period January to September 2006 a definite foundationhas been laid to improve the overall transport services in the country.

Towards this end the National Transport Policy has been drafted anda Railway development decade has also been drafted.

Mr. Speaker,talking about petroleum, in the recent past, we weresubjected to highly increased petroleum prices in the world market andcompelled to increase fuel prices from time to time

However, we tried our best not to burden the public too much andthe Corporation afforded to bear a considerable portion of the fuelprice increases.

During the last year the Ministry has taken sevral important policymeasures in respect of the downstream petroleum industry.

Formulation of a National policy to liberalize lubricant market in thecontry is one of such measures.

It is evident that many countries in Asia are experiencing problemsafter liberalization of the lubricant market without proper safeguards.

Unlike other products where the quality of the product will be notedalmost immediately, the effect of using substandard lubricants will onlybe seen after it has caused much damage to the engine.

Consumers would opt for cheaper lubricants unaware of theconsequences of using substandrd lubricants and there end up withspending more on engine maintenance and health care.

Also, the use of such substandard lubricants in heavy machinery andpower plants would be detrimental to the manufacturing and powersector.

In order to avoid these pitfalls, my Ministry has formulated a nationalpolicy for the liberalization of lubricant market introducing a propercriterion for new entrants.

Through this measure we could bring an income to the country imposinga license fee for the inportation of lubricants.

Further, attempts have been taken to ensure the quality of the lubricantsimported to the country.

In addition, the Ministry has taken mesures to regularize the downstreampetroleum industry addressing the needs created by the industry inwhich a number of private partcipants operating in different petroleumproduct markets.

As you know the state owned Ceylon petroleum Corporation (CPC)was responsible for almost all the activities in the petroleum industryfor over three decades since its inception in 1961.

However, the industry has undergone significant structural changes asa result of entering of other players in the petroleum industry.

This has necessitated the establishment of a legal and regulatoryframework to provide fair and non-discriminatory competition amongthe players in the petroleum industry.

Having recognized this need, my Ministry was instrumental inestablishing a new regulatory framework for the downstream petroleumindustry under the purview of the public Utilities Commission of SriLanka (PUCSL) established under Act, No. 35 of 2002.

Accordingly, it is intended to protect the interests of consumers byregulating prices of and when required until fair competition isestablished, and to offer reasonable access to products and services aswell.

Also through regulation enforcement of quality, safety, operational,environmental and emergency standards will be ensured.

Further, my Ministry has taken a number of development initiatives tocater to the needs of the petroleum energy sector.

At present, Sapugaskanda refinery of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporationproduces only slightly above 50 per cent of the countrys demand forcrude oil and petroleum products.

Hence we have proposed the expansion of the existing refinery atSapugaskanda in order to increase its capacity from 50000 BPSD (Barrelper stream day) to 100,000 BPSD.

At the moment measures are being taken to conduct a feasibility studyin this regard.

Further, proposals made to set up export oriented refineries and LNGplants through BOI are being studied and evaluated.

Moreover, my Ministry has actively ccontributed to ensure the nationalsecurity in the country strengthening the security status of the oilterminals, refinery and other important places in respect of the petroleumindustry.

We have acquired the private lands adjoining these places and also havetaken measures to acquire CPC property which were abandoned in therecent past.

At the moment CPC is paying a huge sum of money as rental to aprivate party for occupying a building in Colombo.

There fore, initiatives have been taken to construct a building for CPCHead Office out of their money without burdening the Treasury.

In the context of the armed conflict in the country, the Governmentis trying its best to supply food and other essential commodities includingfuel to Jaffna peninsula to ensure the normal life of the people there.

My Ministry has been able to ensure the fule supply in Jaffna districtthrough the networks of CPC and CPSTL.

In addition to the existing shipping arrangements. recently a ship hasbeen hired for this particular purpose and supply and distribution offule to Jaffna peninsula will be maintained without interruption .

Now I would like to move to the most important activity in myMinistry.

As you know oil and gas exploration activities offshore Sri Lankahave spanned over three decades.

The exploration programmes so far have identified two sedimentarybasins offshore Sri Lanka.

These are the Cauvery Basin to the North and Northwest of the Islandand the Mannar Basin to the west.

17411742

Earlier exploration activites were directed around the Cauvery Basinand were not successful primarily due to the absence of mature sourcerocks.

Recent seismic studies have indicated that the Mannar Basin haspotential for petroleum accumulations.

With over US Dollars 2 billion spent annually on importing oil to SriLanka the Government is very keen on discovering commercial oil andgas accumulations in Sri Lanka offshore area.

To expedite the oil exploration process, my Ministry has taken severalsteps.

Firstly, we have appointed a highly qualified professional as theDirector General to the Petroleum Resources Development Secreariatto lead this programme.

Secondly, we have obtained the Mannar Basin Seismic date collectedby TGS - NOPEC after paying US Dollars 8.5 million.

Hopefully we will be able to secure this money through selling date.

Thirdly, a Model Petroleum Resources Agreement was drafted andthe necessary regulations for safe and effcient offshore explorationwere identified.

Safety of operations. protection of the environment, conservation ofthe Petroleum Resources and a transparent practical and effcientregulatory regime should be the foundation on which to build anoffshore industry

In connection with finalizing a model Petroleum Resources Agreementand developing the regulations, the Petroleum Resources DevelopmentSecretariat is in the process of conducting an international businessforum to carry out the work.

The news of an intended bid round in the Mannar Basin has attractedthe interest of many international oil and gas cpmpanies as well as localbusiness community and are keen to initiate an offshore oil industry inSri Lanka.

The Director General of Petroleum Resources has met with a numberof these companies to explain the status of exploration programme.

Discussions are also planned with officials from India and Chinawith respect to Mannar Basin exploration.I hope we would be able toachieve positive results of this process in the near future and contributeto the national economy for a better future.

Mr. Speaker, much has been done, but more needs to be done.Thank you.

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem

Thank you.

I am very pleased to speak at the Committee StageDiscussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Labour Relationsand Foreign Employment. I would like to especially dealwith Labour Relations, Foreign Employment and ForeignEmployment Promotion.

As you know, since I entered Parliament in 2001, to everyBudget Debate under the Votes of the Ministry of ForeignEmployment or under the Votes of the Ministry of Health, Iused to contribute and express how best we could improveour foreign employment trade. I have been a person associatedwith this field for over a period of 25 years; one who haspromoted securing overseas employment to over 200,000people; one who has trained our Sri Lankan youth in the ITfield and secured employment locally as well as overseas -for over 60,000 to 70,000 youth from all communitiesirrespective of their religious and caste differences. In myspeeches made during the last three or four Budgets, I havebeen able to put forward different proposals, with myexperience. Today, I see there are three Ministers under theMinistry of Labour Relations and Foreign Employment andForeign Employment Promotions. There are two Ministersand my good Friend, Dr. Mervyn Silva is the Deputy Ministerof Labour. So many proposals that I made in those Debatesare being included in this Budget. I am very happy to seethose proposals. Even in the past the Ministers who hadbeen in-charge of the foreign employment sector wanted togo ahead with the same proposals, but they never had theopportunity of implementing them for the reason that we hadchanges in Government very often. Every new Governmenthad a new Minister of Foreign Employment, a new Chairmanfor the Foreign Employment Bureau and new Boards ofDirectors. That is one of the drawbacks that we had in thepast. We hope that this Government would govern for a longtime and would be able to implement those proposals.

The Foreign Employment sector is one of the sectors thatbring in foreign exchange without effort. When I say withouteffort, we have an Hon. Minister, we have officers, we havea Board of Directors for the Foreign Employment Bureauand we have foreign employment agencies so on and soforth. But there is little investment. This is the only sectorwhere we collect money with only a little investment. Theeffort is coming from the private sector. Private foreignemployment agencies go out of the country, speak to theforeign employment principals, speak to the company ownersand they promote recruitment of Sri Lankan labourers. Nowaccording to the figures, today we have received almost2.3 billion Dollars as foreign exchange. Part of it may befrom the Western countries, from Sri Lankans who havemigrated may be as asylum seekers. Especially after the

signing of the MoU, the Tamil community felt that they cancome back and live in this country. They started buyingproperties. They invested on apartments. They startedbusinesses. So this foreign exchange may include part ofthese remittances as well. That is not my argument here. TheForeign Employment Bureau has many functions. On oneside it has to look after and regularize the agencies that arebeing approved by the Bureau. They must promote that side.That is why a separate Ministry, a new Ministry has beenestablished. But are we geared to supply all the manpowerrequired by those countries? This is the main question.

I see proposals for the establishment of technical collegesand vocational training centres. A good number of proposalshave been mentioned in the Progress Report.

On the other hand Hon. Minister, I draw your attention tothe Arab countries now wanting to recruit from Sri Lanka forthe reason that they want to have a balance of foreign labourinstead of a majority from any one country. Especially, theydo not want to recruit more Indians; they do not want toincrease the number of Pakistanis and so as a substitute theyhave opened their doors to the Sri Lankans. Have we exploitedthis situation? Because they have realized the situation,they came to Sri Lanka and put forward their demand torecruit people from Sri Lanka. Many thousands of vacancieswere offered to Sri Lanka, but we were not able to supplythem with manpower. This is the main reason. Have we so fartaken any action in order to rectify this situation?

We are now talking about the minimum salary scale. Fromthe UNP, the Hon. Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena spoke. Hepointed out about the minimum salary scale and it wassupported by a Colleague from the other side. The minimumsalary scale, Hon. Minister and Hon. Deputy Minister, wecannot set, because there is competition among a fewcountries who are supplying labour to the Middle Easterncountries. Therefore you cannot decide on your salary. Ifyou decide on your salary, definitely you are going to losebusiness. This is through experience that I am telling youbecause Bangladesh is competing with us and India iscompeting with us. These two countries are supplying labourat very low rates. - [Interruption.] I am talking of the MiddleEast. I will come to the Western countries. I am talking of theMiddle Eastern countries, Honourable Doctor. So, you haveto compete. When you say 250 Dollars should be theminimum salary, is it for labourers, is it for housemaids?

What is our share in the labour market? The Hon. Ministersaid that our male labour-force is only 30 per cent and 70 percent is female. As the Hon. Lakshman Yapa Abeywardenasaid, we have signed agreements with many countries andthe Hon. Abeygunawardena said that these agreements arebeing signed by some peons in the Embassies. I regret hislack of knowledge. No peons are available in the Embassies.It is a delegation from ALFEA along with the Hon. Ministerwho go to these countries. There, they sit with the Membersof the Chamber of Commerce and discuss the possibilities

2006 2717911792

and the prevailing salaries in competing countries. That ishow they sign these agreements. Therefore the minimumsalary scale that has been proposed by the Government hasto be reconsidered. You already have agreements for 130Dollars, 125 Dollars; how are you going to change them?Already your housemaid recruitment has come down. Thisis one of the reasons Hon. Minister, as you said, that presentlyit is 55 per cent housemaids and 45 per cent in the malecategory. This is due to that reason. Recruiting housemaidsfrom Sri Lanka is expensive now. You cannot recruit ahousemaid easily. This is why they have reduced the number.As a result of your minimum salary scale, there will be afurther reduction. You are proud of talking about the foreignexchange of Rs.2.2 billion which is helping this country inmany ways, especially at this juncture to shape up theeconomy. But, as we know you have been liquidating NRFCsavings sent by foreign employees to Sri Lanka. That isgoing to come down. So, you have to revise this. Beforetaking any decision, you must go to those countries, sit withthem and talk with the officers of those countries.

The Hon. Minister said that in Bali he had a meeting withMinisters and agents supplying personnel to those countries.Similar meetings took place in the past as well. The Hon.Mahinda Samarasinghe, the then Minister of Employmentand Labour, had a number of meetings like this. When youmeet them you should understand what is practicallyhappening there. So, do not try to reduce the number ofpeople going abroad. Do not take action only to increase theforeign exchange coming into this country. You have topromote the export of manpower. It is a good opportunityyou have in many fields.

So many categories of personnel are required by theseMiddle Eastern countries. For example, I can tell you,employees in the technical fields such as AC, electronics,electrical are some categories which Sri Lanka has not beenable to supply. Likewise, when you take the catering category,we have not been able to supply the chefs, bakers, cooks,even waiters, captains and room boys. We are not geared tosupply them.

In the same way in the IT field, computer field, we have notbeen able to supply programmers, analysts, networkingpersonnel, hardware technicians, engineers and computersalesmen. Likewise in the construction field we are not evenable to supply steel fixers, bar benders, shuttering carpenters,masons, welders so on and so forth. We are only talking. Butis there any tangible action taken by the Government or bythe Ministry? Hon. Minister, this is where I would like tocontribute my experience.

You have mentioned under the training programmes thatyou are trying to co-ordinate with the vocational traininginstitutes, trying to offer courses and trying to prepare themfor employment. But there is one more thing, Sir. You mustalways try to increase their salary. They are skilled workersand technicians. Still we could not increase their salaries

with all the effort made by the Ministry when putting themfor on-the-job training. In each and every field there are highskilled categories. So, from Riyals 600 to Riyals 1,000, youcan increase it up to Riyals 1,500 or Riyals 2,000. So, youhave to put in a little effort. You need the fullest support fromthe agencies. You need to sit with them, talk with them andanalyze it thoroughly. So, this is where the Ministry of ForeignEmployment Promotion has to take action.

Today, I heard that Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thero hasmentioned in a Thulawa programme that the supplying ofhousemaids is bad.

We regret that statement. Ven. Rathana Thero has said thathousemaids are being sent for prostitution or to wash toiletsof the principals of those countries. Sir, you find prostituteseverywhere in the world. Do you not find prostitutes in thosecountries? In those countries you find prostitutes from Russia,Morocco, Philippines, Indonesia et cetera. They do not wantSri Lankans to be utilized as prostitutes. It is the housemaidswho have to decide whether they should work in the house toearn some money and send to have a better standard ofliving or have fun even with some principals or with somedrivers or with some other foreign workers who are workingover there. During the period of the UNF Government twoparliamentary teams were sent to Middle Eastern countriesand finally the report submitted by them said that only 2 to3 per cent had problems. So, how about the balance 97 percent? Out of the total number only 2 to 3 per cent had facedproblems of sexual harassment, forceful sexual harassmentor non-payment of salaries? It is only 2 to 3 per cent. So, justbecause of this 2 to 3 per cent are we going to stop thehousemaids? Hon. Sujatha Alahakoon from the JVP evenrequested the Minister to stop sending housemaids. I amhundred per cent agreeable with her if our country is not inneed of foreign currency. If our country is not undergoingeconomic hardships I would agree with her hundred per centto stop sending husemaids. But, it is our main foreignexchange earning sector. Do not forget that. Whateverhappens in this country income earned from this sector hasnever come down. It has always been going up. That is theonly sector where no investment, no effort is required.Whatever happens in this country, either due to war, floods,tsunami or whatever natural calamity that foreign incomecontinues to come. That is the income that we have beenusing in critical situations. I know personally, India andBangladesh have stopped sending housemaids. If you givethe message to the Arab world they can even stop everything.So, just because of this 2 to 3 per cent we should not do it.That problem is not created only by those sponsors. I wish toremind you that. Two Parliamentary teams wents to 6 or 7countries. We met in Dubai. Even some JVP Members ofParliament were there. They went personally. We went tosafety houses. We met the foreign agencies. We met somany housemaids who were having problems. We met withthe Labour Ministers. Finally, we came to the conclusionthat it is only 2 to3 per cent are having problems. I do notwant to ignore the fact that certain foreign principals or

17931794

[ . . . ]certain sponsors misbehaving with these housemaids. I fullyagree. Even in this country it is happening. Everywhere it ishappening. They are human beings. So, Madam, the ForeignEmployment Bureau should do marketing on one side. HisExcellency has addressed the diplomats on this matter whenhe summoned them to this country recently. I fully welcomethis. I applaud the act of His Excellency the President. Theembassies are just idling. On one hand I know that theembassies are not being provided with sufficient funds andon the other hand, there is no proper communication betweenthe Ministry of Foreign Employment and the ForeignEmployment Bureau and the embassies. They must dopromotion. They must sell our country. They must sell ourmanpower. They must promote our tourism. They mustpromote our exports.

( )(The Hon. Athauda Senaviratne)You cannot sell our country.

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)

Not our country. To sell the country means - you shouldunderstand my Friend - sell our resources which are beingexported. This is what I meant and not to sell our country toforeigners. I am not talking to a child here. I am talking to225 well recognized MPs here. It is the people who havechosen them to be here. So, I expect them to understandwhat I mean.

What I say is, the embassies are idling. I applaud the actiontaken by His Excellency the President - [Interruption.] Thatis why I am asking you to do it without delay because themore you delay those countries might think that recruitmentfrom Sri Lanka is very difficult and they cannot find peopleaccording to their requirements? On the other hand, there aresome restrictions by the Foreign Employment Bureau withregard to the minimum salary, the number of documentsneeded and all that. As you know, this is a competitivebusiness. We need this business. So we must be able tosupply people.

Another area which is very important is the area of nursingon which I have been speaking in every debate. After all,I heard that you have got the Cabinet approval. I do notknow how you are going to get over the problems ofthe Nurses Union which is headed by a veteran Buddhistpriest -

( )(The Hon. Athauda Senaviratne)They agreed on that decision.

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)

Admitted? Okay. If they have agreed, that is well and goodfor the country, Sir. We need to move this country forward.This is a beautiful country. I am one who is travelling acrossthe world. I feel so sorry about our country. While ourneighbouring countries are prospering, we are fighting witheach other. By that we are bringing down our economy tothe ground. Therefore, Madam, quick action should betaken.

The area of nursing is one on which, I hope, theGovernment, can do something. You must always invite theprivate sector to form joint ventures. You can even call inleading private hospitals like the Apollo Hospital becauseyou know, without a hospital you cannot train the nurses.You can call in the Apollo Hospital, the Asiri Hospital, theOasis Hospital and the Nawaloka Hospital to set up nursingschools as a joint venture with the Government. This is agoldmine, I should say. It is not only in the Middle Easterncountries that you have vacancies for nurses. If you work ina Middle East country for three years you are automaticallyqualified to work in Western countries like the UK, Canada,Germany et cetera.

We are late in taking action. But anyhow you have gotthe approval to set up an English Medium Nurses TrainingInstitute to train nurses for the foreign job market. But Iwant to say, before you conduct a three year diploma course,you should conduct a one year English course. You canattach them to any university or you can set up a new campusfor that purpose. This is an investment where you can earnmore and more foreign exchange, Madam. Definitely this isa goldmine. Rather than looking for some other ventures,these are opportunities available in front of us. Why do younot explore them? We should take immediate action andgive a chance to the private sector. The Government sectoralone cannot do this because again there is a problem withfinances. You need a lot of finance. You should have anintegrated programme. You can train people in English andsend these trained people to Middle Eastern countries forfurther training. If they work for three years in a MiddleEastern country, they will get a good training because allthe apparatus that are being used there are sophisticatedones. There are sophisticated apparatus in the Westerncountries.

I know personally that 3000 to 4000 nurses and paramedicsare being recruited every year. Those days the Ministry ofHealth in Oman used to come here every year and recruit 200to 300 people.

( + )(The Presiding Member) , .

2006 2717951796

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)

Okay. I am finishing. They used to recruit 200 to 300surgeons and nurses. Now they do not come because of theproblem of language. That is one area you have already gotto accommodate. I urge you to take appropriate action. Justadopting it and getting the approval is not going to helpyou, Madam. You have to bring in private foreignparticipation. That is one thing.

The second thing, Madam, I want to mention is about thecontribution from the private foreign employment agencies.There are good ones and bad ones as well. Have you giventhem any incentive so far? I am talking on behalf of theprivate foreign employment agencies because they have theirgrievances. They asked me to mention these to you. Haveyou given any incentives to them so far? With regard to theSri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment Act, No.4 of 1994where an agency has secured employment for any personoutside Sri Lanka, the SLBFE has to pay the agency two-thirds out of the sum paid to the SLBFE by such person. Atpresent each category is paying different amounts rangingfrom Rs.5,700 to Rs.15,000, but tax exemptions are givenonly for Rs. 2000. So, you have to consider giving furtherexemptions on that. These foreign employment agencies arebringing in foreign exchange. Have you given them anyconcession as you promised those days such as a duty freecar? That was contemplated by you and by former ministers.You have not done anything.

On the other hand, as far as the airport tax is concerned,you charge Rs.1,500 on top of the air ticket and you sayRs.500 for airport maintenance and Rs.1000 for tourism. Wedo not know why we should pay for tourism. Why do younot charge only for airport maintenance and pay the balanceof Rs. 1000 to the employment agencies.

( + )(The Presiding Member) , .

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)

Yes, I will finish. This is one area I would like to requestyou to consider. As you know, today out of about 200,000to 250,000 students, only 10 per cent are able to enter theuniversities. The balance is left out. You should take stepsto find them employment. We can send the balance lot totechnical colleges and vocational training institutes. Whydo you not encourage them for foreign employment? So,this is one area you have to consider. When you say, foreignemployment they do not have any confidence. They alwayswant to enter the universities and become doctors, engineersor graduates. But, when they are deprived of the chance ofentering the universities, they think that they are useless. So,

you have to concentrate on these people. For that, you haveto have high-tech technical colleges and give them hightechnological training. That is one thing.

I am glad that the Government is sending a number ofLTTEers for foreign employment. I welcome that effort. Thisopportunity should also be given to the people of the tsunamiaffected areas, to the victims of other calamities and youthfrom flood, earthslip and cyclone affected areas. Madam, theForeign Employment Bureau is sending people to Koreaand other countries. Why do you not consider giving thisopportunity to a few number of those victims affected bynatural calamities? I applaud your action. You have givenforeign employment for the LTTEers who have surrendered.I have to thank you on behalf of their families.

Thank you very much.
