But in the case of consumers,if they use electricity and do not pay the bills, the ElectricityBoard disconnects the lines. But, what the Venerable Therowas saying is totally wrong. also he cannot say somethinglike that.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Mr. Speaker, we have no objections to the appointment ofa Select Committee to consider any improvements to theprovisions of the Constitution relating to the appointment ofa Constitutional Council. If there are deficiencies, they needto be corrected. But, it is our respectful submission, Sir, thatthe present provisions in the Constitution pertaining to theappointment of the Constitutional Council are clear enoughand that there is no reason for any delay in the appointmentof the Constitutional Council.

I make this submission, Sir, as the Leader of the politicalparty having the largest number of Members in Parliamentother than the parties to which the Hon. Prime Minister andthe Hon. Leader of the Opposition belong. Before the lastConstitutional Council was appointed, the JVP was in theposition in which we are now. They had the largest number of

Members of Parliament as a party other than the parties towhich the Hon. Prime Minister and the Hon. Leader of theOpposition belonged and we agreed to their nominee beingappointed to the Constitutional Council. Today, not merelythe TNA, but also the SLMC and the Up country PeoplesFront totally, in all 29 Members of Parliament, have nominateda person as our nominee to the Constitutional Council and interms of the present provisions relating to the appointmentof that member, there is no reason whatever not to act uponthe recommendation made by us. The law is clear; ourrecommendation is clear and the Constitutional Councilshould have been appointed quite some time ago. We madethis recommendation as early as 2005 and we have repeatedthe recommendation even this year, but the appointment hasnot yet been made. Therefore, I am inclined to the view thatwhile amendments to the law may be required, the delay inthe appointment of the Constitutional Council is unjustifiedand indicates a lack of will on the part of the main parties tocomply with the provisions of the Constitution which aremeant to achieve certain purposes, that is, non-politicizecertain institutions in this country. I am afraid, it is my viewand the view of my party, that the main parties in this countryare unable to honestly contribute to the achievement of thatobjective. I, therefore, request, Sir, that while the SelectCommittee be appointed to consider the question of reformsto the constitutional provisions, the Constitutional Councilbe appointed and that the nominee of the parties to which theHon. Prime Minister and the Hon. Leader of the Oppositiondo not belong be accepted as the nominee that we, 29Members of Parliament belonging to the Ilankai Tamil ArasuKadchi, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and the Up countryPeoples Front, have nominated.

I thank you.

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

Mr. Speaker, I am quite glad that all parties have agreed toparticipate in this Select Committee to resolve the differenceof opinion that is there among parties represented inParliament. I do concur with what my Colleague, the Hon.Sampanthan, mentioned to you a while ago.

While not being at cross purposes with what he said, I amfaced with another problem from today onwards in mycapacity as the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee.Today the Auditor-General is retiring and he is the principalofficer who assists the Public Accounts Committee and hisappointment, too, comes within the purview of theConstitutional Council. Therefore, I believe that all partiesmust try and resolve this issue fast. At least in the case of theAuditor-General, if we can come to some interim agreementbetween the parties to allow the President to make anappointment, it will assist to conduct the work of the PublicAccounts Committee without a hindrance.

Thank you.

That the Bill be now read a Second time.

I would like to present the Sri Lanka Institute of StrategicStudies (Amendment) Bill providing for the establishment ofthe Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of InternationalRelations and Strategic Studies on the eve of the first deathannivesary of the late Hon. Kadirgamar.

With your permission, Sir, I would very briefly outline someof the objectives of this Institution. As you know, the launchof this institution has been a dream Minister Kadirgamar hadsince he first became the Foreign Minister in 1994. His dreamwas to create and independent multi-disciplinary researchinstitute capable of analysing Sri Lankas strategic interest inthe contemporary global environment. This institute is afitting legacy for a man who was a shining beacon of dignityand peace and as a tribute to his vision, Her Excellency theformer President and the Government of Sri Lanka decided torename it, the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of InternationalRelations and Strategic Studies. In fact, Mr. Speaker, thedecision to establish this Institute was pursuant to a decisionof the Cabinet of Ministers on an initiative taken by HisExcellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, the then Prime Minister as atribute and in recognition to the relentless efforts made bythe late Lakshman Kadirgamar to safeguard the countryssovereignty, independence and terriltorial integrity and alsohis commitment to ensure a just and fair solution to thenational problems.

347348

[ ]Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would also like to say that theInstitute once established will carry out policy researchcatering to our national interest as well as function as a forumwhere policy makers, academics and practitioners ofdiplomacy and foreign relations can meet, develop ideas andbuild capacity related to national policy formulation in thesevital sectors. Possible areas of research would include nationalsecurity interest in the context of the ongoing peace process,peace building and post conflict scenario and also Sri Lankasstrategic interest in the present global context across thespectrum of issues ranging from the economy andenvironment to national security. The Institute will furtherestablished links with similar institutions from around theworld and jointly work on projects of mutual interst. I wouldagain like to take this opportunity to thank all the politicalparties and the Party Leaders for agreeing to pass this Billunopposed and without a debate.

I thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for allocating time for meto speak on this Emergency Debate. I am especially glad tobe speaking whilst you are present in the Chair.

I was fortunate to catch the last part of the speech made byyour very good and honourable brother, the Leader of theMahajana Eksath Peramuna. I was quite taken aback by theemotion in his speech. The tenor of the speech was such thatit was almost as if he could not contain himself. The angerwas very clear from his body language and from the words hewas using. Then, Sir, I was compelled to think as to why thisGentleman, who is from a respectable political family, whosefather happened to be a very distinguished Member of thisHouse, happened to have such vigour in his speech whichsounded, almost like venom being spat out. That is when Irealized that clearly the problem here is that people such ashimself and people who are of similar opinions are mostdisturbed when they talk about the ethnic conflict becauseof the LTTE factor. That is the truth, because all those whoare not sincere in wanting to address the legitimate politicalaspirations of the Tamil people cannot stand the LTTE. Why?They are not like ordinary Tamil Parliamentarians, whether itbe the TNA, whether it be the former TULF, whether it be theFederal Party or the All Ceylon Tamil Congress. These arepeople who do not simply come, talk, plead, try and makea case out and expect things to happen. Here is anorganization that essentially is not prepared to be cheatedagain, unlike us, who are being cheated even today. Here isan organization that has the ability to do something about it.If they are cheated, they will make sure that the Government

learns a lesson. That is the reality. So, if you are not sincere inwanting to address Tamil grievances, Tamil politicalaspirations, if you do not want to share power with the Tamilsand if you are hell-bent on maintaining Sinhala hegemonyover the Tamil people, then, the LTTE is a problem.

Sir, this is probably the bloodiest week we have had in thelast five years. There has been a war that is being waged bythe Government in Trincomalee and is by the Government.But, what does the Government say? The Government triesto justify their military actions, whether it be in Mavil Aru orthe larger Trincomalee District, on the basis that Mavil Aruwas a plce that was under Government control at the time theCeasefire Agreement was signed. The Governments righthand, the JVP and the Governments left hand, the JHU veryclearly make this case out. And they blame the UNP forsigning the Ceasefire Agreement and in the name of peace,for allowing the LTTE, according to them, to move in afterthe signing of the Ceasefire Agreement to places like MavilAru and Sampur. That is the case and therefore, the LTTEthat has moved into Mavil Aru today has chosen to close thesluice gates and has deprived the innocent people of water.But this very same JVP and this very same Government thataccuse the UNP Government, in that first two and a half years,of betraying the military and allowing the LTTE to moveinto places like Mavil Aru and Sampur, also say that theirMember of Parliament for Trincomalee has gone to MavilAru four times apparently, since 2004 and therefore, the LTTEcould not have been in control of Mavil Aru and that it hashappened subsequently. Is there not a contradiction, Sir? Ifthe UNP is being blamed for allowing the LTTE to havemoved into Mavil Aru, how on earth could the Hon. JayanthaWijesekara, the JVP Member of Parliament, have gone intoMavil Aru since 2004? Is there not a contradiction? This iswhat happens when you begin to lie. There is no end to it.You have to repeat lies, one lie after another to cover the firstone. That is what is happening.

No, Sir, the Government was never in control of Mavil Aruwhen the Ceasefire Agreement was signed, nor of Sampur. Itwas the LTTE that was in control of these places for years, atthe very least since 1997. But, why does the Governmenthave to lie in this despicable way today to justify theirmilitary actions? They call it limited. It might be limited.But, why? We are dealing with a Government that is notprepared to address the Tamil political aspirations. We aredealing with a Government that wants to maintain Sinhalahegemony in this country, that wants to hold on to themonopoly of power. Such a Government cannot afford toengage in the peace process. So, they have to prepare for war.If you are not prepared to engage with the Tamil people inthe peace process, you have to prepare for war. That is thereality. If the Government is to successfully, at least, try andfight that war, they need to safeguard the Trincomalee Harbour.It is because they need to safeguard the Trincomalee Harbourthat today, despite the Ceasefire Agreement, thisGovernment lies to its people blatantly and shamelessly totry and justify the capture of Mavil Aru and Sampur. That is

2006 11365366

the reality, Sir. It is in that backdrop that we are debating thisEmergency Proclamation. So, Sir, the reality is that 50 yearsafter being cheated by these Sinhalese leaders, 50 years afterbeing cheated repeatedly, even today there are those of us,probably even myself, when this peace process commencedin 2001, who felt that may be we have a chance, may be theseguys would finally do something just, may be we can livetogether. At least today, let us realize that this Governmentwill never do justice by the Tamil people and at least today,let the Tamil people realize that this Government is hell-benton waging a war, if not to destroy the Tamil people, at thevery least, to incapacitate them.

( )(An Hon. Member)

Did you realize it last November?

. . ( )(The Hon. G. G. Ponnambalam)

It is not a question of not realizing.

I know the Hon. Member, who is a fairly prominentMember of the UNP, is frustrated that the Tamil people boy-cotted the Presidential Election and thereby his good leaderwas unable to win. That is not the point. The point is notabout the Tamil people having to support a Sinhalese leaderwho has to deliver on peace to come to power. No. It is theSinhalese people who should back him. There is no point inthe Tamil people or the minorities propping up a Sinhaleseleader. Your Leader got only 35 per cent of the Sinhala vote.What does that mean? He is not even able to sell that policythat he has towards the ethnic problem to his own people.What would have happened? He would have spoken theright thing. He would have made all the right noises. Hecertainly would have said all the right things to appease theinternational community. But what of the Tamil people? Hewould have never been able to deliver until the interna-tional community realizes the fundamental mind set of theSinhalese people and until the iternational community con-vinces the Sinhalese people. The Tamils connot do it. Youcannot do it. It is the international community that has theleverage. It is to bring this fundamental factor out that theTamil people chose to boycott the presidential Election.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)

Hon. Ponnambalam, you have completed ten minutes.

. . ( )(The Hon. G. G. Ponnambalam)

I will take some more time, Sir. I think we have nearly 50minutes. I will take a little more time.

So, this is the reality, Sir. We are dealing with a Governmentthat is going to wage war, whether the Tamil people, whetherthe Sinhala moderates or whether the Muslim people like it

or not. That is the reality. The very hon. Members of theMuslim community, Leaders of the Muslim community werevery passionate in their pronouncements yesterday. Of course,they have to be. I do not blame them for faulting the LTTEthinking that the LTTE had ulterior motives. But these mostrespected Muslim leaders must also understand that the Tamilpeople have come this far not for anyone else but thatorganization called the LTTE. If the Tamil people who havebeen talking about self - rule, if the Tamil people who havebeen talking about autonomy, today enjoy autonomy in anypart of this Island, it is beacause of the LTTE. It is becausethey have created a de facto state. It is not because of talkingwith the gentlemen across. It is not because the Governmenthas chosen to engage with us and give us autonomy. Thatposition fundamentally cannot escape us. I would urge theMuslim leaders to understand that. I do certainly understandthe suffering that has been caused and certainly there werecertain specific instances that were raised. Our position whenwe met the Hon. Rauff Hakeem a few days ago was veryclear. If the LTTE does not treat the Muslim people well, ifthe larger Tamil community does not treat the Muslim peoplewell, it is we who are the losers. It is our struggle that will notbe just. We have no doubts about that. The LTTE topleadership does not have doubts about that. That we know.But if there are problems and if problems have been caused,then the LTTE must address those problems. There are nodoubts whatsoever on that score. But let our Muslim leadersalso understand when they complain about the LTTEsactions, particularly the military actions, the military stepswhat is actually going on. That is this military agenda andthat is this military option. Sir, let the Muslim leaders alsounderstand that this is not really about the Tamils. It is aboutanyone who aspires to contest Sinhala hegemony in thiscountry. For example, there is a Muslim Moulavi, agentleman by the name of Mohamed Zaheel. He is an ardentsupporter of Tamil nationalism. He believes in the Tamilcause. So much so, that he is in fact a local Governmentnominee of the TNA the Jaffna Municipal Coucil. On the9th of this month, Sir, this revered man was abducted by thesecurity forces. He was in Puttalam. Why? Here is a MuslimMoulavi who truly believes in the Tamil cause. He believesin living with the Tamils. He believes that the Tamil peoplemust be allowed to manage their own affairs. He believesthat Sinhala monopoly of power must end. So, he is abductedby the security forces and the day the Muslim leadershipstands up and challenges this Sinhala majoritarianism theywill suffer the same consequences, indignities and massacresthat the Tamil people are suffering. That they mustunderstand.

Therefore, Sir, let me conclude this Debate by saying toour Tamil people and if the international community wantsto listen to them as well, let us stop fooling ourselves. Thispeace process is dying and unless the internationalcommunity intervenes and makes it impossible for the SriLankan state to wage war, this peace process will die and noamount of wanting this peace process to carry on, no amountof lip - service paid by the President or by his Government

367368

[ . . ]

will ever save this process and that is a reality that at leasttoday that we must understand. This is not a war against theLTTE, Sir. This is a war that is systematically waged againstthe Tamil people and anyone who supports the Tamil people.Today 55,000 civilians are displaced in Vakarai. Fifty fivethousand civilians! How can you justify the displacementof those people? They are bombed. When these people aremoving they are chased, they are bombed. How can youjustify that? How can you justify that action as being anaction against the LTTE? This is genocide, Sir. We reactedto it late in Rwanda. We will react to it late here. But, noTamil should accept this nonsense. No Tamil can expect toaccept this. Let them stand up. They might be killed. But, letthem stand up and be counted for. This might be our lasthour, Sir. But, let it also be our greatest hour.

Thank you, Sir.

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem

Mr. Deputy Speaker, I am glad to follow the young man theHon. Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam who made a verypassionate and reasoned speech. He too like the Hon.Minister Dinesh Gunawardena comes from a very proudlineage. His grandfather and his father were eminent lawyers.One trait in both of them was, they were quite clever in doingjustice to their briefs. None of their clients would ever havedisputed that. I must certainly appreciate that the young manhas a level-head on his shoulders. I wish him very well. Hedealt with the Muslim dimension from the point of view ofhis brief. I have a different brief, a brief with a specificmandate from my own people. My late leader and his fatherwere great colleagues, very close friends. I haveaccompanied my late leader to Gajens house. In fact, I pointedout to him when I met him last time in his house that I havefond memories of his house. But, then we are living in adifferent era today. This is not the ,70s, 80s, or, 90s. We are inthe new millennium where the entire peace process has takena different turn. The LTTE, in my opinion, is no more abelligerent force in a sovereign country. It has at leastbecome an accepted non-state actor which the LTTE maydispute. It has its obligations which flows from the CeasefireAgreement to which the LTTE still shows its adherencethough it is being observed in the breach both by theGovernment and the LTTE. It is true that we met the TNAParliamentarians when the Mutur siege took place, toattempt in whatever small way we could and to see thathumanitarian assistance could go in with a declaration of atleast a temporary cessation of hostilities by the LTTE and theGovernment. They gave us a good hearing. We are also awarethat there are limitations to the TNA being interlocutors inthis case. But, with all that, we do not jump on the emotionaland sentimental bandwagon of some of the slogan shoutingMuslim Ministers on the Government side.

Today, Sir, Sri Lanka has perhaps achieved a dubiousrecord. Sir, of the entire world Muslim population of morethan 1.5 billion, half the population live as minorities inother countries with predominant non-Muslim majorities.Today, Sri Lanka has achieved a dubious record of being acountry with the largest Muslim IDP population in any non-Muslim country with the eviction of the Mutur Muslims.

Here, Sir, I must say with all the pain in my heart that thisdubious record is something regarding which certainly theGovernment alone is not to be blamed. The UNP regime in1990 was unable to save the Muslims who were evicted fromthe entire Northern Province. The Jaffna Peninsula was underthe control of the LTTE perhaps, but there were certain partsof the Wanni where the Government had control. ButGovernment forces could not help the defenceless Muslimsfrom being forcibly evicted.

In every phase of the Eelam war, whether it was the first,second, third or even the fourth, Muslims faced forcibleeviction. But today, we have reached this dubious record ofhaving the largest Muslim IDP population in any non-Muslim country. I am not here to apportion blame onthe Government or on the LTTE, but to look at itdispassionately.

Sir, when has this happened? This has happened at a timewhen we have the largest number of Muslim Ministers inGovernment. Ten Muslim Ministers were never there in anygovernment at any time in the history. We have the largestnumber of Muslim Parliamentarians in the House in thisparticular Assembly. Never before have we had such anumber. Yet we are unable to save our people and this iswhere we need to address the issues quite dispassionately.My dear Friend Gajen Ponnambalam made a well-reasonedspeech. I agree with him on many points. But yet, there arecertain issues regarding which I am at cross purposes withhim and I would like to explain that to him.

The onus on the Government to protect and speedilyresettle the Muslims cannot be better emphasized than to saythat they have the largest number of Muslim Ministers everin any government in this country. We have had repeatedassertions and promises by His Excellency the President onthis issue and I believe him. I believe His Excellency thePresident when he says that he will never allow Muslims tolive forever as displaced. But yet, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we aredisillusioned and saddened that wisdom by hindsight as inthis case is not enough. Grave mistakes bordering ondeliberate disregard have been highlighted in the case ofMutur. I know I have been berated by some of my Colleagueson the other side. They were all in one formation at one timeor the other. Avarice of office sometimes has its funny ways inwhich you lock horns with your own brothers. But this is notwhat the IDPs in Kantale, Tampalakamam, Kinniya or inPuttalam want us to do. We all have our weaknesses. We allare human. But what we need today is an enlightenedapproach to what is happening.

2006 11369370

Look at the callous indifference shown by theGovernment yesterday when the Adjournment Debate wastaken up in the House on this issue. Today some newspapershave highlighted this. There was no senior Cabinet Ministerto answer the Motion as has been the hallowed practice andconvention in any parliamentary democracy. I am very glad,Sir, the Hon. Prime Minister is here today. There are no otherMinisters in the Front Benches. The Hon. Prime Minister hasmade himself available for the entire day. I salute him forthis. But yesterday when an Adjournment Motion was movedthere was hardly any presence of senior Ministers at leastto answer the Adjournment Motion on behalf of theGovernment. I changed my Motion in order to reduce thenegative impact it might have on the Government. Theoriginal Motion was handed over by me to the Governmentwhich read, the callous disregard for human security bothby the Government and the LTTE resulted in the ethniccleansing of the Muslims from Mutur Of course, it was avery harsh, a very tough Motion perhaps for the Govern-ment. Another Motion was brought in by the JVP. They saidthey want to change it, we were not willing to change it.Finally I gave in and I watered down the Motion to read as aMotion that concentrates only on the humanitarian crisisand wanting the Government to address the humanitarianissues.

I have told you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, in every phase of theEelam war, Muslims have been chased away from areas ofhistorical habitation in the North - East. In its first phase dueto violence unleashed by all Tamil militant groups includingthe LTTE, Muslims were forced to abandon many villagesin the Eastern Province. The brutal massacres of thousandsof Muslims that took place in all three districts of the East aswell as in border villages in the Polonnaruwa District andthe Anuradhapura District have merely become a matter ofhistory.

Now, Sir, Tamil nationalists including my Friend, Hon.G.G. Ponnambalam - I am not directly accusing him - cannothide behind the sanctimonious statement alone where theyhad been grudgingly conceding the historical fact thatMuslims too like the Tamils are entitled to claim that theNorth - East is also their homeland. Look at this travestywhich is a very tragic fact. Whenever our Tamil brothers getdisplaced due to war and other hostilities, from the North -East they invariably move to some parts of the North - Eastwhere a predominant Tamil population is living. I agree thata large number of poor Tamil IDPs in the east and the southof Mutur have had to move towards Kathiraveli anddownwards towards Batticaloa. There were a large numberof them, may be equal to the Muslims who have beendisplaced. We are certainly concerned about them. We dowant humanitarian supplies to go there and those peoplealso to be looked after by the Government to the best of itsability. There are no second words about that plight.

We are also concerned about the 17 NGO workers whohad been killed in a ruthless and a brutal manner in Mutur,but look at the way in which the international media is

concentrating on that issue. We have a certain grievanceabout how the media works.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, as opposed to the manner in whichthe IDP Tamil population moves within the North - EastProvince to the Tamil dominated areas, the plight of theMuslims is totally different. The Muslims who claim to thesame homeland, the North - East, cannot live in peace in andaround Tamil dominated areas. They invariably are pushedinto areas in the south or sinhala dominated areas in theNorth - East - as in this case, Kantale. Is there not a starkreality that is emerging out of this pattern of post - migrationof Muslim IDPs? The sense of betrayal they have experiencedis certainly going to leave a lasting impression of how tochart our own course.We have repeatedly warned everygovernment which compromised on the security of theMuslims that they are contributing to the creation of a fertileground for radicalization.We are not saying this only to thisGovernment. My Party, from my late leaders time, ever sincewe entered this House, from within the precincts of this Houseand from outside, we said the same thing. If you fail to protectthe Muslims you will be creating a fertile ground forradicalization and none of us thereafter will be able to reversethat trend.

Does the Tamil national forces realize that our strugglehas its different dimension and these sociological andpolitical compulsions has the potential of derailing theprospect of peaceful co-existence? The LTTE does not appearto have had the maturity and the ability to assumeresponsibility expected of them after becoming a signatoryto the Ceasfire Agreement. Their obligations towards theirsubject civilian population in areas under their control isnot of any concern to us. As we see today, if you arecommitted to the Ceasefire Agreement you have to respectthe sanctity of life and limb as well as the need to avoidattacking places of worship and not contribute towardsconstructive displacement of innocent civilians fromGovernment controlled areas.This is what exactly you didin Mutur. You came in there for the very purpose of seeingthat the entire Muslim populaiton is evicted. Mr.Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam talked about the militaryobjectives and the way in which truth becomes the firstcasualty in a conflict. But, the issue, here,Mr. Deputy Speaker, is that LTTE had its obligations underthe Ceasefire Agreement. They cannot hide behind the grandeloquent statement that Ilanthiraiyan made when thewithdrew his forces from Muttur. He said, Having achievedour limited military objective of destroying Governmentsecurity installations our valiant forces have returned to thePre - CFA positions. He says in conclusion, because of theconsideration we had for the grave humanitarian cirsis thathas arisen in the Trincomalee District. If they were doing allthis in consideration of the grave humanitarian crisis theycould have avoided the crisis, particularly in Mutur, by havingwithdrawn 24 hours earlier and the Government forces wouldnot have punded this village with artillery and mortars. Wehad our own differences on that with the Government. I am

371372

[ ]still being chastised for what I have said and I am being takenour of context by the LTTE and the media that is friendlytowards the LTTE in order to convert the truth.

In the first place, if you continue to treat individuals in theMuslim community, who have the same claim to their areasof habitation as you have to yours, with the same attitude ofuncompromising brutality and ruthless terror tactics as youwould treat traitors to your cause or other Tamil groups,you certainly are making a grave mistake. Do not treat theMuslims as you treat your own traitors, the groups that arethere within the Tamil community, that are opposed to theideology of the LTTE. We are not an armed formation. Wehave not fought against your national struggle. You mayhave one Moulavi or two among your ranks to say that theMuslims are supporting your struggle. Well we too aresupportive of your struggle. Why then in the world that theSLMC took the position when the EU decided to ban you, toopenly say that the EU ban was an irrational one and that itcould have other implications. We also said that if theobjective of the ban is to pressurize the LTTE it can be amistaken objective. Today, perhaps we are proven correct,but then we took up that position because the Muslimsbelieve that in the minority struggle in this country, as a sumtotal of the whole and as a part of that struggle, there arecertain justifications for your attempt to choose violence as ameans to achieve your political objectives. But then, in thiswhole juoruney, the way in which you are treating theinnocent hapless Muslim civilian population, you arecertainly going to contribute towards a further radicalizedformation which will stand independent of every othernationality and fight for its cause. That is way Mr. DeputySpeaker we need to talk about certain important factors. TheMuslims would never concede the LTTEs argument that thereare organized armed groups operating in Muslim areas. Evenif, for the sake of argument, we concede that there are thosewho resort to violence within the Muslim community, couldyou even in your wildest imagination believe that they posesuch portntial threat as your defectors or other armed groupsopposed to you and your struggle are posing? Can you everin your wildest dreams equate the small number of peoplewho may have without any other avenue available to them tosafeguard their areas has taken to arms to the traitorouselements within the Tamil national struggle and treat them inthis manner? How dare you, I ask?. Sir, take the admission ofThamilselvan regarding the need to screen fleeing innocentcivilians and detaining some among them for suspiciousbehaviour opposed to the LTTE activities. How dare doesThamilselvan do this to an innocent population who wasleaving? What happened in Kiranthimunai when thousandsof Muslims - young, old, women, children, everyone - wereleaving? You sought to separate the able-bodied men, tiethem up and beat the old and the feeble who were pleadingon behalf of their young men. How dare you do this? Do notmake this mistake of lumping the Muslims with the residuewho have betrayed your cause? What in fairness and decencyhave the Muslims done for them to become the subject ofyour brutal screening, torture and summary execution?

Mr. Deputy Speaker, the incidents in Kiranthimuani at the64th milepost is the Sabra and Shatilla of the innocentMuslims of this country.

( )(The Deputy Speaker)Hon. Hakeem, I think you have already taken the 25 minutesthat you were allotted.

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

Yes, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I will wind up with a few moreremarks. We spoke about Rwanda and Burundi. Is the LTTEcontributing towards the Eastern Muslim homelandsbecoming a Rwanda and Burundi? We certainly are bleedingas far as we are concerned as to what is happending in thoseareas to our Tamil brothers.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, let me wind up by saying this. I amsure those of them in this House watched and occasionallyenjoyed the catcalls when a desperate Muslim Minister wasvexing eloquent on the need to give military training to allMuslims.

The SLMC leadership which has the predominant andundisputed mandate does not wish to jump on any empotianaland sentimental bandwagon. The sanctimonious humbugswho incite the hurt feelings of these hapless victims of brutaitycannot be misled by avaricious political turncoats who havesuddenly woken from their deep slumber and have beguntheir usual sabre-rettling. Where were these people whenMutur was being pummelled by aritillery and morar fire andwhen these people were pleading to stop this atrocity? Wedid speak, we did call for restraint. That did not come. But ifthat restraint had come, perhaps Muslims may not have gone.But, that does not take away the culpability from the LTTEfor counstructively causing the eviction of Muslims. And, ifthey think with this constructive eviction that their strugglecould gain a few more steps, they are sadly mistaken becauseas I told you they have sown the seeds to create a fertileground for radicalization and they would be answerable andthe Government too would be answerable if they do not takeimmediate and urgent steps to resettle them in the shortestpossible time.

. . . ( )( - , )(The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie - Minister of Railways andTransport and Minister of Petroleum and Petroleum ResourcesDevelopment)

Mr. Deputy Speaker, first of all let me thank you for givingme this opportunity to speak a few words on the extension ofEmergency.

2006 11373374

Emergency has become the most urgent necessity todaythan any other time. Killings in the East, the North and theSouth have become a festival of ruthless murderers. An attackon a former member of this House, Mr. Sivathasan near aschool in Bambalapitiya and the attack on STF Director,Training Mr. Upul Seneviratne are proof that the killer squadshave been active not only in the North and East but have alsoinfiltrated into the South.

Imagine the deaths that would have been caused if thebomb in Bambalapitiya had exploded during a time whenchildren were coming out of school.

In order to tighten security measures, the Extension of theEmergency is very essential and it should be extended untila lasting peace is established in this country.

Yesterday when the situation in Mutur and Mavil Aru wasdiscussed in this House. I did not speak because I wanted tospeak about it in the Emergency Debate as the subject matteris the same.

I am very happy that I am following my Friend, the Hon.Rauff Hakeem who was pointing his finger at the Governmentyesterday. Today he has understood the exact position andhe is holding the LTTE responsible for the eviction of thepeople in Mutur. I am very happy about it.

My heart still bleeds when I reflect upon the devastationand deaths caused to my innocent Muslim brothers in Mutur.After all, what wrong have they done to be displaced fromtheir houses and to languish in refugee camps without properfood, clothing, shelter and even without good drinking water?

Nearly 40,000 Muslim men, women and children havebeen displaced while the dead are believed to be over ahundred. Devastation of houses and other property are yetnot assessed. Why? I ask the LTTE. After all, for what reasonhas this heinous crime been committed upon the innocentand helpless Muslims? This is not the first time the LTTE hasattacked Muslims. Previously too on a number of occasionsthey have shed the blood of Muslims. Every time an attackon Muslims is launched it ends up with a mere condemnationby the onlookers or with an apology confined only to thelips. I am sorry to note that the international community toohas maintained a silence.

The Mavil Aru issue is said to be the root cause for thelaunching of the attack. But it has absolutely no relevanceto the innocent people of Mutur The LTTE entered Muturand started shelling the military targets from there whichcaused all the havoc.

It is very unfortunate that the LTTE which is a claiming tobe a liberation organization pays no humanitarian concernto the poor Muslims of Mutur. In fact, it appears that adeliberate plan to expel the Muslims out of Mutur has beenexecuted. Three months ago they gave a warning to theMuslims to leave Mutur.

Today after they have executed their plan they have putdown their guns and have withdrawn from Mutur. If theirintention was fighting against the forces they should haveremained there and continued to fight. But once theirobjective of expelling Muslims from Mutur was achievedthey withdrew from there. They did not stop at that. Theyhad mercilessly shot down nearly a hundred Muslims aftertying their hands behind, charging that they werecollaborating with the forces. Their only proof has been anodding head covered by a sack known as Gonibilla.

I do not want to go deep into the causes of this attack. I amconcerned with the relief activities that have to be takenimmediately to re-establish normalcy of life for the refugees.On the instructions of His Excellency the President, I havethe opportunity of coordinating the relief assistanceprogramme of the Government to provide food, temporaryshelter and other urgent requirements for the refugees. I wishto thank the local NGOs and the Jama ath - e- Islami. Whorushed to help the displaced people with relief assistance.

Whilst there have been established several refugee welfarecentres, I also wish to make special reference to theaccommodation provided at Agrabodhi Viharaya and SeruvilaRaja Maha Viharaya.

About 9000 displaced persons were looked after by theVenerable Seruwila Saranakeerthi Maha Nayaka Thero forwhich kindness I want to thank him specially.

I know that His Excellency the President is very keen totake speedy action to resettle the displaced people in theirown homes. Restoring basic facilities and services is themost urgent need, in order to encourage families to opt toreturn to their homes. The traumatic experience has shatteredtheir morale and bound to haunt them for another generation.The displaced population cannot be allowed to languish forlong. The resettlement programme should commenceimmediately or within a week or two.

I wish to emphasize that the LTTE should respect humanlife and give an assurance to the Muslims that there will notbe any repetition of such incidents. Further, the importantthing before any resettlement is to immediately put back theinfrastructure like electricity, water, and the damaged houseswill also have to be repaired. There is vast damage to schools,Madrasas as well as to places of worship.

The Government has taken into account all this damageand compensation will be paid.

I also hope that compensation will be paid to the familiesof those who were killed, particularly where they werebreadwinners of the family.

I am happy that Ministers the Hon. Ameer Ali, the Hon.Najeeb A. Majeed, the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, the Hon. S.M. Chandrasena, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, Deputy

[ . . . ]

Ministers the Hon. Hussain Bhaila, the Hon. NirmalaKotalawala, Senior Advisor to the President Mr. BasilRajapaksa, Presidential Advisor Mr. A. H. M. Azwer and theChief Minister of the North Central Province, Mr. BertyPremalal Dissanayaka have all teamed up as one group incoordinating the relief work.

We must tell the whole world as to who is responsible forgetting the Muslims out of Mutur. I am very happy that theHon. Hakeem has realized this. He came before the Housetoday and told us that the LTTE is responsible for this.

This is an occasion for people to shun their politicaldifferences and come to the assistance of refugees. I callupon all political parties to shun party politics in thisconnection and adopt a humanitarian approach to the patheticplight of the displaced community.

Thank you, Sir.

[ ]that the present situation of the country as far as theeconomy, war and the security of the people are concernedis in dire straits. Nevertheless as a Party we are voting infavour of the extension of the Emergency. But I hope thatthe Government will not make use of this opportunity tocrush all the civil rights and the peace in the South.

, , in AllaiArmy Camp, there was an explosion yesterday. That wasbasically due to the excessive usage of equipment. It isreported that nine are killed and more than fifty injured. Ihope the Hon. Minister of Defence will look into thatincident and see that this sort of incident will not take placein the future because this is a dangerous situation. Thatincident shows that the army personnel are not havingenough equipment and proper equipment for their use.
