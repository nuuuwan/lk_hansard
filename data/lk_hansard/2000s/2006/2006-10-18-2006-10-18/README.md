Hon. Deputy Speaker, a request was made by the Hon.Jeyaraj Fernandopulle. The request was that the TNA make astatment in the House to explain our position and backgroundto our agitations today and yesterday in Parliament.

Our view is that the House knows that we have been carryingout a Satyagraha campaign over the last several Sessions.We commenced those Satyagraha campaigns by makingstatements but we had no response from the Government,therefore those campaigns continued.

But if the Governments position is that they wish to havea formal statement from the TNA made, then we are preparedto make that statement tommorrow and we would expect theGovernment to come up with a formal response to thatstatement and our decision as to whether to continue withthe protest or not would depend on that response. But in themeantime, till such time as we make that statement tomorrow,the TNA Members will walk out of Parliament.

Thank you, Sir.

Our Debate is in termsof macro-economy, whether an economy should be in theideal state of performance of management or whether theeconomy has to be managed in terms of certainpracticalities. These are matters that we would always haveto encounter. Ideal economies were there in the world, butnot in the 21st century. What is the pattern followed in theUnited States in terms of economic management? There aretrillion, billion dollar economies in the United States,running into deficits. How is the Chinese economymanaging its affairs? Free on one side, through dictationon the other. The market forces have to be encouraged andinvestment flow generated.

Today, in a small economy like that of ours, where most ofour resources have not been tapped properly or still remainsuntapped, we are still stuck trying to bring about the toolsthrough which we could activate an economic resurgence or

development. Thereby, an ideal economic platform asadvocated by my Friend Hon. Bandula Gunawardane wouldnot arise in situation where one cannot practise such formulas.Here, we are carrying a debt that we have been saddled withover several decades. Today, we have to go in for an economythat is more practical with a management more prudent, andeconomy that will have productivity and also the pragmatismassociated with the administration of an economy.

These are the four core issues that we have to base oureconomic administration and the management of theeconomy on. It is through that mechanism and the tools thatwe have employed that we have been able to sustain thisdevelopment. It is not easy. Take for instance, the flow ofinvestment that is coming into the country, we have to get asubstantial Foreign Direct Investment flow into the country.

I am happy to announce before the House today, since weassumed office under His Excellency the President MahindaRajapksa, we have a foreign direct investment flow to thecountry that has surpassed all previous records. By August,2006, I am registering a Foreign Direct Investment at USDollars 340 million, which is a record in the history of SriLanka. I want to go beyond a US Dollars 500 billion targetand it may be US Dollars 600 billion by the end of the year.How has it become possible without the major tools that areassociated with the inflow of Foreign Direct Investment likein other countries? Mergers and acquisitions had been a majorarea of Foreign Direct Investment in the world in the year2005. In the year 2005, the Foreign Direct Investment thatflowed into countries around the globe amounted to USDollars 916 billion, out of which US Dollars 716 billion wasas a result of mergers and acquisitions in countries whereforeign companies can come and merge with the existingenterprises or public institutions or take over existingenterprises. But, US Dollars 200 billon had flown intogreenfield investments. Those are fresh, new start upinvestments. If we get US Dollars one billion out of a globalflow of US Dollars 200 billion, then we at least get close to a0.5 per cent, a very respectable level of Foreign DirectInvestment which we are now targeting under His Excellencythe President Mahinda Rajapaksa. That surpasses all ourprevious expectations. In order to do that what should wehave? We should have a more vibrant policy framework wherewe can accommodate Foreign Direct Investment. We musthave tranquility in the environment in which investmentscan grow.

I have taken special note of what the Hon. Member,Samarasinghe mentioned that there are some 600 companiesunder the BOI that are not registered with the ETF. This willbe investigated right now and I will answer to the Housewhether there are such companies and if there are suchcompanies I will take steps to suspend their agreements withthe BOI. I do not believe it is the case, but if there are any, Iwill take appropriate action.

(+ )(The Presiding Member)

Yes, Please.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

So with this situation emerging if we are to have a directinvestment flow we have to bring in the type of macroeconomic framework that is conductive for investment flowand also the local factors have to be identified.

We have an entire fisheries sector which is still notattracting foreign direct investment. So we need the correctpolicy framework on ; how we should approach the fisheriessector, how much of foreign direct investment can bepermitted in the fisheries sector and what are the areas inwhich we could advocate development. I will be happy toencourage and advocate development in the fisheries sector.

Then in the agricultural sector ; the value addition processand the research that is needed in terms of bringing aboutquality production that can measure up to the expectationsof the consumers not only in Sri Lanka but also in the worldwhere the markets are emerging. This is what the AfricanContinent is today engaged in. They want to have theirproduction base oriented to the world market needs and thatis why quality production has to come in. This is where

the Sahara Terrain development has now focussed on withforeign assistance in order to measure up to the productionbase of the African Continent and to measure up to the needsof the European and American consumer. Sri Lanka shouldfollow suit.

We should get our development pattern in line with whatwe have now planned under His Excellency the President,Mahinda Rajapaksa to encourage development of the basicraw material sector of this country. We have now bannedthe export of raw material in its raw form because we need,even on iron ore and other deposits that are available,greater value addition for the industrial sector so that theindustry right across would benefit in terms of the industrialmechanism that is coming in with technological trasfer thatcould lift up the base of Sri Lankas development in termsof industrial pursuits. We have always been expecting theforeigners to come in and make it only a limited area ofdevelopment in terms of their contribution which arechanging fast because we need a greater value addition andalso the vertical development in terms of their backwardintegration so that money will flow further down, downstream. When value addition takes place and there is greaterproduction that production will have greater value beingadded in Sri Lanka that will yield a greater share of theprice of the finished product. Now that is the flow that isneeded.

If you take our exports, for the last three years we havebeen having a rapid increase. In the year 2004, we registeredUS Dollars 5400 million worth of exports. In the year 2005,we have registered US Dollars 6300 millions worth ofexports. That is about a 12 per cent growth over the previousyear. This year we are surpassing the seven billion US Dollarmark in terms of our exports. How has that becomepossible? Because the economy has expanded, theproduction base has expanded and the money circulationhas increased and those have led to development in termsof our raw material bases, production bases and also certaininflationary pressures have also got built in because thereis money circulation today.

I am sorry to learn that in certain areas is a lack ofdevelopment in the rural sector, in particular. We have todevelop the infrastructure in order to make the rural sectoralso part and parcel of the rest of the countrys developmentlike the Western Province that has yielded about 50 per centof our development.

We are changing that because His Excellency thePresident Mahinda Rajapaksa went on record and got themandate from the people to broad - base the economicactivities in this country. That is why there is so much ofactivity today taking place in the rural sector of this country,which was not the case in the past. The Maga Neguma,the Gama Neguma, these are programmes in the rural sector.Now as MPs we are aware what is happening now in ourrespective electorates. How many agencies of the

25232524

[ ]Government are spending money for the social and theinfrastructure development of our people in the rural sector?Now these are all monies that have to flow. In spite of thatwe have gone ahead in terms of bringing in more numbersto the public service. We have recruited 46,000 graduates.We needed them to be recruited because they did not haveopportunities of employment. We have engaged them.Provision had to be made for additional salaries to pay them.In addition to that there is recruitment made by otheragencies of the Government, a substantial area in terms ofincrease of employment by the Government.

Now there is the health sector, the Provincial Councils,the transport sector. In all these sectors numbers have notbeen reduced. We have been increasing employmentgeneration. All Provincial Councils are recruiting people.That is okay because the need is there for them to recruitfor their service. That is their objective in terms of whatthey have been conferred with because they have been givena mandate by the people when they got elected to theProvincial Councils to address the needs of the people atrural level. But here the Central Government too isaddressing those needs. There is a duplication ; some maysay. There is the Central government authority. There is theprovincial authority. There is the Pradeshiya Sabhaauthority. A three tier authority is functioningsimultaneously addressing sometimes the basic needs of thepeople of this country. Should we stop that or should weget back to what the United National Party was advocatingin office, to tighten the belts in terms of the basic needs ofthe people? Can we tell that to the people? No, we cannotdo that. We have to address the needs of the people all thetime. This is how we are trying manage this economy. Andalso I must quote here, which is relevant, how the Hon. K.N. Choksy, the Minister of Finance in 2002 during hisBudget Speech was looking at this factor. I quote from hisBudget Speech on November 06, 2002. Now what did hesay? He said, I quote.

Decisive action is required on two fronts to overcome the debtcrisis. First, we need to reduce the budget deficit. Second, require to sellunder-utilised state-owned commercial assets to bring down the debt.Otherwise, the Government will be forced to raise money by increasingtaxes on the People.

Now, have we adopted that line of thinking? This is thechange that we have made without trying to further nationalizeor further peoplize to take over of the assets of the governmentfor private investment. We have been trying to encouragecertain utilities still in the hands of the Govenment to meetthe objectives for which they were created. We havestrengthened the Ceylon transport Board. We have nottouched the CEB. We are still keeping the Ceylon PetroleumCorporation as the main provider in terms of the energy sectorof our country-the petroleum products. Our banks have beenkept intact; the Bank of Ceylon, the Peoples Bank and theother banks of the Government. We have created two morenew banks under the Government for development purposes.

One is the SMS Bank and the other one is the LankaputhraBank. Why did we creaed all these? Because we believe inthe people and our Government believes in the people. Webelieve that we could meet the objectives throug anarrangement whereby we could manage the economy withoutburdening the people in terms of greater producion beinggeneated. Now, that is why we are shifting this focus fromjust a macro economic picture in terms of addressing the coreissues, which is important. We are also going into the microlevel of development, taking development to the periphery;to Trincomalee, to Galle, to Hambantota, to Jaffna. We needthat. That is how we can bring about a lasting developmentin terms of the countrys pursuits. In the absence of which,whatever my Good Friend, the Hon. Bandula Gunawardenesays - I have listened to similar speeches in the past on aregular basis and I enjoy every bit of what he says as an oratorand as a speaker - when it comes to the contents on which wehave to ultimately debate, we find that it falls far short of therealistic economic management that one could advocate fora country. In terms of the Dollar movement - I think myColleague, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama went on toexplain well - today the Dollar is at Rs. 106 plus, close to Rs.107. Yes, two days back it was going beyond that. But todayif it comes down to Rs. 104, what is the basis of that argumentthat the Dollar is picking up? There are certain forces thatwork both out of and on the Dollar because it is a foreigncurrency, That currency is not in our hands. But if you arebasing our main imports to the country, then there is asignificant impact on the consumer, because every item thatwe import is based on a price that is not managed by us.Thereby, we have to ad that price. How can you bring a priceformula other than bringing a subsidized arrangement? Then,again we have to come before the House for supplementaryestimates. Because the subsidies that we have been offeringto the people are the ones that we are now trying to providefor as supplementary estimates here to put the book entries inorder and bring about good accounting management by theGovernment.

So, this is the ultimate objective. Yesterday it was passed.We thank the Opposition for the co-operation extended.Today we engage in a more academic Debate in terms ofwhere this should go and where it is going and whether acorrect path is followed in pursuing that objective. That isthe only way in which we can stimulate growth. I stillemphasize that there are so many other sources through whichwe have to stimulate growth in the country and we keep ontapping them. We have to keep on tapping the agriculturalsector for greater value addition. The industrial base has tobecome more efficient. Sometimes when it is beingencouraged to become efficient, the energy problem arises incertain areas of our industrial base, because we are againdependant on the fuel imports to the country, petroleumimports to the country, to generate the type of energy weneed. So alternative energies have to be looked at.

We have not looked at these realities during the previousregimes. Today we are being saddled with having to innovateand pursue goals for alternate development in terms of our

2006 1825252526

basic needs. Energy is one key factor. That is why we aregoing for coal power generation in terms of our energyrequirements. This is why we are looking at wing powergeneration.

(+ )(The Presiding Member)Hon. Minister, you have three minute more.

( )(The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

Yes, thank you, Madam. In that context, we have to keepon looking at this. Otherwise, there is no other formula thatone can advocate. If it is the value addition precess, onceagain, I must repeat that on the basis of getting a sustainedmarket overseas, we must have a quality product going outof Sri Lanka. Now, if we take for instance tea, we may have tolook at as to how best we can get value added to the teaproduced in this country. Sometimes we may have to look atit again and revise this auction system that is now virtuallyhaving a bit of a market restriction. We may have to open upthese areas to which now we have to get the co- operation ofall sides such as the industry, the policy makers and the hon.Members of the Opposition in order to look at it in a realisticmanner whether we cannot bring in bigger players, widerplayers in terms of foreign buying. And local producers, thebig investor and small producer schemes have to beencouraged. Then we may get a better arrangement throughwhich the international market forces can be penetrated bythe Sri Lankan exporters. These are areas that we must lookinto. I think, there was a remark that was made by an hon.Member as to whether we were getting all the foreignexchange earnings out of our products back to Sri Lanka.I recall when I was Chairman of the Committee on PublicEnterprises we asked the Central Bank to explain theirposition on that matter and they substantiated that therevenue was coming back to the country. I think we can seewhether the entire amount that they collected as exportsproceeds are reflected in the exports earnings. If there is a gapbetween the export proceeds and export earnings, I think asthe Government we must seriously look into it and these areareas that will benefit from this Debate, to have a revisit andexamine these factors.

Then with regard to the difficult scenario that the Treasuryor the Treasury officials are experiencing, I do not know whythe Hon. Bandula Gunawardena went on to refer to theofficialdom. After all, at the end of it, we, as Cabinet Ministersand policy makers are answerable to this House and we willmaintain that. How the Treasury has subjected itself to ensurethe type of macro and the micro economic advancement inthis country has to be fully appreciated. Otherwise, it is amyth for us to just allow this type of aspersions to be cast onbecause that is not what is expected. We have to think of avery realistic, pragmatic and a prudent approach in terms ofeconomic management.

Therefore, Madam Chairperson I thank you for theopportunity I was given to participate in this Debate which isof an academic nature, but relevant because there were verygood suggestions put forward. I think the Hon. DayasiriJayasekara went on to explain how best certain areas ofindustry have to be looked into and how best the BOI shouldcontribute in terms of the overall economic advancement.I am sure those are the areas that we would always seek thesupport and co-operation of all the hon. Members of the Houseirrespective of the divide and their suggestions could be madeuse of in framing our economic programmes.

Thank you, Madam.
