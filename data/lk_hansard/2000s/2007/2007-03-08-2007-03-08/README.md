. , ? . , he has misled me and the House.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . . .

( . . ) (The Hon. M. K. Eelaventhan)

,

.

. The Hon. Minister made it very clear. He misled me and this House yester-day, 7th March, saying that the parcels lying in the Trin-comalee Post Office have been dispatched to Jaffna yes-terday by a ship. He said it to me on the 7th. This hap-pened according to him on the 6th. But the information received from the Tricomalee Post Office is totally differ-ent. No ships have gone to Jaffna and there is no hope of any ships leaving for Jaffna in the near future. Hence, I want to raise this matter of Privilege and get a reply from the Hon. Minister. I still want to say that he is not telling an untruth. The word lie is not used in Par-liamentary language. But I am afraid it is a travesty of truth as his utterance has not been fulfilled. He has only fulfilled the very negation of it. Let me have a reply.

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem-Minister of Posts and Telecom-munication) Hon. Speaker, may I be permitted to reply my Friend, the Hon. Eelaventhan? , , , . ; , , ,

" 2007.03.05 . 2007.03.05 , 2007.03.07 5 . 2007.03.05 , ." This is what the Post Master General has informed me. But I must say that there was no intention to mislead this House. It was beyond our control since the authori-ties there are taking all necessary steps. I have made a very stern request that this must be done without any fur-ther delay. But of course, the Hon. Member, knowingly or unknowingly, made this statement that there is no hope of any ship leaving for Jaffna. That is also wrong. In fact, I say that - . .

( . . ) (The Hon. M. K. Eelaventhan) With due respect to you, I would also like to mention, that before you left for China you said that by the time you return, everything would have gone there. On the day I raised this issue the ships had already gone. Finally nothing has happened.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Member, you must understand that it is not easy. . .

( . . ) (The Hon. M. K. Eelaventhan) You are giving different explanations. Those are not at all convincing. I do not want to say that you are in-dulging in a lie. But what I say is that it is a travesty of truth - not speaking out the truth and trying to divert at-tention. If you have no control over the Post Office offi-cials, please remove them. If you cannot remove them, please remove yourself from the post you are holding. You are incapable of doing anything meaningful.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) The Hon. Member is getting highly excited and emo-tional about this.-[Interruption.] ( )

( - ,

(The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena-Minister of Urban Devel-opment and Sacred Area Development) Always excited!

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I must also say that with regard to the transportation of goods to Jaffna there is another problem that the Gov-ernment is faced with. The ICRC is unable to give pro-tection when transporting certain essential items. There are many difficulties that the Government is faced with. The LTTE too has got to co-operate with the Government in assisting the transportation of essential goods to Jaffna. On many occasions the ICRC has been unable to give that assurance to the Government. Therefore, the Government has been put into serious difficulties in transporting some of the essential items. In this case, these parcels have been lying in Trinco-malee for several weeks, unfortunately for various rea-sons. The Postal Department has taken the best possible action in that regard and finally we have been able to per-suade the Commissioner of Essential Services to carry those parcels by this particular ship that has been made available. But with the added risks, added insurance and various other commitments have to be paid to the owners because of the non availability of ICRC escort. -[Interruption.]

[.. 1.22]

( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) . , . . , . . Hon. Deputy Speaker, let me comment on the amendments that were made to the Bills which are consistent with the Budget Proposals of 2007. However, there was confusion in the House because in addition to the amendments, some further amendments were brought in this morning. However, I would like to comment on one or two amendments, which I think are relevant. One of the amendments is the 'Insertion of new section 26A in the principal enactment', which is on page six of the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill. It says that every Government Agency making payment to another party under contract will be required to withhold one-third of the VAT invoiced by the latter and pay the withholding tax to the Government. Now, already the Inland Revenue Department has certain administrative issues regarding the management of VAT itself. The recent VAT refund

1527 1528

frauds, the delays in making legitimate VAT refunds running to several billion rupees and the numerous difficulties faced by ordinary tax payers have been blamed on the complexity and the lack of capacity to administer the VAT system. Now, in addition, this proposed amendment will cause further difficulties to the Department because it will add to the clerical work of the Inland Revenue Department. Secondly, it will make the system more complex in that a large number of remittances of VAT withheld and remitted to the Department of Inland Revenue will have to be matched with the claims made by the VAT payers. In addition, it would burden Government ministries, departments and other agencies with the task of deducting VAT before making payments to contractors on goods and services, to keep accurate records of the VAT so deducted and withheld and to have the name and the VAT registration numbers of each of those from whom such VAT has been withheld and then to make those remittances as and when VAT is withheld. Now, in addition to that, the inconvenience of the VAT payers will be that they would have to then obtain tax deduction certificates or such documents evidencing that the VAT withheld by the Government agencies are theirs. They would have to chase behind Government employees. They would need to get the clerk of the relevant department to sign that this recovery has been made. This would be a tedious process for the VAT payer, the entrepreneur and it would also create problems for the department. So, in my view, the proposed amendment will be revenue neutral. There will not be a revenue addition except in the case where you might bring in a contractor who has been evading VAT. But that also does not happen because the Government departments do not work with small-time contractors. Therefore, there will be a lot of complexities caused by this and in my opinion there will not be an additional benefit. It will create confusion. Everybody accepts, Sir, the VAT is complex. Now, this system makes it more complex. That is my view and I think this amendment is not suitable. Again, I would take another amendment, 'Amendment of Section 22 of the principal enactment', where the proposal is to restrict the amount of input VAT allowable for set off against output VAT to 85 per cent of output tax. Now, this proposed amendment will make 15 per cent of the VAT paid on goods and services purchased an additional cost to entrepreneurs whose business structure is such that they now recover the entirety or a greater part of the VAT payable from the input VAT they pay for on purchases. My contention is, the definition of Value Added Tax means that the entirety should be refunded. That is the principle on which VAT works. My belief is that the Government is on the threshold of bankruptcy. The Government wants money at any cost. On one side they want the Government departments to deduct a certain percentage, one-third of the VAT

collected and immediately pay the money to the Department so that the Government can use the money. It is like the Government is running on a day-to-day basis. Now, on top of that the Government is going to reduce on total VAT, 15 per cent is going to be on input VAT. It is not refundable. What would happen is all service providers, all industrialists, anyone who is paying VAT will now pass on whatever additional cost they are going to incur to the consumer. So, in the end the consumer is the one who is going to get taxed. So, this Government then is going against its very principles that the "Mahinda Chintana stood for the ordinary people and the ordinary consumers. Now, this is like taxing the consumers and therefore, it goes against the very principles of the "Mahinda Chintana". , . . . . , . , . . . .

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) . , . . . . "Sri Lanka Development Forum: The Economy, Regional Disparities, and Global Opportunities" . . Sir, I quote from that:

The Sri Lankan economy has posted impressive gains in the post-tsunami period, with a 6 per cent growth rate in 2005 followed by 7.8 per cent growth during the first three quarters of 2006. With per-capita income rising above US$ 1,000 in 2004, Sri Lanka is on a steady path to achieving status as a middle-income country. Higher economic growth has been accompanied by a decline in unemployment, excluding the North and East, from 8.1 per cent in 2004 to 7.2 per cent in 2005 and 6.4 per cent during the first nine months of 2006.

, , . ? . Sir, it also states, I quote:

Economic growth during the last two years continued to be dominated by the services sector, followed by the industrial sector. Agricultural growth performance was initially affected by the tsunami-related setback to the fisheries sub-sector, but is bounced back during 2006. , fiscal management . .

2007 08 1569 1570

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) . This further states, I quote:

"The post-tsunami period posed many challenges to fiscal management, with additional expenditure needed for tsunami recovery activities and increased military outlays in the face of the deteriorating security situation. In addition, higher public sector wages and pensions together with increased fuel subsidies created additional fiscal pressures. One positive aspect has been the recent improvements in revenue collection which has partly offset the increases in expenditures.
