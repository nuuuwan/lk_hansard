( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , () (i) (ii) . ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) You are asking the Question with regard to the remit-tances, is it? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Yes, that is right. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella)

You want it from the year 2000 to 2006? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Yes, that is right

2007 20 1545 1546

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Year 2000 - US Dollars 1,160 million; year 2001 US Dollars 1,155 million ; year 2002 - US Dollars 1,287 mil-lion ; year 2003 - US Dollars 1,414 million ; year 2004 - US Dollars 1,564 million ; year 2005 - US Dollars 1,912 million ; year 2006 - US Dollars 2,325million ; ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

The Answer for (b) (ii) - How many are deported? ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella)

That is a long list. You have asked for the last six years. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Just give me the number. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella)

There are twenty five countries. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

How many people are there altogether? ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella)

In 2002 - 998 ; 2003 - 1302; 2004 - 1164; 2005 - 1792; 2006 - 1152; 2007 - 173. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Minister, each of these people who go overseas are charged an insurance premium. How much of that money is utilized to serve them back? I am informed that,while the insurance premiums are collected, the bene-fits accrued to them are coming very slow or do not come at all. Is that correct or not because we see a lot of people languishing in the Middle East. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) I will tell you about the last three years. In 2004 the premium have been Rs. 101 million and repayment has been Rs. 52 million. In 2005 the premium has been Rs.

127 million - I am not taking the last digits repayment has been Rs. 122 million. So, I do not think that argument holds well because you have collected Rs. 127 million and paid Rs. 122 million. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) My only concern. Hon. Minister, is that there are a lot of people languishing. You could see it in the media and otherwise. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Yes. Just let me say this. In 2006, Premium has been Rs. 116 million and the repayment has been Rs. 138 mil-lion. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) My second question is this. I am informed that the money collected by the Bureau of Foreign Employment, is going to be invested in Mihin Air. Is that correct? ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) No, not correct. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Do you categorically deny that? ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella)

I categorically deny that. There was a request. Even if it is invested, it will be on preference shares with an accu-mulative rate of ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

That is even worse than ordinary shares. Preference shares means that there is no ability to run the company at all. That is worse than even ordinary shares. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) No but you have a warrant coupon every year which will be cumulative. If at all, we have not decided. We are just working on that.

1547 1548

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, is there an idea of trying to invest even on prefer-ence shares or ordinary shares? Nothing? ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) No. We are looking at possibilities of investing the money, but it will be done in consultation with may be, one or two consultancy firms, not haphazardly. That assur-ance, I will give you. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) But many of the investments of the Government are being done haphazardly today. I only hope that you will put your finger on this. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella)

Well, you can be assured that it will not be done in the manner that you just mentioned. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Then, you had also said that in order to increase foreign employment opportunities you will be sending people to Afghanistan. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Sorry? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It has been stated in the newspapers that you intend sending people to Afghanisan in order to ensure that more people find jobs overseas. So, are you sending people from hell to heaven or heaven to hell? Because sending to Afghanistan is as good as sending to kilinochchi. This is like sending people to kilinochchi. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella)

Even in hell you will find heaven. It all depends. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, is that a statement to be attributed, Hon. Minister?

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Well, We are looking at various new markets, particu-larly in Europe and Afghanistan has made certain ap-proaches. That does not mean that we are sending them to Afghanistan. We are looking at all possible ways of increasing the numbers to be sent across as migrant workers. But we will not put them in danger. I can give you a classical example. In Korea there are ten people who have died, but in war torn areas in Iraq. We have over eighty thousand people and there is only one death reported. So, comparatively, situation in a country does not relate to the kind of danger that they are subjected to. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I will take what you say on the face value. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) ? 7 . . . . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The next question is about womens employment. You have mentioned that those who are married and having children less than five years old will not be sent overseas. Is this correct or not? ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ? . ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Well, there is a Cabinet decision through a different ministry, but that has to be integrated into this. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) But, Hon. Minister, you were quoted as saying that is a situation where there can be a - ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) No, that is not right.

[..11.30]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity. I rise again to speak in this House at a time when the economy is in great jeopardy, which we do not need to hide. It is in dire straits. The country is at the crossroads, but the problem that seems to be there for the Government is that they do not know how to address this issue. They feel that by adopting a confrontational approach, trying to stymie the media and trying to tell the world that everything goes on well in this country, would bring prosperity to this country. The way the Hon. Minister of State Revenue and Finance just spoke and left this House very well exemplifies that he is unable even to sit and listen to the

1595 1596

[ ]

views of the Opposition . As you know, we have always been trying to project that the economy should not be politicized and colourized, but that is the very thing that has been done. He just explained and left. We, from the Opposition certainly do commend that these are good legislations that have been brought in and we have no objection to the Finance Leasing (Amendment) Bill, the Regulation of Insurance Industry (Amendment ) Bill or the National Insurance Trust Fund (Amendment) Bill. But these are too little, too late. These have no relevance to the economy of today which is in great jeopardy. Why are these things being done? Because of mismanagement of the economy. If I may take up in the first instance, the area of finance leasing, it is very good for debt instruments to be brought in, but when we, from the United National Party did this first and when we wanted leverage and debt equity to come in to make it more formalized, what did they say? Taking on the Opposition for the sake of taking it on is what seems to be happening today. But, we commend the Government that it has done the correct thing and at this moment we give our full support. Why we are debating these here is to explain to the Government and the general public that the countrys situation is far from what it should be today. They are talking of the Regulation of Insurance Industry (Amendment ) Bill. They are saying that every insurance company - today the penetration is very low - is told to ensure that reinsurance takes place in the country. Well and good. But what if there is a calamity in this country like what happened a couple of years ago, then the Government says, "Sorry, we do not have money" and you do not basically provide from reinsurance the monies that are due to the insurance company? Then, the insurer is in jeopardy. The same thing happens in the area of cess. The collection of cess is to pay the producers of the agricultural sector, especially of tea, so that when it gets bad, they get the necessary fillip, a help. But, does that happen? No. Today the tea smallholders - Hon. Presiding Member, you were very much instrumental in achieving todays success rate - are in great jeopardy. Sixty three per cent of the production is handled through the Tea Smallholders' Association. Today they are not getting the cess. They are unable to pay the salaries to the workers. They are unable to use fertilizer to increase the productivity of this area. So what is the purpose? The Government regulates, they collect the money from the private sector and then do not pay back to the people to whom the money is due because the Government is in a state of financial bankruptcy. So, these are all knee-jerk reactions to collect money from wherever you could and still you do not provide redress that is required at a given date if there is a problem. Amending the National Insurance Trust Fund Act and increasing its Board members, all these should have been done a couple of years ago. These are not matters that you

need to waste time to debate. That is why we only ask to debate about the countrys economy today rather than anything else. But we support these; we appreciate these. When we come to the resolutions, there is increasing of limits. There are matters the Hon. Minister of State Revenue and Finance quite rightly has to explain as to what has to be done. But owing to mismanagement, bankruptcy and the income being far less than the expenditure, these limits have to be increased. Is that something that you can be happy with? Far from it. So, we from the United National Party certainly do support these and we do not want to labour ourselves too much saying what has been done is good or bad. It is good. But let me take time to explain about the countrys economy today, which I think is more important, more relevant and I guess we need to digest this. Otherwise, we would be in a world of our own. As you know, the "Mahinda Chintana" of the President elected on 17th November 2005 ensured an euphoria of activities thinking that there would be solace for every quarter in the country. Time after time things have been going on. There were problems in the Alliance and today it is an absolute mess. Two of the prime dynamos who basically brought the "Mahinda Chintana" into being, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera and the Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarchchi, have crossed the Floor today. The emotional speech that the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera made today only reminds us that the SLFP is in shreds. This is something which we have been saying should have happened long ago. They have realized only today that it has aggravated, the countrys economy is in chaos, but it is better late than never. What he mentioned today is that it is in the hands of a few, for the benefit of some at the expense of all. That is basically the summary of what he said. If that is the case, how can we go forward? What the United National Party, which is the principle party, the biggest party and the most respected party in this country has been working on, is that there is a necessity for a Sri Lanka to exist first; there is necessity for good governance; there is a necessity for the country to move forward and our entire job is to protect Mother Lanka and not the "Mahinda Chintana". That is the problem with the Government today. The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle at a strike of a button gets up like a jack-in-the-box and talks of this type of things. His entire thrust is on the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe and the United National Party, thinking that it is the only way to impose his arrogant attitude that seems to be spreading day by day into Parliament. Unfortunately, I must mention that there needs to be control from the Chair to curb this type of degradation in Parliament that has set in. We have Members walking all over at all times and the august Assembly has become just another Pradeshiya Sabha in this country. This is the problem. When the top stinks, it goes down the line. The Hon. Speaker must ensure that the decorum of this House is maintained. He might have a tough time because of the heterogeneous

2007 20 1597 1598

5 PL 002202 (2007/07)

alliance and the various alliances that are there. But his precarious position should not be compromised in ensuring that there is no degradation in Parliament. You have Members who just get up and talk irrelevant points and the Standing Orders are used in an abusive manner just for the sake of trying to stymie the Opposition. Sir, today in the newspapers you read that Sri Lanka is the world's 25th worst State. So, we have been confirmed a failed State. I do not say this with any satisfaction. We have here my good Friend and Minister, the Hon. C. B. Rathnayake. I am sure he must be rekindling and thinking the same thing that the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera mentioned. His heart may be with Mangala, but his body and soul are there. What is to be done? That is the feeling. Unfortunately, that is the situation there. But, I do not expect him to jeopardize. At the correct time many things will happen. I guess his heart is here, but his soul is there. We have to get together and ensure that we protect Mother Lanka. What is the fun in shouting? In the morning it is a slang match that goes on. We ask Questions that are nationally important and prominence is given to some irrelevant, useless things and time is taken on those issues. So, I think we need to focus our attention to this. Hon. Minister, take this up at the Cabinet Meeting. There is no point in our talking. Look at the Government side in Parliament. They say they have 107 Ministers, but there is only one Cabinet Minister there. What is the point? We speak and bring things out as if we are fortune tellers. What we said would happen, has happened. , ? ? - , , , - ? . , . , ? , . . . . , . . . . 48 . . , 2 . , , , . . ? . , defend . So, on that particular score, all we can say is that the fundamentals need to be put into place. Today when we asked a Question in Parliament from the Hon. Keheliya

Rambukwella, he mentioned about Mihin Air. We asked Questions about the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment and the cat jumped out of the bag. That was when I asked very clearly whether the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment is going to subscribe to Mihin Air. On 11th November, 2006, when I moved the Adjournment Motion, they vehemently denied it. The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera was the Minister then and he said that he did not know what was going on. Subsequently in February we had another Adjournment Motion and the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle categorically said, No, we are not going to use any funds of the Foreign Employment Bureau, the EPF and the ETF. These are moneys of the people. This is not the dowry of any one person. So when we asked them, they said "No". But, today when I asked a question in a cross-talk, it slipped out from the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella and he said, Yes, we will be using the funds for preference shares. So, look at the asininity. They do not even understand the difference between the ordinary shares and the preference shares. If you use the funds of the people for ordinary shares, then it is different. When you go for preference shares, you have absolutely no control over what goes on. So, Sir, all what we have got to say is, we have to collectively ensure that we protect Mother Lanka. This is the money of the people of this country. We have got a temporary lease of life to govern this country to the best of our ability. When the Government is unable to govern, we the Opposition, which is the alternate government, must step in to take necessary action. People are asking us as to why we are so silent. We are not silent. We are only letting the people realize what a cardinal error they have made. They are calling us. But there is a democratic process that needs to be followed. When our Leader, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe met foreign diplomats on the 13th of June, 2007, he very categorically told them that the time has come for the resiliency and the silence that we have adopted in Parliament and outside to change. Our battle has been only in Parliament because we have given the Government all the time it needs to ensure that rectification of their errors takes place. But today there is only a multiplication of those errors. So on that score, we have to take the battle from Parliament to the streets. Today the people are calling us and asking, We are ready, are you? And we respond to them saying, Yes, we are ready. Together we can make this difference. So, we have got to ensure that the fundamentals are in place. There is no point in bringing Bills and getting all this done if the fundamental factors are not there. Therefore, we ask the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella, Hon. Minister, are you jeopardizing peoples money in a venture, I am saying now, which is an absolute liability to this country? When the SriLankan Airlines has only about another 11 months to decide whether they would go on with the Emirates, whether they would find a new partner or whether they would breach the privatization policy in the "Mahinda Chintana", who is there to ensure

1599 1600

that Mihin Air - they are losing almost 12 to 13 million rupees a month - would be a success? You have two aircraft that are parked there, which are being used for the whims and fancies of one or two people. These people would be brought to book one day. You know what the

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

has done. He is a person who has been accusing us saying we destroyed the CWE, this, that and the other. Today,

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] that the Sevanagala Union problem is solved. What a travesty of justice! This is where natural justice takes place, Hon. Minister. They character assassinated us and today he has to face us. This is what happens. We get up here not to sling mud at anybody. We have a feeling for this country and we want to ensure that we run this country. . . ( ) ( . . - ) (The Hon. A. P. Jagath Pushpakumara - Minister of Nation Building) , . . . , , . 18 . . . .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . . . . . . . , . , " " . . . As I mentioned, the countrys economy has to be focused from the point of view of how things are going on. Today abductions are taking place, human rights are flagrantly being violated and there is ethnic cleansing. Then, the Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi and the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera have quite categorically stated in this House that a sum of Rs. 400 million has been given to the Tigers during the election. That has very categorically been repeated last Sunday by the Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi when he called the Government, "A Government of Jokers." Going on further, today the economy is in chaos. The cost of living has been going up for the last 18 months and today inflation stands at not less than 17 - 18 per cent. In addition, there is a brain-drain in this country. Furthermore, you are being told that the country is a failed State. So all I am trying to say is, the actions of this Government have led to a situation where the country is going from bad to worse. What has the Government got to say today? Is there any Minister who is able to respond to these questions? When we, as the Opposition make a clarion call on these matters, who is there to

[ ]

2007 20 1601 1602

answer? Are we not wasting our time in this process? If this is the way the Government is trying to ensure that the Opposition voice is unheard, or if they feel that there is no point hearing it because of lack of competency or ineptness in them, God save this country!

Going on further, today the foreign countries have looked at Sri Lanka not only as a failed State but also as an arrogant State which is trying to exclude itself from the world community. Ours is a small island that needs to basically interact and have a close relationship with the world community. Today we seem to be taking on each state. The general assumption is that our neighbours are friends at all given times. Look at the manner in which you are handling India. One of your Ministers goes and says that there are activities taking place in and around Sri Lanka, to please take care, and promises are given to bring about a peaceful settlement. But these are violated time after time and when finally questioned by India, "Brother Sri Lanka, what is it that you are doing?", she is told, We do not want your interference. Then, to further polarize the situation you go to other neighbouring and friendly countries such as China and Pakistan and do certain things which irritate our good friend, our neighbouring friend who has stood with us all the time. And when they correct this situation, Mr. Narayan who is in charge of the RAW and an adviser of the Government of India categorically tells the Defence Secretary, You very well have India as a friend and buy only from us and not from anywhere else. Imagine! For that to be told means that there is an underlying message in that process. We realized that due to certain mistakes made earlier, there was a process of isolating India. But the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe was able to ensure that we got India not only on the left-hand side and the right-hand side but they were also walking with us. Now we are trying to isolate them once again.

The same thing is happening with the European Union. We have Britain, we have Germany, we have France, we have the Netherlands and we have Italy who have been very conscientiously working with us in a friendly manner. Suddenly, we seem to have made them upset. Today they are trying to bring in regulations and motions which are detrimental to Sri Lanka. Since Bangladesh was known as a country where child labour is exploited, certain imports from Bangladesh were stopped. Companies producing brands such as, "Niki" and "Addidas" stopped buying from Bangladesh saying that there was child labour there. So Bangladesh went through a difficult period from which they were unable to recover for a long time. Today a situation has arisen whether ethical trading can take place in Sri Lanka because of human rights violations. My good Friend, a Member of Parliament from the Colombo District, the Hon. Mano Ganesan who seems to be harassed by white vans chasing after him for the yeoman service he is doing with the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella and Mr. Siritunga, has explained that there are almost 130 persons missing in

Colombo. When these are highlighted - this is only from the Colombo District; other areas are kept out at this particular moment - and brought before the international arena, whether it is Amnesty International or Human Rights Commission, whether it is in Geneva or not, the aspect of ethical trading is being looked at. Our little Sri Lanka has to export its products. We have to export our textiles which is 60 per cent of our exports, we have to export our tea which is almost 15 per cent of our exports and if they take everything together and impose a ban on ethical trading saying Sri Lanka is violating human rights, what answer would you Minister, Hon. Dilan Perera, a champion for this cause, be able to give this country? You as the Minister of Justice, would not be able to defend whatever brief that is given to you. I know you are doing your very best. You are the sole sparrow in a nest of birds. But you have got to ensure that these types of things are corrected. So while saying, yes and supporting the Government Business today, I thought it is necessary to speak on matters that are relevant to the world, that are relevant to Sri Lanka and to Sri Lankans at the end of the day because those Sri Lankan citizens have voted for us and if we maintain a stony silence on this matter, it is a heinous crime that we will be committing. So I thought it is necessary that we speak on the ethical trading that takes place. So please ensure, Hon. Minister, that you take this matter up with the persons concerned. I am only saying that this is the writing on the wall. We say this not with a perfidious mentality or with sinister motives but we said that this will happen and it did.

The labour GSP is another issue that is in jeopardy. I did speak to the Ministers concerned. The Ministers are changing everyday. Even the European Union is wondering who the Minister in charge of a particular subject is or what subjects come under a particular Minister. One goes today; another goes tomorrow. The next one says, "I am sorry, that was told by him." So they are wondering whether this is a country or a banana republic. We have to be serious on this. Now what has happened? Owing to the activities that have taken place, you have given the Tamil Tigers world attention. The United National Party was able to bring the warring faction to the negotiating table and speak to them. After all, whether we like it or not, the Tamils seem to be comfortable with certain actions. We do not agree with those but the Tamils do. It seems that there is a certain understanding that even the TNA needs to be represented. But what we are saying today is, instead of bringing the LTTE back to the negotiating table, you have driven them into the jungle. By such action, today this Government has brought them to the attention of the world forum. They have been given unnecessary exposure. When they say Kfirs are bombarding them, innocent people are being harassed, victimized and abductions are taking place, there is no better opportunity for the LTTE to tell the international community that it is a barbaric Government that is ruling. When that happens, it is not only the SLFP but we also get implicated in this process.

1603 1604

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! You have five minutes more please. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Okay. The Government that was very much open and telling the world forum, "Yes, we are doing what is required to bring in a peaceful and democratic solution to this country", has now gone into the jungle. That is, the Government has brought the LTTE into the world forum and it has gone into the jungle. That is the position. . , . . . . Mr. Presiding Member, I was speaking on insurance. There is no better topic to speak today. Insurance reassures a loss that could take place. Look at the Chambers. What are they doing today? They are expecting the Members of Parliament, the Government and the Opposition, to do their job. They are maintaining a stony silence. Why do the Chambers not take a stand on certain ethical matters? They expect the Government and the Opposition to do their job. When we bring them in, they do not understand what to do. So, we call upon the Chambers as this is the time to come forward. Whether it is the Tamils, the Muslim, the Burghers, the Malays, the Sinhalese or whether it is the Sinhala Buddhists, all are in jeopardy today. Sir, today the private sector is generating 85 per cent of the jobs in this country and it is necessary for these Chambers to stand up and tell the Government what is wrong is wrong. We, from the Opposition have been doing this very much to the happiness of these Chambers but they need to come out with what is necessary. Look at what is happening in Pakistan. Look at what is happening in Bangladesh. Look at what is happening in Bhutan and Nepal. The private sector takes them on. They are healthy. We do not say that it is unfair. The country is in jeopardy. The citizens of this country are represented through the politicians and the NGOs. The Chambers are a very good forum. They must get up and do what is necessary. Look at the unions. They maintain a stony silence. When they say that they are going to stand up for their rights, the next day they are stymied or white vans come and abduct the union leaders or they are told that they are terrorist leaders. How many journalists are there today in remand custody being told that they are Sinhala Tigers? For what apparent reason? If there is a crime committed, charge them. Look at the Hon. Sripathi

Sooriyaarachchi. They said that there were certain charges against him but he was exonerated from all those. With Parameswary, it was the same. How many innocent media personnel today are writing with fear? We need to break this barrier. So, what is the purpose of legislating insurance when the reassurance that is required from the Government is being broken? Hon. Minister of Justice, you are smiling alone because you are left alone here today. We feel sorry for you. You are another person whose heart is here but your soul is there. He may differ with Hon. Mangala Samaraweera but the cause and the journey that was started is something he will not oppose. When we got up and mentioned Mrs. Chandrika Kumaratunga who once shone, as a person who ruined this country, there were 150 Members shouting around us. Today when we speak, there is not a single Member to defend her. That is the difference. That is a human frailty. When there is good we stand up. We, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella and myself, when she was treated unfairly by the removal of her security, spoke on her behalf. Even though she had done innumerous harm to us, we still stand for human beings when there is a necessity for us to do so. Sir, this Government is spending almost Rs. 140 billion on the war and is saying that success is around the corner. If that is the case, why is the war in the North, why is the war in the East ( ) (The Presiding Member) Please wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Please give me ten minutes, Mr. Presiding Member. There is one speaker who will not be speaking on this issue. So, I will be taking that time. The war in the North has spread to the East and they say it has been cleared day after day. As I mentioned before, the Hon. Lalith Athulath Mudali, when he controlled, won the East in a couple of hours; General Denzil Kobbekaduwa took a couple of days. The Hon. Anuruddha Ratwatte may have taken a couple of weeks. This Government for the last seven or eight months, has been saying that they have captured the East without anything happening. The North and East war has spread to Colombo and the rest of the country. Today, the innocent representatives of the Tamil people are not able to voice their concern and quite rightly you have to live to fight another day. So, we are fighting on their behalf. That is why the United National Party is truly a United National Party. We have no links with anybody. Unfortunately, the very Members like the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera and the Hon. Sripathi

2007 20 1605 1606

Sooriyaarachchi who said that there is a link between the Tigers and the United National Party today have come on to this side. This is retribution. We utter things that are wrong. Just because they came on to this side, that does not stymie our voices. But they themselves have realized that what they did has put the entire democratic process into jeopardy. What they have done today is a rectification that the people could have done. So, we salute them for their courage and I hope that there will be more Members of Parliament from that side coming over. We will set the ball rolling. We have taken the battle from the Parliament to the people and that is why there were two Members who came over. Next time you will see another lot coming over. So, at the end of the day, please let us all get together and save Mother Lanka. This is not a country for one family; this is not a country for one town; this is not a country for one ethnic group; this is not a country for one religious group. This is for all Sri Lankans and let the social fabric, the multiple races, the multiple religious groups get together. That is the strength of our country. Together we certainly are a rich country. The industriousness of the Tamils, the business acumen of the Muslims and the large-heartedness of the Sinhalese should be put together and put Sri Lanka back on the world map. Today we seem to be moving like a satellite far out of its orbit.

Look at the expenditure that has taken place. This year the Government has voted Rs. 140 billion for defence and before too long they will be asking for another Rs. 71 to Rs. 80 billion because they have got to purchase MiGs, UAVs et cetera but at the end of the day, we still do not seem to be on top of the situation. We, when it comes to defence have been relatively silent because we want to give the Government the opportunity to do what they say. I asked a question as to what the expenditure on defence was and quite rightly, the Government has the right not to explain owing to security reasons. Without knowing the information we have to blindly wait and hope that the Government is taking the right step. But we feel that they are miserably failing. They target innocent people in order not to show their military defeat. As you know, a government until it wins, loses. Terrorists unfortunately, until they lose, they win. So, from that point of view, we have got to look at as to how we are going forward.

Look at the International Independent Group of Eminent Persons Report. The Daily Mirror of 12th of June, 2007 states, I quote: Blow to Govt. : Experts criticize HR Commission" Justice P.N. Bhagwati is a very respected person. This is only on seventeen people who are missing. The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, the Minister of Human Rights invites them to this country and the first report that comes out on a temporary basis says that there are blatant violations taking place. The Government is not co-operating, they say.

Hon. Minister of Justice, I think it comes within your purview. You must ensure that you break the fetters. Whoever is trying to stymie information given to the International Independent Group of Eminent Persons should not be permitted to do so. They should be permitted to obtain information. Because if by chance a wrong report on human rights goes to the International Independent Group of Eminent Persons, we Sri Lanka will be named along with what has been happening in Sierra Leone, in Zimbabwe, in Sudan or Darfur. Then we will not have an insurance to safeguard our country. Going on further, look at what has been mentioned. The Government says, Fresh initiatives to stabilize the CFA. This is vehemently opposed by some quarters of the Government. The next one, they say, . , ? . , ? . , , 50,000 . , , . In the same way, the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva went to Geneva and said that fresh initiatives should be taken to stabilize the CFA. But it has taken eighteen months. What has been going on? Have we obstructed? The President and the Government have been so lucky that they have a Leader of the Opposition who is so accommodative and who says, Do whatever you want and tell us. But what happened today? The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle said that the newspaper reports do not state that the Hon. Leader of the Opposition was not there to vote yesterday. What on earth is this? Hon. Minister of Justice, there is no justice in your Government. We are trying to assist you. You are trying to kick us away. When we came through a MoU, you said, Very good. At least that is the dawn of a new future in this country. When the MoU is broken, for that also they scold the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe and the United National Party. That is why I say in this Government, the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing and even if the left hand knows what the right hand is doing, they cannot think what to do next. Because of that, scolding the UNP is the best thing for them. Look at the audacity and arrogance of the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle. . . , , , , . , , , .. , . . . . , .

When my Colleague, the Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne mentioned something for the collective good of the Government, harassment takes place. These are people in the armed forces. So, please ensure that collective responsibility is not only seen and spoken of, but is demonstrated in action as well. Once again, I want to refer to the economy. I am quoting from the Financial Times of the Daily Mirror newspaper of 15th, June, 2007. Exports slacken, Imports soar in April. Sir, that is a clear case which corroborates that Sri Lanka has been ranked as the world's 25th worst State.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . .

2007 20 1669 1670

.

( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Thank you Mr. Deputy Speaker, I would first like to read my Adjournment Motion.

Whereas His Excellency the President has under Section 5 of the Public Security Ordinance promulgated certain regulations cited as the Emergency (Mutur (East)/Sampur High Security Zone) Regulations No.2 of 2007 which regulations have been published in Government Gazette Extraordinary No.:1499/25 of Wednesday, 30th May 2007. And whereas the said regulations state that there shall be declared a zone to be called the Mutur(East)/Sampur Hgh Security Zone comprising the area the limits of which are described in the schedule to the said regulations and which are depicted in the map included in such schedule. And whereas there is no map included in such schedule rendering such regulations invalid. And whereas a great deal of uncertainty and confusion prevails in regard to the said regulations and the said lack of clarity renders the said regulations invalid. And whereas the said regulations, in any event, constitute a blatant violation of the fundamental human rights of the Tamil people who have historically inhabited these areas and are deliberately discriminatory against them on the grounds of race. And whereas the implementation of the said regulations could result in several thousands of Tamil families who have been historical inhabitants of several ancient Tamil villages in the said areas and who were displaced by the indiscriminate aerial bombardment and multi-barrel rocket launcher fire in the course of military operations conducted in the said areas by the Sri Lankan State, being denied their fundamental rights to resettle on the lands owned and possessed by them in such villages and to carry on their livelihood in the said villages and pursue their economic social and cultural aspirations in the said villages. This is their birthright and cannot be denied to them. And whereas this action has been capriciously taken by the Sri Lankan State without any form of consultation with the said Tamil people or their democratically elected representatives. And whereas this action if pursued will inflict immeasurable and irreparable harm to the lives of these thousands of Tamil families and their descendants.

We therefore call upon the Government, (I) to refrain from taking any steps to implement the said regulations And (II) to take steps to rescind the said regulations so that these thousands of Tamil families can resettle on their lands possessed and owned by them in the said villages and recommence their lives. I will not refer to the Gazette Extraordinary, Sir, a copy of which I have with me here.

.

( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) All I would say, Mr. Presiding Member, is that this Gazette Notification seems quite vague and quite confusing in regard to several matters. Be that as it may, Sir, it would appear that the area covered by the Gazette Notification which has been declared a high security zone would cover approximately 50 per cent of the present Mutur Divisional Secretarys Division. The present Mutur Divisional Secretary's Division is 179.4 square kilometres in territory and if it would cover 50 per cent of that territory, it would appear that this high security zone would encompass about 90 square kilometres of territory which is a very substantial extent of land. That is the extent of land which apparently is covered by these regulations and which has been declared a high security zone, if those regulations are implemented in the way in which it is proposed. Sir, there are, within this territory 12 Grama Sevaka Divisions. There are 28 villages comprising of 4,249 families and making a total population of 15,648 people. I will not read out the names of the Grama Sevaka Divisions, Sir, nor the names of the villages. I am tabling* a statement in regard to this matter and I would request, Mr. Presiding Member, that this statement be included in the Hansard and that you direct accordingly. Sir, in this document that I have tabled, I have referred to 28 villages, and in these villages are 19 schools, and one of them is Chenaiyoor Central College which is the most leading educational institution in the entire Mutur

area. In these 19 schools, several thousands of children, according to my information, approximately 5000 to 6000 children are being educated. Sir, in this area, which is supposed to be declared as a high security zone, 18 Hindu Temples and one Methodist Church are situated and I am tabling*, Sir, a statement giving the names of the 19 schools and the 19 places of worship and I request that you kindly direct that the statement be included as a part of my speech in the Hansard. This area, Sir, has 88 minor tanks under which people cultivate. It has grazing lands meant for the livestock owned by the people in the area, which is approximately 2,000 hectares in extent. Farming, fishing and livestock breeding are the main occupation and source of income of these people. There are several fishing villages in this area comprising of a large number of families who depend upon fishing. There are two hospitals in the area. One is the Sampur Hospital and the other one is the Paddalipuram Hospital. If this high security zone concept or proposal is to be implemented in this area, I would earnestly request the House to visualize the havoc, the utter havoc that would be created in the lives of these large number of people living in that area. We are also, Sir, very concerned because of the impression that is sought to be created by certain very highly placed Government persons that this Sampoor area was indeed a Sinhalese village in ancient times, in olden times. In fact, I do not mind mentioning on the Floor of this House that some diplomats have inquired from me and asked me the correct position on the basis of some statements made to them by persons in high Government positions. This has become a matter of grave concern to us and I therefore want to put the record straight and put the matter beyond doubt for these are not matters which can be allowed to be left in the realm of doubt and in the realm of myth for people to play around with. I have with me the Gazette of the Census of Ceylon 1881 where it is stated that there were in 1881 four Wanniyar Divisions, Assistant Government Agents Divisions in the Trincomalee District. The first was Trincomalee Town, the second is Kaddukulampattu, the third is Koddyarpattu and the fourth is Tambalagamampattu and this entire area Sampur and Mutur East area comes within the Koddyarpattu Wanniyars Division or the Koddyarpattu AGAs Division. According to the Census of 1881, I have with me in my hand a copy of the Gazette, the population breakdown ethnic-wise in the Koddyarpattu Division is as follows: Europeans - 01, Eurasians and Burghers - 13; Males - 07,

Females - 06; Sinhalese - 11, Males - 11, Females - none; Tamils - 3027; Males - 1646, Females - 1381, Moormen Muslims - 1673, Males - 881, Females - 792, Veddas - 38, Males - 21, Females - 17. This is the reality. I am not for a moment saying anything against the Sinhala people, certainly not. But if persons in high positions in Government have certain beliefs in some myths, I think there is a need to dispel such beliefs. Therefore, it is my duty to refer to this matter on the Floor of the House and put the record straight .

I have with me, Sir, the census of 1827 based upon religion and according to that the Hindus were 14,182 in the whole of the Trincomalee District, the Buddhists were 250, the Moors were 3,245 and the Christians were 1,481. Most of the Christians would have been Tamils. What is important is that the Hindus, all of whom would have been Tamils, were 14,182 and the Buddhists, all of whom must have been Sinhalese, were 250. I am only mentioning these figures, Sir, because as I said before, there is a need for this confusion and these myths that were growing in the minds of these people to be dispelled and they should realize that they have been seriously mistaken in expressing this point of view to some diplomats and others with whom they have discussed this matter.

We are concerned also because the Government thinks that there are certain security considerations which need to be addressed. It is our view, Sir, that such security considerations can be addressed without a severe and total denial of the fundamental human rights of the long-standing Tamil civilian residents of these areas.

The Government's action, in our submission, is indicative of a total lack of sensitivity to the rights of the Tamil civilian population and is strongly reflective of anti-Tamil racial discrimination. The Government is insensitive to such severe and total denial and deprivation of civilian rights, because the civilians are Tamils. The Government has not and will not, on grounds of security, inflict such denial and deprivation on the Sinhala civilian population.

This leads me, Sir, to the more fundamental question of why this distinction exists in the mind of the Government, between the Sinhalese and the Tamils relating to security. Is it not for the simple reason that you have not accommodated diversity and pluralism and recognized the most fundamental human right of the Tamil people, the right to internal self-determination in the areas of their historical habitation, is it not this failure on your part that compels the Tamil people to disaffect and rebel, more particularly the Tamil youth to rebel? Have you honestly and meaningfully addressed the cause of such disaffection? Is not the solution the granting of substantial self- rule to the Tamil-speaking people in the

* . . Produced at end of speech.

2007 20 1673 1674

territories in which they have historically lived and are in a majority? Your lack of will or ability to do the correct thing drives you to confiscate and expropriate the land and the property which belongs to these Tamil people, which is owned by them and which they have historically inhabited. You will not stop at that; indeed with such thinking, you cannot stop at that. Your task, in accordance with your thinking, will be fully accomplished only when this land, this property of the Tamil people is occupied by Sinhala people of your choice. That is what you will try to proceed to do. The Tamil people see this move of yours as yet another step to spread your tentacles into the Tamil-speaking historical habitation.

It is my duty, Sir, to state that such diabolical action on your part cannot and will not achieve either of your objectives: neither the security you seek nor the Sinhalisation of Tamil-speaking territory, both of which you believe can be achieved through military aggression. But in the process, the Tamil civilian population is being grievously victimized. Such action on the part of the State can only be described as heinous.

It is also my duty, Sir, to state that security can be achieved only through a just and honourable peace and this is not achievable by mere words, by empty rhetoric. It is achievable only through action primarily by the Sri Lankan State that demonstrates a strong commitment to a just and honourable peaceful resolution of the conflict. We, therefore, Sir, call upon the Government to abandon this proposal of declaring this area as a high security zone and to facilitate the resettlement of the displaced Tamil civilians on the lands from which they were displaced. Nothing less would be acceptable.

Before I conclude, Sir, I consider it my duty to demonstrate to this House the political thinking of the people in this area and for that purpose I am going to cite to you the result of an election that took place on the 28th of June, 1962 after the death of the then sitting Member of Parliament, Mr. T. Ahambaram who was a Member of Parliament for Mutur. After his death there was a by-election and Prof. C. Suntharalingam, who was a very renowned person in this country, contested the Mutur Electorate on the platform of Tamil Eelam. He wanted Tamil Eelam to be the policy goal of the Tamil people and contested the Mutur Electorate on the platform of Tamil Eelam. He was opposed by the Federal Party candidate. The Federal Party candidate polled 14,215 votes and Prof. Suntharalingam polled 423 votes and forfeited his deposit.

. ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) Mr. Mohamed Ali was the candidate of the Federal Party.

.

( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) That was the position. So, this would demonstrate to you that these people of Mutur have only been demanding autonomy, the right to internal self-determination in the area of their historical habitation. They did not demand separation and when a person so renowned as Prof. Suntharalingam was the candidate, they voted in such a manner that he even lost his deposit. And these are the people who have been evicted from their lands which they own, which belong to them for generations, for centuries. They have been evicted as a result of military action and now you are contemplating keeping them out completely by declaring this area, 90 square kilometres of territory, 50 per cent of the Mutur AGAs Division as a high security zone, so as to ensure that these people will not be able to return and live in those territories and thus these people will be denied the right to lead a decent life as human beings, to carry on their livelihood, their farming, their fishing, their livestock breeding, have their children educated and pursue their economic, social and cultural aspirations in the area in which they and their ancestors have lived for generations and centuries, will continue to reside for many more centuries and generations to come.

I am finishing, Sir. If the Government persists in its proposal to retain this area as a high security zone and to keep these people out of this area, it would mean that the Government is deliberately engaged in a policy of ethnic cleansing; of keeping Tamils out from areas which they have historically inhabited and the Government would render itself liable to the charge of deliberate ethnic cleansing in this area. This Motion will be seconded by my Colleague, the Hon. K. Thurairetnasingam, Member of Parliament for Trincomalee, who is also a victim. His house is in Kattaiparichchan in this area. The house belongs to his family, who have been historical inhabitants of this area. I have on my left-hand side another Friend of mine, the Hon. Mavai Senathirajah, who has been evicted from Mavittapuram, Valikamam North. He is unable to return to his home, to his village because it has been declared a high security zone. Today, my Friend, the Hon. Thureiretnasingam, Member of Parliament for Trincomalee, who is a resident of Kattaiparichchan will second this Motion. He is also a victim along with several thousands of other people.

I would appeal to the Government to abandon this idea, to refrain from implementing this proposal, to discuss this matter with the democratically elected Members of this area and arrive at a solution which will not result in the people being harmed in this way. I am addressing you today, Sir. I am told today is the International Refugees Day and on such a day, I think the Government should take a good decision, not render more people to become refugees, should reverse their decision and decide not to proceed with this proposal. I thank you, Sir.
