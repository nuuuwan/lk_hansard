( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am happy to follow the Hon. Maithripala Sirisena. Sir, I am happy the Hon. Prime Minister is here. The Hon. Prime Minister has moved the Resolution in regard to the state of Emergency. There is something, Sir, I want to raise with the Hon. Prime Minister. I have always had a very cordial relationship with the Hon. Prime Minister and I must say, at a personal level he has extended to me the maximum courtesy. But I was quite surprised at a speech that I saw the Hon. Prime Minister make at a function which was telecast and which I listened to very carefully. The Prime Minister referred to the attack on the Katunayake Airport in the course of which he stated, The LTTE has come and attacked Katunayake. I cannot understand why they have done so. What have we done to justify this attack? That, I do not want to comment about. The Prime Minister is entitled to his own views in regard to the matter. The Hon. Prime Minister went on to say, Some people are talking about a negotiated settlement. There is no equivalent for the expression negotiated settlement in the Sinhala dictionary, which was tantamount to saying that the expression "negotiated settlement" is not something which is found in the Sinhala vocabulary. And then he went on to say, We have started a certain course of action in which we have been successful and we will pursue that course of action until we are fully successful. About that too, I have no complaint. That is a matter in regard to which the Prime Minister is entitled to have his own views. But I certainly want to raise the question on the Floor of this House as to what exactly the Prime Minister meant when he said, There is no equivalent for the expression negotiated settlement in the Sinhala dictionary, which meant the Sinhala vocabulary? Does that mean that as far as the Sinhala people are concerned, they do not understand the meaning of the expression negotiated settlement? This is something, Sir, which is very important. The Hon. Prime Minister is a very senior Member of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. He was Prime Minister when Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was the President. He was Prime Minister before the present President became Prime Minister and he has been appointed Prime Minister by the present President after he became the President and he is no small person in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. The statement made by him which was telecast over the television, the electronic media and viewed by all the people in this country, the Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims and everyone, must certainly have a relevance, a meaning and I must state, Sir, that I was much perturbed by that. We are concerned, Sir, because as far as we can see, the possibility of a negotiated settlement rather than moving forwards is now in fact moving backwards.

There was this demerger of the North-Eastern Province. The merger of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces was the cornerstone of the peace process and the removal of that cornerstone means that the peace process must crumble. When I expressed this view to the Hon. Indian Prime Minister when we met with him, he was in perfect agreement with that view. This was brought about by an unfortunate Supreme Court ruling where the Supreme Court merely held that the procedure adopted by President J.R. Jayewardene in regard to the merger was not regular. The Supreme Court did not hold that there could be no merger or that the merger was invalid. The Hon. Prime Minister made a Statement in Parliament after that Supreme Court ruling. In the course of that Statement, he referred to several options, one option being the bringing of legislation to Parliament, which would have enabled the re-merger or the merger of the two provinces once again. There can be no doubt, Sir, whatever that if such a resolution is brought to Parliament, that resolution would be passed by this Parliament by an overwhelming majority. If the Government is behind that Resolution, it will be supported by the United National Party, it will be supported by the TNA, I have no doubt it will be supported by the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, the Ceylon Workers Congress, the Up-Country Peoples Front and by various other parties in this Parliament and it will be passed by an overwhelming majority. We are sorry that that step has not yet been taken by the Government. But what is happening now in the North-East? What is happening particularly in the Eastern Province? I am sorry to state, Sir, that the Sinhalization of the administration in the East is being strengthened. Of the six Secretaries appointed for the East, currently three, including the Chief Secretary, are Sinhalese, there are two Tamils and one Muslim. The Chief Secretary is Mr. H. Abeyaweera, a Sinhalese gentleman who has served formerly as Government Agent, Ampara. The Secretary, Public Administration is Mr. G. Rodrigo, yet another Sinhalese gentleman. The Secretary, Education is Mr. Siriwardene, yet another Sinhalese gentleman. The Secretary, Health is Mrs. Ranjini Pillai, a Tamil. The Secretary, Rehabilitation is Mr. Swaminathan, a Tamil and the Secretary, Agriculture is Mr. Mahroof, a Muslim. More than 75 per cent of the people in the Eastern Province are Tamil-speaking. More than 75 per cent! And of the six Secretaries appointed, 50 per cent, including the Chief Secretary, are Sinhalese. The others are two Tamils and one Muslim. Tomorrow, a good Muslim Friend of mine, who is a Minister, might be in a position to persuade the Government to make a few changes but six months later, one year later, five years later, ten years later the position will only get worse.

The Governor of the Eastern Province, a retired military official, is a Sinhalese. Do you have any Governor in the rest of the country who is a retired military official? No, we never had any. The Government Agents of the predominantly Tamil-speaking

2757 2758

Trincomalee and Ampara Districts in the Eastern Province are both Sinhala. The Trincomalee Government Agent is a retired Sinhalese military official. Do you have any other Government Agent in any other part of the country who is a retired military official? Then why should you have as the Government Agent of Trincomalee, the population in Trincomalee being more than 70 per cent Tamil-speaking, a Sinhalese and that too a retired military official? Why should Ampara, which has more than 62 per cent Tamil-speaking population, have a Sinhalese Government Agent? Quite clearly, Sir, the groundwork is being laid for the Sinhalization and Sinhala takeover of the Eastern Province. And when the Prime Minister said that there is no term for the phrase "negotiated settlement" in the Sinhala vocabulary, was he referring to what is now happening in the Eastern Province? However, as I said before, Sir, I have had a very cordial relationship with the Hon. Prime Minister and I mean nothing personal. But I consider it my duty to raise this question on the Floor of this House. The eviction of Tamils from their historical villages in the Eastern Province and the emasculation of the political strength of the Tamils is, in my submission, a part of this process. All arrangements that existed pertaining to mobilization of projects, management and implementation of projects including determination of priorities have been dismantled and brought completely under Central control. They are now handled only in Colombo. As in the past, the North-East is no longer treated as a war-torn area that has suffered much devastation and which must receive special attention pertaining to resettlement, rehabilitation, reconstruction and development. Everything comes under the Centre which treats the country as one unit with no special focus on the North-East despite the fact that it is a war-torn territory with tremendous devastation and destruction. A concept is being clearly enunciated that no distinction must be drawn between the North-East and the rest of the country. Not even the fact that the North-East has been long neglected in the matter of development is relevant. Meanwhile, Sir, as I said before, military action currently being pursued results in further devastation, particularly in the Eastern Province. Allocations are made by the Centre for the North and the East separately, treating the North and the East as separate entities, though the court merely held that the procedure pertaining to the merger was flawed. While lip-service is being paid to sharing the powers of governance, centralization and Sinhalization, by progressively reversing the North-East merger as a first step are being vigorously implemented and we have not the slightest doubt that further steps aimed at the achievement of this goal will follow. We must appeal to the Government, Sir, not to proceed with this course of action. If the Government persists in this course of action, the chances of peace dawning in this country would indeed be very remote, would indeed become impossible.

There are, Sir, over 150,000 refugees presently in the Eastern Province, who are mostly in Batticaloa at present. Over 300 people have been killed in the Eastern Province, in the Trincomalee and the Batticaloa Districts as a result of aerial bombardment, heavy artillery fire and rampant use of multi-barrel rocket launchers. We can prove it; we have got the figures. Over a thousand people have been injured. Our houses have been devastated and destroyed; our plantations have been destroyed; our crops have been destroyed; our livestock have been destroyed; our vehicles have been destroyed. The people have nothing to go back to. They are presently in refugee camps. There has been some attempt at forcible resettlement. People have declined. People are afraid to return because when they return, they are taken away and a large number of people have gone missing. I have got with me, Sir, the particulars of persons who have gone missing in Batticaloa as on 09.01.2007. They are Nanthakumar Nadanaruban, 14 years, Rajadurai Pathmanathan, 16 years and Sellathamby Thanuseelan, 16 years. A number of persons have been reported missing. I have got here with me the information pertaining to about 20 people who have gone missing. They have been taken away. People are being arrested; people are being detained. Some people are being detained in Boossa. Some people have been arrested from the refugee camps and are being detained elsewhere. I have got here with me a list of six persons arrested on the 1st of April at St. Anthonys Church, a refugee camp in Mutur. Searches are being conducted and people are afraid to return to their villages because they are not sure that they will be safe. Sir, we have met with the United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Co-ordinator and the UNDP Resident Representative in Sri Lanka and urged that the matter of resettlement of these refugees be brought under a UN umbrella so that these people will be safe. The evicted persons should be resettled on the same land from which they were evicted. These lands have belonged to them. Those lands have belonged to their families for generations and centuries. The State has no right to deprive these people of these lands and these people must be resettled on the very same lands from which they were evicted. Most of their houses have been destroyed or are badly damaged. They must be provided with housing. They should be provided with acceptable and neutral security. The evicted persons are 100 per cent Tamils; the Sri Lankan security forces are over 99 per cent Sinhala. There is no mutual trust between them, particularly in the aftermath of the severe military action taken by the Sri Lankan security forces. The evicted Tamil civilian population would not be safe with security provided by the same forces as is being clearly demonstrated by the large number of persons who have been arrested, who have been detained and who have gone missing. Sir, they should be provided with the necessary means to commence their occupation such as farming equipment, fishing equipment and other facilities.

Children should be able to recommence schooling. Over 20,000 children are not able to attend school at present and this situation should not continue. Our temples, orphanages and public buildings have been destroyed or damaged. They should be restored and people should be provided with medical facilities. Pending the implementation of a proper programme for resettlement and in order to facilitate resettlement, we have submitted that it would be appropriate to set up transit camps at or close to the village from which the people were evicted. This would enable the people to partake in the resettlement programme and also recommence their occupational activities. Sir, we want to urge that this programme be initiated and implemented under the auspices and responsibility of relevant United Nations agencies. They are a neutral player and that would certainly inspire much confidence amongst these severely traumatized people. There is something else that I wish to refer to with regard to the United Nations involvement. As we all know, Sir, very unfortunately Sri Lanka once again has come under observance by various international groups who are engaged in monitoring human rights, particularly the Amnesty International, the Human Rights Watch and so on and so forth and there has been a strong demand made at the last meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva that they must be stationed in Sri Lanka, a United Nations human rights monitoring mechanism so as to ensure that there will be neutral observers, a neutral umpire in regard to the observance of human rights, which will ensure that people will no longer be able to flagrantly violate human rights with impunity as is now happening in the country. Speaking to "The Sunday Leader", as reported in the newspaper on 25.03.2007, Mr. Brad Adams, Sir, the Asia Director for Human Rights Watch has said, I quote: HRW believes a United Nations human rights monitoring mission is urgently required. He further said, I quote: Monitors on the ground will help temper the behaviour of all parties to the conflict, thereby saving lives. We hope that the UN Human Rights Council and other concerned states will raise Sri Lanka during the session and work with the Sri Lankan Government towards establishing a United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Sri Lanka. "The Sunday Leader" of 25.03.2007 states, I quote: Organizations such as the HRW informed the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva last week that the Presidential Commission was an inadequate mechanism for addressing the wide spectrum of serious and ongoing abuses by all sides, ..... The same newspaper further reported, I quote: As UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour noted, the commission will only investigate a selection of cases, and a broader international mechanism is needed to monitor and ultimately prevent human rights violations in the longer term.

The newspaper article further states, I quote: Meanwhile the International Independent Group of Eminent Persons appointed to observe the functions of the Commission of Inquiry have noted that due to the lack of a strong witness protection programme, witnesses were afraid to risk their lives by lodging complaints with the Presidential Commission for Inquiry. It further states, I quote: Due to the lack of a strong witness protection unit, the Presidential Commission of Inquiry which was appointed to investigate 15 cases of serious human rights violations has received only 12 representations thus far. Commission Secretary S. D. Piyadasa had said that he was disappointed - ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , . . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I will take a few minutes more, Sir. I have got time; our Party has got time. Getting back to the newspaper article, it states, I quote: Commission Secretary S. D. Piyadasa had said he was disappointed at the number of representations received, despite wide publicity given. Statements from Catholic priests, NGOs and private individuals made up the 12 representations, he said. That is the position, Sir, though the Government tries to make out something else. Our burly Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights - I do not see him present here - goes before these international bodies and tries to make out that the Government is setting up Commissions of Inquiry and so on and so forth. I do not know to what extent this Honourable Gentleman is able to really monitor the human rights situation in Sri Lanka. Though he is the Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights, it is my respectful view that his influence and control over the observance of human rights in this country is almost nil. I do not think those persons who are engaged in military action are prepared to pay heed to him in any way in regard to whatever views he expresses in regard to human rights. Meanwhile, Sir, the US State Department - I have got the Country Report here with me - has come out very strongly in its Report for the year 2006 against the human rights situation in Sri Lanka and has documented the very serious human rights violations that have taken place in this country in recent times. This, Sir, is a continuing phenomenon; it is not something which ends by appointing a commission or starting an inquiry. Under the article "HR watchdogs call for third umpire", "The Sunday Leader" of 1st April, 2007 states, I quote: Just last week, Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Arbitrary or Summary Executions, Professor Philip Alston said that since 2005, the conflict in Sri Lanka continues to involve extrajudicial executions and disappearances directed at civilians and others no longer involved in

28761 2762

[ . ]

combat. He said that the return of disappearances on a large scale- the so-called white van' syndrome- should be especially disturbing to anyone with even a cursory familiarity with Sri Lankas recent history. He added that the government has, unfortunately, responded to this pattern of human rights violations primarily with a public relations campaign designed to head off international scrutiny. While there have been some positive initiatives, including the establishment of a commission of inquiry accompanied by an independent international group of eminent persons, Professor Alston said that these cannot plausibly respond to the abuses occurring on a daily and escalating basis. 'Commissions of inquiry are, at their best, less than nimble and less than capable of addressing constantly evolving situations.' Therefore, Sir, the position is perfectly clear. I have here with me, Sir - I have no time to read - reports of various newspapers, in regard to the position, where in Jaffna when there was a curfew on, people have been abducted; people have been killed; where in a white van people have gone to rob a house and in the course of robbing the house, have raped a young girl and killed the girl. There are numerous reports. Therefore, Sir, efforts made by people to merely show the world that for the Hon. Ravirajs killing we have got the Scotland Yard, for the murder of the 16 aid workers we have got the Australians to come here, we have appointed a local commission to inquire into certain specific abuses of human rights, we have got an international group of eminent persons coming here, all this is, in my view, in my submission, totally inadequate and does not meet the grave situation that Sri Lanka is in today on the question of human rights. That is the view of the Amnesty International; that is the view of the Human Rights Watch; that is the view of international organizations and no one can bluff in regard to that matter. ( )

( - ,

) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe - Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights) Hon. Sampanthan. .

( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Yes?

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Since my name transpired, can I have a few minutes just to answer you?

.

( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) No. You can speak after me, after I finish, please.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) I was listening to your speech. I am just trying to be helpful. That is all.

.

( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) No. I have no time. You can answer later on. I want to make it perfectly clear. The Hon. Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights wants to intervene. He can reply to me after I have finished. But, I want to say that the Hon. Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights is not in a position to control the blatant and flagrant violation of human rights in this country. That is the truth. There is no question about it. You are not in a position to control the military. You are not in a position to control the armed forces. They do not even let you to state your views. We are aware of that. That is the truth.

Sir, you are trying to pretend that this matter is under your control in this country. It is not correct at all. Our people are suffering. Our people are being killed. Our people are being abducted. Our people are being raped. This is what is happening. Therefore, Sir, I also want to urge that in addition to the UN bringing under its umbrella the matter of resettlement of people thereby giving confidence to the people, on behalf of the victims of human rights violations, I ask from the Floor of this House, that there be a United Nations Human Rights Monitoring mechanism set up in Sri Lanka, so that the violations of human rights by whomever - that is a continuing phenomenon on a daily basis - can be monitored.

I thank you, Sir.

( )

( - ,

) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe - Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights) I will take just two minutes. We will adjust the time from our side. Since my name transpired, I think it is my duty to reply to the Hon. Member of Parliament because he raised some very important points and I think it is essential that he and this House are informed of what the correct situation is.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) .

2007 05 2763 2764

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) I will just take two minutes, Sir. The point that you made Hon. Sampanthan about the IIGEP and the Commission of Inquiry, let me tell you that this was a structure which has no precedence anywhere in the world and when I was in Geneva during the Human Rights Council meeting, it was all praised and no criticism for the fact that we had put this structure in place. I do admit that it is only looking at fifteen cases. But these are fifteen important cases of disappearances, abductions and extra judicial killings which we hope to conclude successfully - [Interruption.] No, you did not give me the opportunity. Sir, he did not give me the opportunity. I do not want to yield either. [Interruption.] Please let me explain to you what the real situation is. We are very hopeful that we will be able to conclude these cases successfully. The Commission of Inquiry has been meeting more than on twenty occasions. The IIGEP Members have been coming to this country and they have been working very closely and effectively with this Commission of Inquiry. [Interruption.] Please let me finish.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees)

, do not disturb the Hon. Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) We are hopeful, Sir, that with the conclusion of these cases successfully, it will create a demonstrational effect so that these kinds of incidents will stop. We, as a Government do not agree and concur with this kind of behaviour. This is why His Excellency the President took this decision of putting in place a Commission of Inquiry. No one can criticize the level of the Commissioners or the background of the Commissioners. They are all very independent people and we have allowed eleven eminent international people to come to this country and observe whether this Commission of Inquiry is conducting its inquiry and investigative process and meeting minimum international standards. So that is the way the international community has read this and this is why the European Union decided that they will not proceed with the Resolution that they had put forward to be taken up at the last Council meeting. - [Interruption.] Pardon me. -[Interruption.] That is why I said that they will not proceed. Hon. Sampanthan, can I tell you something? This time they have not given a date for taking it up. They have not given a date for taking it up and I do admit that it is now up to us to show the results. We are asking you to work with us, not just blindly criticize us; not be subjective - [Interruption.]

The other point that I want to mention, Sir, there is absolutely no need -[Interruption.] No, no. Please let me finish. I have gone through all the reports and the best answer to all the reports was the fact that this Resolution was not proceeded with. Sir, I want to say one more thing. Our position as far as the International Monitoring Mission is concerned is that we do not feel that this is necessary. There is the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution. We are in the process, through a Select Committee of this very Parliament, to look into the shortcomings, the lacunas in the Seventeenth Amendment. We will rectify the Seventeenth Amendment; we will put in place the Constitutional Council once again; we will ensure that the independent commissions are put in place and once the independent commissions are strengthened and capacity-building takes place as far as those international commissions are concerned, there will not be a necessity to have international monitoring. -[Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) .

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) We will ensure that our national institutions will do the job, Sir. - [Interruption.] .

( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Why are you against them? - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The Hon. Jayarathna Herath may speak now. ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) There is a speaker from the Government side on his feet now. I guess you are giving time from your Party.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The Hon. Jayarathna Herath may speak now.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Why should we allow foreigners to come here and look at our human rights situation? -[Interruption.] There is no necessity to bring foreigners here. If we build our

2765 2766

[

strong independent institutions, there is no necessity to allow foreigners to come and do the job. [Interruption.] There is no necessity to have foreigners to come and do the job. [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Suresh Premachandran - [Interruption.]

Whilst appreciating the assistance offered by Government of India to establish an Air Defence System for Sri Lanka, it is strongly viewed that National Air Defence plan for Sri Lanka should not be compromised due to any external influence or pressure. , . , pressure . , , 5 , . ,

Who can answer these? That young Squadron Leader cannot answer that. They must be held responsible. They say that there is no threat on the Katunayake Air Force Base and the only thing that they need is a combat aircraft to shoot at movables. This is in their own website and they buy some planes from Ukraine which has never manufactured them. It is a repair factory. Only two places manufacture them - Moscow and Kazakhstan. Now there is no one even to answer that. [.. 1.01] ()

( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees. At the very outset I would like to remind my good Friend, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights that when he sought to defend the efforts of the Government in relation to the prevailing human rights situation in the country and more particularly in the North-East, he was only trying to defend the indefensible. He was trying to present a rosy picture in this regard. Following the eloquent intervention of the Hon. R. Sampanthan, Leader of our Parliamentary Group, my good Friend, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe was trying to present facts, which - I am sorry to state - I am rather compelled to counteract in relation to what he said about the Human Rights Council and the proceedings of it during the last three weeks of the last month. We all know the Hon. Minister went to Geneva. He was there on the very inaugural day, the 12th of March and having made his address he had returned to Sri Lanka in a day or two. It appears to me that he was not fully aware of what happened in the deliberations of the Human Rights Council in Geneva thereafter, till the 30th of last month. In fact, I was there Mr. Deputy Chairman. A number of countries including Switzerland, Sweden, Germany, the present Head of the European Union had made specific references to the prevailing human rights situation in Sri Lanka. Professor Philip Alston, Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Arbitrary or Summary Executions has in his Report to the UN Human Rights Council, recommended the establishment of an international monitoring mission to deal with the human rights situation in this country. He had warned about the impending human tragedy in Sri Lanka in relation to the prevailing human rights situation. The international community - I say with all emphasis - Sir, is now fully aware of what is going on in this country, with more than 1600 cases of murder in the North-East, murder of innocent civilians at the hands of the armed forces and paramilitary murderous mercenaries operating in conjunction with the armed forces, with more than 800

[ . ]

2833 2834

cases of abductions and disappearances. The prevailing situation in the North-East to say the least is very much worse than what the Tamil people experienced during the subjugation by the Portuguese colonialists in this country. We never ever had this situation before. Recently, we were made to understand that there has been cases of rape of innocent Tamil girls at the hands of murderous mercenaries. There has been a report about the commission of a robbery and rape in a private household in which the intruders having robbed the inmates had repeatedly raped a 14 or 15 year old female student in consequence of which she had to be warded in the Government hospital in Jaffna. There was another case, where a teacher, a mother of two or three children was gang raped by Tamil mercenaries operating in conjunction with the armed forces in full view of her husband and her tender children. This is the state of affairs in Jaffna. During the last three months commencing from the 01st of January, there have been 61 cases of murder till the end of March and during the last four days there have been four cases of murder committed by the armed forces, rather the elite groups of the armed forces and the Tamil mercenaries operating together with them, and 98 cases of abductions and disappearances. So in this state of affairs, one can see that my good Friend, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe is trying to do the impossible. That is, Sir, trying to defend the indefensible in relation to the human rights situation. One cannot help feeling sorry for him. I understand the Hon. Minister. He rightfully belongs to the side which he should be with. I can understand him. I can understand him very well. I only wish the Hon. Minister would read the Report of Professor Philip Alston, Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Arbitrary or Summary Executions that was submitted to the Human Rights Council on the 27th of March this year. I have the agenda. So this is the situation and here we talk about a political solution, about political proposals and I am rather compelled to say that this Government is inherently incapable of taking any positive step in this regard. With a number of months having rolled by, the Government and more particularly the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the main constituent of the Government Party is still unable to submit its proposals to the All Party Conference. That is the state of affairs. What is happening on the other side in relation to the Opposition? We all know what has happened to the Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi. It is nothing but political victimization; nothing but a gross manifestation of political vendetta. Now, I find my Colleague, the Hon. Shivajilingam is at the receiving end. I would like to tell the Government that we, the Members of the Tamil National Alliance have clean hands and our activities are open. Everyone of us is ready to face anything in this regard. In relation to the ongoing criminal investigation, we are ready to face the investigation. Not only the Hon. Shivajilingam, if that happens even to any other Member, that would be the case.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I have to state as to what happened the other day. That was on last Saturday, near the famous Murugandi Temple in the Vanni area, situated very much on the outskirts of the town of Kilinochchi, when there was an attempt by the so called Deep Penetration Unit to assassinate my good Friend, the Hon. Member from the Vanni District, the President of the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization, a constituent Member of our large alliance of Tamil National Alliance, my good Friend, the Hon. Selvam Adaikkalanathan and the Hon. Sivanesan, a Member of this august Assembly representing the Jaffna District. Thanks to providence, they narrowly escaped. This is the state of affairs in this country and with all that there are pious pronouncements, pious proclamations coming from the Hon. Minister in charge of human rights to the effect that the Government has been doing its best to deal with the situation.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, your time is over. .

( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) Doing what, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees? Doing its best to deal with the situation. We see the results on the ground. Rape, robbery, murder, abduction, disappearances and what not? This is the situation in the North-East. Even in Colombo every Tamil citizen whether he be a male or a female or a youth is very much concerned about his or her own security. With all this I am thankful to the Hon. Anura Bandaranaike for whom I have the highest regard as an able debater whether he was here or there, for being present to represent the Government on the front row of the Government now. I see practically an empty front row of the Government even on an occasion such as this. Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, please be kind enough to give me two more minutes. Even on an important Debate such as this except for two Hon. Ministers, I find the front row practically empty. This is the concern, this is the regard and this is the respect that is shown to Parliamentary democracy. With this state of affairs what can we expect on behalf of our Tamil people, the suppressed people of this country from this Government which I charge, I indict, is quite insensitive, callous and irresponsible in relation to its constitutional obligations? Therefore, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, we do not expect anything from this Government. The Government's days are numbered and I proclaim in this august Assembly that in a matter of a few months its term would come to an end and thereafter the people who have been the perpetrators, who are the perpetrators of all the ongoing violations of human rights would be made answerable. I believe that day will come soon. Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . . ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike - Minister of National Heritage) Hon. Deputy Speaker, it is indeed a very ominous and very important occasion that we are debating the extension of the Emergency Regulations. I would like to thank the Hon. Sri Kantha of the Tamil National Alliance for the warm compliments he has paid me. As an individual, my personal belief - I am not talking about the Government or anybody else - is that the talks with the LTTE must resume without delay, that we must once again merge the North and East and maximum devolution within a united Sri Lanka is the only solution to this problem. If the SLFP and the Government take a different view, unfortunately I will have to go along with them as a Member of the Cabinet. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) You must get them to take the correct view. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike) I will certainly try, Hon. Sampanthan. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) You will succeed. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike) I hope so. Whatever decision the Party takes, I will go along with it, but as an individual this is my view and this has also been the view of the ex-President, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the view of the Government of India and the view of all the other countries in Europe, United States of America, Japan and so on. Certainly it is the view of the Indian Government and the Indian Government has repeatedly - as Hon. Sampanthan knows - conveyed this to the Government of Sri Lanka, to President Mahinda Rajapaksa over and over again that the only solution is to stop the war and commence talks by taking the two main steps I mentioned today.

Sir, we are meeting at a time when unfortunately terrorism has taken a very dangerous trend, a trend it has taken never before. I am not here to analyze terrorism. I am not an expert on terrorism. But all this time Sri Lankans have been used to vehicular bombs and vehicles have been searched at great inconvenience to the public. But everybody has taken it silently because of the danger involved. Everybody has been searched. All Members of Parliament who are coming into this House, including yourself have been searched for many years. The Diyawanna Oya waters have been patrolled by the Navy and we have taken all the precautions we can possibly take as a Government. But nobody expected an aerial attack at 12.45 in the morning on the Air Force base at Katunayake. Sir, unfortunately the people of this country - this has been a curse that we have had to live through - have very short memories. They talk about something one day and they forget all about it the next day. They are all agog; they all get excited; they all get worked up and they talk about a certain incident and the next day it is forgotten. ( )

( - ,

) (The Hon. Dew Gunasekara - Minister of Constitutional Affairs and National Integration) It is a national weakness.

( ) (The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike) That is a national weakness. The Hon. Dew Gunasekara is quite right. It is a national weakness that our people always have. This is very unfortunate because the magnitude of what has happened is not only on the Air Force but also it is a fact that the LTTE now has air power which they can use at any given time, at any given target. Sir, you know the situation in Parliament. The United National Party asked for a debate which is their right. A major incident has occurred and as the major Opposition Party the UNP has a right - as I have used that right as the Leader of the Opposition on many occasions - to ask for a debate on major issues. But in a situation like this, Sir, a debate is useless. It is frivolous because the UNP will blame the SLFP, the SLFP will blame the UNP, the JVP will blame the SLFP and the UNP and in regard to the TNA I do not know what my good Friend, the Hon. Sampanthan will do. He will probably blame the whole world and the others will probably keep quiet. A debate in Parliament is frivolous, Sir. We come and vex our voices here, we condemn each other and we go home. The problem goes on. That is why I wrote to the Hon. Speaker in spite of the Hon. Leader of the Oppositions

6 - PL 001926 - (2007/04)

2841 2842

request that we should be clear in our own minds as Party Leaders that Parliament is safe. I have been in this House for 30 years. My life has been around this House, has been in this House. I am a committed Parliamentarian, I am a committed democrat and nobody can I think question that. This is the citadel of democracy and if Parliament is attacked, then I think we are set back by many, many years. Sir, we search cars as I said, the waters of the Diyawanna Oya are being monitored, but nobody looks up at the sky which the LTTE now controls. Obviously, something has been amiss and as a result they were able to come, attack the Air Force Base in Katunayake and then go back another 200 miles to the Vanni and be photographed with Prabhakaran looking jolly happy. Now, Sir, I do not think that we, as Parliamentarians on both sides have really not realized the seriousness of this matter. When I asked for a meeting with the Hon. Speaker and the other Party Leaders, I wanted to be briefed. I do not want to know the mechanism by which they do it. That is not my business. That is their business. My business is to ensure that Parliament is looked after as a Member of Parliament. That is why the Hon. Speaker - I must thank him for this - very quickly summoned a meeting. We were summoned on Tuesday morning, I think at nine oclock. We discussed this matter and we went on to other matters and I am totally unconvinced that Parliament is safe. All he said was that he cannot give away the secrets. Okay. I do not want to know secrets. I do not want to know what methodology they are going to use to safeguard this House. But we must be sure as Members of this House, every Member, every person working here, thousands of workers here, all the people who come to the galleries must be sure that their lives are safe at least in this citadel of democracy. I came out of that meeting completely flummoxed, still wondering what action they are going to take. I think, the Hon. Sampanthan was seated next to me. He must have been equally flummoxed. The Hon. Speaker is a very nice man. I am very fond of him. I have known him for 30 years. I think he is a gentleman and a very fine man, but I am not prepared to take his word. Here are our lives, the lives of 225 Members of Parliament, thousands of workers, security people, visitors, officials, yourself, the Speaker, all of them are in danger. I am totally unconvinced that that meeting produced any results at all because still I believe that the LTTE has the capacity to attack any target at their will. I do not want to talk about other places. That is not my business. I am talking about Parliament because I am a Parliamentarian. Now, Sir, somebody had said in the press, I do not know who it was I cannot remember now, that this happened during President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas time as well. Of course, yes. The Bandaranaike International Airport was attacked. Aircraft were destroyed. I think many places were attacked during

the late President R. Premadasas time, during the late President J. R. Jayewardenes time and during President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas time. But do not forget the fact that she was the President of this country for 11 years, twice elected for 11 years. In that 11 years, we captured Jaffna, we lost some battles, we won some major battles and the airport was attacked. Here in one year and three months we have the Air Force Base being attacked. So, it is useless saying that it happened during President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas time, it happened during late President R. Premadasas time and it happened during late President J. R. Jayewardenes time. But it is happening now. We must stop it now. Therefore, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I am totally dissatisfied with the assurances given by the Hon. Speaker, with no insult to him, as to whether the lives of the Members of this House and those who are working here are safe. Sir, it is far better to be an alarmist in my view, and take precautions than be complacent and pretend that all is okay and do nothing. We can do that. Nothing has happened, no bomb was dropped. So fine, life goes on. Life goes on but still the attacks will also go on. Today, in the morning a huge bomb of ten kilograms was found in the Wattala Supermarket. That would have blown up about 500 people if it exploded. This was meant for somewhere else, obviously. So this battle is going to go on and I believe that Tamilselvan has said that these attacks will be continued by air. So I am not satisfied with the assurance given by the Speaker, God knows on whose advice, that the Parliament is safe. I mean at 7 oclock in the night, 2 oclock in the morning they can attack this House. If we are all here including the TNA, then I am sure we will not be attacked; but if they are missing, I will be the first to run out.

( ) (An hon. Member) A major risk.

( ) (The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike) If my old Friend, the Hon. R. Sampanthan is missing from this House and the others are missing, I will run from this House, whatever the Vote. ( ) (An hon. Member) I shall embrace - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike) I was joking. I am not calling him a terrorist by any means -[Interruption.] He has his own beliefs, perfectly justified in having, I am not contesting that. But, Sir, this is the situation on the ground.

[ ]

2007 05 2843 2844

Now, Sir, again I read somewhere in the newspapers, said by some defence person, that India has given us some outdated machinery or some outdated stuff.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Radar.

( ) (The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike) Yes, radar. That was said. Was it not? And that is why the LTTE planes were able to get through. Sir, blaming India and not blaming ourselves is a very foolish, naive and childish thing to do. India is our only friend who will come to our assistance if we are in trouble. India is the only country that is affected by this directly. There are seventy million Tamils living in Tamil Nadu and the DMK is a part of the Congress Government led by Mrs. Sonia Gandhi and we have gone and opened our big, fat mouths and said, Oh! India has given us some useless, outdated machinery, radar or whatever. Sir, without blaming India, let us find out who is to be blamed first. Have a full inquiry. Find out where we have gone wrong. We hear all kinds of rumours. I do not want to repeat rumours in the House. But yet we have not been able to do that. Now, Sir, it is useless attacking India or anybody else on this matter. We must also remember that the international opinion about Sri Lanka is not very good, to say the least. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) It is horrible.

( ) (The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike) I heard Hon. Sampanthan that at the World Cup, human rights groups are distributing various leaflets in the West Indies against Sri Lankas violation of human rights. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) They want a neutral umpire. They want the UN to come here.

( ) (The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike) Therefore, we have to rebuild the confidence of the international community because all these countries in Europe like Britain, Germany, France, Italy and the

United States as well as Japan are all interested in the welfare of our country, to see that there is peace. We go to them for money, we beg them for money and then we do not listen to their advice. They are all trying to find a solution to this problem. But of course, we must find a solution that is acceptable to our people. There is no question about that. Therefore, Sir, may I say that today the world cannot be seen with one eye. It is a global village. As Senator Hilary Clinton, probably the next President of the United States has said - she has written a book called "The Global Village" - the world is a global village. One country cannot act on its own and forget that the rest of the world exists. We are a part of a huge global community and the community is getting closer and closer. Therefore, Sir, we cannot think in isolation. We must think as a part of the world and we must co-operate with the rest of the world in solving our problems if we cannot do it ourselves. Now, Sir, President Mahinda Rajapaksa must be commended for both, trying to bring in peace and for waging war. He tried very hard to get the talks off the ground but various things happened. There are various versions to this. The talks broke down and the war broke out. Naturally, as the Head of State and the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces as any commander-in-chief, he has to declare war to fight back. That is what he is there for. He is the Commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces. Our family has commanded the Forces for 28 years. We know the responsibilities it carries. Therefore, Sir, he has waged war on the LTTE. But in the meantime I am sure the President and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party would not object to talks starting immediately. Look what has happened in Ampara and Batticaloa. The Hon.( Mrs.) Ashraff is here. Sixteen people were slaughtered in a bomb attack on a bus including innocent Sinhala women and children. Six Sinhalese who had nothing to do with this conflict were slaughtered in Batticaloa in two days. How long can we go on like this? Everyday on the television you see either Sanath Jayasuriya or dead bodies. It is one of the two. Horrible looking dead bodies lying all over, pieces of heads and pieces of bodies! How long can we go on with a nation like this? That is why we have to get together and solve this problem and find a political solution to this as fast as possible.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, the time allotted to you is 15 minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike) How many minutes more have I got, Mr. Deputy Speaker?

2845 2846

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You have used the 15 minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike) Yes. I will wind up. Now, Sir, I have in fact come to the end of it. I would once again urge the Hon. Speaker, as a senior Parliamentarian and as a man with a good heart, to make absolutely sure that the lives of the Members of Parliament and the staff of this House are safe at all times. It is his responsibility. He is the custodian of this House. You are also partly responsible, but it is not your full responsibility. He is the Speaker. You are only the "". But it is his responsibility, the responsibility of the Speaker. Erskin May goes into chapters on this. Sir, it is his responsibility to ensure the safety of this House. But I am totally unconvinced that the safety of this House is ensured. Sir, may I finally say that this is not a Vote of No-Confidence on the Speaker at all. I am sure he will do the needful. But if anything goes wrong, he is also equally responsible. Therefore let him keep in mind, as good a man as he is, that he is also finally responsible if anything happens to this House. I have in fact had this fear for the last four years, long before I became the Speaker that this House would one day be a prime target because this is where we all meet. Today if all the Members of Parliament are going to be here, there will be 225 Members in this House. But we are quite safe as long as the Hon. Sampanthan is here. Please do not go, please wait there - [Interruption.] No. He is not a terrorist. He is a refined man. Sir, may I wind up by saying just one thing. This is outside the Emergency Debate and the subject under discussion. There was a very unfortunate incident in the Museum of Colombo which comes under my Ministry. There has been a leak in the roof and some old artefacts of very valuable nature have been affected. I could not go there yesterday because I had a dental problem. So I am going today to see it and I have already given instructions to the Ministry and the Secretary to the Ministry to have a full inquiry to find out how this has happened. I do not know during whose time the repairs were done; whether it was during the time the Hon. Vijitha Herath was the Minister or whether it was before him. I do not know for certain whether it was under the PA Government or the UNP Government. I do not know whether it was done under the two years of the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe. Whoever is responsible, whichever Government, whoever the official must be exposed and punished because these are artefacts which you cannot find again. I am very glad that the Hon. (Ven.) Ellawala Medhananda Thero, though his words were very strong and quite inappropriate for a Buddhist monk, has raised

a very important point. In fact I have already given instructions to have the areas that are leaking temporarily covered. Any high-ranking officer who is responsible for this will be fully punished and I give that assurance to this House. Now, Sir, with that I wind up. I have decided not to speak on the subject of Emergency. Our words are useless. I have been pleading on this issue many times as the Hon. Sampanthan knows very well and the other Members of this House also know this very well and I plead again, let sanity prevail, let us reach for the stars if it is ever reachable, if it is ever possible. Let us stop playing politics, let us stop thinking of the Sinhala vote, this vote and that vote. Let us bring peace to this country. Let us bring it during the time of this Government under Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksas Presidency. That will be the only service we can do for this country and if that service can be done it will be remembered at all times. Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. [. . 3.41] ( )

( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Sir, may I be heard?

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . .

( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Sir, I think we are dealing with a matter of principle and we wish to take an independent view in regard to this matter. The principle is that if a political party or an independent group has been elected to a certain number of seats in a local authority and if for some reason - whatever the reason may be - the list of candidates in the list of that particular political party or the independent group has been exhausted, those vacancies need to be filled. They must be filled certainly in terms of the democratic verdict delivered by the voters in that particular local authority and if a certain party had a certain entitlement, that party should be able to fill the vacancies that have

2873 2874

occurred. That is all. We are not concerned about other things. This is a straight forward simple matter and we take a perfectly independent view in regard to this question. I think it is perfectly democratic for that political party to be entitled to fill the vacancies that have occurred in that list. That is all what we are dealing with. And therefore, Sir, I think there should not be much haggling about this. I think we should support the Bill and have it passed.
