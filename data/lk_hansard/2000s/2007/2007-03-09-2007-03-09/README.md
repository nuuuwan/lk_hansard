( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa) Mr. Speaker, today at this Vote of Condolence we are talking about our beloved Colleague, the late Hon. Raviraj. Previously also, Mr. Speaker, I have spoken at the Vote of Condolence on the late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar. Thereafter, today I am speaking about the Hon. Raviraj. There are similarities in both these killings; both belonged to the Tamil community; both were lawyers who were my colleagues. I had a great opportunity to associate very closely with the Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar as well as the Hon. Raviraj. I have examined Hon.Raviraj's qualities closely. Therefore, when I speak about him, I have no hesitation and I speak from the bottom of my heart.

When I listened to most of the speeches made by both sides of the House in the Vote of Condolence, what I gathered was we spoke more about the North-East conflict than about Hon. Raviraj. That shows the killing of the Hon. Raviraj is an integral part of the North-East conflict existing not only now, but in fact for a period of over two and a half decades. Unfortunately, now this issue has been entrusted by both parties to the military sectors. In order to achieving the rights of the people who are living in the North and the East, especially the Tamil community, you have entrusted your battle to a military force; that is the LTTE. Now, the other side, the Government side, when there is no amicable solution,

when there is no political negotiation, when there is no attempt even to have a political negotiation as a result of the conduct of this terrorist organization, also has entrusted certain matters to the military. Now, our duty as Members of this House is to think about a political solution. To my knowledge, during the last so many years, there was no constructive discussion in this House. There had been curses, allegations, counter allegations and talking out of vindictive thinking. But there is one thing we must keep in mind and that is, that we cannot find a solution to this problem by conducting ourselves in this manner.

In the capacity of His Excellency the President as the Head of the Executive, - not only the present President even the former Presidents - made various attempts to find a solution and one significant feature was to appoint All Party Conferences. Even at the moment there is an All Party Conference going on. But on the other hand, as legislators, what steps or attempts have we made to find a solution? There was not even a suggestion by the TNA. I am not making a complaint, I am just drawing your attention. Although a mandate has been given to this House by the general public of this country, whether they belong to the Tamil community, the Sinhalese community or the Muslim community, not even a Select Committee has been established for this purpose to discuss these issues in Parliament. We are all representatives of the general public representing various communities, various divisions and areas. So, as long as you leave this matter to the President or to the Executive alone on this side and so long as you leave this matter to the LTTE alone on the other side, there cannot be a solution. The conflict will get worse obviously beyond any doubt when they are left with some military solution. That military solution is going on. Now the question is, whether you are going to rely on this military solution any further or whether by making allegations and counter allegations, the problem will be solved. My opinion is, no. Therefore we have to admire the task and attempts taken by the late Hon. Raviraj. We have only a very few Members in this House who can express their opinions in all three languages. He was one such Member who contributed immensely to maintain the harmony and understanding between the communities, not only in this House but by the services he has done through the media, especially the Sinhala media. We know that all Sinhalese people had the highest respect for him. There were many saying, from both sides, that the late Hon. Raviraj was a bridge connecting the North and the South. I fully endorse it because most of the views, the ideas held by the Tamil community in the North and the East were not within our knowledge. Similarly, may be they were in the dark about our thinking. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . .

, [ ] .

, , [ . ] . Whereupon MR. SPEAKER left the Chair and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES (THE HON. RAMALINGAM CHANDRASEKAR) took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa) I was drawing your attention to the efforts that we have to make in finding solutions. Do not think that the Members on this side or the Members representing the Sinhala community as rustic and of stone. We have hearts. We have sympathy. We are not talking out of vengeance. We are not vindictive. We are genuine to find a solution. We also appreciate the difficulties and agonies gone through by the Members who are in this House representing the Tamil National Alliance. I do not think we have ever gone through the difficulties that you have gone through. I know your problems when you have to face your people - you have a lot of problems. You have to face a lot of challenges. On the other hand your people expect you to do a lot within the four corners of this House. Your people think that you will find a solution in this House. Similarly, the majority community in this country also have a lot of expectations that we will do something in this House. I think this is the place. This is the correct time. We have suffered enough.

The Hon. Raviraj dedicated his life for the cause of the Tamil community. But at the same time we know that he was not doing anything out of vengeance. He was a very reasonable people's representative. We understood his mentality and knew the sacrifices he made. He was not only dedicated but finally he had to sacrifice his life also. It is a pathetic situation. Unfortunately when this type of an unfortunate event takes place we talk about it for a couple of months and finally we speak of him at the Vote of Condolence and then everything is forgotten. Now that is not the duty of the public representatives whether they represent the minority community or the majority community, no matter what, ones duty is ones duty. All people whether Sinhalese, Muslims or Tamils seek the protection from this House. So we will have to think about it not once, not twice but a hundred times as to whether we are performing that duty or whether we are shirking our duty. I feel - this is my personal view - that there were not enough attempts by the Members of this House to find a solution to this problem and after such a long period now it is a cancer. We are talking about a great personality with a lot of integrity, who never sought his own ego and maintained his equipoise. His equipoise was never disturbed in all those debates and arguments. He was such an admirable character. But by merely talking of the late Hon. Raviraj I do not think we are extending our due courtesy and respect to him. Taking into consideration all these lessons

- the bitter lessons that we have learnt in the past - if we can find a way to stop these killings, I think that will be the highest respect that you and I can extend to our beloved late Hon. Raviraj. The speaker who spoke just before me, drew attention to several unfortunate incidents. But we must not forget the fact that as a result of this conflict at least 60,000 people of this country have sacrificed their lives. As a Member of this House, as a responsible citizen of this country I will never go to the extent of counting how many Sinhalese, how many Tamils or how many Muslims are dead. That is ridiculous for any Member or any human being to evaluate deaths on a community basis. They are citizens of our country. They are our assets. More than the 60,000 people who have sacrificed their lives in this conflict, how many people are suffering as disabled? How many families are suffering without their beloved fathers or husbands or their children? This is the result of the war. Therefore, I would urge that while speaking about late Hon. Raviraj, we must respect our ethos. We must not forget that our society is a multicultural, a multireligious and a multilingual society. It is a potpourri. It is like a bouquet with a lot of colourful flowers. But in the same way, if one wants one can refashion the same thing to result in disaster or devastation. The experience that we are now going through unfortunately is that. When there are different communities living together in different types of cultural backgrounds - if you want you can take it as a blessing; if you want you can take it as a curse - I am sure all the minds, the intellects and those who respect other people in society can take it as a blessing. There has to be a lot of changes in attitude in our society. Even when I spoke two days ago, I pointed out certain examples from the Indian society. The question is why can we not improve to that level? We are maintaining the literacy rate at the highest level in Asia. With all that, even sometimes when you talk to the international community, they ask as to why our society is so deteriorated. If we want to find the reasons, we can look for them for hours, days and years. If we want to make allegations we can also do that; we were doing that. At least during the last two to three decades we were doing that in this House. But my conscience pricks.

What have we done as Members of Parliament? What are the moves that we have taken? By cursing the military forces from your side, by cursing the LTTE cadres from this side, has anybody gained anything? Is this the way we should conduct ourselves? My view is, no. The past is gone. I am not asking you to forget it nor am I ready to forget it. From the past we must learn lessons. This is the place for you to air your grievances. This is a place where we have to respond to your grievances, but in a constructive manner. My view is that we have not done enough. We have not done enough.

1619 1620

There are so many other unfortunate events which come to my mind. If we compare ourselves with the august Assembly that existed in the 1950s, 1960s, the then Members had realized what their duties were. When there was an issue in Matara it appeared in the Hansards that there were many Tamil Members from Jaffna in the House who had spoken much more than the Sinhalese Members on that issue. When there was a problem in Jaffna, I think the Sinhalese Members had taken the same interest whether they were from Matara, Galle, Hambantota, Anuradhapura or Kandy. It made no difference because at that time there was a collective responsibility of the Members of this House and all the Members who were in this House represented the country. But, that attitude has deteriorated to the worst level today because now the attitude is, if you are from Matara your interest is to look after Matara; if you are from Ja-Ela or Wattala your interest is vested in Ja-Ela or Wattala. That should be the thinking pattern which should prevail in the minds of the Members of the Provincial Councils or the Members of the Pradeshiya Sabhas. They are Local Government politicians. Their scope is limited. They cannot go beyond that. They cannot penetrate beyond that. I, of course, came from the National List. But, that was also on the strength of the vote base, the mandate given to the PA, this Sandanaya Government. Similarly, there are others. We must not forget that our duty is not only to look after the interests of the people in the South or to look after the interests of the people in the North. We must look after the interests of the people in the whole country. We will have to change this attitude. When are we going to do it? I think, there is a reason behind it. It has not happened haphazardly. There is a reason for it. There is a background to it. I think the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana will agree with me. There is a background to it. After the introduction of the new electoral system, the Propotional Representation System, Members have been confined to the districts. But, still you are not representing a particular number of people in your area. All those things are uncertain. May be you come from Wattala Seat but the votes given by the people in Wattala are not sufficient for you to come to this House. You will have to go around the district. Now, their territory is limited to a district. As a result of that, the attitude in the minds of the Hon. Members of this House has changed that somehow we must keep our people happy. Our people means not the people of this country but the people of their territory or their district or their electorate. That attitude has done a lot of damage to our system. In politics we had a very good culture; we had very good ethos. Our politicians had the qualities of refinement. They were a good blend of Eastern ethos, Western culture and Western intellect. What has happened? Although we refer to this House as the "august Assembly", if you go to the road and ask the people as to what their attitude about the present Parliament is, I do not think you would hear a single good response. It is an insult to this House. For

that matter we cannot blame the people. The people have a right to express their opinion. Everybody must have the same right to hold and express their opinion. That has been guaranteed by the Constitution. Unfortunately, Mr. Raviraj was killed by somebody because he expressed his opinion. He had not done anything wrong. He had not killed anybody. He had not caused any destruction to the country. Each and every minute, he spent for the benefit of the general public of this country. It was not only the late Hon. Ravirajs dream but even our dream to unite these communities and let them live like brothers and sisters. That is the dream of the people of this country whether they are Sinhalese or Tamils. There can be a very small percentage who think on different lines. But the dream of the majority, at least over 90 per cent of the people irrespective of their community is to get together. On an earlier occasion also I stated that there were Tamil businessmen who were doing quite successfully prior to 1983 even in my village, Walasmulla. You know, our experience is that when these traders wanted to go to their hometown in Jaffna they used to bring their children and keep them in our houses for protection. That was the culture we had. Similarly we used to go to their houses in Jaffna and stay in their houses for weeks and weeks. What a marvellous time we had ! What happened to that history ? Why can we not go back to the past? I think the attitude of the people and their war mentality must be removed, must be taken away. Until such time this House is a glorified talk-shop. But what is the resultant position? The resultant position is "no result" . Nobody will achieve anything. I was thinking that at least if there is a Select Committee appointed in this House to discuss these issues - this is my personal view - we can exchange views. We can exchange the views with the Hon. Members who have been sent to this Parliament by the Tamil community and the Muslim community from the North and the East and the Sinhalese community from all the other areas. Why can we not do it? What is the obstacle? Of course it is a pathetic situation that there is no good rapport among the Hon. Members who represent these two communities. With the ongoing military operations during the last two and a half decades, I think our friendship has been severed. Our dream should be to make this country a prosperous country where all citizens can live in a dignified way without discrimination while maintaining equality. Now, the whole future is only a dream. But in other countries it is not so. In most of the other countries where there is democracy, they live with expectations. They have a clear idea. They have a clear vision. They know what they are going to do in the next year and the following year. But, today, the whole political system is a glorious uncertainty. People are not in a position to think or presume what will happen tomorrow or what will happen in the next year. We are living in a world of uncertainty. We all are very unfortunate. But that is not what is expected from democracy. Democracy means a lot. That is why I mentioned that by making allegations and counter allegations, only a curse will befall on us. We can keep

[ ]

2007 09 1621 1622

on talking. I am not saying, do not discuss. But what I am saying is that we must go forward at least one or two steps above that level. As a first step why can we not discuss this issue as a whole? As Members representing all the communities, we can have a Select Committee and discuss these matters. That Select Committee could consist of Members from all the communities, from the Government and the Opposition. Matters can be taken up at a higher forum if you want. But, as far as democracy is concerned and our Constitution is concerned, there is no higher forum. This is the highest forum. We are legislators. We are supreme. We have the supreme authority. Now even in the supreme authority, if we confine ourselves to making confrontations, allegations and counter allegations, then obviously there will not be a solution. Everyday, we come and talk. At the expenses of the general public we make allegations and counter allegations. Is that enough? My humble opinion is, that is not enough. At the same time, I am of the firm view that this Parliament can do much more if we have a will. We are all brothers and sisters. It is your right for you to talk in Tamil. It is my right to speak in my mother tongue, Sinhalese. I am not speaking in Tamil not because I hate it but because I am not competent enough to speak. I do not have that knowledge. Otherwise, I love your language. I think if we change this attitude among ourselves we can set an example to the country. Now, the people of the country are waiting to see the positive steps that we take in this House. On the one hand, we come to this House and start making all these allegations over the killings but finally we do not achieve anything and the people also do not achieve anything. The people have their highest expectations that this is the place it should be sorted out. On the other hand, we come here and air the grievances of only our community. My opinion is that we must go above that level. When we speak we should not confine ourselves only to the grievances of one community. We must speak of the grievances of all the communities. We must be united. Before you ask the people of this country to be united we must show in this House that we are united. "United" in the sense not to suppress the views of one community but to respect the views of other communities as well. There may be differences. That is democracy. If there are no differences in the ideas and the conduct, we do not need to have democracy. How pathetically things have been done in the name of democracy in this country during the last couple of decades! Democracy has been used not to unite the people but to divide the people of this country. That is the worst experience that we have gone through during the last couple of decades. There has to be a point where we have to stop this. Therefore, I wish to say that the Hon. Raviraj maintained the dignity and sanctity of this House, dedicated his life for the cause of the people. He was not an extremist. He was not a communalist. Finally, he sacrificed his life for the people. Now my question is, how long are we going to continue on this basis? Are we waiting for another similar type of unfortunate incident to happen or are we trying to find a solution to prevent these kinds of incidents happening in the future, keeping the danger in mind?

Therefore, I make use of this occasion to honour the Hon. Raviraj who sacrificed his life. As a mark of respect for him, there has to be unity in this House to find a solution to this problem and it has to be a common effort by the Members representing all the communities in this House. Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) But the problem is, one of those who got 15 years imprisonment -

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) That is another story. I will come to that. 15 . . , . . - ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Can I see that document? ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Which one?

Keheliya Rambukwella) I will have to fish it out because all the documents are together. That I can give you. If you want the entire set of -

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) You said that there was an appeal and at the appeal the fifteen-year sentence was enhanced to a death sentence. Can I see that document? ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) I can send it to you but the only problem is these are documents -[Interruption]. Then you should have asked that from the Foreign Ministry, not from me. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) The information I have is quite different. According to the information I have, the person who was sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment was beheaded by mistake. If the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella says there was an appeal and at the appeal the fifteen-year sentence was enhanced to a death sentence and if he agrees to produce that document at the next Session of Parliament, I will accept. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) I would also like to know the source of your information. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) No. No.-[Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) I also have the same right that you enjoy. You have no special privilege in this House. If you have the right to ask for the document that I have, I also have the right to ask for your document. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) You are misleading Parliament. You said you have a document. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) I am not misleading Parliament. I am agreeable to give the document to you, but I am also making use of the same privilege that you enjoy by asking for a document. Am I not entitled to it? -[Interruption]. You said that you have a different source of information and I would like to have that as well. I will also give you all the information that I have, the entire set of documents.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) I do not want the entire set. I want only the appeal. , - 15 - , 15 , . . ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) I will produce all the documents related to that. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) I want only that. I do not want the entire set.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) , , .

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) But you cannot mislead Parliament. He said- ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . -

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) You have already misled Parliament by saying that no attempts have been made. In fact, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe as the Leader of the Opposition has written in this regard. You are misleading Parliament. -[Interruption]. No. You said so. You said no attempts have been made. -[Interruption] No. I am not giving way. I am on my feet. That is more than enough. You could have said all that when you were speaking. You said that no attempts had been made. You forget what you said within five minutes. I am very sorry.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) , . ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) [ ] . . I think, you must review this matter, go to the courts once again.

The Embassy Officer visited the jail and when asked what assistance they wanted, they have said that - that is what is recorded - We do not need any assistance at the moment. If we need, we will ask. This is the information. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , - [ ] , , . . , . . ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) , . He has come with a predetermined thinking. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) No, no. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Certainly, a predetermined submission. Unfortu- nately, he is not prepared at least to listen. I thank the Hon. Vijitha Herath, at least he is prepared to listen and then reply. The Hon. Kiriella is not even prepared to listen. , -

( ) (The Hon. Vijitha Herath) , . . . . . ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) . , . . , . . - - "series of armed gang robberies' . "" , . - I will table this in the House because it is a bundle of papers. That is why I am saying that it is not proper to say that we have not made any attempts. May be, the attempts that were made were not adequate. That may be so. But they have made a number of attempts and a number of appeals. They have

1665 1666

[ ]

personally sought appointments with the King of Saudi Arabia. All those are documented. All those things are available. At the next Session I will table the entire file on this matter so that you will have a clearer picture. I think, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella will be able to clear his doubts. [Interruption.] That is what I say. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . ? ? Who were the lawyers who appeared? ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) I am so sorry. You forget what you have said just five minutes ago. You told me to table it at the next Session. Now you are asking me to do it now. You are saying that I am not giving the documents. Unfortunately, you forget what you have said five minutes ago. It is on record. Mr. Deputy Speaker, he said, submit it. And I agreed. Now he is saying, he is misleading.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) I asked you to table the relevant documents.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) You asked me to submit them at the next Session and I agreed to it. What is this? Now you are saying, give it to me now" and "misleading.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Members, if you address the Chair, these problems will not come up. These problems come up because you are not addressing the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Thank you for your advice. He is popping up from time to time and he is not allowing me to speak. He had time to make his comments. I do not want to take much time on this because this is not a very pleasant debate to start with. , , , , , ,

Sometimes what you pay for your experience may be fairly high. So I think, it is time that we have a Select Committee or a Consultative Committee appointed where we can take up all these matters. I am only trying to present one matter. As far as I am concerned, this is the most unpleasant Debate that I am participating in this House because we are conscious of these four Sri Lankans who have been beheaded. We have neither seen nor heard this kind of thing except in the pre-Independence era. Under the rule of kings we may have heard of this type of thing. But

1667 1668

under civilized systems, under our culture I feel it is quite unpleasant and unacceptable. But we have to remember one thing. That is, there are certain laws that are applicable and carried out under the legal system prevailing in the respective countries. This is why I say that. In fact, there are nationals of the European Union in the Welikada Prison today. There are German and French nationals. You know, four or five of them are waiting on the death row. There are certain measures that we can take like entering into some bilateral agreement in the future to exchange the prisoners where the system exists. But, of course, you will have to carry out the sentence that is given there and complete the balance sentence if they are brought back half-way into their respective countries. So there are so many other ways of looking at this and to control these affairs. On the other hand I think the Bureau - , , . . , , , , . .
