( -

) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila - Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member for giving me this opportunity to speak a few words when we are discussing a Debate that has taken place in the House of Commons. I think we must first put in proper perspective the way the Debate took place on the 2nd of May in the House of Commons. This Adjournment Debate took place in the same way that we are today discussing a Debate of the

2975 2976

House of Commons. Sometime back we discussed the happenings in Iraq, in Afghanistan and in various other countries. None of these Adjournment Debates are binding, nor do they generally show the stand of the Government of the United Kingdom. An important point that we must remember about the recent Debate is that the totality of that Debate does not reflect the views of the British Government. We have considerable engagements with the United Kingdom in many spheres, including matters concerning many dimensions of our own unfortunate conflict. It must not be forgotten that following India and the US, Britain was one of the first countries to ban the terrorist organization, the LTTE, even before the EU and Canada did so last year. With respect to the British Government, we are also not dealing with a Government that is not familiar with terrorists or with terrorism. They have had this same problem. They have faced terrorism especially within their own borders in Northern Ireland. It is in this context that I wish to state quite categorically at the outset of this Debate, that we are not averse to hearing any well-meaning suggestions that emanate from the British Parliament or any other parliament around the globe. We have studied the comments made by some Hon. Members in the British Parliament and acknowledge that there are some valuable suggestions. We will definitely take those into consideration. At the same time, one must not forget that many Members who contributed to the Debate have formed themselves into an organization called the All Party Parliamentary Group for Tamils. I do not know, when they talk about Tamils, whether they talk only about the Sri Lankan Tamils, the Tamils in Tamil Nadu or the Tamils in Malaysia. Tamils are spread all over the world. But you can understand that there seems to be some hidden motive behind the formation of this group. If I may digress for a moment, what is this group? This group is something like the friendship associations that we have. We have parliamentary friendship groups of various countries within our own Parliament. So this is not a matter which we should be very much concerned about. But however, a few MPs have decided to form this group, already polarizing the little divided Sri Lankan diaspora in the UK. We have had an All Party Parliamentary Group on Sri Lanka. They have been doing very constructive work. As far as Sri Lanka is concerned, they have strengthened relations between the Sri Lankan Parliamentarians and the British Parliamentarians. We have had so many visits from here to there and there to here. This is the type of Parliamentary group that has been in existence and now I do not understand the need for forming a group for a particular community in a country. I think many of us have read the speeches that were made there. Most of them said that they were

representing the views of their constituents. Now one must look at whether we as elected representatives are bound only by the wishes of our own constituents or should we think of the ground realities of the subject on which we are speaking. This seems to have not attracted the attention of the speakers who spoke during that Debate. Another coincidence was, may be it was a coincidence - I personally would not believe so, but grant them the right that it was a coincidence - that this Debate was arranged just one day prior to the Local Government Elections all over England, other than the Greater London area. Of course what happened was, the Labour Party lost that also. That shows that even this - what we would call in our language, the Election Gunduwa- also did not work. They were trying to target the votes of the Tamil population in those areas but even that did not work. However, what is more important is to make an assessment of the objectives of the promoters of this Debate. The main demand of the speakers in favour of the LTTE was that the current proscription of the LTTE as a terrorist organization should be lifted. But what is the stand of the British Government on this issue? What did Dr. Kim Howells, the Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office say during the Debate? Sir, I will quote him. We have repeatedly urged the LTTE to move away from the path of violence. In the absence of a full renunciation of terrorism in deed and word, there can be no question of reconsidering their proscribed status. That is the stand of the British Government as said by Dr. Kim Howells, their own Minister. It is statements of this nature by Ministers of the British Government that has to be taken note of and not statements from Members who are just trying to add a few more votes to their vote banks. This so-called APPG-T also claims that they intend to organize a summit between the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE, to which they propose to invite the Norwegians to come and participate. Of course I would not talk about the Norwegians; they can take a decision on their own. But I can assure you that the Government of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa does not answer to summons of this nature from anybody. As for the LTTE, as my Minister stated to the media yesterday, before Thamilselvan goes to the UK, first he will have to come to Kollupitiya to get the visa from the British High Commission and we do not think that the British High Commission is going to issue visa to a terrorist whose organization has been proscribed by its own Government. The APPG-T also claims that they are planning to visit Sri Lanka in September with the purpose of travelling especially to the North and the LTTE dominated areas. Sir, we need to educate those Hon. Members of the British Government that Sri Lanka is a sovereign country and not a colony, and their capacity to

2977 2978

[ ]

2007 08

visit Sri Lanka is only as tourists and we will welcome them as tourists. Tourists can come; but for any other purposes they necessarily must get the permission of the Sri Lankan Government. That is one thing that those Members have to keep in mind. Let me also hope that these Members of this so called APPG-T group reach beyond their so-called constituents and seek to understand the facts about Sri Lanka from the entirety of the Sri Lankan diaspora living in the UK and not merely the supporters of the terrorist organization, the LTTE. There are moderate Tamils; there are Sinhalese; there are Muslims who are living in the UK and their ideas also should be taken into account before going into various matters related to the Sri Lankan ethnic conflict. Let me assure the Hon. Members of this House that our Government is very clear about one matter; that we will not allow anybody on any occasion to infringe upon the sovereignty of Sri Lanka.

Thank you very much, Mr. Presiding Member.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Thank you. The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake. 45 .

[.. 11.49]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member. I rise in this House at a time when this country is in absolute disaster; whether it is the economy, whether it is the peace process, whether it is the militaristic situation or whether it is the general living standards in this country; everything is in a state of utter chaos. Amidst this, today we are discussing a Debate which has taken place in the British Parliament. We, the United National Party have always been very categorical, very clear that we will not permit any country to interfere, meddle or to influence in the internal affairs of our country. But, Sir, it is also absolutely essential to say that we are a party that recognizes that Sri Lanka is in the world and not that the world is inside Sri Lanka. Developing a friendly atmosphere is the hallmark of the United National Party policy which we have pursued. So, we look upon those friendly countries that try to assist us in our hour of need. The Government has called upon the Prime Minister of Britain, Mr. Tony Blair and the President of this country went and invited the British Government to assist us. But, that does not perceive there should be any interference and that has been very categorical in the speeches made by all Members who have spoken in that House. All we

have to do is, we require friendly persuasion, maintenance of friendly, neighbourly relationships and take the world community into our confidence. The United National Party, during our tenure of office, was able to bring this horrific war to an end. The Ceasefire Agreement however much is put to debate, is being protected by the Peoples Alliance Government, by the JVP, by the Hela Urumaya and by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party because they see the fruition, the benefit that accrues owing to the fact that we have an international agreement that we are working upon. Mr. Presiding Member, I think it is absolutely essential in an era when geography is history, borders are borderless and this is the time that Sri Lanka must look upon the world community and say what a plight we are in. So, trying to pick problems that are being created by friendly people will only isolate us further and help the terrorists to achieve the goals they are trying to achieve. Is that not what they are trying to do? They are trying to corner us into particular positions, getting us alienated from the world and trying to make this country a Zimbabwe of Asia. That is the hallmark that is seen and that is why we say that this must be very dexterously, very carefully and very intelligently handled. That was the way our Leader, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, when he was the Prime Minister tried to bring this conflict to an end by a negotiated settlement through the Ceasefire Agreement. We definitely enjoy close relationships and we have been working with the international community especially with India, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, the European Union and Japan. Whether it is China, whether it is Pakistan or whether it is Saudi Arabia, we have an international flavour that we believe in; that the international community together is a necessary recipe to bring a solution to the problems prevailing in our Mother Lanka. Sir, as you know, I said that Sri Lanka is inside the world. . , . As I said before geography is history today and that is the reason why today we are speaking on this important occasion. I do not know the origin as to why there was a necessity in the British Parliament to debate this matter. But there are facts that have led the international community to look into what is happening in Sri Lanka. But before that let me get on to this point. I want to know the proposition that was brought in by the JVP. But where is your leader coming from? Hon. Presiding Member, I am asking you. He is a Britisher with a Sri Lankan passport. Why are they not making a noise? Is this a coup to create a problem for him? ( ) (An hon. Member)

2979 2980

2981 2982

Who is the leader?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Somawansa Amarasinghe. He says so, he claims so. He is a Britisher with a Sri Lankan passport. Has he not got dual citizenship? What is this hypocrisy that is there? When they outlaw them, . When they interfere with the activities when there is a problem - when there are certain things that have got to be followed for the proscription, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera had to agree to certain conditions and when you breach them they have to come and investigate; . One and a half or two years ago, was it not this same Parliament, the same party that gave accolade and said, yes, we appreciate the banning of the Tigers by the European Union? Is not the United Kingdom a part of that? Was that not because of the Ceasefire Agreement that the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the then Prime Minister signed? We had the Co-Chairs, were they not signatories? All of them unanimously said, yes, there is a breach and you need to ensure that there is a proscription imposed. So, Sir, this has to be looked at from different perspectives, different angles and not just with blinked eyes like an ostrich with its head in the sand. We, the United National Party has always been a responsible party. Today, the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, the President of this country is having enormous problems. Our Leader was magnanimous enough to extend a lending hand in November 2006 to come up with an MoU. You said you have problems. You called us for help and we agreed. That is disregarded and then you blame the rest of the world. We are repeating that we do not want any foreign intervention in our country. That is very clear. But at the same time, we are a great believer that we require the international community to come to our assistance in our time of need. They can guide us. They can give their absolute assistance from their practical experiences. Now, I table* the Hansard of the British Parliament containing that particular debate which has seven pages in it. Sir, I want to ensure that this is printed in Hansard instead of just being placed in the library. When the Minister of Middle-East Affairs, Dr. Kim Howells started the Debate, he stated in reply to questions that came up as to why this Debate needs to take place. He said, We have rich experience through the Northern Ireland process. The President of Sri Lanka had come to seek our assistance and we did extend our services. So, on that basis the proscription took place. The Hon. Mangala Samaeraweera had to write and confirm that they will ensure the human rights and media

freedom would be guaranteed. I am sure the Minister of Foreign Affairs who will speak later on obviously will have a headache. He will be able to ensure and give light to this by saying, Yes, there was a commitment. The breach of that has given the opportunity for the international community to peep into Sri Lankan affairs. Who is held responsible for that? The Executive President of this country for the last 14 years has been from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. They are the ones who have let this in. Their incompetency, their inaptness has led to such a situation and then they blame the rest of the world. . - [ ] . , ? . When there is a flood, when there is a shortage of general utilities in Sri Lanka, when the cost of living is zooming, when human rights are being violated, when media personnel are being harassed you put the blame on someone else. The general situation today is not reflected in issues in Colombo. They are reflected in issues overseas. As I said, Dr. Howells of the British Parliament has said, Owing to our experience we are coming forward. It is a friendly persuasion. This is not something dropped from the air. That is the difference here. Who has led this to a situation of foreign intervention? As you know, Sir, we are signatories to international treaties on Human Rights such as International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights monitored by the Human Rights Committee of 1980, then subsequently to the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights administered by the Human Rights Committee on 3rd January, 1998. These are the Covenants that bind Sri Lanka with the international community. There is no way that we can live in isolation. Ours is an island. We have got to ensure that we live with the world community. So with all these international agreements, when in 1983 the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna attacked all the public properties creating mayhem in this country, it was proscribed and with the proscription the then leader of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, Mr. Rohana Wijeweera said that there were incidents of human rights violations taking place and wanted the international community to look at Sri Lanka. Was that not the case? Then, likewise the then Member of the Opposition, the present President, the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, quite rightly may be, in his perception he would have felt that there was a violation of human rights during the period 1988 to 1989 and he tried to take evidence to be produced before international fora, not legally but hidden inside his shoes. At that particular moment did he not bring that matter into international light and say there was a problem in the human rights situation? Today, the Parliamentary Leader of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa mentioned about Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar. An

* . . Produced at end of speech.

2007 08 2983 2984

Adjournment Motion was brought before this House sometime back. At that time Myanmar could have turned around and said, What right have you got to discuss about Myanmar? When the world famous Buddha statues of Bamian in Afghanistan were demolished by some barbarians there, we took that matter up in this House. They too could have turned around and said, What has Sri Lanka got to do with this? It is not so. When there is a problem that concerns the international community, these types of situations do come up. So, instead of trying to create problems, we have got to ensure that we attend to such problems in a friendly manner. You can catch more bees with honey than with vinegar, Sir. That is what we, the United National Party are saying. Going on further, I would also like to mention what the Deputy Solicitor General, Mr. Palitha Fernando said at a passing-out ceremony at the Police Academy just a couple of days ago. To save time I table* Annex 5. I will only read the important sections pertaining to this situation. It states, I quote:

" . . , . . ; . ' ?' . , . . , , ."

Deputy Solicitor-General . . This is the entry. This is the reason why we, in the United National Party have been very vocal with regard to the human rights situation of the country today when day by day people are being abducted in white vans. The judicial system is kept aside. The media freedom is stifled to such an extent that they report only what the Government wants. This is the reason why we have been trying to bring this matter to the notice of the international community. The previous Speaker who spoke from the party that proposed this Motion blackguarded the United States of America. He said that the Government was tempted to sign an agreement. Why did they permit them to carry on with it? They are a part of the Government. They run with the hare and hunt with

the hounds. When they have to go to IPU conferences they go with the Government delegation and when they come back they sit with the Opposition and take the time allocated to the Opposition to speak against the Government. What is this hypocrisy that is going on? That is why I say, " " . . . "" . . . Again he basically brought the United Kingdom into action. He said that they were helping the Tigers. Then why did His Excellency the President visit Tony Blair when he was enjoying his holidays and say, Please help us? Nobody said it. It was not the United National Party, it was not the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe who said it. Because the Ceasefire Agreement was in serious jeopardy he was forced into reality and decided that getting assistance was a better medication rather than taking them to task. Now when they come, they say that they are interfering. In the same way he had a swiping touch on Norway. You came into power saying that you would chase Norway out. Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, why are you still keeping Norway? If it is bad, if it is inimical and if the United National Party or the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe has done something wrong, why on earth - you have been three years and four months in Government and one and a half years in Executive Presidency - do you keep Norway?

( ) (The Hon. Ravindra Samaraweera) Norway was brought by them.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes. As my good Friend, the Hon. Ravindra Samaraweera says, who brought Norway in? It was ex-President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. At that time we were in Government and because it was brought by the then Opposition or the then President we did not want to go against it. We thought that there was a necessity and that there was a certain good aspect in it. So we took the good points of it and today even after five years and two months it is still going on. The Foreign Minister is running around the world saying, "Yes, we are there to comply with International Covenants; we are there to internationalize international agreements that we have signed". The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella yesterday in the morning said that there is a necessity for the Ceasefire Agreement. , , ; . . ? "

" . . . . , , " ?" . . , , . . , . . " ?" . I am asking you the same thing. He took a swipe at India. India is our friend, we have to utilize them. Then he was talking of the British Company, Booker coming and taking land. Why on earth are you giving, you are in Government? So please ensure that you have a consistent policy. I am sure the Government has that - the Opposition definitely has that - but it is the appendages of the Government that do not have this and they are the ones who are creating misery in this country. His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa was extended a hand of friendship by the Leader of the Opposition, our Leader of the United National Party. He took it and bit it. Today he finds the sadness of biting it. The momentary thrill of biting has been forgotten and the hunger is growing now. Why on earth did he do it? What has been done is done. Still we are in the international community respecting the sovereignty, the national integrity and the Sri Lankans right to determine their own future. We only go there and tell what is expected. There was a huge debate by the Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, the Minister of Mass Media and Information trying to entangle the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe when he was overseas on what he told the international community. I table* Annex 2. I want it printed in full in Hansard because the general public do not understand what has been told in that. What has been done is a summarization, a collation of twelve letters that have been tabled by the Members of this House, the former Ministers of this House, by the media and by the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe as the Leader of the Opposition on certain matters that have got to be done. I will mention the contents of this Annex. No. 1 - The Memorandum of Understanding between the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the United National Party on the 23rd of October, 2006. Is there anything

wrong in that? No. 2 - The Statement by the Co-Chairs in November 2006 welcoming the MoU. No. 3 - The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghes letter to the President on 27th December 2006 with proposed amendments to the Emergency Regulations and the PTA, Prevention of Terrorism Act. No. 4 - The Statements in Parliament on 6th February about the abrogation of the MoU by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Ranil Wickremasinghe. No. 5 - The news reports in The Sunday Leader of 8th April, 2007 on the Statement made by the Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi on the deal with the LTTE. What is wrong? It was mentioned by the Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi, an Hon. Member of this House. Of course the Government for saying so has been trying to crucify him but we appreciate the audacity, the sagacity and the honesty because he came out and told the world that this is the actual situation. No. 6 - Complaint to the Chairman of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption by the former Ministers regarding the purchase of MiG 27 dated 14th March 2007. Who are the Ministers? The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera and the Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi. Did we take them? Did we accompany them? Did we engage them to go and do this? No! They have a feeling for the country. The actual situation is being told by them. So, when the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe as the Leader of the Opposition conveys information which is inimical to the Government, is this something to run down the country? No. 8 - The Statement in Parliament on the 3rd of April, 2007 by the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe regarding the attack on the Katunayake Air Force Base . That is the factual situation which was collated and told in Parliament which was communicated. No. 9 - The Statement on the Breach of Privilege of Parliament on the 20th March, 2007 by the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe. This is what happened to one of the Members, the Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi when he brought in certain matters that needed to be debated, which is yet to be debated. The Speaker of this House has still to give a ruling on that. No. 10 - The list of 81 names of Tamil persons who disappeared. It is a document by the Civil Monitoring Commission that has been made public and given to the international community. Nobody has disputed it. No. 11 - The letter to the International Press Institute dated 24th April, 2007 by the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe on the continuing deterioration of media freedom in Sri Lanka . This was a request that was made by the media.

The media said, We are sorry. We are being stymied. We are being harassed. We cannot publish what we want to publish. So they called the international community. This is the entry of the international community to Sri Lankan activities. . . ( ) ( .. - ) (The Hon. H.R. Mithrapala - Minister of Consumer Affairs) Why do you not add the killing of the Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs?

( ) (An hon. Member) Who killed him?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, if you read this you will understand it. That is also in this. You are like the jack-in-the-box and do not know what you are talking about. You do not know what the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe spoke. You only want to show the world that what he said is wrong. This is the truth. Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamar is in it. So, please accept that the United National Party is a responsible Opposition. We also can hold placards and play merry hell near the Lipton Circus. But we have made life much more simpler and the people are asking us as to why the hell we have been like that. That is the difference. You all are the ones who are creating murderers. How many innocent people have been killed? , 4800 ? ? . . We are only doing what we have to do internationally. Then No. 12 is the Human Rights Watch Asia Director's letter to the Members of the Human Rights Council. Now, Sir, our Leader starts off by saying, The Presidential Election 2005 was a turning point in Sri Lankan politics. The LTTE had rejected the best chance for peace by preventing the Tamil voters from exercising their franchise to conclude the peace process which was going on with the United National Party and the Government at that particular moment. Sir, he starts daring them. You know, the LTTE did not give one vote to the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe. There were many accusations. - . . , . . ,

, , . , , . So, I as the Secretary handling International Affairs of our party with our Leader, have been trying to do the best of a worse situation that is there. The brief is very bad. Imagine if we took information the way that was done during our time by the then Opposition Members when the Government was in Opposition, where would this Government be? People are asking us as to why we are not doing anything and the time has come to think and answer that by saying, Yes, we have been too soft on these types of issues. So going on further, the situation that leads to such international entries is the killing of the Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham, a Member of this House on the 25th of December, 2005. No answer. The Hon. Raviraj, a good Friend of ours and loved by everybody in this House was killed in the highest security zone in this country. Nobody knows. The Government's offer of Rupees five million to such a valuable person is a further insult. Is this the type of thing that the Government does to such barbaric acts that are committed within the high security zone. Not a person has been caught. The Civil Monitoring - [Interruption.] My good Friend, the Hon. John Amaratunga says that within 24 hours Scotland Yard was called upon. Now, it is almost 6 months. We do not know whether Scotland Yard has come on a holiday and gone or whether they have ever been called to this country. That is swept under the carpet. When there is a issue in Colombo they call Scotland Yard. Now, Scotland Yard is not in North Korea, not in Cuba, not in Zimbabwe. They come from Britain. . . . . . . , " " . ? . [ ] . . . "" , "" . . ? , ? The Government appointed the Civil Monitoring Committee and people started reporting to it about missing people. Likewise is the Committee of Eminent Persons. Who invited them? Mr. Mahinda Samarasinghe called them and said "Please, come to our country". Because obviously they were fighting a situation that was very difficult for them to grapple with in Colombo. When they could not handle the local situation, they called the Committee of Eminent Persons to come in. When they came in, the courts say, "You cannot refer to

[ ]

2989 2990

that information. This information is still in the judicial process". Then what happens? As I said before, the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, quite rightly as the President has the right to go and ask anybody, any help. He goes to UK. When? During holidays when Tony Blair was on his Christmas vacation. . ! . . , " ! " . . ? Then in the same way, the Mahinda-Ranil MoU is another clear example. Then, the COPE. We struggled and put forward a report saying that this is the corruption that is going on. We had to tell those lending institutions in the world that there is corruption in this country. When that is brought up it is tainted as if it is shown in a different way. Then, today the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Louise Arbour is supposed to come to this country. Now, the Government is telling Mrs. Louise, "Do not come into the country. We will meet you in Geneva". What is this hypocrisy? What have we got to hide, Hon. Foreign Minister? You have a difficult task in selling Sri Lanka in its present situation when every single thing is being violated. [Interruption.] I know you have to sing hosannas for your dinner. But, I am sure you will not tell that to your British High Commissioner when you meet. I am sure you did not tell Dr. (Ms.) Condoleezza Rice when you met her in United States. You said, "Yes, we will do everything that could be done". Two days after you met them, why did we lose out of the Millennium Challenge Account. [Interruption.] I know that. . . . ? . , . . . , " " . . . . , . , , . . Likewise Mangala Samaraweera's report as the Foreign Minister, just before he was sacked as the Foreign Minister, stated that there was interference that was going on. That was the reason why the international community was asking why he was sacked. Before that he very categorically told these are the reasons as to why

he was sacked.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) With the permission of the Chair, Hon. Member, Hon. Mangala Samaraweera was never sacked as the Foreign Minister of this country.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Then?

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) There was a Cabinet reshuffle.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You took over without him being sacked.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) In fairness to an Hon. Member of this House, we must be truthful in terms of what has to be said. I think my good Friend will take note of that.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) My good Friend and your good Friend and today our good Friends, all Friends know that he was summarily dismissed and he was sacked. Why? Because he told the truth and now you have got that bad brief to be carried on. You do not sing hosannas for your dinner. You can well afford to do without that. Now going on that basis, what about the situation where the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera went before the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption with regard to the purchase of MiG 27? Are you going to say that that was the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghes job? This is hell of a situation!

( ) (An hon. Member) Give an answer for that.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is the situation. [Interruption.] Yes, I want an answer. You cannot give an answer. You will only give a skipping answer because you have got to save the day

2007 08 2991 2992

for yourself. Then the other matter is interfering with the media. Champika Liyanaarachchi of the "Daily Mirror", a good friend of all of us was harassed for no apparent reason. When the innocent His Excellency the British High Commission goes and meets her, that is being construed in a bad way. When they meet to discuss foreign loans to be paid in local rupees, that is okay. , loan . ! , Dushantha Basnayaka is still in custody. MTV is being harassed day in and day out. The "Minnal" programme is in jeopardy. The frequencies that the MTV wanted to go islandwide is being halted. Why ? Just because they say, We report you decide. It is not decided for them. It is not good enough for them. They want to say "You report what we say". That is the difference. Then "The Sunday Leader" when it stated that there were bunkers being made - a factual statement and with Government money - they tried to arrest the Editor. Then in the same way with "Swarnawahini" - there is no . This is the reason why we signed the International Covenants in order to respect the international community and when there is a breach of that, there is a problem. As I said when they ban, proscribe the LTTE they say hurray. When we have an aberration of that and when there is a check from the international community, . On the same score we are leading this country astray. I have been repeatedly saying that the major part of the problem in this country has been created by nobody else, but the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. In 1956, when the Members in this august Assembly said, Do not do what you are trying to do because you will only create a problem, it was Dr. Colvin R. de Silva who said that if you have one language you will have two countries and if you have two languages, you will have one country. That advice was set aside and the first bomb exploded. Then in 1972, the right of the minorities that were enshrined through Chapter 29 of the Soulbury Commission was taken off and at that moment, the minority requested not to do this as this is something that enabled them to fly the Sri Lankan Flag. That was taken and thrown aside. Then in 1974 came the standardization issue. The minorities cherished, they fortified and strengthened their love towards the education. That was ripped apart. When all of them were put together in 1974, the minority thought that enough is enough and they exploded. From 1976, this curse has been going on. Please, we call upon the Sri Lanka Freedom Party led heterogeneous Government - the oxygen provided by the JVP and the Jathika Hela Urumaya - not to create further problems that this country will not be able to solve. You have a Muslim problem. You have a Sri Lankan problem that is genuine. Youths today are helplessly left alone. The economy is in dire straits We are having 20 per cent inflation. Provide answers to that. That is how things

are going on. Then, Sir, all we can basically do is to look at the other things that come about. Today, I quote below with responsibility because I never imagined that the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, the Chief Government Whip, would say certain things that are inimical and also which will become pugnacious in retrospect. The Minister accused the Tigers for attacking in the night. 'They come stealthily at night. We hit them in daylight. They have to fight face to fact without hiding in the dark I table* a copy of the Local Link of the BBC Sinhala. com script dated 25th April, 2007. What stupidity is this? Is this type of Cabinet Minister helping the Government? He may be saying this in his official capacity. These are the things that make the foreign community intercept into Sri Lankan affairs. Today we don't have interceptors to intercept the LTTE.

. Sir, we call upon the Chief Government Whip to explain as to why he is doing these type of things. This country is not his personal dowry. This country is Sri Lanka. We have got to ensure that we protect this country. Every step that has been taken by the United National Party is to foster and bring a democratic solution, a peaceful negotiated settlement to this country. We dare tell the Government to tear the CFA. If it is so bad why is it not torn? The other day the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa asked a question as to why it is not torn. For one month there is no answer. He does not press for an answer. Because, for dinner he is with the JVP and for lunch he is with the Chintanaya. That is the difference. The JVP has a lot of lovely people. But these type of hypocrites are only creating difficulty to run this Government. And I say with all honesty, please let us stop this politicization.

: "President seeks India's support. Weeratunga carries message to Manmohan Singh." This is what we have been saying. Our Leader, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe has always been advocating that the closest of our friends is India. Antagonizing them is not the answer. We brought about a close affinity and fostered close unity with them.

( ) (The Presiding Member) .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . When the President seeks Indian support, what has he got? The Indians have sent a PR firm to go and meet the Defence Secretary. We have been doing that free of charge. The last time the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe and I, as the Secretary, International Affairs went to India along with the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella and the Hon. Sajith Premadasa, we were able to meet everybody, Mr. Advani, all the Opposition Members and Government Members, Mrs. Sonia Gandhi, the Finance Minister and all of them, without any problem at all. So, is this a requirement, that the President should seek Indian support through a PR firm? Come on, this situation has to change. If we go on like this little Mother Lanka will be crying saying, Do not cry for me Sri Lanka. So, we have got to change this particular situation. That is the reason why we call upon the Government to take necessary steps. With the peace process they have been trying to come up with a certain answer. What is the proposal they have put forward?

I am Pleased to have this opportunity today to debate the current situation in Sri Lanka, and I am greatful to the right hon. and hon. Members present for their interest in this important issue. There has been mounting concern about the continuing violence and tragic displacement of people from their homes on that beautiful island. I want the House to know that this debate is the result of expressions of concern from right hon. and hon. Members. It is not, as some propagandists and partisan elements have claimed, a debate generated by any faction of Sri Lankan politics or by any lobbying organizations claiming to represent any part of the large Sri Lankan diaspora residing in Britain, pro or anti - LTTE. I participated in a debate on Sri Lanka a year ago, when I expressed the hope that it is Government and the LTTE - the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam - would fulfil the Commitments that they made at talks in Geneva in February 2006, Which were the first talks for three years. The Government had pledged that no armed group or person other than Government Security forces would carry arms or conduct operations. For its part, the LTTE had pledged to ensure that there would be no acts

[ ]

2007 08 3003 3004

of violence against the security forces and the police. Sadly, those commitments remain unfulfilled. We have over the past year seen worsening violence. Extra - judicial killings, disappearances, intimidation and violence by paramilitary groups are all too common. The violence has fuelled an atmosphere of extreme mistrust and polarisation, which has fuelled further antagonism and violence. Innocent civilians have borne the brunt. There are now more than 100,000 displaced persons in the eastern district of Batticaloa and hundreds more arrive every day. There have been more than 700 cases of missing persons in the Jaffna peninsular, and nearly 500 are still unresolved. There have been more than 50 abductions in Colombo in the past year, and nine media workers have lost their lives in recent months. In the past few weeks, bus bombings have killed dozens of people simply going about their daily business. These are despicable terrorist acts that are totally without justification. The responsibility of the LTTE for violent acts over the years is well documented. It is a proscribed organization under the Terrorism Act 2000. The EU listed the LTTE as a terrorist organization in May 2006. We have repeatedly urged the LTTE to move away from the path of violence. In the absence of a full renunciation of terrorism in deed and word, there can be no question of reconsidering its proscribed status. LTTE involvement in killings, torture, detention of civilians and denial of freedom of speech is a reality. The LTTE does not tolerate any expression of opposition and its continuing recruitment of child soldiers is matter of great concern. The ability of the LTTE to raise funds overseas helps to sustain its ability to carry out violent acts and reduces the incentive to move way from the path of 2 May 2007 : Column 1552 Violence. LTTE fundraising activity in the United Kingdom encourages war, not peace. It will not be tolerated, and I have recently met our security authorities to discuss how we can counter the bullying, threats and acts of fraud that are used regularly to extract money from the Tamil population and others in the country. The LTTE is not the only source of violence in Sri Lanka. However. Civilians in Government controlled areas regularly fall victim to brutal attacks by paramilitary groups, often acting with apparent immunity. Reports of the Governments links with the faction led by karuna, a former LTTE commander, concern us a great deal. We believe karuna and his faction to be responsible for extra - judicial killings, abductions, intimidation of displaced persons and child recruitment. Karunas record is appalling, and we will be watching very closely whether he acts on his commitment to the United Nations to address the child recruitment issue. We will want to see clear evidence that he has delivered against his welcome promises. Karuna needs to go further and cease all acts of violence and intimidation against civilians. There must be no question of the Government of Sri Lanka allowing Karuna to perpetrate those crimes. If they are serious in their desire to find paths to an inclusive peaceful Sri Lanka that embraces all its peoples and cultures, they must disassociate themselves completely from all acts of abuse, terrorism, intimidation or torture, no matter who commits them or what agency encourages them. Mr. Geoffrey Clifton - Brown (Cotswold) (Con) : Is the Minister aware of the comment made by the FBI assistant director in charge, who said Karuna hasnt merely supported the LTTE cause, he has orchestrated support in the US? Before the Minister concludes his speech, will he answer two questions? First, what international co - ordination is there on intelligence to stop fundraising for the LTTE? Secondly, is there similar Co - ordination to ensure that people such as Karuna, who have committed acts of terrorism, are brought to justice? Dr. Howells : The hon. Gentleman is right : the list of crimes by this faction is long. We have been exchanging intelligence with a number of agencies in other countries. He will know that I cannot go into detail about that matter, although I can say that lately intelligence has indicated that there may be widespread fraud scams in the country. We are not certain about that, but they may be one of the sources of funding, at least

part of which finds its way back to the LTTE and acts of terrorism. Achieving peace is not going to be an easy task, and of course it is primarily for the Sri Lankan people to find a way forward. However, the international community can help. The Norwegians have had a central role in facilitating the 2002 ceasefire agreement, and the British Government applaud their efforts. It is obvious from recent events that the ceasefire is in trouble, if not shot to pieces. If it is adhered to and underpinned by the right conditions, however, it can still be a good base from which to launch a new peace initiative. The Norwegains have worked tirelessly and 2 May 2007 : Column 1553 In diffucult conditions to advance the cause of peace. As I said, they have our support. We value our regular consultations with them. The Norwegians tell us our commitment is valuable at this time. We support the work of the co - chairs - the US, the EU, Japan and Norway. Mr. Chris Mullin (Sunderland, South) (Lab) : Would I be right in thinking that the Norwegian general who was based in Sri Lanka advised the EU against declaring the LTTE a terrorist organization and said that that would lead to the breakdown of the ceasefire? Dr. Howells: I cannot tell my hon. Friend whether that is true. I do not know; this is the first that I have heard of it, if it is the case. I will try to find out for him, and if I can find anything constructive, I shall write to him. What is Britain doing to help with the search for peace ? First and foremost, we are offering the benefit of our Northern Ireland experience. Sri Lanka is not Northern Ireland. It has a population of 20 million, which is more than 10 times that of Northern Ireland, and it is five times larger in area, but we think there are lessons from Northern Ireland can be applied in a Sri Lankan context. Fore example, we learned the hard way that a focus on security can get us only so far. A lasting peace can come only if the underlying causes of conflict are addressed. In Sri Lanka, that means focusing on a credible framework for a negotiated settlement. An all-party conference will shortly present its findings on a constitutional way forward. I look forward to the publication of proposals for a framework for peace that satisfies the legitimate aspirations of all Sri Lankans, and to a constructive response to such proposals from the Sri Lankan Government. Our Northern Ireland experience told us that peace will not happen until the parties to the conflict understand that nothing can be gained by continuing violence. A military victory for one side is very unlikely to produce a lasting political solution. Our experience tells us that an emphasis on the military inevitably means more war, rather than peace. A military victory is rarely winnable in the long run. Violence comes with too high a price. In Sri Lanka, we can see that such an approach brings suffering to the people, as human rights are eroded, the humanitarian situation deteriorates, a culture of impunity develops among the killers, extortionists and torturers, and mistrust between communities increases. That, in turn, damages Sri Lankas image in the eyes of the world. We are doing all we can to get that message across. Mr. Andrew Love (Edmonton) (Lab/Co-op): I thank my hon. Friend for giving way, and I apologise for arriving too late to hear the start of his speech. Unfortunately, the previous business ended rather suddenly and the debate began before I could get here. My hon. Friend mentioned human rights. There is considerable concern in Sri Lanka and internationally about the human rights situation at the present time. Several international organizations have suggested that the only real solution is to set up a UN- sponsored human rights monitoring commission. How would the Government view such a body ? 2 May 2007 : Column 1554 Dr. Howells : That suggestion is well worth considering. I will come to the question of a monitoring organization in a minute. Of course, we already have one, and perhaps the best thing is to make that work rather than search for another one. However, it is certainly something that we could discuss. High-Level engagement is an essential part of our efforts to help with the search for peace in Sri Lanka. Last August, my right hon. Friend

3005 3006

the Prime Minister offered to share our experience of Northern Ireland with the Sri Lankan President, and he retains a close interest in events in Sri Lanka. I was particularly grateful that my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) visited Sri Lanka in November to convey his invaluable experience as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Accompanied by another expert in these matters from the Northern Ireland Office, Mr. Chris McCabe, he met the President, Ministers and members of civil society. He also met representatives of the LTTE, the lessons of peace can only work if conveyed to all parties to the conflict. We remain ready to talk to the LTTE if such contacts can help the cause of peace. The response in Sri Lanka to my right hon. Friends visit was very positive. I know that the President shares my wish that he and Mr.McCabe will pay a return visit to the island, and I understand that preparations are already under way for that. I was pleased to visit Sri Lanka for a second time in February this year. In my meetings with the President, the Foreign Minister and the Defence Secretary, I underlined the British Governments wish to help in the search for peace. I stressed that a military solution was not the way forward - a message that I repeated to an MP from the Tamil National Alliance. The President told me that he thought that our contact with the LTTE would be helpful. I visited Ampara in the east of the island and was pleased to meet representatives of local communities - not only Sinhalese and Tamil but Muslims. It will be important to take into account the views of the Muslim community in any final negotiated settlement. I heard from UNICEF about the reality of child abductions and the threats and intimidations suffered by other non-governmental organizations in the east of the island. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary met the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister in London in March. She reiterated Britains commitment to peace and our willingness to get involved in that whole process. She spoke of the terrible humanitarian impact of the conflict on the civilian population and the need for both sides to do more to protect that population. She repeated the message that there can be no military solution to conflict. The Minister assured her that a credible framework for negotiated settlement would issue very soon. Keith Vaz (Leicester, East) (Lab) : I, too, apologise for arriving late, having been caught out by the business moving so swiftly. I thank my hon. Friend for his focus on these issues whenever we have asked to meet to discuss them, he has been ready to do so. One of the bars to a proper solution to this problem is the ban that remains on the LTTE. Has he had any further discussions with the Home Secretary about whether the Government would. 2 May 2007 : Column 1555 be prepared to lift that ban, so ensuring that all parties could be part of a discussion to bring peace to the island ? Dr. Howells : My right hon. Friend, through no fault of his own, missed that part of my speech. If he will forgive me, I will not go back over it but simply say that, for reasons that I tried to explain a little earlier, I have not met my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary to discuss this matter, if I thought that it was a good idea I would certainly do so. As I said, my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen met LTTE representatives in the north of the island, and we are prepared to meet LTTE representatives in Sri Lanka if it is considered that that will help the peace process. I hope that that is clear enough. John McDonnell (Hayes and Harlington) (Lab) : We are all apologizing for lateness, but I was not as late as the others. As we learned from Northern Ireland. Individual issues can build up to create a sense of grievance. That is the case with regard to the proscription and non-recognition of the LTTE. Although there can be informal dialogue, nothing can substitute for more formal dialogue and recognition. Removing the ban would undermine one of the elements of the sense of grievance that contributes towards the conflict. Dr. Howells : I take my hon. Friends point, which is something that we have to consider. However, I have to tell that, of all Members in this House, I am very much averse to recognizing the legitimacy, if I could put it like that, of suicide bombers, murderers, torturers and rapists. I

have been there twice and I have heard these stories myself many times, from NGOs and from Tamils themselves, as well as from Sinhalese and the Sinhalese Government. This has to be considered very carefully. As I tried to explain earlier, there is no silver bullet that is going to Sort everything out. If we thought that that recognition would take matters forward, we would certainly be prepared to consider it very seriously -- I give my hon. Friend that undertaking. Mr. Edward Davey (Kingston and Surbiton) (LD) : I must add my apologies for lateness. The Minister clearly wants to ensure that there is a balanced discussion about this issue, and he is right because it is very serious. However, could not he lay out a review process and explain how the might talk to colleagues in this House and groups in this country, as well as to the people he and his colleagues have met on their visits to Sri Lanka, to determine the the criteria? Some people in communities throughtout this country and around this House feel that a one-sided approach is being taken and that a proper review process might ensure that a truly balanced approach is taken. Dr. Howells : The hon. Gentleman is not to no know this, but we have had quite a number of meetings with Tamil groups from around the country. As well as talking to the Sri Lankan Government, we have met all kinds of representatives. Let me assure him that this is 2 May 2007 : Column 1556 a completely balanced approach. Securing this debate is part of that process, and I hope that he will contribute to it. Our approach seeks not to take sides either with the Sinhalese Government or with the LTTE but to try to use our good offices and our experience in Northern Ireland, among other places, to try to find ways in which it might be possible to help the Norwegians to make the ceasefire work, and then to take that peace process forward, put the issues on the table, and get everyone around the table to try to resolve the issue. Some 60,000 people have died in this war so far, and perhaps 1 million people have been displaced. It is a very serious conflict by any standards in the world, and we are working very hard to try to resolve it, but, believe me, there is no easy way forward on this one -- it will take a long time. This conflict has been going on for a very long time. Before you took your seat in the Chair, Madam Deputy Speaker, Mr. Deputy Speaker was telling me that he remembers is kicking off when he was out there in 1983 --; fact, it was the day after he left, in I do not know whether he was to blame. We complement our high-level engagement with more practical assistance through a joint Department for International Development, Ministry of Defence and Foreign and Commonwealth Office peace-building strategy for Sri Lanka. The focus includes people-to-people contacts between communities, mechanisms to provide early warning of potential for conflict, and development of civil society capacity to monitor conflict. We are involved in all those processes. We believe that quiet activity of that kind has an important role to play in these difficult times. I know that many in the Sri Lankan diaspora have been pleased to see Britains active involvement in Sri Lanka. We believe the Sri Lankan diaspora in Britain to be perhaps as much as 200,000 strong. It is important that we take into account their views and insights as we try to formulate a balanced policy on Sri Lanka. Right hon. and hon. Members present will understand that there is a wide range of views within the community on a way forward for peace and the role of Britain in Sri Lanka. We try to listen to all perspectives within the community, and we value those opinions and insights.

Peter Luff (Mid-Worcestershire) (Con) : I congratulate the Minister on his balanced approach to a sensitive and difficult subject. He has been subject to calls during the debate to recognize the LTTE. Is not it difficult to do that when, for example, the organization assassinated the Foreign Minister, who was an ethnic Tamil, in 2005? As long as organizations practice such blatant violence and disruption of civil society, it is difficult to give them the recognition that they crave.

Dr. Howells : The hon. Gentlemen made that point well -- I could

2007 08

not have made it more vividly. The Tamil community has been especially concerned about deteriorating human rights in Sri Lanka. Its concern is understandable -- many of its members have first-hand accounts of the difficulties that their friends and family face daily. Earlier, I spoke about the abductions, disappearances, intimidation and extra-judicial killings that have regrettably become commonplace. My right hon. Friend the Foreign 2 May 2007 : Column 1557 Secretary and I have made our position clear to the Government of Sri Lanka. There has to be an end to the culture of impunity. Those responsible for human rights violations should be brought to justice. We have welcomed the establishment of a Presidents commission and an eminent persons group to observe the commissions work. The British Government are funding the participation of Sir Nigel Rodley, an internationally respected professor of law, in that group. We shall continue to raise our concerns with the Sri Lankan Government. Mr. Love : Considerable concern and criticism have been espressed about the Sri Lankan Governments failure to support the commission in its essential work, with which the international community is involved through the eminent persons group. What action have the British Government taken to ensure that the Sri Lankan Government to everything that they can to help the commission in its work? Dr. Howells : We have attempted, through all diplomatic channels, to clarify for the Sri Lankan Government out determination that the process should work. Sir Nigel Rodley is not somebody to mess arould with. He is a serious person, who will not take part in the group if he believes that his investigations are being impeded in any way. We have great confidence in him and in the eminent persons group to see the matter through. We urge the Sri Lankan Government to make their rhetoric on the need for a proper investigative commission work on the ground. We shall continue to urge them to do that and facilitate that work wherever we can. Britain is a great friend of Sri Lanka and the dire situation there is a matter of great concern to the Government. We are determined to work with the Government of Sir Lanka to bring peace. We are ready to talk to all parties to the conflict if that can help with the search for a solution. I have spoken of three things that need to happen to make peace possible. First, the parties to the conflict must accept that a military victory is neither possible nor a basis for a lasting solution. Secondly, there has to be a credible framework for a negotiated settlement -- I hope that that can emerge from the work of the all-party conference. Thirdly, there must be respect for the human rights of all Sri Lankans and an end to the culture of impunity. Britain stands ready to help the Sri Lankans find a peaceful solution to their conflict that will offer a bright future for all their citizens. I hope that the House will agree that the Governments commitment to peace in Sri Lanka at this difficult time has been genuine and that it will be sustained. 3.13 pm Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown (Cotswold) (Con) : I congratulate the Minister on his calm and balanced introduction to the debate. We have had a good start to a debate on a subject that evokes passions. It is important to debate it in the House. Sri Lanka is a beautiful island with a population of approximately 19.5 million people and it has been my pleasure to visit it. It is rightly a popular tourist 2 May 2007 : Column 1558 destination it has more than 600 miles of beaches, with resorts on the west, south and east coasts. It also contains deep jungle and mountain slopes, where high quality Ceylon tea is grown. Sri Lanka has an ancient and historic civilization, some of which I have explored through ruined cities and buildings such as places, dagobars and Buddhist temples throughout the island. I am conscious of the substantial archaeological interest in various sites, including Anuradhapura. Mihintale, Polonnaruwa, Sigiriya, Dambulla and Kandy,

where the glory of the islands past can be witnessed at first hand. I have been welcomed by the friendly people of Sri Lanka when I have visited. It is therefore especially sad, given its natural richness, that the troubles and deep divisions persist on that beautiful island. I note that the Minister visited in February. As he said, the problems have been going on for far too long. The dispute in Sri Lanka does not get as much international attention as it deserves when compared with Darfur, Somalia or Burma. That is a travesty, given the long standing nature of the conflict. Its recent history began in 1975, when a Tamil, Vellupillai Prabhakaran, began to form an extremist wing, which is now known as the Tamil Tigers the LTTE. The Foreign Office estimates that, since that conflict began, nearly 70,000 people have been killed and perhaps more than a million people have been displaced. It is a major conflict in anybodys terms. In recent times, the conflict and death rates have escalated. In answer to a written parliamentary question from me earlier this year, the Minister said that there were 1,000 civilian deaths last year and 40 this January alone. I also note that some 64,857 internally displaced persons are in the process of being resettled. That is expected to happen by the end of July. The conflict has brought untold misery to many more throughout the country who have been injured, displaced or lost loved ones. The international community should make renewed efforts to inject momentum into the peace process. As the Minister repeated several times, a political solution, agreed by all the parties involved in the dispute, is the only lasting answer to the problem. To begin to resolve the conflict, both sides must recognize that that will not happen by military means. As the United Kingdom Government discovered in Northern lreland, there must be a political solution. There will never be a military solution to the Sri Lankan problem. Given the deeply ingrained feelings of mistrust on both sides, resolution is not an easy prospect, as the Minister said. Yet we should not stop trying. It should be our purpose today to discuss what we can do to facilitate the end of the violence in that beautiful country. There is almost daily violence between the armed forces of the Sri Lanka Government and the LTTE. On Friday, three Sri Lanka navy personnel were killed by members of the LTTE in gun battle in Trincomalee on the east coast. On Thursday, Sri Lankan army troops launched an attack on the rebel mortar position in the north-west of the country, where clashes the previous day left 23 combatants dead. The 2 May 2007 : Column 1559 Sad truth is that similar incidents happen every day and will probably continue to happen unless something is done to stop them. * : Document tabled Annex 2 Sri Lanka - Darkness at Noon Stifling Democracy to Promote Family Rule The Presidential Elections of 2005 was a turning point In Sri Lankan politics. The LTTE had rejected the best chance for peace by preventing the Tamil voters from exercising their franchise to conclude the peace process which was on going at the time the United National Party (UNP) Government ceased to hold office in April 2004. This coupled with the failure of the new Mahinda Rajpakse administration to continue the peace process and the escalating violence in the country saw President Rajapakse pursuing the strategy of firstly militarily defeating the LTTE and then presenting a political solution. Unfortunately, the hallmarks of this strategy were the encroachment of democratic freedom. Failing governance and an alarming proliferation of human rights violations. This led to a seemingly insurmountable impasse in the country. In October 2006 a Memorandum of Understanding (annex I) was signed between the two main Sri Lankan political parties - the United National Party and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party as a possible means of

3007 3008

salvaging the deteriorating political, military and economic situation in the country. Its primary objectives were to cooperate on a political solution to the North East conflict, protect human rights and promote good governance. It seemed to provide the key out of the deadlock created by the government, through consensus building and mutual co-operation between the two major political parties at least. The International Co-chairs to the Peace Process welcomed this unprecedented initiative by the two parties and wanted us to work towards a joint solution for the North East conflict by February 2007 (annex 2). The Government undertook to submit its proposals by this deadline and the UNP agreed to work closely with Minister Tissa Vitharana who had been appointed to chair the All Party Committee, to formulate the proposals. I impressed on President Rajapakse the necessity of adhering to this framework in order to give credibility to the MOU. By this time, all other political parties had submitted their proposals apart from the government. However, President Rajapakse was not willing to make this commitment. Furthermore, President Rajapakse promulgated draconian emergency regulations which curbed media freedom and reduced the safeguards on preventive detention. Gravely disturbed by this turn of events, I wrote to President Rajapakse on amending some of these human rights restrictions (annex 3). However, I did not elicit a response to my letter. In January 2007, despite the MOU, President Rajpakse enticed 18 UNPers into the Government by appointing them as Ministers - clearly in violation of the understanding that the UNP supports the government from the opposition. This created a world record in the number of cabinet ministers. My subsequent statement in Parliament (annex 4) on the abrogation of the MOU was also not responded to in Parliament by the government. Two ministers (Mangala Samaraweera and Sripathi Sooriaarachchi) who opposed President Rajapakse on the expansion of the Cabinet and a number of other issues including the human rights violations were summarily dismissed. In fact, Samaraweera as the Foreign Minister had written to President Rajapakse on his increasing difficulty to internationally defend the growing abductions and disappearances. This he did in December 2006, four months before his removal. Subsequent to their dismissal, the two ministers have made the following allegations : (1) They, together with a brother of President Rajapakse (Basil Rajapakse - officially, Presidential Advisor) had a secret understanding with the LTTE on behalf of Mahinda Rajapakse prior to the 2005 Presidential elections. This entailed paying the LTTE a large sum of money to forcibly prevent the Tamil voters in the North and East of the country from exercing their franchise (annex 5.) (2) After reconstituting the new Cabinet in February, 65% of the 2007 Budget allocations are being utilized for the five ministers under President Rajapakse and one under one of his brothers (Chamal Rajapakse - Minister of Agriculture). Allocations for the Ministers under the Rajapakses amount to Rs. 840 Billion of the total budget of Rs. 1,319 Billion. (3) After the Presidential elections nearly 120 of President Rajapakses relatives are on the payroll of the government. President Rajapakse is also the Minister of Defence and a brother of his (Gotabhaya Rajapakse) is the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence. President Rajapakse is the Minister of Finance and a relation of his by marriage, was appointed by him to be the head of Sri Lankas Central Bank. (4) There has been an allegation of corruption, to the Permenent Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery & Corruption, in the recent procurement of MIG 27 aircraft, which are now out of production, by Gotabhaya Rajapakse - Secretary Defence (annex 6). The allegation of a secret agreement with the LTTE has yet to be specifically denied or answered by President Rajapakse and his brother.

Neither have the allegations pertaining to nepotism been countered - the most serious charge being that Basil Rajapakse - his other brother - interfered with the awardind of a tender to build a harbour in Hambantota (President Rajapakess electorate) (annex 7). In response to these allegations, members of Cabinet have made counter-charges against these ministers and the SLFP has instituted disciplinary action at party level. Today, payments have to be by made by businesses to again governmental approval and licenses. Corruption and rampant nepotism, increasing governmental expenditure sans viable revenues, the indiscriminate printing of money indiscriminately resulting in galloping inflation, have made day to day living unbearable for Sri Lankans. The exchange rate which was Rs. 97 to the US Dollar in April 2004 when the UNP Government resigned is today Rs. 111 to the US Dollar. The year on year inflation is currently 19.5% as compared to the April 2004 rate of 2.5%. The Treasury Bill rate today is 15% as opposed to the April 2004 rate of 7.5%. The prime lending rate is today 20% compared to that 10% in April 2004. The Governments response to the increasing mismanagement of the economy has been to camouflage it by highlighting the successes of the war and asking the people to tighten their belts as supposedly, victory was around the corner. This strategy was blatantly exposed when two aircraft of the Tiger Air Force bombed the Sri Lankan Air Force base at the Katunayake Airport. A request by me to the Prime Minister to immediately summon Parliament to discuss this crisis was rejected (annex 8.) It is evident that the political, economic and military situation in the country is deteriorating rapidly - leading President Rajapakse to resort to the suppression of democracy and dissent. One striking example is the arrest of the sacked minister Sripathi Sooriaraachchi on an allegation of not being able to fully account for the use of and official vehicle which was in his possession in the year 2000 while he was a Government Minister (though this vehicle has been subsequently returned). This accusation is made in an era when Ministers are known to have in their possession up to thirty vehicles each. The arrest was made after Sooriaarachchi gave notice of a motion in Parliament calling for the appointment of a Parliamentary Select Committee to investigate Rajapakses secret deal with the LTTE. I have raised this issue as a violation of the powers and privileges of Parliament when a member is physically prevented from proceeding with his motion after having given notice to Parliament (annex 9.) The Government has also decided to use the same approach against other Opposition MPs who are strong critics of the Government, in order to silence them. What is of the greatest significance however is the alarming rise in human rights violations with impunity. These include abductions and disappearances, extortions by armed militant groups working with the Government, preventive detentions without valid reasons and intimidation of media personnel and political opponents. For instance, the number of abductions is believed to exceed 1,000 for 2006 - 2007, with 707 recorded cases - at the Governments Human Rights Commission - in Jaffna peninsula alone. Two Tamil members of Parliament have been killed within the high security government controlled areas in Batticaloa and Colombo in December 2005 and mid 2006. However up to date no action has been taken by the Government. A large number of Tamils (particularly businessmen) have been abducted and subsequently released after the payment of ransoms (annex 10). One-time Sinhala movement supporters of Rajapakse who disagree with this repressive regime are being arbitrarily detained or forced to flee the country. Recently President Rajapakse conferred Police powers on the members of the Armed Forces. The ground situation does not warrant such extreme action. It is to oppress the growing political opposition in the country. The issue of impunity to commit human rights violations is being constantly voiced by civil society and the international community. This is being encouraged by the Governments dilatory attitude in regard to completing inquiries into the hundreds of incidents of human rights violations. Inquiries are promised but never completed nor is action taken against the perpetrators. An example of this unwillingness to act is the story of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into 15 high profile incidents which occurred in 2005 and 2006. Although this Commission

3009 3010

2007 08 3011 3012

6 - PL 001982 - (2007/05)

hearings have been held yet and the credibility of the process is being questioned by the public. Two of the Commissioners are reported to have resigned. To give the process an aura of transparency an independent international group of respected individuals (the IIGEP) have been selected as an oversight body, but we feel that this Group too is becoming disillusioned by the delay in the Commission getting down to work. To the public it looks very much a case of Justice delayed being Justice denied. Perhaps a consequence of several of the cases like the assassination of the two members of Parliament and some 18 Tamil aid workers of an international relief organization carrying the allegation of some governmental involvement. This Government is quie qdept at the well known practice of appointing Commissions of Inquiry almost instantaneously and then allowing, or encouraging them to go to sleep through lack of material support. Despite increasing concern being expressed by the international community and human rights groups these concerns are not reflected in the local media which is partly government controlled and the remainder privately owned. What is highly disturbing is that the Rajapakse regime has managed to control the private media newsrooms through coercion and the active collaboration of some of the media Personnel. Some media persons have been subjected to long periods of preventive detention. One newspaper group was forced to close down due to the freezing of their bank accounts under Emergency regulations. The licenses of two radio stations were cancelled in one case the license was restored only after the ownership of the station was transferred to Government approved investors (annex 11). There is a grave humanitarian crises when it comes to the military operations taking place in the North and East of the country. Current estimates of the internally displaced women, men and children in the East alone are around 150,000 (annex 12). These people are at the mercy of the elements as the Rajapakse regime has prevented humanitarian agencies accessing them. As a result of the incessant aerial bombing of Tamil villages, the international community (which had repeatedly condemned these actions) was not supportive of the Government when the LTTE attacked the Katunayake Air Force base. Another factor which has discredited the Government is the issue of the use of child soldiers by the parties to the conflict. A UN initiated investigation of this abhorrent practice disclosed that not only the LTTE but that the Karuna group which is supported by the Government has been recruiting and using child soldiers in warfare. The Government is complicit in this practice and has yet to satisfy the international community that its hands are clean in this respect. The Rajapakse regime is able to operate with complete impunity as efforts to expose the actual situation are condemned as being demoralizing towards the Sri Lankan armed forces, treacherous, and are subject to shaming, harassment and intimidation. It has become blatantly clear that Rajapakses stated objective of unifying the country is simply a camouflage to further his true intentions of stifling democracy through force and repression. THERE IS IN EFFECT DARKNESS AT NOON. In this, the LTTE must share the blame of violating human rights and the conscription of child soldiers. Whilst such conduct can be identified with a terrorist organization, a democratic government which is subject to law and convention is expected to act in accordance to high ideals and protect all of its citizens. That is why we expect the Government to honour the rule of law and not become a copy of the LTTE. What differentiates us Sri Lankans in this conflict is not merely a commitment to safeguard the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka but an equal commitment to safeguard the democratic rights of the people. The Constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka is based on the sovereignty of the people. It is this principle that the Rajapakse regime seeks to destroy under the guise of fighting separatism and terrorism. It is here that we appeal to all of you abroad to support us by launching campaigns in your respective Parliaments and outside, to pressurize the Government of Mahinda Rajapakse and the LTTE to safeguard human rights, to restore democratic freedoms (including the media) and to resolve the humanitarian crisis facing our people.

It is difficult to shot down these attack aeroplanes. It is not as easy as plucking Cashew with a catapult! These are not hanging fruit, these are aircrafts traveling at 150 kilometers per hour. The Army had achieved a great success by not allowing them to attack the main installations. The air attack was repulsed only after three to four hundred soldiers fired at them

Next time we will be even more ferocious. We have shown them this Time. Since we have attacked When we attack from air, them so many times, the Tigers we cant expect them to do are bound to retaliate. When we nothing. They will of course attack from air, we cant expect attack. They have to! We them to do nothing. They will expect them to attack!! Of course attack. They have to! We expect them to attack! The minister said.

No pre - Conditions for talks When asked about the future of the peace process, the minister said We will not go for peace just because they had started air strikes. We are not scared of them. If we go for peace talks we will begin it with no pre conditions. We are not ready to talk about the opening the A9 or to begin talks based on the CFA. But, we will hit back every time they hit us! The minister accused the Tigers for attacking in the night. They come stealthily a night. We hit them in daylight. They have to fight face to without hiding in the dark.

[.. 1.21] ( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa) Hon. Madam Chairperson, today we are discussing a Debate which had been held in the House of Commons in the United Kingdom on the 2nd of May 2007. While we are making some kind of an allegation that this Debate should not have taken place in the United Kingdom, we are also repeating the same thing in our Parliament. That shows that this is not something novel but these kinds of debates have taken place in past history. This is not something unusual but there are serious matters to be taken into consideration by the Sri Lankan Government as a sovereign State and we have drawn attention to some of the proposals and contents of the speeches made by the Hon. Members in the House of Commons. Before I start my comments I would like to refer to history. While we were fighting for our Independence during the colonial period, one of our illustrious sons, the greatest orator who represented this august Assembly, Dr. Colvin R. de Silva wrote a thesis for his Ph.D. under the topic "Ceylon under British Occupation". While he had made certain criticisms, I recall once he had stated in Parliament, "The sun never sat on the British Emperor because the sun could not trust the integrity of the British Emperor". That was a great comment made by a great leader. But, today I am not going to stir up a hornets nest. That is the past. By peddling the pedigree I do not think that we can achieve anything. We must understand the reality. The ground reality must be understood correctly. Then only we can face the situation. Before we discuss the contents of the proposal made by some of the Hon. Members of the House of Commons, I would like to draw your attention as to how this proposal had come in. This had been moved by one of the Members, the Hon. Keith Vaz who was elected as a Labour Party Member to the House of Commons and became a Minister but resigned shortly after the last General Election. Before his resignation there was a significant incident that had taken place. There is a Committee on Standards and Privileges in the House of Commons.

2007 08 3015 3016

After an inquiry there was a report issued by the Commissioner that the Hon. Keith Vaz was involved in an unethical, unwarranted transaction where he had accepted large sums of money from an Asian family for the election campaign and therefore had violated the Code of Conduct of the British Parliament. That report says, We found Mr. Keith Vaz has committed serious breaches of the Code of Conduct and Contempt of House. Since then he was compelled to resign from the ministerial portfolio and was a backbencher. Now one or two days before the Local Government Elections - may be he was so eager to go for a publicity campaign - he used a novel method to maintain his or his colleagues' reputation in the Election and took up issues which were not directly relevant to their Parliament but to our Parliament. I am not being unkind by saying that he is a museum piece of a politician, but we will have to concede the fact that he was hunting for some reputation in the constituency that he represents and also in his country. But at the same time we must also not make a mistake. This is not a stand taken up by the British Government. The Deputy Minister, the Hon. Hussain Bhaila explained to this House as to how the British Government had responded to this move, especially the Foreign Office Minister, Dr. Kim Howells who said that this is not the position of the British Government and until the full renunciation of the violence and weapons, there would not be any kind of consideration for the removal of the banned status on the LTTE. And, therefore as a responsible Government we are not going for a confrontation with the British Government. We must appreciate the fact that Tony Blairs Government has taken up the correct stand like some of the Members in our Parliament sometimes move for various debates on incidents that occur in various parts of the world. For example, I can remember there were some debates in this House with regard to the invasion of Iraq by the United States. This is something like that. Some Members had gathered on representations made by some of the Tamil voters and taken up this issue. But I do not think it will create serious problems as far as our sovereignty is concerned. On the other hand one must not make a mistake that we are against them having any discussions, debates or comments in the House of Commons which are related to events in our country. We must concede the fact that they have the freedom to talk and debate. We do not want to restrain it. But at the same time we have the highest regard for the House of Commons as the mother of Parliaments in the world. Those who are running their country on an unwritten constitution, those who are so concerned about the traditions and customs in politics, and when we have to teach our students about the modern Parliament, we always take up the model Parliament, the mother of Parliaments, the British Westminster Parliament. And therefore it is a paramount duty on our part being representatives of the general public of this country and responsible to safeguard its sovereignty, that when a Parliament takes up a debate of this kind or moves this kind of a resolution, there are certain bounds and limits which should not be passed.

We can understand the British Parliament discussing our issues, our communal problems that have been in existence for several decades especially because the British are partly responsible for some of the debates at the inception when they ruled this country as a colony and always followed the divide and rule policy. That also to a certain extent has led to the creation of a division among the communities in this country especially among the Sinhalese and the Tamils. And, therefore they know the issue. They are responsible up to a certain extent. But, at the same time if they are willing to contribute in some way to make us unite, we welcome that. But, we are really concerned as to whether they have done it just to make us unite or to divide. That is the issue.

When you look at the contents of the speeches delivered apparently by 37 Hon. Members, there had been some fair comments as well as some unwarranted comments. Their having a debate or a discussion we welcome, but we cannot accept them forming a caucus or a forum in the House of Commons to fight for the Tamils in Sri Lanka. Although we had a lot of misunderstandings, confrontations and conflicts with the British Government, the British rulers, after Independence we were able to maintain a cordial relationship with the United Kingdom. In this regard, I think even the Commonwealth Parliamentarian Group has done a great service and valuable contributions have been made. So far of course our relationship is good and there was a stage when the British Government was also compelled to ban terrorist organizations under which list the LTTE is also included. But our concern is this. In the event the British Parliament wants to make a contribution towards the upliftment of the society of Sri Lanka or for safeguarding its unity, certainly there are ways and means of doing that. Forming a caucus or a forum especially to look after the interests of the Tamils might lead to some more deviations. In fact, if a responsible caucus or a forum is going to give us a helping hand it should be to look after the interests of the entire people living in the country. If that group is going to look after the interests of one party or one communal group, that will always lead to problems. Also, it will set a very bad precedent in the world. As I explained earlier, there had been discussions and debates, but there is no precedent where any Parliament or a group of Members has set up a caucus of this nature. Therefore, if they go beyond their authority, interfere with another sovereign State, that will create more and more problems. What comes to my mind is the saying, "Fools rush in where angels fear to tread". That is applicable to any Member of Parliament if he or she does not know his or her limit. As a Parliament, when we debate about another independent State of which the sovereignty is retained and protected, there are certain norms and traditions we have adhere to. Especially the British Parliament is full of traditions and customs which we have to be careful about. By looking at the contents of the speeches made, again what I noticed was that their comments had been

3017 3018

mostly one-sided, not impartial. It is within their knowledge that during the last so many decades there had been attempts, more than five to six times, to commence peace negotiations. Our constitutional reforms were introduced; constitutional amendments were effected. With all that, they have failed to consider the sacrifices and efforts made by the Government; whether it was by this Government or the previous Government makes no difference. As far as the Sri Lankan Governments are concerned, there had been various initiatives proposed and implemented commencing from the late President J. R. Jayewardene with the introduction of the Thirteenth Amendment. There had been positive actions taken by successive Governments. But apparently, the majority of the speakers who delivered speeches in the House of Commons have failed to take into consideration the attempts and the sacrifices made by all the successive Governments at least since 1987 to resolve this problem. At the same time, I also wish to mention that some of the Members had the effrontery to make statements damaging to the dignity of Sri Lanka. What I insist is that making these kinds of statements with effrontery would not help to solve our internal problem. If they being outsiders so wish to see our people heave a sigh of relief, there has to be a satisfactory contribution which would lead us to have unity, not to have the people or the community divided. While there are enough sources, ways and means of making some kind of contribution to achieve peace in this country - we have the Inter-Parliamentary Union; we have the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and committees and there is no obstruction for us to sit together and discuss - what is the big idea of discussing these matters in the House of Commons with the participation of some Members in the United Kingdom who are looking after the interests of the Tamil voters in London or with Norway? The crux of the issue is before us. That is well within the ambit of this House. In the event that they want a meaningful discussion, there are Hon. Members who represent the Tamil community in the country in the North and the East and even in other areas. There are other political parties represented in Parliament. So, what is the difficulty for us to sit together and discuss? We can organize a meeting, maybe in London or in Colombo.

The way they have proposed to start a caucus especially to fight for the rights of the Tamils will give a misrepresentation and a misunderstanding to the people. It is not going to help the country. In fact, the Foreign Secretary has stated in the statement he has released that the fund-raising by the LTTE has not helped this country to resolve the conflict; it has helped only to increase the war. That is the stand the British Government has openly taken. Therefore, with these kinds of comments, I personally feel that especially the Hon. Member Keith Vaz, who is leading this group has gone beyond his limits, out-of-bounds and certainly it will not help the Tamils or the Sinhalese or anybody in this country to have a

peaceful solution to this problem. When there are enough ways and means, we are surprised as to why he made this kind of move.

On the other hand, taking into consideration the latest developments in the political field where the whole world is entangled with some kind of war at some place in the world, when one country or one parliament discusses about an internal issue of another country, I think there are certain ethical limits within which they have to act. When people have no trust on this kind of contribution, that will lead to problems. Whatever the intention is, whether it is bona fide or mala fide, the Norwegian Government is involved in our peace process. There are comments made either way. But the majority of the people in this country do not believe that they have done a good job; people do not believe that they are impartial. In an instance of this nature, if the House of Commons also gets together with the Norwegian Government and try to do something, there will be a lot of unrest and distrust. We will have to rightly or wrongly concede that this is a communal issue. This has no other basis than distrust among the communities. What we will have to do before everything else is to build trust between the parties.

In an instance of this nature where the Sri Lankan Government is taking meaningful steps through the All Party Conference to establish peace in the country, there can be criticism. I know that most of the political parties have criticized our partys suggestion. That is your right; you have a right to do it. That is not the final version of our proposal. The partys position is that that has to be discussed. That is why earlier also I mentioned in my speech that those meaningful negotiations should have taken place in this House, not at the All Party Conference. But, rightly or wrongly we have now started it. The second stage would be to discuss that matter in Parliament. In an instance of this nature, if there are external interferences which would create doubts in the minds of our people, I think we would go back to square one. We will have to think as to how we must avoid this kind of conflict situations.

This Parliament is represented by so many political parties, so many religious groups and communal groups. Therefore, if there is any question, there is no difficulty for us to discuss it. When it comes to the question of the sovereignty of our State, we cannot be renegades. We have our own political ideologies. Those are conflictive; controversial; they do not go together. But we will have to concede the fact that our prime duty is to safeguard the sovereignty of the country. In that instance there cannot be divisions; whether you belong to the UNP, the SLFP or the TNA, at least we must have a consensus. We all are Sri Lankans. All the 225 Members of this Parliament are Sri Lankans. If you deviate from that basic position, there is no meaning in having this Parliamentary Session. That is the prime duty of any Member of Parliament.

There are issues. When there are such issues, even the House of Commons should not just embrace those issues. They must comprehend the issues. They must understand what the issues are. They must be able to understand as to who created the issues, as to how these issues have been developed. If they are genuine in resolving our issue of course, I will have to state that this is not the way they should have come out with their proposals. There should have been better ways and means. It appears that their eyes are covered with haze - with instructions or advice given by their voters. If you look at the speeches made by the Hon. Members in the House of Commons, it is clear and beyond any doubt that they have not come to any conclusion on the matters that they have spoken about. They have merely gone on the basis of certain information given by their voters in London. It is something dangerous. Just because a Member of Parliament gets some information from some of his voters, it is not correct to reveal that to the whole world without ascertaining as to what the truth is, what the ground reality is. Therefore I have to tell those speakers that they should have been much more careful about certain comments, not all, which they have made. We are here to solve the problems and not to complicate them. If one Parliament is trying to complicate the problems of another country, it will create more problems. It will create a bad precedent. That is why I said at the beginning, the House of Commons has gained a lot as a model Parliament, an exemplary Parliament in the world. We cite the Westminster Parliament as the model Parliament to our children. If they stoop to a level of this nature people will lose confidence in that system. It is bad for them. Before it has a bad impact on our ruling system, it will have a bad impact on their own Parliament. We are not going to advise them as to how they should run their Parliament but there are basic norms that have to be followed and adhered to. We have learnt from them most of the traditions in the Parliamentary system. We expect them to maintain those traditions. But with this incident there is a serious erosion in public confidence not only about their impartiality but also about their conduct, Parliamentary traditions and Parliamentary customs. We never say or never want to impose conditions on any Parliament not to discuss our matters. Now the whole world has become a global village. We cannot live separately, we have to live together. However much we do not like some nations or some of the systems, we have to move about with them and at the same time there is another significant fact that I wish to remind. When they made a suggestion to have a caucus or a forum in the House of Commons they should have taken into consideration the fact that the British and the Norwegians cannot resolve our problem. No doubt they will be able to give some support. They will be able to make some contribution but we are having some of the imminent factors here. However much the House of Commons or the British Government is genuine they cannot sort out

our problem the way they want. However much the United States of America wants to sort out our problem, they cannot do it. There are imminent factors. Nobody can bypass India. We must make our minds clear. Whatever the contribution we get, whatever the support we get globally we would not be able to do anything unless we have a very close relationship with the Indian Government. Not that they want to show their powers but there is an inherent factor that they cannot keep quiet; they are not blind. Ours is a small island situated in the Indian Ocean. You have to concede the fact that in addition to the other countries in this region India is a leading country. That is a strong country. Therefore, just because the Norwegians or the House of Commons give suggestions to us, do you think we can resolve our problem? Can you bypass India? Can you ignore India? Therefore, if we are to make a genuine effort to have peace in this beautiful country, we have to work closely with India. If you ignore India and put pressure on the international community whether they are from the American continents or the European continent it will be a futile act. Nobody is going to gain anything. Therefore, Madam, I wish to wind up my speech by reminding that we being a responsible Government we are not going to have a confrontation with the United Kingdom or the House of Commons. Let them discuss, we have no objection but the establishment of a caucus is out. That will create a bad precedent. This has never happened in history. It is against all norms and traditions maintained by the British Parliament during the last three centuries. Therefore, under no circumstances will we tolerate that kind of move. But at the same time we have a duty as Hon. Members of this Parliament. Why should we wait until the British Parliament or the Norwegian Government find a solution for us? What is the effort we have made? We will have to take the blame. I have repeatedly stated that we have not been able to appoint a select committee to look into this matter in spite of all the communities and groups being represented by the Members in this House. We do not discuss, we do not ask for a select committee, we do not sit together.

( ) (The Presiding Member) , .

( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa) . We do not discuss any of these issues. When our issue is discussed in the House of Commons we come here and make a big fuss. Why is this ? So we will have to discuss. I think within our conscience we are fully responsible for not finding a solution. We always come and make

3021 3022

allegations against somebody or curse somebody. By doing that, this issue will never be sorted out during our lifetime. Therefore what I suggest is, before we dwell upon the discussions, debates or any other comments made by the international community or any other Parliament, we must be genuine to ourselves. We must make a genuine attempt. If not, I think we can discuss and criticize this issue not only today but continue for so many years and yet we will not be able to find a solution. Thank you very much, Madam Presiding Member.

The Colonial Secretary of Ceylon, Sir Hugh Cleghorn wrote in June 1799 to the UK Government : "The different nations from a very ancient period have divided between them the possession of the Island. The Sinhalese, inhabiting the interior of the country in its Southern Western parts, and the Malabars (it means Tamil) who possess the Northern and Eastern Provinces. These two nations differ entirely in their religion, language,

and manners." 1799

Johnstone "Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland"

"I think it may safely be concluded both from them and from all the different histories which I have in my possession, that the race of people who inhabited the whole of the Northern and Eastern Provinces of the Island of Ceylon, at the period of greatest agricultural prosperity spoke the same language, used the same written character, and had the same origin, religion, castes, laws and manners, as that race of the people who at the same period inhabited the Southern Peninsula of India." . 1881 ,

"The census of 1881 also indicates that the two Tamil Provinces were almost exclusively inhabited by the Tamils in the late nineteenth century. The Sinhalese population constituted only 1.8 per cent of the total population of the two Tamil Provinces. In 1881 Sinhalese accounted for only 0.51 per cent of the total population of the Northern

Province, and 4.2 per cent of the Eastern Province." , , , . . , . ? . - , , , , . , . , , 1815 , 1818 . 1833 , , . . , - Sovereignty - . , . , . , , . -

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) It has still not been done. Ask about it from the GA, Batticaloa. Yes. Only in Vakarai a few people have been resettled. But more than 100,000 people are still in refugee camps and the Government is not giving them anything to eat. It is the World Food Programme that is giving some food through the GA and the Government claims credit for that. You go and check and tell me whether I am telling you the truth or not.

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) Now you are talking about the All Party Conference. You are in the Government. You have already given a proposal that was rejected by your own Ministers. You know that.

3073 3074

2007 08

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) These are the SLFP proposals.

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) The SLFP has given a proposal which even your Ministers have rejected. If you are going to give proposals like that, how can you solve this problem?

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Our proposals are still under consideration. You must understand that ours is a democracy. Our Government is a coalition.

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) You need time again and again. For the last 50 years, your people are doing this.

( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) Hon. Member, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party is a democratic party.

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) On the one hand you do things in a democratic way and on the other you kill the Tamil people - [Interruption.] Why are they killing the Sinhalese? Because you cannot find a solution. You are the people who created the LTTE, not we. Do you understand that? That day I explained this to you very clearly. Now you are talking about resolutions and you are explaining to the international community - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Now I must conclude -[Interruption]. My time has been taken. [Interruption.] What is this? Hon. Member, do not get excited. Do not get excited about the whole issue. We are here to answer you. We are the Government. I will tell you. We will bring a lasting solution to the problem.

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) How long will you take?

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) The moment your LTTE - [Interruption.] I hope you are not representing the LTTE. The moment they de-escalate violence, put the arms down, come to talk, we will proffer you the solution tomorrow. That is how we are going to do it. We have talked with the LTTE - [Interruption] What? How can you say that? Do not be pessimistic. Do not be pessimistic as a politician. [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) You people do not have anything in your mind. [Interruption.] You have to change your mindset. [Interruption.] This is the problem, you know. You go all over the world telling untruths and you come to this House and again tell us untruths. You said that you are explaining to the international community. What are you explaining?

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Hon. Member, what is the - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) Sir, I rise to a point of Order - [Interruption]

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) No, let the Hon. Member have his say because this is something you are not enjoying in Kilinochchi which freedom we are prepared to extend to you. You cannot go and talk to Prabhakaran like this. Can you ever go and tell Prabhakaran, You are killing my people. Please lay down the arms and talk to a responsible Government ? You cannot say that to your own man. [Interruption.] We do not want time. [Interruption.] In the event we do not have terrorism in this country, the problem is always solved. But if there is terrorism, give us time to address this issue.

3075 3076

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) You are running to New York, going around the world and explaining -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) You are speaking for me. [Interruption.] You are speaking for me, Hon. Member. Now, this is where the most important factor of this Debate comes to light. I quote what Dr. Kim Howells stated in Parliament leading this Debate. The responsibility of the LTTE for violent acts over years is well documented I think, the Hon. Premachandran will have to listen to this. It goes on further to say, I quote:

It is a proscribed organization under the Terrorism Act 2000. The EU listed the LTTE as a terrorist organization in May 2006. We have repeatedly urged the LTTE to move away from the path of violence. In the absence of a full renunciation of terrorism in deed and word, there can be no question of reconsidering its proscribed status. LTTE involvement in killings, torture, detention of civilians and denial of freedom of speech is a reality. This is not what I am saying. I have not said this. But I repeat what the Hon. Member, Dr. Kim Howells is saying. I quote :

The LTTE does not tolerate any expression of opposition.. That is where you get caught up, where the LTTE is concerned.

and its continuing recruitment of child soldiers is a matter of great concern. Now we are trying to put this entire Debate into a greater perspective.

The ability . - [Interruption.] That is what I have always been canvassing in the foreign capitals.

The ability of the LTTE to raise funds overseas helps to sustain.. - [Interruption.]

I know your problem is because we canvass a different agenda than that of yours. When you are going to be a part of the LTTE agenda, we as a democracy advocate something against the LTTE.

The ability of the LTTE to raise funds overseas helps to sustain its ability to carry out violent acts and reduces the incentive to move way

from the path of violence. Now what they say is, Do not give funds to the LTTE. Stop allowing them to collect funds in the world. This is what the British Parliament is saying. LTTE fundraising activity in the United Kingdom encourages war, not peace. They are also denouncing this. This is the very thing we have said. Now they have started arresting people in the United States, in the United Kingdom, in Australia, in Paris, in France. This is what we have done. You are against that. This is what the whole world wants in the elimination process of terrorism. This is why we went to the SAARC and got a comprehensive terrorism declaration. That is, terrorism in all forms and manifestations. This is how we are looking at the agenda. This is how we are now fighting the battle in terms of bringing about lasting and sustainable peace in our country. This is how we are looking at this agenda. That is why you are now getting agitated because your agenda is different from ours. But I am sure as an elected Member of the people, in your heart of hearts you believe in a democratic path and do not want to be dictated by the LTTE. But that, you cannot express to the LTTE. We leave that to you. It will be - [Interruption.] Dr. Kim Howells goes on to say, I quote:

It will not be tolerated, and I have recently met . This is what is important.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) .

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) . I will quote that. . .

( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) .

I quote the Hon. Member, Peter Luff :

I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. It is vital that both sides take courageous steps to achieve the ceasefire that we all crave. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Both sides.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Wait! Wait! I will come to that. I quote: I have no axe to grind except that, when I hear of a death in the name of politics, I am angry. I worry that today we have heard criticism of the .. My reading of the behavior of the LTTE in those areas is that it, too, inhibits reconstruction. It suits such a group to keep people in some subjugation and blame others for their misfortune. That is a familiar technique of tyrants through the ages. Although I deplore any action by the that makes reconstruction more difficult, the LTTE inhibits the process, and that may suit its political objectives. Now what are they saying? They are condemning the activities of the LTTE.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) . , , , aid front organizations .

, front organizations, . , . - I want to bring to your notice, Hon. Member, one of the speeches made in the House of Commons. It says - We have welcomed the establishment of a Presidents commission and an eminent persons group to observe the commissions work. The British Government are funding the participation of Sir Nigel Rodley, an internationally respected professor of law, in that group. We shall continue to raise our concerns with the Sri Lankan Government". Mr. Love said that considerable concern and criticism have been expressed about the Sri Lankan Governments failure to support certain areas of work. But that they are confident that the international community through the eminent persons group will take action to ensure that the Sri Lankan Government does everything it can, to help the Commission in its work. Now there are very positive signs. They are all coming in terms of what action we have taken and at the same time recognizing the fact that in Sri Lanka there is a terror struck environment. In the event we are free of terrorism, then we would have the total writ of all parts of Sri Lanka where we can apprehend the criminals. The situation then is quite different. I am sure my Friend, the Hon. Kiriella will agree with me. [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . . There should be a parity of status. - - . . , . .

- The thrust of the speech is the parity of status of both sides, the Government and the LTTE - if the LTTE is banned they cannot come for negotiations. So you had better be mindful of that - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Hon. Member, I do not want to dispute your opinion. Opinions can be formed from all these speeches that have been made. But I must be very emphatic on this matter, that nowhere had there been any comparison in terms of parity of status between the Government and that of a

3079 3080

terrorist organization. Nowhere have they brought it in. We had this parity of status only in the CFA. The Ceasefire Agreement is the only thing that stated that the Government and the LTTE had to sit across and discuss matters in parity.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , . . . . .

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) . - [ ] . -

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) That is the entire thrust of the debate. Debate . The entire thrust of the debate is that if negotiations are to be started, the ban on the LTTE must be lifted.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) There is absolutely no conclusion to that effect.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) You are ignoring the reality.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) No. The reality is what has to be discussed in the light of Sri Lankas situation. Nowhere has the British Government ever said that we have to discuss with the LTTE on parity. But negotiations must be done. The British Parliament need not resolve that. We have been saying that. We are prepared to talk with the LTTE and we did talk with the LTTE in Geneva.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) That is only the first debate. There will be many more debates. So I am telling you - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) You are very presumptuous. You are looking at a very hypothetical situation. May be you are aware what

the next stage is and what the following stage will be. You may be aware of the developments that are going to take place. I respect you on that. But at the same time I must tell you [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana) Hon. Minister, will you let me have a small clarification?

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Yes.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana) Will you make a statement on the Ceasefire Agreement? Are you going to abrogate it? Now you said that because of the Ceasefire Agreement the parity status became -

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) What is the answer you would like me to give?

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana) Will you make a statement on the Ceasefire Agreement?

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) What is the answer you want me to give? What is your preferred answer?

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana) Will you make a statement about the Ceasefire Agreement? Now the JVP asks you to abrogate it. The JHU, a partner of the Government, says that it has to be abrogated. Are you going to abrogate it or not?

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) When the former Prime Minister, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, signed that Agreement, were we kept informed of that? You and I were in the same party. Were we kept informed of the signing of this Agreement? You answer that.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana) Now you are the Foreign Minister. Now you are not in the UNP.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) You answer that. You and I have sat on the same side. You give me an answer, Hon. Member. Were we aware as Ministers at that time? Were we kept informed that this Agreement was signed?

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana) Now I am asking you as the Foreign Minister to make a statement on the Ceasefire Agreement signed by the UNP. You supported the Ceasefire Agreement when you were in the UNP. You were the first person to support the Ceasefire Agreement.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Was the Hon. Speaker kept informed? Then he was the Leader of the House. He got up and said that there was no such Agreement signed by the then Prime Minister. But then the Agreement was signed. You give me an answer to that.
