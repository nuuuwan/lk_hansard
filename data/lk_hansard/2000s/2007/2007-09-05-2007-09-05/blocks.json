I move that, \"(a) The flagrant violation of Human Rights, in the form of extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances and other inhuman and unlawful actions continuously perpetrated against the unarmed Tamil civilian population, particularly in the North-East, and also in some other parts of the country, with a sense of total impunity on the part of such perpetrators, and the persistent failure on the part of the Government to take meaningful, adequate, positive and tangible action, so as to prevent or deter such regular and continuing violations, other than some face-saving measures in regard to certain identified past violations, which results in Tamil civilians particularly in the North-East having to continuously suffer unbearable agony in an environment of total insecurity, indignity and oppression. (b) The several actions of the Government both covert and overt to dismantle the arrangements on which the peace process pertaining to the North-East was structured particularly in relation to the merged North-East and inclusive of the special steps resorted to by Government to alienate State land and provide housing to persons of the majority community, in parts of the Eastern Province, which are racially discriminatory against and particularly harmful to the Tamil-speaking people, both Tamils and Muslims in the North-East, particularly in the East at present, which steps would also cause adverse changes in existing demographic compositions in such territories, and also the steps contemplated by Government to effect territorial changes in administrative structures by creating new units of administration, in such territories, so as to strengthen majority interests and emasculate minority interests, which would permanently endanger the well-being of the Tamils and Muslims in the North-East, the cumulative effect of which steps taken by the Government, would be that instead of moving towards resolution of the conflict, the conflict would be further exacerbated and prolonged. (c) the immense suffering endured by the several hundreds of thousands of Tamil civilians who were displaced consequent to the aerial bombardment and the firing of multibarrel rockets by the Government armed forces into properties owned and occupied by them for generations and centuries, the lack of a cohesive programme acceptable to the displaced Tamil people pertaining to their resettlement on the lands from which they were evicted and the several aspects relating thereto, the lack of transparency, and the lack of consultation, in regard to such activitites carried out by the Government, and the need to evolve and implement a comprehensive programme that would restore lasting stability in the lives of these unfortunate Tamil people, rather than pursue programmes dictated by narrow political agendas which would only be to the permanent detriment of these people and deny them the long standing benefits to which they are legitimately entitled.",

(II) (a) that the Government takes appropriate action to restore the merged North-East, (b) that the Government desists from the special steps taken to alienate State land to the majority community in the North-East, so as to change the demographic composition in such territories and from creating new administrative units in any part of the North-East so as to strengthen majority interests and emasculate the interests of the Tamil speaking people the Tamils and Muslims in the North-East. (III) that the displaced Tamil people be resettled on the lands from which they were evicted as per a programme prepared in consultation with the displaced Tamil people and that they be adequately compensated for the losses suffered by them and that they be provided with all other essential facilities so as to enable them to recommence life in a stable manner. Sir, I want to make it perfectly clear before I commence my submissions on the Debate of this Adjournment Motion that any submissions that I will make on the Floor of this House in the course of this Debate is not directed against any community. I want to make it clear that all communities in this country are entitled to live in equality and that the maintenance of goodwill among all communities is essential for permanent peace in this country. Therefore, Sir, any submissions I make on the Floor of this House is not intended to offend the feelings of any one community. I want to make that perfectly clear. But, at the same time Sir, injustice cannot be permitted to occur and in order to ensure that injustice does not continue unchecked, it is necessary to raise relevant issues with the Government and there can be no more effective way of raising these issues with the Government than on the Floor of this House. It has been said, Sir, that there is a well-known Buddhist view on politics which enunciates that the politicians' approach to governance should be based solely on dharma or justice and righteousness. And I shall endeavour in the course of my submissions today, on the basis of hard facts to establish in this House and to this country that many of the steps that have been taken by the present Government in this country today, particularly in the Eastern Province are not based on dharma, are not based on justice and are not based on righteousness and therefore, it is our duty as representatives democratically elected by the people of the North-East to voice the sentiments of those people on the Floor of this House. I propose, Sir, in the course of my submissions to deal primarily with the displacement of Tamil civilians in the Eastern Province - over 300,000 Tamil civilians were displaced in the Eastern Province during the course of the military actions - the manner of such displacement, the objective of such displacement, the consequences of such displacement, the plight of the people today and what is happening after such displacement and other matters related thereto.",

The Government has declared a high security zone in a part of the Mutur DS Division, and the Government is engaged in certain diabolical steps with the sole purpose, if I might say so, of converting the majority Tamil-speaking Eastern Province into a majority Sinhalese territory. I do not say this with any malice against my Sinhalese brethren. Certainly not, but if peace is to prevail in this country I do not think we can be willing parties to the pursuit of any such policy and my fear is that what the Government had been engaged in, in the past several months in the Eastern Province has created amongst those young people in the Eastern Province, the boys and girls and the children, many future insurgents who have seen for themselves, the way the Government has dealt with them and they must be bearing these memories in mind and will some day think that the armed struggle must continue rather than end. This is most unfortunate and I think, Sir, this is a matter that I am most concerned about and why I think, Sir, there was a need for this Motion to be brought in this House and for these matters to be debated in this House and for the Government to be made aware of the catastrophic steps that the Government is engaged in, in regard to the Eastern Province. I propose, Sir, in the course of my submissions today, rather than speaking on the bases of material which I have been able to collect and gather in regard to the goings-on in the Eastern Province, particularly in regard to the displaced people, to place before this House the reports of, for instance the University Teachers for Human Rights, a much-respected independent human rights organization which frequently strongly criticizes the LTTE for their misdeeds very boldly and very frankly. I also propose to place before the House certain observations made by independent media personnel, all Sinhalese people, all Sinhalese friends of ours who have gone to the Eastern Province and who have seen for themselves, they have talked to the people, the Tamil people and the Muslim people in the Eastern Province and who have consequently written in regard to the observations they have made and in regard to the information they have gathered by talking to these people. Before I quote, Sir, from the Report of the University Teachers for Human Rights, I think, it will be interesting to place on record the observations made by Dr. Rajiva Wijesinha, the present Head of the Government Peace Secretariat in regard to the comments that he made when",

In the course of that comment that he made in regard to Western Human Rights Groups he also referred to the University Teachers for Human Rights and this is what he said. He said that some Western Human Rights Groups as opposed to the Sri Lanka's University Teachers for Human Rights \"for which he had the highest regard\" were acting in concert with the UNP and the LTTE. So he said that while he had the highest regard for the University Teachers for Human Rights certain Western Human Rights Groups were acting in collusion with the UNP and the LTTE. Now, Sir, I want to refer to the Report of the University Teachers for Human Rights (Jaffna). I refer to Special Report No. 26 released on the 3rd of August 2007 under the heading, \"Can the East be won through Human Culling?\". In the course of this Report these honourable gentlemen have not only referred to the operations carried out in the Eastern Province but to what happened to the people when these operations were carried out, what their present plight is and what the future holds for them. It is a very comprehensive analysis of the situation in the Eastern Province and I think this House would greatly benefit from what these honourable gentlemen have had to say. In page 3 of their Report they have said, I quote: \"Once more security is being equated with capturing areas and bringing them under Sinhalese hegemonic dominion. Against such delusions, the Government's much vaunted winning of the East is going to be temporary, the Tamils and Muslims are going to feel further insecure and in turn Sinhalese living in the East would further be turned into unwilling pawns in a devastating ideological game.\" Sir, in another paragraph on the same page, I refer to what they have said. I quote: While we draw attention to historical precedents in demographic fiddling and uprooting of Tamil villages in the North-East as part of the Sinhalese hegemonic project, we reiterate that its renewal runs contrary to the wishes of the Sinhalese people. So I do not think the majority of the Sinhala people in this country want anything diabolical to be done to the Tamil and Muslim people in the Eastern Province which will only exacerbate and prolong this conflict. I quote further: Credible revelations of a pre-election deal between the Presidents men and the LTTE to disadvantage the UNP candidate, throw doubts on whether the President was elected. The party of extremist Buddhist monks (JHU) and presidential ally, currently wielding key influence in driving government policy in the North-East, was never by far elected as the representatives of the Sinhalese people. Going on further, Sir, on page 4 of their report, I would like to read to you some further paragraphs. I quote: The East is now under a total militarisation of the civil administration, by a military enjoying a 23-year-history of absolute impunity, killing thousands of Tamil civilians without anyone being punished.

    "text": "They go on to say, Sir, I quote: \"Testimonies we received from civilians confirmed that in general, the LTTE did not fire at the Army from among the civilians until the last stages in December, 2006.\" Sir, you will see that this is what the UTHR says. Persons who normally criticize the LTTE and whom the Government hails as being persons who expose the truth in regard to the LTTE is clearly shown in the statement made by the Head of the Peace Secretariat, Prof. Rajiva Wijesinha. Sir, Page 7 of that Report they say, I quote: Faced with massive bombing and shelling in Mutur East in early August, 2006, the civilians were forced to move from one village that was hit to another that seemed safer. Thus many people who fled Sampoor, which was shelled first in April, fled to Illankaithurai Muhattuvaram. When Muhattuvaram came under missile attack in August, the displaced scattered again to wherever seemed safer, to Verugal, Kathiraveli and Vakarai before ending up in refugee camps in the Batticaloa District in December 2006. At every one of these places, they were bombed, shelled or both.......\" The point is that the Government did not want them to get back as subsequent events show.\" The Government did not want these people to go back, is the view of the UTHR. That view is confirmed by the statement of Minister Keheliya Rambukwella sometime later that the Government will not allow them to go back and that they are going to create special economic zones in those areas for whose benefit, we do not know but we can guess for whose benefit that will be. In another paragraph of the UTHR report, it is stated, I quote: The events in Mutur East could be a violation of International Humanitarian Law. It would call for an independent and international commission to investigate such violations. In other countries, UN Human Rights Field Operations are tasked with such investigations, and clearly there is again a need for such an international monitoring and investigative presence. Now there is another paragraph which is so sad to read. This is something I heard about which I never believed but it is confirmed by the UTHR in their Report. It states, I quote: Violence, coercion and intimidation from the State were constant companions of the refugees from the time they reached government-controlled area, were photographed and processed by the security forces and taken to IDP camps. In the case of those forcibly moved to Trincomalee, often ordered to get into buses without notice, they were beaten by the security forces, parted from children who were at school, and told that if they remained their huts would be bombed or if caught on the road in Batticaloa with a Trincomalee ID, they face an uncertain future.\" This is how, Sir, refugees who had been driven out from their homes went to Batticaloa as refugees and were in various refugee camps for internally displaced people, were compelled or forced to return to Trincomalee.",

    "text": "Another very interesting, very revealing, part is on page 17 of their Report. It states, I quote: The GA Trincomalee has ordered all Muslims displaced around Kinniya and Mutur since 1990 to be resettled in their villages. 200 Muslim families displaced from Arafanagar, which lies in the new HSZ between Kattaiparichchan and Sampoor are being resettled. Meanwhile Tamils are not being resettled. It further states, I quote: Fostering Tamil-Muslim Enmity has been a constant strategy of the security establishment since 1985. Another element in the engineering is, the GA Trinco absolutely forbids any humanitarian agency from providing support to IDPs whom he does not recognize as IDPs. All such cases we learn are Tamils who have a history of violent displacement going back to 1985. There are a number of scattered cases of Tamil IDPs (e.g. 50 families in Thampalakamam) who do not get any assistance. Humanitarian agencies were not treated in this manner by former GAs from the civil service. In this Report they go on to say, Sir, I quote: From the time security forces captured Sampoor, they have looted the place, levelled houses and started building roads through paddy fields according to reports we have received as though it were no concern of the civilians and without any formal procedure. That such practices are a crime against humanity, if they are aware of it, is regarded a minor inconvenience. You can imagine, Sir, the extent to which these people have had to suffer. They have posed this question, Sir, in the course of this Report. I quote further: A fundamental question arises, if a person by being a Tamil is a threat to the Sri Lankan State, what alternative arrangement is there for the Tamils? If Tamils can be driven out of their ancestral homes in this way because they are Tamils and because they are perceived as being a threat to the Sri Lankan State, what alternative arrangement is there for Tamils? - [Interruption.]",

    "text": "( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Hon. Members should realize that these 300,000 people who were displaced and who fled in the course of the aerial bombardment and multibarrel rocket fire were not terrorists. They were Tamil civilians, men, women and children. I do not think Lord Buddha would have wanted them to be treated in this way and the Dhamma that the Lord Buddha practised would not have wanted them to be treated in this way. What I have been referring to is the way in which this 300,000 Tamil civilians, men, women and children have been treated. I quote from page 28 of the Report: We examine the status of the Mutur East/ Sampoor displaced more closely. The Governments position of the people of Sampoor and Mutur-East has been confusingly ambivalent. The President said on 4th September, 2006 that they recaptured Sampoor purely for the benefit of the people. Speaking to the Daily Mirror (5th September 2006), the Military Spokesman, Brigadier Prasad Samaraginghe categorically stated that the threat posed by the LTTE to the Trincomalee harbour and the adjoining naval base was no more following the successful operation involving the three forces.He added that once the area was cleared the civilians could resettle in the next few days. That is what Brigadier Samarasinghe said. That is what President, Mahinda Rajapaksa said. Going on further Sir, I quote: Two things follow from what we have pointed out earlier and what the Military Spokesman confirmed. There is no imperative military or security reason why the displaced civilians should be denied the homes and they were compelled to leave their own territory by being shelled all the way to Batticaloa. Therefore, Sir, the point I want to raise is, if as they say they have captured Sampur and Mutur East and it is under the Government control and the Army has moved in there, the LTTE and their artillery cannot go back to Sampur and Mutur. The area is now under the control of the armed forces. Why are these poor Tamil civilians who had lived there for generations and centuries being prevented from going back? They have cleared the landmines in Vakarai, Kathiraveli and within two or three months, the people have been resettled. Here you say, \"Landmines have still not been cleared\". Why not? We do not know. I might mention to you, Sir, that there was some action taken by these people from these areas. I first refer to a letter dated 18th July, 2007 and I am tabling* only the first page of that letter.",

This letter was sent; there was a reminder sent, but there has been no response from Major General Parakrama Pannipitiya to this letter. I would request, Sir, that you direct that this letter, which I tabled, be included in Hansard at the end of my speech. You might kindly make an order to that effect. I will then refer, Sir, to a case where three persons went to the Supreme Court and filed Fundamental Rights Applications to resettle on these lands. Unfortunately, we were not given leave to proceed. But in the course of that hearing, which was a matter taken up before the Hon. Chief Justice and two other Judges of the Supreme Court, this is what has been recorded in the journal entry. I quote, Sir : The application relates to the order made by His Excellency the President in Government Gazette marked P7. That is the Government Gazette declaring Sampur and Mutur East area a High Security Zone. The matter has been dealt with in Supreme Court Fundamental Rights Application No. 218/2007. It further states, I quote: Deputy Solicitor General submits that steps are being taken for the resettlement of affected persons with due compliance of the internationally operative best practices for such process. Hence the Attorney at Law for the Petitioners or any person who is interested in the rights of such persons may make representations to the Deputy Solicitor General who would ensure that the matter is considered by the competent authority. Registrar is directed not to entertain any further applications with regard to the operation of the order produced marked P7, since the administrative processes should be given time to be properly implemented. I table*, Sir, a certified copy of this journal entry of the proceedings of the Supreme Court in case No. SC(FR) 219/2007 and I request that you direct it be included in HANSARD at the end of my speech. This, Sir, is the position of these people and these people want to be resettled in their own land. I might mention to you, Sir, that one of these people who went to the Supreme Court, in his Fundamental Rights Application, filed his deeds in regard to his property. His deeds went back to a Crown grant, which is more than hundred years old, from his family. This is their ancestral property; this is not something the State gave them. Maybe, there are some lands which the State gave them. But, a large extent of lands in this area are private properties owned by these people for generations and centuries. They had built houses on those lands. They were living there peacefully, carring on their occupations: farming and fishing. They had livestock; they had their",

They have lost everything today and they are in a state of utter penury, not being looked after by the Government. According to the report of the UTHR, it would seem that the actions of the Government were deliberate, that the actions of the Government were carried out in such a way that these people would not return to their lands, that the Government before launching its operation had made a decision that these people will not be permitted to return and that is why they were driven out in this way. And there was no reason for them to be driven out in this way. Any idea of settling these people elsewhere, Sir, in my submission, must be abandoned. These people must get back to their natural environment, to their own lands and properties in which they have lived for generations and centuries and they must be able to carry on their lives there because this area is now free of the LTTE. There are no heavy artillery guns of the LTTE there. The army, you say, is in control and if the army is in control, the LTTE cannot return there and unless you look upon every Tamil in this country as a terrorist or an LTTEer, you cannot stop these people going back. They must go back to their lands and properties. That is my very humble, but firm demand from the Government on the Floor of this House. What is the position today, Sir? It is something that we have to look at. I want to read, Sir, from certain reports which had been filed by some journalists of repute. I think I must put this on record because these journalists have given a very graphic description of the position of these people in these areas today and I think, Sir, that must be brought out. The position, according to what these people say, is deplorable. Might I read, Sir, from an article which appeared in the Daily Mirror of 6th of August, 2007. It states as follows, I quote: The fact that the authorities have failed to provide livelihoods means that no resettlement programme can be successful. The people insist that till a means of living is in place, just dumping them in lands to satisfy larger political goals will not suffice. It goes on to say, I quote: Government plans to hold elections have also failed to increase faith in the people. They do not believe Karuna cadres will allow anyone else to contest, leave alone win. People fear a bloodbath once campaigning starts. No one believes a free and fair election can take place with the militant presence of Karuna cadres. Might I read another article, Sir, which has been written by yet another reputed Sinhalese journalist. All these persons, whose articles I am quoting from, are Sinhalese journalists. They are not persons who can be said to have any bias against the Sinhalese or against the Government or any bias in favour of the LTTE. This is what is said in an article in the Daily Mirror of 6th August, 2007. This is an article written by Shakuntala Perera. I quote: The political victory of liberating the East and weakening the LTTE has done little to help the ground situation. The plight of the people remains unchanged.

She says, I quote: What is sadder still is that there isn't even anything on an interim basis. There is nothing on ground to even suggest that the government has even begun a proper resettlement programme. You talk big about all types of programmes being carried on and people going there, visiting there but here this lady says, I quote: There is nothing on ground to even suggest that the government has even begun a proper resettlement programme. Aside from merely dumping the people wherever it suits them politically, there is little to prove the governments ambitious programme on paper. In its present form, the East is the perfect breeding ground for terrorism. No one could blame anyone suffering the trauma of the war turning towards either of the militant groups for refuge. The people feel neglected and ignored by the State to feel desolate enough to turn towards a terrorist group for survival. I am not saying it. Shakuntala Perera, a Sinhalese journalist who has no reason to say anything against the Government and the armed forces, who has gone there and seen for herself, is saying it. She says further, I quote: \"Denied the dignity of the basic human rights, the people would be far from ready to face any political process. The elections are the last thing on the minds of the people in this scenario. They strongly believe that the presence of Karuna cadres in their present form will be a threat to any free and fair election. In this situation they refuse to trust the outcome of any election.\" There is another article written by Tisaranee Gunasekera, yet another independent journalist who writes for the \"Sunday Island.\" This appeared in the \"Sunday Island\" of August 19th, 2007. She says, I quote: \"The international community is concerned about the indifference we display towards our minorities. And according to media reports even the Eastern Muslims are beginning to feel disenchanted with the reality of 'liberation'; there seems to be a growing sense of alienation, of insecurity which bodes ill for the future of the province and the country.\" She, in another paragraph, Sir, very significantly says, I quote: \"The lack of interest in the protection and welfare of Eastern Tamils/Muslims can be explained by concluding that for the regime and its supporters, nation is coterminous with Sinhala/Sinhala Buddhist race....\" I repeat, \".....nation is coterminous with Sinhala/Sinhala Buddhist race and patriotism means promoting and defending Sinhala/Sinhala Buddhist interests.\" I think people must stop preaching and begin practising true Buddhism in this country if we want to have peace in this country. And if we want to have development and prosperity for all our people in this country, I think people must stop talking about Buddhism, talking about protecting Buddhism and start practising Dharma. As Lord Buddha preached, start practising righteousness, start practising justice by all the people who are living in this country, otherwise you are not being a Buddhist; you are being anything but a Buddhist.",

    "text": "ground. Despite the growing criticisms and restrictions on the humanitarian agencies it is difficult to think of the fate of the IDPs without their presence. Their assistance provides a much needed life line to the hundreds of thousands left displaced. It further states, I quote: \"Moves by certain political organizations to settle Sinhala families within Muslim villages is also a very sensitive issue in the area. The people see through a 'political agenda' of colonization that they don't approve of and vow to fight back against. They maintain that the authorities were threatening the lives of these innocent families by dumping them in the middle of a very angry community. They allege moves were on to change the ethnic composition. In Mutur there is a 52% Muslim population, a 47% Tamil and 1% Sinhalese. Member of the Mutur Pradeshiya Sabha M. Regis claims that the Government has settled 25 Sinhala families already.\" Might I quote, Sir, from another article which appeared in the \"Daily Mirror\" of 7th August, 2007 written by Mr. Jehan Perera who is a reputed journalist. He says, I quote: Instead of security and democracy, I saw a continuing high level of insecurity, little democracy and no evidence at all of economic development. Belying the government claims on political platforms and in the government controlled media that normalcy and reconstruction are, and will soon be, the features of the liberated East, I saw a present picture of utter misery that spread through at least two of the three districts in the East, the only exception being Ampara at the bottom of the Eastern Province and farthest from the North Mr. Jehan Perera in his article further says, I quote: President Mahinda Rajapaksa is presently stomping the rich electoral grounds of the South affirming his governments determination to continue with the war and militarily vanquish the LTTE in the North, as it has done in the East. On the other hand, the costs of this war are bound to be much higher in the North than in the East. The North has always been the stronghold of the LTTE. The question of the cost of the war will surface in full measure with any government onslaught on the LTTE in the North. Once again there will be massive displacement of people, as occurred in the East, and very likely on a larger scale. The homes that people have built and protected over generations will be destroyed, and their properties looted, as they were in the East. \"......their properties looted, as they were in the East.\" Our houses were demolished, Sir. Our doors and windows were removed; our roof materials were removed; copperware, brassware in our houses were removed. Members of Parliament have complained to me and I even contacted His Excellency the President on the phone over some of these matters. Our houses were looted and that is what Mr. Jehan Perera says will happen in the North. He goes on to further say, Sir, I quote: War in the North should only be a last resort. The country is not an abstract idea to be fought for, but a living organism comprising all of its citizens. Any government that deliberately pursues a military solution as its first option that leads to the eviction of hundreds of thousands of Sri Lankan citizens from their homes, and to the loss of their ancestral properties, will jeopardize its moral right to govern the country. It will be good for the Government to remember that. He further says, I quote: Before taking the drastic step of stepping up the war in the North, the Rajapaksa government has a duty to present a reasonable political package that could be the basis for a just solution to the ethnic conflict, and is acceptable to moderate Tamil opinion.",

Moves by certain political organizations.....\" What are these political organizations I want to know which are in alliance with the Government who are secretly engaging in a programme in the Eastern Province with the support of the Government? The Government is privy to that, the Government is conniving with them and these organizations are doing that, and this is what Shakuntala Perera says. I quote: \"'Sinhalisation' is a serious charge levelled against the Government. Moves by certain political organizations to settle Sinhala families within Muslim villages have only poured fuel to the sensitivities of the area. The plans have earned and aroused the wrath of the Muslim community. There is little security that even a military can provide to families just forced into the villages.\" She goes on to say in another paragraph, Sir. I quote: Changing administrative boundaries is another means through which the demography of the Eastern Province is allegedly being changed, since it impacts upon the ability of minority groups to influence the political processes in their local areas. Sir, I am not saying these things. I am quoting what had been written by independent journalists from the majority community who have clearly exposed the fact that sweet little, sweet nothing is being done for the displaced Tamil and Muslim people in the Eastern Province. They have been dumped in their villages and asked to fend for themselves. Sir, over 300 people were killed, a much larger number were injured, thousands of houses were damaged, people lost their farming equipment, they lost their fishing equipment, they lost their livestock and they lost their plantations. I want to ask you, has one cent been paid as compensation to anyone of these people? Not one cent has been paid as compensation to anyone of these people. I do not see the Ministers in charge of rehabilitation of the North and the East here. Why are they not here? We are having a Debate in regard to the situation in the North and the East. We are having a Debate in regard to the plight of the people in the Eastern Province, the people who were displaced. Why are these Ministers not here? Have you paid one cent as compensation to these people? You give them rice, you give them dhal, you give them sugar which you get from the World Food Programme. You give these things to people, drive them out of their lands and now say, You cannot go back. You can only go back to the areas to which we agree.\" This, Sir, is the height of audacity. This is something, Sir, which can never be tolerated and we would ask this Government to rethink about these questions. You have a military officer as the Government Agent in Trincomalee.

Have you got a list of the fishing equipment and the farming equipment that were destroyed? Are you in a position even to make an evaluation of what you must do in regard to these people? I am sorry, Sir. They are merely carrying on propaganda. I am told, Sir, that only in Vakarai, some boats and nets have been given to the people there. Nothing else has been done anywhere and what is worse is that you are preventing the INGOs and the NGOs from working in these areas. Why? You are not giving them relief and you do not want the INGOs and the NGOs to work because you do not want these people to be helpful to the Tamil victims. Is this fair? I do not think, Sir, this should continue. I think the Government must re-look the whole question, frame a comprehensive programme after proper consultation with relevant people and implement a programme by which people will be resettled on all the lands from which they were displaced. People can go back there, proper housing provided there, proper employment opportunities provided and they be paid compensation for the loss of their kith and kin. Pay compensation for the loss of livelihood potential and put them back on their feet. You are trying to make beggars of the Tamil people in order to drive them out of this country. Security can no longer be an issue insofar as resettlement is concerned because you have publicly stated that security is no longer an issue and that you are in total control of Sampur and the Mutur East area and that there can be no question therefore of the LTTE coming there particularly with their heavy artillery or their guns, or whatever, and therefore the people should go back. Now, Sir, I want to say a few words about the second limb of my Motion which deals with the question of the North-East merger and certain other things that are being done in the Eastern Province as of now. I want to say, Sir, with utmost respect, if Sri Lanka can be one single united country with an overwhelming Sinhala-speaking majority in all parts of the country and the country taken as a whole, other than the North-East, given the history of Tamil rule by Tamil kings and Tamil chieftains in the North-East until colonial conquest and even thereafter till the country was for the first time united administratively by the British for their administrative convenience in 1833 as per the Colebrooke recommendations, and given the fact that the Tamil-speaking people in the North-East are an overwhelming majority in the North-East just as much as our Sinhala-speaking brethren are an overwhelming majority in all other parts of the country, and given the fact particularly, that despite Sinhala colonization the Tamil people and our Tamil-speaking Muslim brethren are yet the majority in every one of the",

This is not a matter, Sir, which can be settled by a judicial decision, particularly when the decision pertains only to a procedural flaw. It is our submission that President Mahinda Rajapaksa is under an obligation both under national and international law, to give effect to a treaty signed by the sovereign Government of Sri Lanka with the sovereign Government of India. He is also under an obligation, particularly, in view of the clear commitments of his predecessors in office and their governments and his not having sought a mandate from the country to dismantle the merger, to deny the Tamil-speaking people, the Tamil people in particular, a longstanding political aspiration accepted by his predecessors in office and four successive governments of Sri Lanka. Merger, Sir, is the legitimate political aspiration of the Tamil people; a longstanding aspiration. It has got nothing to do with Tamil militancy or the LTTE. The Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact of 1957 accepted the merger. Regions created in the North and the East could amalgamate beyond provincial boundaries. This position was accepted by the late Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, the founder of the SLFP long before the birth of the",

Four successive presidents in Sri Lanka followed through the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement what Mr. Bandaranaike had accepted in 1957. President Mahinda Rajapaksa in my submission, Sir, should show stronger spine in dealing with this question. Tamil people cannot and will not give up this legitimate aspiration on which their future is totally dependent. What is the position of the international community in regard to this matter? I might refer very briefly to certain meetings that took place and certain statements made by international personalities. When President Mahinda Rajapaksa went to Havana, Cuba for the Non Aligned Summit in September 2006, he met with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his advisers in Havana, Cuba. That was when the action was pending in the Supreme Court and the judgment had not yet been delivered. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had made it perfectly clear to President Mahinda Rajapaksa that India did not want the merger to be dismantled in any way other than in accordance with the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement and President Mahinda Rajapakasa gave the assurance to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that he had instructed the Attorney-General to go into court and ensure that the merger was sustained. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh also communicated to President Mahinda Rajapaksa that if the merger was dismantled in a manner contrary to the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement, India would keep all its options open. That was the discussion that took place between the Prime Minister of India and President Mahinda Rajapaksa in Havana, Cuba in September 2006 at the time of the Non Aligned Summit. There was yet another significant statement, Sir, made by the Co-Chairs when they met in Brussels on 12th September, 2006, before the judgment was delivered. The Co-Chairs in that statement stated that \"there should be no change to the specific arrangements for the North and the East which could endanger the achievement of peace. The legitimate interest and aspirations of all communities including the Tamil, Muslim and the Sinhala communities, must be accommodated as part of a political settlement.\" That was what was said in Brussels, Sir. The Assistant Secretary for State for South Asia and Central Asian Affairs of the State Department, United States of America, Richard Boucher was in Sri Lanka just after the judgment in October 2006 and had a press interview on 20th October, 2006. He was asked two questions by an Indian journalist; one in regard to the LTTE and the second in regard to the Supreme Court judgment. We have this week the judgment on de-merger and it has caused a great deal of concern among various sections here, did it figure in your talks? That was the question posed by the journalist to Richard Boucher and the answer given by Boucher was on these lines. The merger for many years has now been one of the fundamental assumptions of the peace process. It is one of the fundamental assumptions of the whole negotiations",

I do not have any formula for that. But it is a very fundamental issue. In my discussion with various people there is an understanding of how important it is to the negotiation process and it needs to be dealt with in that context. This is what, Sir, Richard Boucher stated. Then, Sir, we have the statement issued by the Co-Chairs. At the end of their meeting in Washington DC on 21st November, 2006, this is what the Co-Chairs said in their statement. \"At the same time the specific arrangement for the North and the East should not be disturbed as they are fundamental to continuing the dialogue to achieve an agreement, the legitimate interests and aspirations of all communities including the Tamil, Muslim and Sinhala communities must be accommodated as part of a political settlement. Sir, we had a meeting with President Mahinda Rajapaksa on 16th November 2006, on his invitation. We discussed this matter with him fully and subsequently in confirmation of our meeting I wrote to him on 20th November, 2006. I will not replace the whole letter on record. But I will just read the last three paragraphs. I quote: We also pointed out to you, that you could without difficulty muster the required support in Parliament to cure the defect pointed out in the judgement of the Court. Since meeting with you, we have met with Hon. Ranil Wickramasinghe MP, Leader of the Opposition who has assured us that his party would extend to any such legislative measure to validly restore the status quo ante, the fullest support. Many other parties will extend to you the fullest support. You will definitely receive overwhelming support, to have the required legislative measure enacted. We also need to point out that the constitution of the Northern and Eastern Provinces as one unit, relates to the basic fundamental rights of the Tamil speaking peoples, and is also intended to attenuate the injustice meted out to the Tamil speaking peoples in the Eastern Province, by the Sri Lankan State, since independence. This basic fundamental right cannot be set at naught by any reference to Tamil militancy. It must not be forgotten that such an arrangement was contemplated even in the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayagam Pact of 1957, long before the birth of Tamil militancy. Any effort to use the technical flaw referred to in the judegment of the Court, to dismantle the constitution of the North-East as one unit, in accordance with the provisions of the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement, would only mean that the Tamil speaking people are being denied a basic fundamental right recognized by the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement; that the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement itself is being disregarded; that the unjust gains brought about by the Sri Lankan State since independence in the Eastern Province, so as to disproportionately benefit the Sinhala people is sought to be retained, and that the Government is not concerned about the Tamils concluding that they have once again been cheated. It is my duty to point out that such an unjust course of action cannot bring about peace. I appeal to you to do the correct thing, by taking corrective action to restore the status quo ante pertaining to the constitution of the Northern and Eastern Provinces as one unit, and thereby honour and implement the Indo-Lanka Agreement.",

In the course of that interview he was asked by the person who interviewed him, \"At this stage, what would you feel is the best solution to the North-East conflict?\" North-East had then become a reality. President, Jayewardene brought about the merger. He knew that the North-East was a reality and what was his answer? \"The federal system\". President, Jayewardene with all his experience, as an elder statesman in this country who was responsible for battling the LTTE in the earlier years, who had dealt with Mr. Chelvanayakam, who was responsible for Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, who was a signatory to the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord - when he was asked, \"What is your solution today to the North-East conflict?\", his answer was, \"Federalism\". The North-East had become a reality. President, Mahinda Rajapaksa must acquaint himself with these historical realities and not live in a world of his own and not live under the influence of some of his recently acquired alliance partners.",

In Kappalthurai, along the Trincomalee-Kandy road, adjoining the Kappalthurai junction, on the left hand side, on a land earmarked for an economic zone, land has been taken and 300 houses are to be constructed for ex-servicemen or servicemen - along the Trincomalee-Kandy road, on the main road in Kappalthurai, hardly six miles from Trincomalee town. In a place called Rottawewa, that is an ancient Muslim village to which village I have been as a little child. I remember there used to be an old man called Abu Sally because he was not only my client but I had known him very well. I used to go to that village with my relations who were Government officials at that time. Their land has been taken, 600 or 800 acres, I am not very sure, the land is being cleared - on the Trincomalee-Anuradhapura Road - and action is being taken I am told - to construct 5000 houses for ex-servicemen or servicemen. What is happening? You are going back to all the old practices what you did and stopped some years ago. You are trying to redo and where will you end up? Where will you go? Five thousand houses for servicemen or ex servicemen in Rottawewa - a Muslim village adjoining an ancient Tamil village called Panankaddimurippu - are being constructed and the land is presently being cleared. In Kinniya where the Muslims are 99 per cent in an area called Sundankadu coming within the AGA's Division of Kinniya, Sinhalese families from Sooriyapura, Jayanthipura, Pansalgoda and Wan Ela are sought to be settled in this land. The biggest problem that the Muslim people have is that they have no land. But you are trying to take their land and settle Sinhalese families. Are you doing the right thing?",

    "text": "Then, Sir, you are taking away land from the Tamil people. You are giving land to army personnel. You are trying to give land to the Sinhalese people. What is happening to the Tamil people? There was a land in a place called Linganagar. The EPDP Member, my good Friend, Hon. Douglas Devananda, had settled some people sometime ago at Lingernagar and then those people were to be evicted. I interviewed President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and then she instructed General Daluwatta who was then the Army Commander to meet with me and I inspected the area with some army officials and we decided that a major part of the land would be left because the Army was concerned about security. I appreciated their concerns and about 15 acres of land was to be given to Tamil people and 103 people who has lived there were chosen, and it was approved and the Army agreed . The cases filed against these people in court were withdrawn. Permits were written out for 53 of these 106 people and permits were to be handed over. Then suddenly a military gentleman became the new Government Agent in Trincomalee. He has stopped the issue of the permits. People have constructed houses there. They have dug wells there. They have lived there for fourteen to fifteen years. This matter was gone into by Government and the matter was resolved. A decision was taken to identify 15 acres and to be given to these people. Hundred and three people were identified, land was surveyed, cases filed against them in court were withdrawn, 53 permits have been written out and after that the Government Agent in Trincomalee in his wisdom goes and stops the project and the whole thing is stopped. I would say this type of thing cannot go on. The other thing is, Sir, which I am very concerned about is that there is a proposal, I am told, to create a new district between Trincomalee and Mullaitivu . I want to place on record, Sir, for the information of the House and for the Members, a plan of this area of the Trincomalee District also showing part of the Mullaitivu District. The villages in Trincomalee - by the name of Pulmoddai, a predominantly Muslim village - a village called Thennaimarawadi from where the people were",

There are people who are going and surrendering to the Human Rights Organization in Jaffna asking that they be remanded in jail because they are afraid that they will be killed if they stay outside. I have with me a paper report which says that a family of five people have gone and recently asked that they be taken over and kept in the jail and they have in fact complied. So far there are about sixty five people who are in that position and who have been remanded. Every other day, people are being killed in every part of the North and the East.

    "text": "I refer to the discussion we had with you on the 16th instant in regard to the above. You will appreciate that this is the most basic issue in the evolution of a negotiated political solution to the Tamil question. We impressed upon you that the Northern and Eastern provinces were constituted as one unit, on the fundamental and incontrovertible basis, that the said provinces were the areas of historical habitation of the Tamil speaking people. This fact accepted in the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement signed by Shri. Rajiv Gandhi Prime Minister of India and Mr. J. R. Jayawardene President of Sri Lanka on 29th July 1987. This we submit is an international treaty which Sri Lanka is bound to honour and implement. Under the 13th amendment to the Constitution and the Provincial Councils Act, President J. R. Jayawardene had constituted the two provisions as one unit. After the constitution of the two provinces as one unit, he provided for the poll to determine whether the said two provinces should continue as one unit or be separate. The date for the poll has been extended by Presidents R. Premadasa, D. B. Wijetunga, and Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga for over a period of 18 years. Three successive Presidents have thereby accepted the constitution of the Northern and Eastern Provinces as one unit by the President. J. R. Jayawardene. They thereby honoured and implemented the Indo Sri Lanka Agreement singed between the Heads of two States. The Supreme Court has held that the amendment of the Provincial Councils Act by President J. R. Jayawardene, by an Emergency Regulations is invalid, and therefore of no effect in law, and that consequently the proclamation pertaining to the constitution of the two Provinces as one unit is invalid. The Supreme Court has not held that the provisions of the Indo Sri Lanka Agreement or the legal provisions pertaining to the constitution of the two Provinces as one unit are invalid. It only questions the procedure adopted by President J. R. Jayawardene to constitute the two provinces as one unit.",

In fact, that gentleman once told me that he had known me very well in the good old days, in the 1970s when he was a young officer in Thiriyai and I was a Member of Parliament at that point of time. But his actions are not towards helping the civilians. He is trying to convert the entire civilian administration into a militarized set up which is not good. So, I would earnestly request you to kindly talk to the President and see whether you should replace that Government Agent with a very competent civilian officer.",

But I do not know of any such decision apart from the Grama Sevaka Divisions, and there again it will be done after a Committee is appointed and after taking the views of everybody concerned.

There are not five thousand servicemen in Trincomalee now. In another place they are constructing 300 houses. Earlier on I read in the newspapers that there was a massive housing programme contemplated in Horawpatana. Why are you constructing houses in Trincomalee for Sinhalese people? The soldiers are all Sinhalese people. Are you not stirring a hornet's nest? Are you not creating trouble? Must this not be stopped? If you want peace in this country, can we have peace by doing things like this? Now land is being cleared. Surveyors are surveying the land. I am told that a decision has been taken. I would appeal to you as a senior politician to talk to the President. In fact I would like to discuss the matter with the President myself. Stop this type of thing. It is not good.",
