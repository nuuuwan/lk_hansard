SELECT COMMITTEE ON ELECTORAL REFORMS ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) , : 2006 04 , 2007 03 , 96 2008 30 . , . . Question put, and agreed to. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) , . , , . '' , , 15 , '' . , , , , . BBCSinhala.com . I quote: "COI probes deliberately delayed"

, I quote: "Sri Lankan authorities are accused of delaying a crucial amendment to make Presidential Commissions enquiries efficient. Chairman of the Presidential Commission of Investigation (COI) to investigate serious human rights violations, retired Judge Nissanka Udalagama said the inquiry is being delayed due to technical problems. According to the Commission of Inquiry Act, Justice Udalagama said, any investigation could not be continued even if a single member of the panel falls to appear for a hearing." . "The Commission has proposed an amendment which was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers and passed by the Supreme Court. The amendment has suggested to change the Act so that the investi-gation could be continued with half of the panel members attending." . It is now forwarded to the Speaker seeking Parliamentary ap-proval, Justice Udalagama told BBC Sandeshaya. However, the former Supreme Court Judge accused the Parliament of delaying approving the amendment citing different reasons. It appears that the matters does not seem to be a priority for them as they kept coming out with different reasons not to debate it now. Now they say it will be delayed due to Budget Debate, an annoyed Justice Udalagama said. The COI expected to initiate public inquiries on 20 November ex-pecting that amendments would be passed by then. We have foreign experts - from Canada and Australia for example - also participating in the enquiries. We cannot say investigations cannot be conducted due to the absence of a Commissioner, he told BBCSin-hala.com. He said international community might be suspicious that the Gov-ernment is deliberately delaying the amendment in order to delay COIs investigations. "The COI entrusted with investigating 15 serious rights violations including the killing of former FM Lakshman Kadirgamar, former MP Joseph Pararajasingham, 17 aid workers in Mutur and five students in Trincomalee. 'Some might think that there is a deliberate attempt to delay our investigations,' Justice Nissanka Udalagama said." , . . . , . , , . . , . . . . ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) , , .

( - ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella - Minister of Foreign Em-ployment Promotion and Welfare) Sir, I think his point of Order, in fact is misleading the House because when the complaint was made, even the STF personnel were arrested. They were kept in remand custody but there would have been some fundamental rights from their side for keeping them without charges. That is why the Commission of Inquiry was initiated. You are completely wrong on that. They were remanded and then, after they were remanded there was - , , , . Com-mission of Inquiry . , Hon. Mem-ber, you are misleading the entire House on that. They were remanded, there were no evidences and that is why the Commission of Inquiry was initiated. ( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) Sir, he is again misleading the House. . , The Minister is again misleading the House. This is not true. Special Task Force . , . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Chairman)

Hon. member, can you conclude your speech, please? ( ) (The Hon. Annamalai Nadesu Sivasakthi) , , , . . [.. 12.26] . . ( ) ( () . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala- Minister of Higher Education)

Mr. Chairman, before I enter into a discussion of the role of this important Ministry in the sphere of social welfare and development, I would like to congratulate the Hon. Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva for taking certain bold decisions in the area of health policy in this country. Bold decisions and realistic policies are necessary to project a realistic health policy for this country which would make a noteworthy contribution to the process of social and economic development in this country. The welfare-oriented style of development, which began in the 1930s with the introduction of the Donoughmore Constitution has had impressive results, for instance, in 1947, Mr. Chairman, the social welfare expenditure of Sri Lanka was 56.1 per cent of the government revenue. In this way, Sri Lanka evolved into a welfare State and both health and education became vital components of the Sri Lankan model of social welfarism. Health policy is an important issue in any country. Mr. Chairman, take for instance, Britain where the British Labour Party in the period of the former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, tried to reform the national health service, the NHS and this created a crisis within the Labour Party. Today, just at this given moment, Mrs. Hilary Clinton as an aspirant to the US Presidency is talking of the need to make more provisions for healthcare. In other words, health policy has become a major campaign issue in the United States just at this moment. What are the objectives of a comprehensive policy of healthcare and nutrition? In my view, Mr. Chairman, a realistic health policy should aim at the following.

(1) To assist the individual to remain healthy.

(2) To provide equal access to health services.

(3) To provide equality of entitlement to health services.

(4) To provide a broad range of services of high standard.

2991 2992

[ . . ]

All resources provided by the Government need to be devoted to the maintenance and promotion of public health services both in the curative and preventive healthcare. For instance, nutrition issues are primarily linked to primary poverty. This is our own experience and therefore, only with the introduction of proper social policies that the issue of poverty could be tackled. Poor social conditions especially in our part of the world affect the quality of life and health. In our system equality of entitlement has been guaranteed without restriction by age, social class, sex, race or religion. In that respect, Sir, our health system is a fully-fledged social welfare system, and this is prevalent in both education and health because of which we have a powerful human resource base which could be utilized for social and economic development. Equality of access though provided is not available in all parts of the country and the Hon. Minister, with a set of realistic policies, is trying to rectify this imbalance in the system. Rural areas need to be provided with better hospitals. ( ) (The Chairman)

Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees will take the Chair now. , [ ] .

, , [ . ] . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. RAMALINGAM CHANDRASEKAR] took the Chair. . .

( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala)

Mr. Deputy Chairman, the estate population needs to be provided with better hospitals. The Government has taken the correct decision by taking over the hospitals network in the plantation sector in which you are associated with and it is only through education and health that the economic and social backwardness of the plantation community could be improved. Most of the good hospitals with modern services are found in Colombo and other urban centres. The quality of care in the Provincial hospitals needs to be raised and model hospitals like the one at Mahiyangana, which I visited, should be developed throughout the country. What I am trying to advocate is an equitable health system which can provide access to all individuals especially the poor, the marginalized and the disadvantaged in the country. The Hon. Minister, in formulating a realistic health policy, has given enough thought to this question. Though the Constitution of Sri Lanka does not recognize the access to health as a right, all governments in the past, have offered universal coverage. But the fact remains that vulnerable sectors of the population do not get proper health care,

and I want the Hon. Minister to look into this aspect as well. These people are in the rural areas of the country. Today health care services could be divided into two sectors - the State sector and the private sector. Nearly 56 per cent of the people use the State sector and the private medical institutions are used only by the rich 20 per cent in the country. This is in relation to out-patient care. I am not referring to in-patient care. In Sri Lanka health care delivery is determined on the basis of the availability of medical personnel and paramedics. The availability of the relevant drugs is yet another problem. That is why I am advocating a national drug policy for the country. The following figures show the imbalance in the availability of medical specialists: Colombo District has 195 Specialists, Kandy - 87 Specialists, Galle - 69 Specialists, Kurunegala - 31 Specialists, Anuradhapura - 19 Specialists, Ratnapura - 25 Specialists, Badulla - 27 Specialists, Polonnaruwa - 6 Specialists, Nuwara Eliya - 5 Specialists, Hambantota - 6 Specialists, Ampara - 2 Specialists and Moneragala - 5 Specialists. See the nature of distribution of the Specialists throughout the country in the different districts. This imbalance needs to be immediately corrected. Even primary care facilities are poor in some of these areas. The Post-Graduate Institute of Medicine which comes within my purview should increase the intake. We propose to provide it with more facilities so that they can produce more specialists within a given time frame. In addition, we have set up two new Faculties: Allied Medical Sciences at the University of Peradeniya and the University of Colombo to produce more allied medical personnel. Training of nurses through an academic degree is to be handed over to the universities in 2009 and this programme initially is to be set up at the University of Peradeniya and the University of Jayawardenepura. It is with this programme that we propose to enhance the quality of nurses training and a professional degree is to be given to the nurses. This would certainly enhance the quality of nursing education in this country and through the universities we can produce professional nurses to meet both the local and the international demand. Primary health care, Sir, in any country has an impact on poverty reduction and the development of human capital. As I mentioned earlier, we have a good network of health institutions providing primary, secondary and tertiary health care services. But there are enormous variations in terms of facilities and infrastructure. Policy initiatives are necessary in this sector to improve the infrastructure. In the area of preventive care, Sri Lanka, compared to other countries in the Asian region, has comparatively a good system, which, in my view, needs further expansion. Inequality in the distribution of services needs to be immediately corrected. Yet another important matter which invites our attention is the access to medicine.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) -

. . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala)

Give me one more minute, Sir. In this sphere, it is my view that the country needs a national drug policy. Drugs are very expensive and the prices vary from one pharmacy to another. I am speaking on this matter as a layman. Some form of control is necessary in this particular area. Expenditure on medicines accounts for a major proportion of the cost of health services. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) , .

. . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala)

It has been estimated that one-third of the people are unable to purchase medicines on a regular basis because of the escalating prices in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka, I am told, spends nearly Rs.500 million for medicines for outpatients and 60 per cent of it is dispensed through national hospitals. The Hon. Minister needs to be congratulated for gazetting the regulations pertaining to the control of private medical institutions. The Private Medical Institutions (Registration) Act, No. 21 of 2006 was a vital piece of legislation, a fundamental piece of legislation. The proper implementation of the regulations would improve the quality of services and the interests of the patient would be guaranteed. Thank you, Sir. [. . 12.38]

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Chairman, we are here today to discuss the most important subject that the House should be concerned about, the of health of the Nation. There are two parts to

an individuals personality, one deals with material concerns and the other deals with spiritual concerns. Spiritual concerns deal with God and it is dealt elsewhere. Today, we are dealing with material concerns of which health is the most important part. To deal with this, we have as our Minister the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, a most competent and efficient person. I will be coming to the distinctive contributions made by him later. The World Health Organization established in 1948 gave a very comprehensive definition to health. According to that, health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. Unfortunately, the mandate vested with our Minister deals only with the second part, the absence of disease or infirmity. It is the negative aspect of health. The positive aspect of ensuring physical, mental and social well-being is vested in numerous other Ministries. This is evident from the estimates of expenditure Then, the programming relationship which would link the negative and positive aspects too is not evident in the estimates of expenditure. The World Health Organization, of which we are a member, has three responsibilities: one of being a clearing-house and a research providing body; the other of helping the countries in the control of epidemic and endemic diseases and the third of supporting the efforts of countries in improving public health administration. I suggest that the Ministry seek the help of the WHO to build a wider network of programming information to provide a better understanding of the complex linkages that health has with other aspects of the society. But, in spite of the conceptual limitations that our Minister faces he is doing an excellent job. I like to speak of his efforts to improve health conditions of the people in the Trincomalee District. Trincomalee is a district which is affected by two shortcomings, one of extreme poverty and the other of poor geographical conditions which make communications extremely impossible because it is a part of the Mahaweli Delta. For the latter reason, health facilities have to be provided in the Trincomalee District not based on population density but on geographical conditions. Our Minister is helping us having understood our difficulties. The Trincomalee Hospital has been upgraded to a general hospital. Mutur, Kinniya and Kantali hospitals have been upgraded to base hospitals. A policy decision has been taken to upgrade the Pulmoddai hospital to a district hospital. I must thank the Hon. Minister who helped to upgrade these hospitals. I must thank the Hon. Minister for appointing two doctors to the Puttalam and Mannar hospitals. However, we are still in short of three more doctors and I urge the Hon. Minister to appoint three doctors to those hospitals.

I would like to speak a few words about the drug policy. Professor Senaka Bibile pioneered in the introduction of a new drug policy. Up to then the drug policy had been determined by pharmaceutical companies the world over. Drug manufacture is an extremely risky venture. It will take at least ten years for a drug to be introduced to market once initial experiments start. In the meanwhile, about 95 per cent of experiments on drugs fall by the wayside. Drug companies, therefore, concentrate on the manufacture of drugs for the day-to-day health problems such as erectile dysfunction, cosmetic enhancement, et cetera. They do not manufacture drugs for fatal diseases in the world such as AIDS. If they do, these drugs would be extremely expensive and some of them would be more expensive in Sri Lanka than any other country. The State Pharmaceuticals Corporation of Sri Lanka was set up to deal with these issues by Prof. Senaka Bibile. It has established a wide network of Osu Salas. A few more Osu Salas in the Trincomalee District would be most welcome. I also wish that the SPC deals with a wider prescription of generic drugs. As it is, our poor people are the victims of well-financed advertisement campaign for branded drugs which have the same efficacy as generic drugs. Doctors are part of this network. Our poor people would sell their property to safeguard their nearest and dearest where health issues are concerned. The SPC has an obligation to reverse this trend. Our Minister, probably, is in charge of the most difficult aspect of human resources in Sri Lanka ranging from specialists to technicians. Their withdrawal from services, has immediate effects on the patients. He, therefore, has to treat them with great delicacy, perhaps even overlooking some glaring shortcomings. With regard to management, sometimes in order to achieve the greater goal, short term effects have to be ignored. It is all a question of balance. Our Minister has the maturity to ensure this balance. While commending the work of our Minister, I support the Votes of the Ministry of Healthcare and Nutrition. . , . . ( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Minister, will you conclude your speech now

Sir, thank you for the opportunity given to me. I would like to say something regarding the problems faced by the Faculty of Applied Science at Buttala.

As one who has dealt with the student community regarding the demand for shifting the Faculty from Buttala to Sabaragamuwa, I fully agree that the Faculty has to be shifted to Belihuloya. I went to meet the lecturers and the students at Buttala and also at Belihuloya and later we had a discussion. I had three discussions with the student community and there was no dispute. A decision has been taken to shift the Faculty from Buttala to Belihuloya but the only problem was the opposition by the academics and the management of the Faculty of Applied Science at Buttala plus the management at Belihuloya. We set up an independent committee and we tried to accede to the demand of the student community, to shift the Faculty of Applied Science. The independent committee reported back saying that the available accommodation is not satisfactory. Anyway, today, we had a lengthy discussion ( ) (The Hon. Anura Dissanayake) , . . . 600 . 600 Faculty of Management building . . .. . ( ) (The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa) , . Today, we had a lengthy discussion. I got down the academics from Buttala plus Belihuloya and also I got down the contractors the two buildings, one for the Faculty of Management and the other far the Faculty of Agriculture. I requested them to expedite the completion of the two buildings by the end of February. So, now we are in a position to allocate those buildings used by the Faculty of Management and the Faculty of Agriculture at least by the 2nd of May, to shift the Applied Science Faculty from Buttala. That is the earliest I can do. I am prepared to talk with the student community and also to discuss with the Hon. Members of Parliament and solve this problem amicably. We will try our level best and you can co-operate with us. We also have to think of the release of the students who have been taken into custody because we cannot go on like that. There are a number of shortcomings as referred by the Hon. Anura Dissanayake. There are a number of problems faced by the university community. Our students are suffering. The underdeveloped universities have numerous problems. So, it has to be systematically designed and this problem solued. His Excellency the President entrusted this work to me and instructed me to go into the problem at Buttala. I visited the place. I spoke to the student community. So, the present situation is, today, we had a lengthy discussion while the student procession was going on, while the arrest was taking

place. We have now pressurized the contractors, the CECB and they have promised to complete the two buildings, one belonging to the Faculty of Management and the other to the Faculty of Agriculture. As soon as they finish we are prepared to shift the Faculty at Buttala to Belihuloya and also we have discussed about the accommodation for the lecturers, non-academic staff and all that. Even we are prepared to bring some caravans temporarily for the academic staff. So, I am prepared to talk with all of you. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Dissanayake) . . Faculty of Management 600 . building .
