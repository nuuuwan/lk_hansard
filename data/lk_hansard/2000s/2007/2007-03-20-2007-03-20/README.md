( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon.

In Erskine May Chapter 5 on the General view of the privilege of Parliament under What constitutes privilege, it states, I quote: Parliamentary privilege is the sum of the peculiar rights enjoyed by each House collectively as a constituent part of the High Court of Parliament, and by members of each House individually, without which they could not discharge their functions, and which exceed those possessed by other bodies or individuals. Then, under "Breach of privilege and 'contempt' ", it states, I quote: When any of these rights and immunities, both of the Members, individually, and of the assembly in its collective capacity, which are known by the general name of privileges, are disregarded or attacked by any individual or authority, the offence is called a breach of privilege, and is punishable under the law of Parliament. , . , 3 , 4 . Sections 3 and 4 of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act embodies the basic principle of privilege as laid down in Parliament. . Erskine May . In Chapter 10 on Breaches of privilege and contempts and under the sub title "CONTEMPT IN GENERAL", it states, I quote: "It would be vain to attempt an enumeration of every act which might be construed into a contempt, the power to punish for contempt being in its nature discretionary. Certain principles may, however, be collected from the Journals which will serve as general declarations of the law of Parliament. It may be stated generally that any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either House of Parliament in the performance of its functions, or which obstructs or impedes any Member or officer of such House in the discharge of his duty, or which has a tendency, directly or indirectly, to produce such results may be treated as a contempt even though there is no precedent of the offence." . One is the Strode's case. Strode . . . . . , , . In Strode's case, Strode was thrown into jail

1689 1690

[ ]

for bringing a Bill to ban tanneries. Someone intervened in the courts and he was thrown into jail. The Parliament passed another Act in order to free him. This was carried on. , then came the case of Sir John Eliot. 1641 . . . ? - King's Bench - . King's Bench . . , . Sir John Eliot's was a classic case where you find that a Member got up in the House of Parliament and criticized King Charles I. I need not tell you what exactly he said, but he was taken before the King's Bench Court which was manned by the King's judges and was imprisoned. The Parliament freed him. That was the beginning of the crisis which led to a civil war and the Parliament emerged victorious over the monarchy. , 1688 .

. . . [ ]

I am reading from a New Law Report. If the Hon. Member cannot read the New Law Report, that is not my fault.

It states, I quote:

The argument for the respondents based on section 3 of the Act, which is an adaptation of Article 9 of the Bill of Rights, is that their conduct was part of the proceedings of the House and cannot therefore be impeached or questioned except by the House itself. It is interesting also to notice that section 4,more or less in amplification of section 3, protects a member from liability to civil or criminal proceedings by reason of any matter or thing which he may have brought before the House by petition, bill, resolution, motion or otherwise, and that section 9 requires the Courts to take judicial notice of the privileges of the House. The first question which arises is whether the immunity conferred by sections 3 and 4 for proceedings in the House are in any way qualified by Part II of the Act. It is true that section 22 appears on its face to confer on the Supreme Court jurisdiction over all offences specified in the Schedule and that section 23 contemplates the possibility that the Court can convict a member of an offence under the Act. But does this contemplation amount to an expression of intention by the Legislature that the Court will have power to convict a member even in a case where his conduct would otherwise be protected by the freedom of speech, debate and proceedings conferred in Part I ? In page 423 he has made it very clear. .

Sir, I quote again: I pass now to the meaning of the term proceedings in Parliament. The Attorney-General has relied on statements and citations in May to the effect that proceedings mean the transaction of Parliamentary business, or what a member may say or do within the scope of his duties in the course of Parliamentary business or a part of a proceedings of the House in its technical sense i.e. the formal transaction of business with the Speaker in the Chair or in a properly constituted Committee. Obviously Article 9 of the Bill of Rights was intended to include within its scope business of the nature referred to in these citations. But was that all which was intended to be included? Was it not intended to include such acts as a giving of notice of a motion? Standing Order 24 of the House of Representatives requires notices of motion to be given in writing and to be handed to the Clerk when the House is sitting, or to be sent to or left at the Clerks office at any time. Is not then the handing or delivery to the Clerk of a written notice of motion a proceeding covered by the immunity? Moreover, I take it that the Standing Orders contemplate the possibility that a Member may not be able to write out his own motion and that he may therefore dictate his notices to a confidential stenographer or secretary. In my opinion such dictation, being an ordinary and even necessary mode by which busy men usually have documents prepared, would equally be covered by the immunity. To take a further example a member would not ordinarily give notice of some important motion in the House without first assuring himself that some other member will second the motion, and it would seem that a bona fide communication of the subject of his motion made to another member for this purpose will be protected as being a matter or thing brought before the House by motion -(Section 4 of the Act). May (at p.65) refers to a statement made in this connection by the Select Committee on the Official Secrets Act that, cases may easily be imagined of communications between one Member and another or between a Member and a Minister, so closely related to some matter pending in, or expected to be brought before the House, that, although they do not take place in the Chamber or a committee room, they form part of the business of the House, as, for example, where a Member sends to a Minister the draft of a question he is thinking of putting down, or shows it to another Member with a view to obtaining advice as to the propriety of putting it down or as to the manner in which it should be framed. Now, there is also another question. This was also repeated in Gomes Vs. M.H. Mohamed. There is another issue which has come up which is also relevant to this -

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , - ?

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) ... . , Sir, I further quote: The terms of section 9 of our Act, in my opinion, require a Judge to pose to himself not the question is the act of a member outside the scope of the immunity?, but rather the question is not the act of a member within the scope of the immunity?. In other words, sections 3 and 4 must receive a liberal construction wherever possible in favour of the plea of immunity. Now, did the Magistrate of Colombo take this view on Saturday? That is one of the most important issues that has come up. , , there were proceedings of Parliament. , .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . . Hon. Speaker, I would like to mention that when the Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi was produced before the Colombo Magistrate, the Magistrate should have taken judicial notice of the Kaduwela case. It was obvious that there was a case filed in the Kaduwela Courts earlier and the Colombo Magistrate should have taken judicial notice of that. There was a case filed in the Kaduwela Courts. He was discharged - [Interruption.] Hon. Speaker, I would like to refer to Article 13(2)of the Constitution. It states, I quote :

Every person held in custody, detained or otherwise deprived of personal . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) ?

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) 13 . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) It states, I quote, Every person held in custody, detained or otherwise deprived of personal liberty shall be brought before the judge of the nearest competent court .. Now, Sir, what is the nearest competent court? The nearest competent court is the Kaduwela Courts. He cannot be produced before the Colombo Magistrate. The course of action arose in Kaduwela. Everything was in Kaduwela. So how can the police - [Interruption.] No, this is a matter of privilege of the House. Sir, according to Article 13 -13 . . the Colombo Magistrate should have taken judicial notice of the case filed in Kaduwela where he was released even without a statement being taken. This is not a matter concerning the SLFP MPs or the UNP MPs. This is a matter concerning all of us. Therefore, I appeal to you to summon the Magistrate and to summon the police - [Interruption.] We can summon the Chief Justice also. , , , .

Speaker, as pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition, this Motion for a Select Committee is before you. It forms proceedings in Parliament. On a liberal interpretation of Sections 3 and 4 of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act even though rejected it is considered as being before Parliament. That is what the Hon. Leader of the Opposition mentioned. So, the Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi should have the right to come today and say, I have submitted a Motion for a Select Committee. I am not asking for an impeachment. Members of Parliament have a right to ask for an impeachment of the President. But he has been reasonable. He has not asked for an impeachment. He has only asked for a Select Committee. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Wimal Weerawansa) , , . , . , , ; ; . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) ? ? ( ) (The Hon. Wimal Weerawansa) . backup , ,

So, the Hon. Members of this House do not understand that we have no one to blame. I have to blame myself for putting people like this into Parliament. - [Interruption.]

Nevertheless, getting on to the issue raised by the Leader of the JVP Parliamentary Group, firstly, - I will put it in English - in 1989, backup cars were given to Ministers as Members of the Cabinet for security as of necessity by late President Premadasa. Secondly came the decision that Members of Parliament attached to Ministries should also be given vehicles. That system got expanded and abused as it went along. The start was during the UNP. It was for specific purposes but it got abused to the extent of not only Ministers, but also officials having a large number of vehicles.

The Secretary, Ministry of Defence, Public Security, Law and Order is focusing on the vehicles that have been lost. So, in that background, what we are saying is - on Thursday this Member was produced before the Magistrate's Court, Kaduwela - if there was anything more against him, he should have been taken to the Magistrate's Court, Kaduwela again, not anywhere else. That is the court of competent jurisdiction. They have recorded a statement without doing any further investigation. I read out an affidavit. They have taken the necessary documents from Augustin Motors. I think the police must do that. But, I think the police should have done all that before they asked him to be remanded. I am talking with a sense of responsibility. When all those documents are taken afterwards, we have to raise this issue because all these are proceedings of Parliament. If you want anything more, you can refer to the former Speaker Anura Bandaranaikes Ruling where matters were put to debate. That has come up again. It goes much further, specifying the expression "proceedings in Parliament". In page 10, his Ruling states, I quote: "Its primary meaning, as a technical parliamentary

term, signifies some formal action, usually a decision taken by the House in its collective capacity, and embraces all forms of business in which the House takes action and indeed the whole Parliamentary process, ......" So, the Member has given a Motion. If you do not put it in, he has the right to raise it here. We can discuss it. You can give a ruling. After the ruling, if necessary, the House can challenge it and at the end of it only the process is over. That was started by giving the Motion, which has been discussed. What we find is, this Member of Parliament, if there was sufficient evidence would have been remanded on Thursday. He was not remanded. Why did the CID take him to the Colombo Magistrate? We know in that background, already he has alleged in his statement that one of the witnesses has been held under detention orders. So, was it because the Member could not be held under detention orders? He was prevented from coming most probably because, from what I understand, he was to come today and raise the issue with you here in this Chamber. So, he was prevented from doing that by this act after he told the Magistrate. As stated in the Attorney-General v. Samarakkody case, the Magistrate has to find out what are the immunities of Parliament. It is not for the Member to go and say that. That is why we say that you have to go into this whole issue, call them up immediately and ask for the Member of Parliament to be released. The IGP, the DIG, the three police officers involved and if anyone in the AGs Department had given an opinion after Thursday, bring that officer also in. I understand that there has been no opinion given. But, if anyone has given an opinion after that, he has to be brought in to find out why it was done in this background? This is an insult to Parliament. That is all I said and I thought I will clarify as to why this came up. There has to be some action by Parliament while he is being tried there again by the Kaduwela Magistrate.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, I suggest that we first decide on this and then get on to the next item.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) Yes.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) But I also want to say that as far as we are concerned, we have not come under Section 5. We have come under Sections 3 and 4 where there is interference in the proceedings of Parliament. Therefore, there is a duty by courts and the police to keep the House informed. That is what I am basing my argument on. The normal practice is after an arrest you must inform the Hon. Speaker but here there is a proceeding. This has been affirmed in the Samarakkody Judgement and also by the Order given by the then Speaker, the Hon. Anura Bandaranaike. Now in this regard, if you are studying this, I suggest at least to ensure the security and the safety of that Hon. Member, that some of the Members of Parliament here be delegated to go to courts and come back and report to us as to what is happening. That is what we are going to do. That is what we should do. We are asking the Hon. Members on behalf of the Opposition to go to courts, come back and report here in the afternoon before the Hon. Speaker finalizes - [ ] , ? , !

2007 20 1719 1720

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I am going on the basis that this is an interference in proceedings. This Section -[Interruption.] Wait! This Section did not apply in the case of Vasudeva Nanayakkara or anyone else. Now, that is what you have to decide here after hearing us further. In the meantime - this was not done in any other case - we are raising a breach of privilege against the IGP, the DIG-CID, Director CID, Visvalingam and Indika Silva, the two IPP and the Magistrate of Colombo -[Interruption.] Wait! This has to be heard now. In such circumstances, at least we will ensure that some of the Hon. Members in the Opposition - if the Hon. Members of the Government are frightened to go to go into the Kaduwela Magistrates Court, see what is happening there and come back. I do not think he can be held there any more. Then we can proceed with this matter. I am asking some of our Members of Parliament in the Opposition to go there - some of them are lawyers - to look at what is happening. In addition, I am also sending a lawyer, the Secretary to the Leader of the Opposition to be there in courts. Thank you.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) - [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) We will report to Parliament as to what is happening there.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, all of them were taken in under the Emergency Regulations. This is under Sections 3 and 4.Let the Hon. Member address the Samarakkody case. He has not even read the case. . . , .

( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) Please read S. J. V. Chelvanayakam's and Vasudeva Nanayakkara's cases and the then Speaker, the Hon. K. B. Ratnayake's Ruling. Please read these things. Sections 3 and 4 of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act does not apply to this.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I am going by the Samarakkody case, Gomez v. M.H. Mohamed case and the Ruling by the then Speaker, the Hon. Anura Bandaranaike. All that is there.

( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) Chelvanayakam's matter was in 1961 under the Emergency Regulations.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Samarakkody case is the main case on this.

( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) Thereafter in 1971 Vasudeva Nanayakkara's case. Read those cases.

We have taken it up first and if the Kaduwela Courts have not followed us, that is a problem for them, not for us.

Sir, whatever decision you may come to after reading the Report of the Neville Samarakoon Select Committee of which I was a Member, the importance, the sovereignty, the dignity and the decorum of this House must be maintained.

ADJOURNMENT ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) , " " . . .

Question proposed.

PRESENT SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY [12.56 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Sir, I only want to mention this before I commence to move my Adjournment Motion. When the Party Leaders met during the last sessions of Parliament, I requested that we have an Adjournment Debate for a whole day on this particular Motion. Since the Government Business was quite numerous, the Hon. Leader of the House agreed that we will have a debate from 3.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. today. But it appears that thereafter certain matters have arisen between the Opposition and the Government, particularly the main Opposition Party, the UNP, the Chief Government Whip and the Leader of the House. We have no problem in regard to that matter, Sir. All what I say is, that it was the agreement that of the three hours of the Adjournment Debate, two hours will be allotted to the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi. But since we are starting the Debate now at 12.55 p.m. long before 3.30 p.m. all that I would like to say is that the time that has been allotted to us, the two hours, remains and there is no change in regard to that allotment of time to my party. That is all I wish to say, Sir. Sir, I now move the following Motion: "Whereas over 156,000 Tamil civilians, men, women, children and infants comprising of families who are historical inhabitants of several villages in the Eastern Province, for generations and centuries, have been forcibly evicted from these villages, as a result of intense military action, inclusive of indiscriminate aerial bombardment and indiscriminate heavy artillery fire inclusive of the rampant use of multi-barrel rocket launchers, into civilian populated areas in such villages. And whereas such intense military action has resulted in the death of over 300 and grievous injury to over 1000 such Tamil civilians, inclusive of men, women and children. And whereas such intense military action has resulted in the destruction of houses, temples, school buildings and other facilities depriving such Tamil civilians of their right to residence, worship and education and use of such other facilities.

2007 20 1819 1820

And whereas such intense military action has resulted in the destruction of farming equipment, fishing equipment, vehicles, plantations, crops, livestock and other belongings on which such Tamil civilians depended for their livelihood and which constitute their valuable and enduring economic assets, on which these Tamil civilians depended for their future economic survival. And whereas these unarmed Tamil Civilians were denied adequate food, medicines and other essentials while they continued to remain in these villages despite such intense military action. And whereas International Non-governmental Organizations and other relief organizations were denied access to these villages and were not able to render to the affected Tamil civilian population the required relief despite numerous efforts to do so. And whereas the aforesaid several matters are a blatant and grave violation of the human rights of the said Tamil civilian population. And whereas in all these circumstances, these unarmed Tamil civilians were compelled to flee from these villages and seek refuge in adjoining areas. And whereas in these adjoining areas, under the World Food Programme, the Government is distributing to these Tamil civilians, rice, flour, dhal and sugar and whereas all other essentials are supplied to these Tamil civilians, by various international non-governmental organizations and other relief organizations. And whereas despite such assistance by such organizations the affected people have much difficulty in the matter of temporary housing, sanitation and other personal needs. And whereas the Government is programming the resettlement of the affected Tamil civilians without any form of consultation with these affected people, or with the duly elected representatives of these people. And whereas in determining these programmes, the Government is solely focussed on ensuring its security concerns to a degree that denies or restricts the inalienable rights of the historical Tamil inhabitants of these villages. And whereas such arbitrary actions by the Sri Lankan State would not be acceptable to the historical Tamil inhabitants of the several villages in the Eastern Province. And whereas there is no neutral acceptable security arrangement for these historical Tamil inhabitants in these villages when they are resettled. And whereas several young Tamils have been detained and subjected to torture and other cruel inhuman and degrading treatment. And whereas the racial composition of the Sri Lankan security forces is more than 99 per cent Sinhala, and whereas these Tamil civilians who are the displaced historical inhabitants of these villages are 100 per cent Tamils. And whereas there is no mutual trust whatever between the Sri Lankan security forces and these displaced Tamil civilians. And whereas there is reluctance on the part of the displaced Tamil civilians to be resettled at the behest of the Sri Lankan security forces without adequate guarantee of their personal security. And whereas these Tamil civilians who have virtually lost everything, desire that their resettlement should be accompanied by a measure of rehabilitation, that will enable them to recommence their lives. And whereas there have been efforts to forcibly and compulsorily resettle such displaced Tamil civilians against their wish. And whereas the Sri Lankan State has not been sensitive in the least, to the concerns of the severely affected Tamil civilian population.

And whereas it would seem clear that the Sri Lankan State is planning to pursue such intense military action in other villages in the Eastern Province, which would result in the forcible and compulsory eviction of such historical Tamil inhabitants from these areas. And whereas such further intense military action would multiply the grave problem now existing manifold. And whereas the historical inhabitants of these Tamil villages, the Tamil civilians, are being called upon to face the ordeal of such a cruel and inhuman military attack for no fault of their own. And whereas it is imperative that such intense and indiscriminate military action, in which Tamil civilians are helpless victims, should not continue. And whereas the immediate needs of displaced Tamil civilians must be attended to, wherever they are presently. And whereas there is a definite need to involve Tamil civilians and their duly elected representatives in all programmes pertaining to their resettlement, their livelihood and their security. We call upon this House and the Government to take cognizance of this grave situation, wherein a part of the citizenry of this country, by virtue of its ethnicity, are being treated by the Sri Lankan State in a cruel and inhuman manner, and as unequal and inferior citizens, and to take immediate steps to remedy this callous disregard for the safety of their lives and their well-being. We appeal to the international community to take cognizance of the fact that the continuance of the present course of intense and indiscriminate military action wherein Tamil civilians, the historical inhabitants of many villages in the Eastern Province, are being treated by the Sri Lankan State in a cruel and inhuman manner and with callous disregard for their safety and well-being, would be a severe setback to the peace process, and to exert the maximum pressure to bring the present situation to an end. We also appeal to the international community to set up their own mechanisms to monitor the process of resettlement and rehabilitation when such programmes commence so as to ensure that the inalienable rights of the Tamil civilian historical inhabitants are not denied or restricted and to ensure that neutral acceptable security arrangements are in place that would enable the Tamil people to live without the fear of being harmed". That, Mr. Deputy Speaker, is the substance of my Motion and may I, Sir, speak a few words in regard to the contents of my Motion and the current situation that is prevailing in the Eastern Province pertaining to the Tamil civilians who have been evicted as a result of intense military activity from their areas of residence. Not merely have Tamil civilians been killed and injured in large numbers but they are virtually being rendered destitute and reduced to a state of penury. Their houses have been demolished in substantial numbers. Their temples have been demolished. Their school buildings have in many instances been demolished. Their agricultural equipment, their fishing equipment, their vehicles, their carts, their plantations, their crops, their livestock; all the wherewithal with which they have continued to survive economically have been destroyed and devastated. This, Sir, is no small matter. This is the wealth acquired by the Tamil people, these historical inhabitants through their own efforts. These houses were not built for them by the Government. Most of these people have their houses on their private lands. Most of these people have the plantations and crops on their

1821 1822

[ . ]

private lands. It was through the sweat of their brow over several decades that they had acquired this wealth. All that has been destroyed now and as I said before they have been reduced to a state of utter penury. That is the position of these Tamil inhabitants who have been evicted from their lands as a result of this military action. In order to prosecute a war against the LTTE in the harshest possible way through aerial bombardment, through heavy artillery fire, including the use of multi-barrel rocket launchers , the Government without any justification whatever, in my respectful submission, has exposed the Tamil civilian population to the dangers which they have encountered; death, grievous injury and the damage they have suffered to their immovable and movable assets. This, Sir, in my submission, is clearly unacceptable and is against international humanitarian law. I repeat Sir, that the Government has pursued action against the LTTE with callous disregard for the safety and security of the tens of thousands of Tamil civilian population who inhabited these areas. The question, Sir, is that the Government which prosecutes this military action in this very harsh manner despite the presence of tens of thousands of Tamil civilians, citizens of its own country, with such a utter disregard for their safety because the civilians were Tamils; would the Government have dared to prosecute such harsh military action if those thousands of civilians who resided in these areas were not Tamils, but Sinhalese with such utter disregard, with such callous disregard for the safety and security of such civilian population and their properties? The answer to that question, Sir, would be a resounding "No". The Government would never have done so. The clear answer is, Sir, that there is a segment of the citizens of this country who have had to face such intense military attack; aerial bombardment, heavy artillery fire, multi-barrel rocket launchers, only for the reason that the Government was not concerned about their safety and their security because these civilians were Tamil civilians. That is what, Sir, is clearly unacceptable and that is what I want to state on the Floor of this House and through the Floor of this House to the country and to the world at large. I do not want to speculate, Sir, but by going through all the reports that one has been able to read and all the information that one has been able to gather, though the Government claims to be acting against the LTTE, the damage caused to the LTTE, the death caused to the LTTE or the damage inflicted to property of the LTTE, in my view respectfully is minimal, negligible, compared to the death caused, the injury caused to the Tamil civilian population and the damage caused to Tamil civilian property. This is something Sir, which we have to bear in mind. Have you, as a Government acted in the best interest of the people you govern? Have you as a Government displayed towards your civilian population your responsibilities to ensure that in whatever action you take against the LTTE that these civilians are not subjected to jeopardy? My answer to that question, Sir, clearly is that the Government has not acted with a sense of responsibility in regard to its own Tamil civilian

population and the question that must inevitably flow from that situation is, if that is how the Government has acted, if the Government has been so irresponsible in regard to the actions it has taken, do you have a moral right to govern these people? If you cannot, if the Government is incapable of acting with a sense of responsibility to ensure the safety and security of the Tamil civilian population who are a part of the citizens of this country in whatever military action you choose to take against the LTTE, the question does arise, do you have a moral right to govern such people? The Tamil civilians, in my submission, Sir, have come under such intense military action for no fault of their own and without justification. The Tamil people, since 1956 at every successive general election to the national Parliament, have democratically supported a federal structure of government. That had been the will of the Tamil people when they exercised their franchise at successive elections to the National Parliament from 1956. In 1956, in March 1960, in July 1960, in 1965 and in 1970, that had been the democratic wish of the Tamil people; that had been the democratic expression of the will of the Tamil people. May I, Sir, at this point refer to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on the 10th of December, 1948. I refer to paragraph 3 of Article 21 of that instrument, which clearly states, I quote: The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government;" And the will of the people is expressed through periodic elections, the franchise exercised by the people. So, this has been the will of the Tamil people. If the will of the people is the basis of the authority of government and this has been the will of the Tamil people expressed over several decades at successive general elections, what has the Sri Lankan State, the Sri Lankan Government done to accommodate, to recognize that, as expressed at successive general elections? It was the duty of the Sri Lankan State to recognize and accommodate this democratically expressed will in some acceptable way. Half a century has gone, Sir. It is not a question of three years, five years, ten years or 15 years, but a half century has gone and nothing has happened! In this country, most unfortunately, it has not been possible to make anything happen. On the contrary, Sir, history records - I do not want to repeat the same thing over and over again - that Tamil civilians have been the victims of consistent human rights violations and repeated racial pogroms against them in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and the 1980s. They have been the victims of consistent human rights violations. Even more significantly, Sir, towards the entire period that I have referred to - for several decades; in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s - the Tamil people were the only

2007 20 1823 1824

victims of such consistent human rights violations. There were no other people of any other community in this country, Sinhalese or Muslims or anybody else, who can claim to have been the victims of consistent human rights violations as the Tamil people have been. The rule of law did not protect the Tamil people. These are facts, Sir, which cannot be denied by any Government in this country and which must be accepted. I wish to refer, Sir, to the Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I want to refer to paragraph three of that Preamble, which states, I quote, as follows:

Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law.

In this instance, the human rights of the Tamil people, as I have stated earlier, have not been protected by the rule of law over several decades and inevitably there has been a rebellion. This is the reality. The violation of the democratic rights and the human rights of the unarmed, peaceful Tamil civilian population has led to a rebellion, an armed struggle. Is there something strange about that? If there was political accommodation, if there was a recognition of the democratic verdicts of the Tamil people delivered at several successive elections, this would never have happened. This is why I said, Sir, during the course of my speech that the Tamil people are being punished for no fault of their own. A political solution is still elusive. We do not know whether it will ever come about. The Sri Lankan State is unable to get its act together. That is what is clearly visible.

There is a thinking, Sir, prevalent amongst many Tamil people, which I must give expression to in the course of my speech in this House today, that the motive for this intense military attacks have a definite political objective, that these intense military attacks in Tamil civilian populated areas in the Eastern Province have a definite political objective, which is, the emasculation of the political strength of the Tamil people and diminishing the strength of the Tamil people in the Eastern Province. Sir, I do not know how far this is true, but one must look at it fairly objectively and one is inclined to take the view that such an objective cannot be ruled out and that it could very well be the thinking of certain elements within the Government that this objective must be established.

Sir, if President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is currently the President of this country, will want to earn for himself a place in the history of this country, it may be that if military action is being pursued with such a political objective, that could only result in short-term political gains. But if he wants to earn for himself a niche in the history of this country as a statesman who understood this problem and endeavoured to bring about,

through the accommodation of the rights of all people who inhabit this country, peace to this country, I think pursuit of a military action with such a narrow political objective could not earn such a place for him. After all, Sir, in the Eastern Province today we have 16 Members of Parliament: seven Tamil Members of Parliament, six Muslim Members of Parliament and three Sinhalese Members of Parliament. All seven Tamil Members of Parliament belong to the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi. Of the six Muslim Members of Parliament, four belonged to the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress at the time of the General Election in 2004. One of the Muslim Members of Parliament is the Hon. (Mrs.) Ashraff, a Member of the NUA and the widow of the late Mr. Ashraff, who had a perfect understanding with the Tamil people, who realized that the Muslim people have to adopt a philosophy of living together with the Tamils ensuring that the aspirations of the Tamils were not jeopardized by the Muslim community, but at the same time, taking sufficient steps to protect their own interests. That has been the policy of the Muslim Congress. And we are in total agreement with them that for the coexistence of the Tamils and the Muslims on the basis of equality in the Eastern Province, we should ensure that Muslim aspirations are met in such a way that they are contented. That is the position as far as the Eastern Province is concerned; this is the political ethos of the Eastern Province. If someone is trying to throw a spanner in the works, destroy this edifice in the Eastern Province and transplant this edifice with a new structure, it is a matter of concern to us, it is a matter to which we cannot be oblivious. Because if this situation was to continue, Sir, I would fear that there will be more conflicts in this country, there will be more bloodshed in this country. The rebellion in this country cannot come to an end because the pressure and tyranny would increase and in such a situation, the rebellion cannot come to an end. We are fearful, Sir, because there were two recent attempts at some measure of forward political movement. One was the proposal for the Interim Self-Governing Authority. The second was the Post-Tsunami Operational Management Structure, the P-TOMS arrangement, both of which were aborted. The whole world knows the circumstances under which those possible mechanisms could not become functional and how they were aborted. Sir, there are certain forces in this country who are not prepared to permit any forward political movement and what is their Governments answer to that position? Is the Governments answer to that position, the pursuit of military action against the Tamil civilian population in the Eastern Province to a degree where they are evicted from their residences, driven out from their villages, rendered destitute and reduced to a state of penury? Is that the Governments answer? We have to know, Sir. I do not know whether anyone knows what is happening to the current peace process, where it is going and where it will end up. I do not want to comment too much about it. But it is a great question mark as to where we are heading.

1825 1826

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Sampanthan, forty minutes -

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I will take my time, Sir. My Party has time. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Okay. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) One might well say, Sir, that your zeal to crush the rebellion by the harshest possible military action disregarding completely the safety of Tamil civilian life and property, if in no small measure attributable to your inability to get your political act together. Is that not becoming increasingly clear when one looks at what is happening? I want to repeat, Sir, on the Floor of this House that it is the Tamil civilian population who are the heaviest casualties of your intensive military endeavours. This is clearly unacceptable and in our submission, this cannot continue and should not continue. We would urge the Government not to submit the Tamil civilian population to further death and destruction, agony and suffering as a result of further intense military action. We would urge the international community to use its best efforts to safeguard the lives and property of the Tamil civilian population. Now, Sir, it is over 150,000 people who have been displaced. They are planning resettlement and deciding where they can be resettled. Various conferences are being held. I said before that there are seven Tamil Members of Parliament from the Eastern Province. We are not summoned to any one of these conferences; we are not consulted; we do not know what is happening; our people do not know what is happening. As I said before, the primary focus is on security concerns regardless of the extent to which the rights of the Tamil people are eroded or totally disregarded. In fulfilling those security concerns, decisions are being made, there is no transparency. They do not seem to wish to have any contact whatever with either the Tamil people or their Representatives. Efforts are being made to compulsorily resettle people. People are very concerned about their security. They do not want to go back. The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, Minister for Re-settlement, is here. I was told that some days ago in Batticaloa some people were assaulted and put into vehicles to be taken back to Trincomalee. They do not want to go, be taken back to Mutur - to villages in East Mutur and West Mutur.

Sir, it is my duty to say a few words about Mutur. I come from that District; I represent that constituency. When Mr. S. J. V. Chelvanayakam used to go to Mutur for his political campaigns, I used to go with him. He never walked in Mutur. The people of these villages in Mutur used to carry him on their shoulders and we used to walk beside him. The people of Mutur never allowed Mr. S. J. V. Chelvanayakam to walk in Mutur. They always carried him on their shoulders. They supported him. I remember, at the March 1960 Parliamentary Elections, Mr. Thambiah Ahambaram was the first elected Member of Parliament for Mutur. In July 1960, Mr. Ahambaram was again the elected Member of Parliament in Mutur. He was the first Member of Parliament in the multi-member constituency. In April 1961, during the Sathyagraha campaign, Mr. Ahambaram died. He died of a heart attack. There was a by-election shortly thereafter, a couple of months later. The Federal Party candidate was Mr. M. E. H. Mohamed Ali. He was contested by Prof. C. Suntheralingam who campaigned on the basis of Eelam, who campaigned for Eelam. In fact, one day Prof. Suntherlingam stormed into my house in Trincomalee and told me that I must come and campaign for him. Our candidate was Mr. M. E. H. Mohamed Ali, a Muslim. He was the Federal Party candidate. Mr. Mohamed Ali was elected with an overwhelming majority and Mr. Suntheralingam forfeited his deposit. That is the political history of these people in Mutur. They were not separatists. Mr. Suntheralingam lost his deposit and Mr. Mohamed Ali was returned as the Federal Party Member of Parliament. The Tamil people in Mutur overwhelmingly supported Mr. Mohamed Ali. Today, they are all being driven out. Why? What crime have they committed? They are being chased out. Our temples have been destroyed in Mutur. The Pathra Kali Ambal Temple in Sampur was an ancient historic temple. I have been to that temple as a little child with my parents. They had the reconsecration ceremony for that temple in 2005. In fact, they came and saw me and told me, "Sir, we want you to present a bell to our temple because we want a big bell at the temple." I had a big bell made for them. That bell was blessed at the Pathra Kali Ambal Temple in Trincomalee and the Hon. Thurairetnasingham, my Colleague and Member of Parliament for Trincomalee and I went to have that bell installed in Sampur. It cost over a hundred thousand rupees and the bell was installed and the temple was reconsecrated in 2005. That temple, I have been told, has been razed to the ground. Destroyed! How can this type of thing continue? How can you expect us to live with you if you continue to treat us in this way? We rejected separation. We asked you for a federal arrangement. We overwhelmingly supported a federal arrangement at successive elections. You made no endeavour whatsoever to accommodate our aspirations, give us some political space in matters related to

2007 20 1827 1828

governance and in the guise of beating down the LTTE, you claim to indulge in a military action. Aerial bombing, repeated aerial bombing, repeated artillery fire, multi-barrel rocket launchers not knowing where the rockets will go, whom it will hit, what will happen and our people are slaughtered. No, Sir. This cannot continue; this should not continue. Resettlement must be done in a situation where the people who are resettled are assured of their security, are assured of their well-being. You cannot chase people out in this way, take them back and dump them. They must be given their means of livelihood. Farmers, fishermen and others must be given the facilities with which they can commence their livelihood. They must be given proper housing. They must be given proper security; there must be a neutral, impartial security arrangement. It is only under such conditions that there can be resettlement taking place and there must be consultation with the people and with the duly elected representatives of the people. There are Hon. Members of Parliament from Batticaloa, Ampara and Trincomalee, Tamil Hon. Members of Parliament who have a right to be consulted, who have a right to be involved. Even at the Local Authority Elections held recently in 2006, in every one of the Tamil areas in the Eastern Province where the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi fielded candidates, it came out supreme. We won those areas where the Tamil people live. So, these democratic verdicts of the people need to be respected. I want to appeal to the Government, Sir, that this military action must stop. The continued eviction of Tamil civilians from Tamil villages must come to an end and resettlement must be accompanied by proper rehabilitation in a situation where there is proper consultation with the people, with their duly elected representatives and with proper security arrangements where our people can live without the fear of being harmed. My Motion, Sir, will be seconded by the Hon. T. Kanagasabai, Member of Parliament from Batticaloa. Thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Thank you. The Hon. T. Kanagasabai.

Ministry of Defence and the US Embassy in Colombo have had initial discussions on the above agreement.

( ) (The Hon (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) 02. This will be an executive level international agreement between two countries. Further it is a legal tool used by the US Government to exchange logistical support, supplies and services avoiding standard contracting and foreign military sales procedures. 03. We have been informed by US Embassy in Colombo that from the Asian Region Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Fiji and Tonga have already signed ACSA agreements with US Government. Among the eligible countries to sign such agreement are Indonesia, Maldives, Philippines, Nepal, India, Mongolia, Bangladesh and Brunei.

The agreement can be used to undertake combine exercises, training and deployment. The co-operative efforts of such an agreement can be stressed to peacekeeping operations, humanitarian, natural disaster and rescue operations, especially during exigencies. Signing parties could refrain from supplying if required. - [ ] earphones . . Further, I quote: "04. The advantages of such an Agreement are as follows:

, , he is known for his magnanimity, . , . " Where ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be wise" . , " ".

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] . . - " " - . . , . , . , . What is happening in the Batticaloa District is nothing but aiming at cultural genocide, physical liquidation and economic strangulation of the Tamils in Batticaloa. This is a coldly calculated move by this Government to break the contiguity of the Tamil territory; swallow Trincomalee, the capital city of [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] and the link maintained between the Northern and Eastern Province virtually nullifying the Indo-Lanka Accord, an international agreement reached nineteen years ago, indirectly telling the mighty Indian subcontinent as to who are you to dictate terms to us; we the Sinhala Buddhists will establish our imperialism, come what may what India thinks. Now, I come to another point. You have in the most inhumane manner, by military attacks displaced 200,000 Tamils. Not one hundred, not two hundred, not one thousand but 200,000 Tamils have been displaced from their own homeland. Chase us from Colombo, Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Badulla and Bandarawela; we will accept it.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] But if you are trying to displace us from our own homeland, the consequences are going to be grave. Are we to be dumped into the Indian Ocean? Give us a reply.

[ . . ]

2007 20 1915 1916

Now the next question is, the way they have chased the Tamils. More than 20,000 Tamils have taken refuge in Tamil Nadu and that has become a problem to India. Kalaignar Karunanidhi is doing his utmost to help the people. - [Interruption.] Please keep your mouth shut. Do not disturb me when I am at a most crucial point. Kalaignar looks helpless. You are now determined to make us a microscopic minority or a nonentity and change the demographic features of our historic habitation. The Hon. Sampanthan in his beautiful language, in lovely language, in an articulate language said that the Northern and Eastern Provinces are the historic habitation of the Tamils. If anybody wants our territory the consequences are going to be very grave. I think, I cannot speak better than Hon. Sampanthan has spoken in the morning. If you do not listen to what we say, we are determined to agitate a confrontation. Come what may; we shall fight by air; we shall fight by land; we shall fight by sea. We have nothing more to lose except our blood, toil and tears that we offer to our land. [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] whether you accept it or not. Now as regards India, our motherland, we feel India under any circumstances should not fall prey to Sinhala Buddhist imperialism. We plead with India quoting the Bible, You are the salt of the earth." If the saltiness is removed, where do we go?
