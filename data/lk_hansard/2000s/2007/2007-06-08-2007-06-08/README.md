( ) (An hon. Member) [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) There was a reference made by the Chief Government Whip that there are certain things that need to be expunged from the Hansard. Under Standing Order 136, you have a right, the almighty right, to do anything and everything you want. I am sorry, Hon. Speaker, you may be the Speaker of this House. We are the Members of this House. We are there to respect it and you are there to uphold that. It is our contention that any statement could be expunged only if it is unsubstantiated or if it does not have a relevance to the Debate that is taking place. The Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne in his statement categorically took the full responsibility for those statements. So, on that score you have no authority to intervene with his right. Only if there is a flagrant violation -[Interruption.].

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . [ ] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am on my feet, Sir. Please listen to me. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . [ ] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Listen to me, Hon. Speaker [Interruption.] Please listen to me. I have not concluded my point.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Give a Ruling when my point is concluded.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) ?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Please, do not behave like a Hitler here. We are here only to ensure that we uphold the dignity of this House.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) On that score, a Member of Parliament has the full right and as the Speaker, you have only got to ensure that he takes responsibility. If it is touching on the President you have a right to expunge that. Otherwise, on what basis do you have a right? Under Section 25 of the Standing Orders when an Hon. Member speaks on a matter that is related to the subject matter, on what basis are you going to expunge it from the Hansard? So please - that was only a reference - listen to us as well. This is absolutely a behaviour with a Hitler type of mentality.

Hon. Speaker, in the course of the Parliamentary Debate granted at the request of the Hon. T. Maheswaran, Member of Parliament, the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella

categorically stated that the Government only assisted people who voluntarily agreed to leave the city. This is a completely false statement made to mislead the Parliament since there is clear evidence that many of these people were forced to leave. Miss Dharshani Selvam had clearly stated that she was due to get married next Wednesday. In fact the reception hall had also been reserved. She had been living in Colombo since her father passed away. But preventing all that she was forced to leave Colombo. This clearly shows that the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella acted in breach of the Privileges of Parliament and I seek your indulgence to raise this matter on the Floor of the House and take such action as necessary. , - [ ]

( - , ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem-Minister of Posts and Telecommunication) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I have risen to make my reply early since it happens to be a Friday and we have to be there for our Jumma prayers by 12.30 p.m. Hence my honoured Colleague, the Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya on behalf of the Ministry of Finance will make the final reply. I, as the Minister would now deal with some of those concerns that have been raised by the two Members who spoke before me. , : " . , , ." . . . -Securities and Exchange Commission- Director-General, . . . . . .

. , , . . . , . , . . , GTH . . . . . , . , , , . . . , . There are many technical issues that I have to deal with. Therefore I would switch on to English in order to reply to the balance queries that have been raised. A suggestion has been made that the Government must purchase the shares of NTT. But then what we must remember is that if NTT wishes to sell their shares to somebody else, the Government cannot do anything about it. That is the basic position. The United National Party Government during their tenure of office entered into a new Shareholders Agreement and that new Shareholders Agreement does not contain any caveat which will prevent NTT from selling their shares without the consent of the Government. But here, there is one pertinent issue that arises particularly because NTT in their letter has indicated to the Government that they are going to sell 25.3 per cent of the shares to this company known as GTH. Therefore, their shareholding drops below 10 per cent. That act itself automatically terminates the existing Shareholders Agreement. That is how the Government is coming into the scene in order to look at the acceptability of GTH as a shareholder and a partner, probably to manage Sri Lanka Telecom. Obviously it should be agreed that there is no compulsion on the Government to give the management to any party just because they have a certain number of shares with them. This evaluation in the past was based on certain criteria. Particularly when NTT originally became entitled to their current shareholding of 35.2 per cent, their

experience as a fixed line operator was one of the primary factors in the decision to sell Telecom shares to them. Not only that, NTT was a Japanese Government entity and their customer base, their profitability and income was several fold higher than that of the then SLTs position. There was a large investment that came in. Together with that they brought in their expertise. These were the fundamental reasons for the Government to consider divesting its shares to NTT of Japan. Since NTT was a Japanese State owned company quoted in the Stock Exchange in Tokyo and the deal was between two business entities of two sovereign countries, security consideration obviously did not arise at that time. I must also very categorically deny another assertion that was made by the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara in the House today that the agreement has already been signed. I take responsibility and say that no agreement has been signed. The Committee of officials are still going into this offer and they will make their recommendation to the Cabinet. It is only thereafter that the Cabinet could authorize the preparation of a shareholders agreement and that too would be done with the concurrence of the Attorney-General if the party seeking to buy the NTT shares is acceptable to the Government.

2007 08 1235 1236

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) The intention is to have a tripartite agreement. If at all it has to be done, the officials agree that it has to be a tripartite agreement and NTT obviously has got to be a partner since they are going to retain less than 10 per cent of the shares, a large chunk of their shares. The issue pertaining to the right of refusal by the Government when NTT wishes to sell their part of the shares is another matter that has to be discussed by the officials. I am sure these are matters they will consider. Before ultimately recommending to the Cabinet, these fundamental issues would be gone into by these officials and they will particularly look as to what advantage will accrue to the Government of Sri Lanka on entering into a new agreement with this buyer. As I told the House earlier, when NTT originally came they brought in huge investment, management skills and technical know-how. It is widely accepted that our present management has acquired the necessary skills and if it is required, they have the capability to run SLT efficiently. We have managed to acquire these skills over a period of time and this is why the suggestion by the United National Party and the JVP has come up today about the Government buying the shares. I must say, as it is the Government anyway is the majority shareholder and without the Governments consent, no new shareholder's agreement could be entered into with a new party. Though the Governments shareholding is 49.5 per cent with the initial public offering that was made during the United National Party regime, there is about 15.3 per cent held by public and even among the 15.3 per cent, I must say that the Employees Provident Fund and the Bank of Ceylon hold a sufficient number of shares and them being Government institutions, obviously the overall Government shareholding will be more than 50 per cent as it is. So, this being the situation, the issue of entering into a new agreement arises only if NTT holds less than 10 per cent of the shares and decides to sell the rest of the shares to a new party. But, however there is no compulsion to give a new shareholder's agreement to any other party or the Government. This being the case, it is now being examined by this Committee. Maxis, the so-called leading mobile operator in Malaysia in their letter dated 14th March, 2007 to NTT is adverting to this fact. They say, this. We believe the GTH by having Maxis as one of its group companies has a solid track record as a telecommunications operator with a leading position in Malaysia and strong mobile operations in India and Indonesia. It appears that their expertise is only in mobile operations. This is also a factor that the Committee of officials are taking into account. The SLT is basically a fixed line operator and mobile operations is a very small part of our business.

And, therefore that is also another matter that should be taken into account. I find that Maxis operations even in India and Indonesia as well deal with only mobile operations. Here GTH is claiming Maxis to be one of its group companies. This issue was also raised by the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara and this matter is also being gone into by the officials to establish the connection between Maxis and GTH so that Maxis would be the main responsible partner in entering into an agreement with the Government of Sri Lanka. Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I must very categorically state that certain issues of concern that have been raised by the Members here are matters that are being examined currently and no decision has yet been arrived at. No shareholders agreement could give unlimited management powers with no fall-back action of a limited time frame. That chance is there for the Government now, if at all there is a new agreement to be entered into, to make it a time-bound exercise so that the rights of the shareholders could be upheld. Then another question was raised as to why the Securities and Exchange Commission has not suspended transactions of the shares of SLT in the stock exchange. Here again the rights of the minority shareholders and as to whether a new agreement could be violating the Articles of Association of Sri Lanka Telecom are matters that would be thoroughly gone into before a final decision is made. Then obviously there is another issue. If in the future, the so-called new partner acquires more than 30 per cent, that will trigger the merger code and thereby an offer has to be made to all the shareholders. That issue together with the security concerns that has been raised is a very pertinent one and that too would be looked into. There again on the security issues, the Ministry of Defence has also been asked to give a report to the Committee. I am sure all these matters would be gone into. Obviously whoever gets the effective control of Sri Lanka Telecom will get the opportunity to control the international gateway to Sri Lanka and have access to unlimited intelligence opportunities. This has not been lost certainly on the Government, and this matter too would be gone into. One other matter which has also been attracting the attention of the officials is the right of the Government of Sri Lanka to play a role in national development like rolling out rural infrastructure. The Government cannot cede the opportunity of harnessing State resources for national development and in fact the Telecom Policy in Sri Lanka is to facilitate universal access. In fact, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, in an address later today to the Sri Lanka Economic Summit, I am to speak on the subject of Telecom Policy in Sri Lanka and I would be dealing with some of these issues there. As it appears to me, most of the assumptions that have been made by the Opposition are premature assumptions. No decision has been made. All these concerns are being

1237 1238

thoroughly looked into and there is no need to panic or to raise alarm bells. Certainly it must be very clearly stated that the ethnicity and the ethnic background of the owners of a company is not something that the Government is worried about. But certainly issues of security would be gone into and the Government is seriously looking at it. These matters have raised much controversy. It is very unfair to make allegations and go to the extent of saying that the Presidents brother was found in Japan and that it happened soon after or before the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera and the Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi were expelled from the Cabinet and that implies that there was something fishy going on in Japan with NTT and the Presidents sibling. In my opinion - [Interruption.]

I appreciate the opportunity given to me to speak on this very important issue that is being discussed and I hope our genial Minister of Posts and Telecommunication would spare a little time. I am sure even Allah will bless you to listen and protect the State assets - [Interruption.] Yes, I will ensure that I will finish before the start of the prayers at 1.00 o clock so that you will get the blessings of the Opposition This is the first time I have seen that the Hon. Minister rattled, shaken, disturbed and speaking from a prepared text. He is a capable, cunning, amiable and quick-witted Minister. Today he was out hit-wicket. He was not ready to answer the questions that were posed by my Colleague, the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara because the brief was not prepared by him. The brief was prepared by others. He did his best from a bad brief. We all got together and prepared our brief. ( ) (An hon. Member) I prepared it.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) We are a collective team. We are not being wagged by the tail - [Interruption.] Hon. Minister, your inner heart will tell you that you are a half- abducted Minister. The Tamils are fully abducted. The Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi was a Minister who was sacked two months ago. He is fully abducted. I mentioned to you to listen to him as to what he had to say on a question you posed. He is the one who said that monies have been given. You deprived him from saying it. I will give two minutes of my time so that he will be able to explain it to you. I will not disturb. I will give him my time. Are you willing to explain it, Hon.Member? ( ) (The Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi) Hon. Member, I do not want to take your time and speak regarding this matter. But actually what happened was, I was in charge of the Public Enterprises Reform Commission. Then this SLT matter which was also facilitated by the PERC came under me and there were about seven interested parties at that time. Therefore, the Government could have done this deal in a very transparent manner suspending all deals at the Stock Exchange and getting proposals from the seven interested parties. The Government's Management Agreement could have been done in a transparent manner going back to the original criteria given by the Government when this was privatized originally. Those things were never done. After sacking me it is very, very peculiar that Mr. Basil Rajapaksa went to Japan with Mr. Ralph Marshal. Therefore, anybody can guess what actually happened . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Now listen, Hon. Minister. This is not desultory speculation. He is the Minister who was in charge of PERC. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) On the issue - ( ) (The Hon.

Deputy Chairman of Committees, now the issue relating to PERC came up here. I must say that the PERC officials are also assisting the committee. They are not unaware of the entire thing. Their advice is being taken by these officials in their discussions. The PERC officials are there in attendance and nothing is being done behind the screen. It will be a very transparent exercise. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) When you wait for the next 35 minutes you will see why the screen is so different, why the goal-post has been changed. So just listen, Hon. Minister. So, that was the former Minister. The PERC was in his charge and he expressed in this House as to what happened. So remember we, from the United National Party do not have desultory speculations. We are saying what happened, what would happen and that is where we are going forward. Hon. Minister, may I stump you once again? You are the Minister of Telecommunication. Why did you not sign the Cabinet Paper of 23rd March 2007?

During Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga's and Mr. Ranil Wickremasinghe's times, when you were a Minister you were an almighty Minister. Now you are just a postman. That is what has happened. Are you relegating yourself ? [Interruption.] Okay.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, in fact the owner of the shares in the SLT is the Treasury and therefore the Minister of Finance has the right to submit a Cabinet Paper because it deals with the shares of the Sri Lanka Telecom. Though the subject is listed under me, it is also concurrently a subject which is coming under the purview of the Minister of Finance.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So in that case it is another arrogation of power. So that means 75 per cent might go up to 85 per cent. But this is becoming another story. Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, now all we have got to say is, the more I give time for Mr. Rauff Hakeem to speak, the more is the exposure. I will give you another opportunity if you want to open up again. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) 75 85 . [ ] .

Ravi Karunanayake) Now, we are referring to the company, the Sri Lanka Telecom. The Sri Lanka Telecom is now listed on the Stock Exchange. Now that was the reason why when we were Cabinet Ministers, the ill-timed privatization that was done during Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga's period was amended where you were able to go into the Stock Exchange; not only the Stock Exchange in Sri Lanka but float it even in America, Hong Kong, India, anywhere, so that we could build capital for our country. Telecommunication is a very important sector and that is the reason why that was done. So never did it alter the Shareholders Agreement; it only re-arranged the management to a certain extent. Before the stocks were put on the Stock Exchange, this was a corporation. On 31st July, 1997 this was converted from a public corporation to a public company. Thirty five per cent of the shares of SLT was sold to NTT. Rs.13.5 billion or at that point it was US Dollars 225 million, if I recollect right, was the offer that was made to Sri Lanka Telecom. I, from the United National Party was a Member who opposed it saying that it was undervalued. The valuation was very transparently clear and showed that the value of 35 per cent was around Rs.22 billion to Rs.23 billion. That is why we still say that that privatization was ill-timed, was not properly done and undersold as well. We are certainly a party which believes that privatization will help competition, improve the lifestyle of the people and bring Sri Lanka into a world of technology with greater ease. But certainly this privatization was not done in the desired manner. Certainly the staff was protected by giving certain shares and today the benefit of that is shown by a Rs.10 share being placed at almost Rs.40 to Rs.41.

I heard that they are still pushing it up from Rs.40 or Rs.41 to Rs.45. That shows that at least the benefits of the employees are looked after. The Government has the control of this company even as of today because 49.5 per cent of shares is held by the Treasury as you said, 2.5 per cent by EPF and another 0.7 per cent by Bank of Ceylon. That very clearly shows that the Government has an absolute 51 per cent control of it. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) . . ( ) (The Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka) . ( ) (The Hon.

Minister - ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Mervyn Silva) [ ] - .

I was just explaining as to how the shares are controlled by the Government even as of today. Those are on the Stock Exchange. You quite rightly said that anything that had got to be done had to go through the rules and regulations of the Stock Exchange. That is the reason why there are further speculations. I would like to get back to the origin of the privatization because the spirit of it is still there. The concept that was espoused at that moment was to get professionalism by all means. That is why they showed that the company must have at least 25 years minimum experience in running businesses and especially 15 years experience in the field of telecommunication. They further mentioned that that company should be able to have at least Rupees one million in the domestic company; that is the company with which it is registered. Also it should have at least 20,000 public phones and together with that the number of workers should be significant. That was to show that it does not go for a normal fly-by-night operator. Quite rightly from that aspect the best of the companies, NTT was selected. At that particular moment the most significant factor was not only the selling of the 35 per cent shares. It was the selling of the 35 per cent shares and also giving the 10-year management right to run that 35 per cent of shares. Selling even 5 per cent of it and getting 100 per cent management is good enough. That is the reason why this speculation has come about on this particular deal.

What the NTT does with the shares that are placed on the Stock Exchange is not our concern. Once it is done, it is a done deal. In that case, what is the reason for the Cabinet to interfere, intercede and get involved in the process? That is what we, from the United National Party want to know. My Colleague, the Hon. Dayasiri Jaysekara mentioned that the United National Party has gone on record saying that we will not hold ourselves responsible for any act that takes place on this so-called privatization that is going to be done or is impending. The reason for it is that we mentioned at the time of privatization of Air Lanka that we would not do so. We informed Mega which was giving an international guarantee on expropriation of funds; that we would not subscribe to it and we still stand by that. Mega did not ensure that. You and I, when we were in the Cabinet tried to take certain steps. They wanted counter suggestions. We did not give in to their requirement of counter suggestions because there was a ten-year period. We could not abrogate. But we certainly did not give in to their requirement at that particular moment. Therefore, relatively it is not correct to say that we did not do anything. Certainly we did everything. I was one of the people who said that in the case of Air Lanka it was an inimical privatization

Once again I quote from the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera's speech, Column 2279 of Hansard dated 9th December,1997 : I am glad to say that Mr. Kamitsuma, who was the President of the international section of NTT in Japan became the CEO in Sri Lanka, because NTT wants to make Sri Lanka the centre of the South Asian Region. They believe in the Government of Sri Lanka and our capacity to develop as the centre of this whole region, and I think we have already gone a long way in doing so. In fact, when the privatization was announced in Japan the News - Seven said, NTT plans to build up phone services in Sri Lanka making it the centre of its operations . Likewise, there were glowing references to Sri Lanka in the Japanese media when this strategic alliance did take place. That was the company on which confidence was placed for the running of the Sri Lankan Telecom. Today telecom is a widely changing field. It is an industry that you can make billions of rupees. We, Sri Lankans are only scratching the tip of the iceberg and that is why we are very concerned when these type of statements are uttered. Also it has at this particular moment given a completely different way of life to Sri Lanka. The privatization process certainly has its benefits. Today, competition has increased on the basis of Mobitel, Hutch, Airtel, Suntel, Lanka Bell - you name it. That is the process of opening this out. When it was restricted we waited six to eight months to get a new telephone. But today we are able to get about five to six ". Certainly there has been an openness in the telecom area. The reason why we are saying this has got to be protected is because ours is a small island. In a globalized world there are certain services that we have got to protect. The constitution of our GDP is almost 58 per cent bent on services. Allah will bless you if you wait for another ten minutes, Hon. Minister. We have a mosque in Kotte. You you can go there in five minutes provided there are no road blocks . All I say in good spirit is that we want to get this moving. I also heard my Colleague, the Hon.Wimal Weerawansa, speaking very passionately about a week ago on the Privatization of NTT or the Sri Lanka Telecom but I guess, lacks fire today. He touched on areas which was relevant to privatization but not relevant to the issue today. He did mention that there was a US Dollars 10 million bribe that was taken. But why was he silent on this today ?

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, the Hela Urumaya and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party got together in a tripartite agreement to come into power. During that process, they said that there is going to be no privatization. That was the clarion call given to the people of this country. Today, what is the difference? They say that they are not getting involved in the sale of NTT to Maxis or anybody. But they say that they are going to give a management right to this company that is going to buy the NTT shares. If it is not accepting privatization why are they getting involved? That is the question we are asking. Privatization has many names. Today it is being used like a cat that has seven lives and in different ways it is trying to skin the cat. All we have got to say is that this is privatization taking place in the best of form because you are giving 100 percent management to one company.

Today, Dialog is doing a fantastic job. Rupees seven billion is their profit. The shareholders are getting a very good return. They are also a public limited company just as much as the NTT in Sri Lanka Telecom. Dialog has gained a very big market share, almost about 70 percent in the mobile field. Likewise, Sri Lanka Telecom has gained a market share of about 60 to70 per cent in this country. As mentioned quite rightly by the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa, this has been going on from our days and people have been investing in this and it is a company bond. They agree that they do not like privatization. That is their own philosophy. I have no doubts about that. But we believe that a commercialization process needs to go on and on that score we say today that the concept of trying to mix Dialog - Dialog is already given out - and SLT to be given to another Malaysian company. Even though the Netherlands gets its roots back into Malaysia, you are giving an absolute monopoly, whether it is the fixed lines or the mobile lines, to a country which is not within our control. I mean, if it is a friendly country - Malaysia is very friendly I must say - in economic terms in the SAARC Region like India, it is acceptable; it is permissible; it is thinkable. But here is a situation, where Dialog is doing a superb job and you are trying to give our balance assets also to a Malaysian company. Then the question arises as to whether the Security Exchange is performing its functions properly. Being the former Minister of Trade and Commerce, it is my bounden duty to tell the Minister that it is necesary that he consults the Minister of Trade as well as the Minister of Finance as a monopoly situation is allowed to be established. Why is there the Fair Trading Commission Act, No. 1 of 1987 for the control of monopolies? Authorities set up under this Act must step in and ask whether this is for the collective good of the country. Then only the third aspect, the shareholders and the right of all of them comes in.

Going on that basis, it is just not looking at a particular company and saying that it has sold its shares when the actual operation of what flows from that needs to be looked at. The Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs comes in. I am sure he must also be quite rattled because you are basically quoting Malaysia, a country that has looked at Sri Lanka and said, We would like to be like Sri Lanka. But today we say, Let us be like Malaysia. That is the sad irony of what has happened to us. This is owing to the wrong policies pursued by many Left oriented chauvinistic politicians who have led this country astray. Others realized the mistake made by Sri Lanka, corrected it and moved forward. That is why we are saying today, please ensure that this type of situation is corrected. The Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs has a cheeky smile on his face.

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) Welcome to Sri Lanka.

( )

( - ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama - Minister of Foreign Affairs) I am happy to see my good Friend speaking so smartly.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Welcome to Sri Lanka", says the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekera. I know the added problems you have with ethnic cleansing and aberration of peace. You have much more than foreign affairs to do at this particular moment. But we were just mentioning that we are trying to create an enclave where there is going to be a monopoly by trying to give another institution to Malaysia which will be unhealthy to the consumers of this country. It is not the country that is getting in, but the overall impact of one company basically having the entire control of our telecommunications in their hands. When we gave one third share to IOC having almost US Dollars six to seven billion coming in and going out, which did not have any monopolistic nature of holdings, through the Indian Free Trade Agreement what a fuss was made? Why is no such fuss made over this transaction? That is why, you have got to look at it from the entire playing field rather than just from one small area. As I mentioned the Stock Exchange, the Securities Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka, the Fair Trading Commission and the Consumer Affairs Authority must go into this matter. I was happy to read in a national newspaper a news item under the caption stated below and I thought I must mention it in Parliament today. It states, I quote:

Dialog becomes Sri Lankas biggest investor."

It shows that they have invested almost Rs. 90 billion in this country in their third phase operation. It is only re-echoing and re-emphasizing the fact I mentioned that we are knowingly and willingly creating a monster and then, saying, "Malaysia controls our Telecom". Please, Hon. Minister, being in Cabinet you must speak on this. You are silent. You are basically allowing matters to just go out of your hands and then suddenly say, "Ah! Something happened". At the moment all matters that are being discussed have an impact like the dealings involving Prima during Mrs. Chandrika Kumaratungas Sri Lanka Freedom Party mandate. The issue regarding Sri Lanka Telecom was again during Mrs. Chandrika Kumaratungas time. Before too long we will be talking of SriLankan Airlines, once again an issue that was there during the time of Mrs.Chandrika Kumaratunga. We mentioned that that was inimical. Then and now there is no difference. If we had done this, you would have the entire House here shouting.

1253 1254

[ ]

Then going on further, Mr. Presiding Member, we would like to mention that this particular transaction has now taken a different turn. Now what is the turn it has taken? Who is going to buy is not our concern. As you said the NTT was given a right on 31st July 1997 to buy the shares. They had their destiny in buying the shares. Today, they are going to sell these shares. Now, why is the Government of Sri Lanka getting involved in this process? They are on the Stock Exchange and they have no right to discuss behind the scene with one person because what happens if the shares are put on the market and somebody goes and offers hundred rupees? Then the deal with Maxis or supposed to be with GTH Netherlands, when somebody, may be a peoples company gets together and says at the Stock Exchange , "Here I am going to quote Rs. 100 a share". Then what happens to this? You cannot be saying, "I am giving such and such" because the shareholders will say, "Why are you giving another person when I am going to offer you hundred rupees and I can give a better price than that, a better return than that?" So you are going to get basically submerged into a pre-done deal. That is why John Keels, a couple of months ago walked out of this system. They are a blue-chip company. Nobody says that they have political colourings. They decided that they want to enter into this new market and suddenly walked out. They went out quicker than they came in. "What was the reason?" is what everybody is asking. Then, thereafter for some reason or the other, I do not want to waste time on what was laboured very well by my Colleague, the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara, who mentioned that the NTTs shares are being sold to GTH. What is GTH? GTH happens to be a company in the Usaha Tegas Group which is a Malaysian company. Now, the GTH which is a Netherlands company registered just a couple of months ago with no employees, with no capital base and no trading, are trying to show that this has a Maxis connection. Maxis is a subsidiary company coming under Usaha Tegas equity share with only 69 per cent. So, Maxis have no absolute connection except being a group company in this particular set up. So, Maxis is a telecom company in Malaysia which has absolutely no connection with the GTH, Netherlands. Now what is the justification in that case? This is like you basically saying that you are a shareholder of John Keels or Hayleys or Aitken Spence and then suddenly on the strength of it saying you are a Director in another company. Cross-utilization. So, you are only trying to mystify and show that there is Maxis connection or experience in this. There is absolutely nothing. We want to mention very categorically that it has no relevance and no management experience in this. So, in that case this is just a dummy company, a Special Purpose Vehicle in the Usaha Tegas group of companies, just to ensure the purchase of Sri Lanka Telecom. Just a couple of days ago, Mr. Akashi came to this country and my Leader, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella and myself did happen to meet him. We asked Mr. Akashi as to why the Japanese were moving out. Hon. Foreign

Minister, to make your life easier, as you know we have been doing more marketing for you than your own trade ministers. We asked him why the Japanese were moving out of this country. Then, they both looked and grinned like Cheshire cats rather than answer that question. We felt sorry. So we did not want to pursue on that. This is not a matter which was between the companies, but it so happened. So we knew what was the reading. NTT owns the Sri Lanka Telecom. The Sri Lanka Telecom never said they asked for BOI status. They said they never asked for a radio licence. They said they never wanted a 3G, Third Generation licence and that they also did not ask for a direct-to-home licence. Then why has this been given? A direct-to-home license is worth almost US Dollars four to five million. The Dialog Company when they acquired CBN Sat did not have this. Now they are paying three, four, five million Dollars trying to achieve it. Others are in the market in the same way. When BOI status is given to a company like this, the revenue loss to the Government will be almost US Dollars eight to ten millions a year because you are going to have them exempted from the duty they are paying today. So the revenue to this country is lost. Sri Lanka Telecom did not ask for it. Then why did you give it? Third Generation licence is worth a lot of money and radio licences are also the same. If they are so keen to give companies that did not even ask these, why do you not give companies that have asked for it? Sirasa, MTV, Swarnavahini, TNL, Derana, MAX TV, all of them have asked but they have been refused. There must be some subtle difference between the two as to why they have been given when they do not ask and why people who ask do not get. Professor Mervyn Silva can put his thinking cap on and ask as to what the Government's logic is when they do such things.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have five minutes more.

Now the Maxis that is being thrown around so much is Ananda Krishnan who is 64 years running a gambling industry. He was born in Valvettithurai which happens to be Prabhakarans village. Now what is this? Two people Ralph Marshal and Ananda Krishnan are both born in Valvettithurai. What is the significance? Imagine, if the United National Party brought such a proposal and said that the shareholder is so and so, these guys would have been shouting at the Lipton Circus today. " - ." . . ; , . . That is the reason why we are asking this. We are not telling this with any malice or with any discontent. All what we are saying is, the truth is revealed. If there is a necessity for the NTT to sell the shares, let them sell. The Government is the biggest shareholder. Hon. Foreign Minister, you have said that there is no privatization in your Governments policy. Then what the hell is going on? You talk of one -

1257 1258

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) What, there is no privatization?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) According to the Mahinda Chintana there is no privatization -[Interruption.] You need not say. It is there in the Mahinda Chintana.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) No, Mahinda Chintana has not said anything about it.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Why not? It is very clearly stated there.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Quote that. Quote the relevant section from the Mahinda Chintana.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You say there is no mention of privatization in the Mahinda Chintana.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) You mean, privatization of State enterprises?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Any enterprise, be it Government or otherwise, privatization -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) ? . ?

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) You quote that.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I will quote that.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) It is not there.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You have taken me unaware. Because it is so integral to your policy, now you are doing an about-turn. You are an "Export Quality". You must ask from the SLFPers because they are the ones who were involved with the preparation of the "Mahinda Chintana". So, all we are basically saying is, please ensure that the Government policies are complied with. Now, abbrogation of the Ceasfire Agreement was one of your main pledges. Now you say, Do not. The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella says, You have to do it and the Hon. Nimal Siripala says If you tear this, are we going to fight with these guys with catapults? We share the view of the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva. Then what the hell is the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella saying? That is the problem.

( )

( - ) (The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne-Minister of Enterprise Development) Can I intervene? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne. The problem I am having is, I am fighting with my old Friends.

( ) (The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne) Now you said that he is an "Export Quality". You can be in the next consignment.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No. There will not be a "next consignment" because the ship will sink. Then what will happen is, you all will be thrown on to this side and we will be thrust on to that side. That is what is going to happen.

2007 08 1259 1260

( ) (An hon. Member) You are day-dreaming!

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Day dreaming or not, what to do, Sir? Some persons make dreams come true. We are those guys. Sir. on that score, why is that out of 35.2 per cent of shares only 25.3 per cent is being sold? The NTT is retaining the minimum level that has got to be maintained. They are selling shares with dislike because otherwise NTT can sell the entire 35.2 per cent shares. The least percentage of shares that they can retain without having any impact is 10. Now they retain 9.9 per cent. So it creates an impact. When they keep 9.9 per cent out of 35.2 per cent and sell the balance, then what happens? You are creating a new atmosphere. Why is this new atmosphere created? If NTT is so keen to sell shares why did they not sell the entire 35.2 per cent of shares? If it is a good deal they are getting, why do they need to have a residual impact? They do not have directors. They do not have minority right issues. Nothing. So, they are hoping that their own shares will be blossomed by somebody else to whom they do not like to sell. That is very clear and subsequently I will quote to you a letter in that regard. Furthermore, now they are buying I think 28 or 29.8 per cent of shares. Now the Stock Exchange has a shareholders' share of 8 to 10 per cent. So if they buy 2 per cent, then there is a mandatory right offer of 30 per cent.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! , .

, [ ] .

, ( ) . Whereupon THE HON. GAYANTHA KARUNATILEKA left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER (THE HON. GITANJANA GUNAWARDENA) took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Am I permitted to carry on with my speech, Sir.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, you may.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I was just going on the basis that the NTT has a mandatory offer of 30 per cent. If they buy 2 per cent from the Stock Exchange, then they have a right to go for a mandatory offer. What will happen then? Obviously if they push the price up to 35 or 40, which will be more worthwhile later; if they buy this then they have a right to run through with this. So have these been looked into by the Hon. Minister because sometimes the officials may be telling something there. I am only telling this from a business angle because this is something I revel in doing and it is just to show that these are the things that are going on. Sir, I would like to table* the Cabinet Memorandum of 27th March, 2007. In this, His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa sets out the reasons for a Cabinet Memorandum being put forward. I would say that this is a redundant Cabinet Paper because if shares are being sold at the Stock Exchange, then what is the necessity for the Finance Ministry to say that an agreement is being prepared? As the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara mentioned, if John Keells, Hayleys, Aitken Spence or Siddhalepa is selling their shares in the Stock Exchange, why have you got to get approval? You are not going to mess around with the market capitalization that is in the Stock Exchange. So, this is the reason why people are aroused with suspicion, because there is something more to this. When the company does not ask for facilities and they get and when the Finance Ministry puts forward Cabinet Papers that are not relevant, then only things come to light. Now going on the basis of the Cabinet Paper that was put forward on the 27th of March 2007, I presume - I may be subject to correction - Mr. P. B. Jayasundera who is a central figure in all these privatization deals then, now and I do not know whether in future, certainly plays a pivotal role in this. Even before the Minutes of that Cabinet meeting come, he writes to Alexis Silva who is the Director-General of Public Enterprises a letter dated 27th March, 2007. I will quote the last paragraph of that letter which states: I would appreciate if you would facilitate this exercise and prepare the relevant agreements subject to approval of the Attorney-General in terms of the Cabinet decision. Now that means even before the minutes come, he assumes that things are done. It is sealed and the agreement is prepared. But on the 28th of March, Alexis Silva, Director-General writes to the Secretary, Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and to the Secretary, Ministry of Defence, Public Security, Law and Order, asking them whether there is any necessity or any interest for them to get involved in the discussion of this

1261 1262

particular transaction. So after signing the agreement only the letter comes asking as to whether they are interested in joining and whether there is anything that needs to be changed. So do you not think that there is some malice or prejudged action that is there? We are only looking at your own documents. So, this is why it arouses suspicion. So, that was on the 28th. Then a week later - on the 11th of April 2007, under the following heading - he writes to all of them. It states, I quote: FIRST MEETING OF THE CABINET APPOINTED COMMITTEE RE: SALE OF SHARES OF SRI LANKA TELELCOM LIMITED (SLT) BELONGING TO NTT COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION TO GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS HOLDINGS N.V. (GTH) So, what I am asking is, if Dialog sells 10 per cent of the shares tomorrow, will the PERC call Dialog and ask, What are you selling? What are you doing? Do you want to get involved? Hon. Minister, this is what we want to know. The Hon. Deputy Minister of Finance is supposed to speak after me. Please give a logical conclusion. Do not just say that the UNP gets up and is talking from the skies. We are talking from documents you yourselves have given us. These are not things that are secretive. I am tabling* all these documents. Hon. Deputy Speaker, I would like to ensure -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! Hon. Member, you have to conclude your speech by 1.10 p.m. as there are two speakers from the Government side to speak.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) But we have been given 35 minutes and 40 minutes.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, all that is inclusive.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) How can it be? We have 35 minutes and 40 minutes.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) We have to finish this Debate at 2 o clock.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Forty minutes have been given to the UNP and 35 minutes have been given to the TNA. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You started your speech apparently at 12.35 p.m. . ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) The TNA is not speaking. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, the TNA is not speaking. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The TNA time has also been included in your - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, no there is 40 minutes and 35 minutes separately. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) I have given instructions to - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Instructions of what? You said at 2 o clock the Debate is over. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You were allotted 40 minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, Sir, and 35 minutes which had not been - ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Now I have given the allotted 40 minutes to you and if you need an answer from the Government you have to allow the Government to speak.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Certainly, there is 30 minutes allotted. And I can give them 35 minutes if they require. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) No, it is up to the Chair to give the allotted time. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) But we are the ones who determine the time that is allotted. The Debate is in our hands and we will allot that time. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Not you, the Chief Opposition Whips office has allotted the time. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, the Hon. Ranjith Aluvihare stated that the balance time will be given to me. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) I think we are wasting time arguing about time. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is what you always do when you are in the Chair, I must say that. [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) That is my job. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) There is a document written by Ralph Marshal on the 3rd of April 2007, which very clearly speaks of the Meeting that took place on 22nd February with further instructions on what needs to be done. Sir, I table* the page which gives the Member Companies in the UTSB Group and I want it to be printed in HANSARD.

On page 14 under "Comments by PERC", it states, I quote:

"As above, it has been stated that, * GTH, ....... , has a solid track record as a telecommunications operator with a leading position in Malaysia....... * Having had extensive discussions with GTH,......" Now, I do not understand what this extensive "solid track record" is, when this company has been newly formed and has no trading background at all. It further states, I quote: "Whereas, as per the 2nd paragraph in the same letter, it has been stated that GTH was incorporated recently in the Netherlands Antilles and GTH has no employees and CEO. As such it is questionable as to what extent NTT's assessment and recommendations are reliable. This is what PERC says. The PERC is a professional entity even though they have done very many non-professional activities that we found through the COPE. But at least even now listen because they would be summoned by COPE again before too long. Then on page 16 of the same document under "Comments by PERC", it states, I quote: "As above, the Fixed Line operation of Maxis is very marginal." We would like the Hon. Deputy Minister of Finance to tell us, if Maxis has a connection, what connection it has got because we very clearly said in the Usaha Tegas Group Holding, Maxis is a subsidiary of Usaha, the equity is 69 per cent and the GTH which comes in as a subsidiary has no involvement with Maxis at all. So, on that basis they are not comparing light with light. This is the irony of it and a deal which is questionable. Sir, due to lack of time, I am tabling* the document "Comments by PERC" which gives the "Revenue: Fixed Lines Vs Mobile" with the totals. This is a comparison that has been done by the PERC. It has been done very professionally. This needs to be questioned as to what it is and how it is going forward. Once these particular shares are sold - that is something which is neither in the interest of the Government nor any of us, because that is on the Stock Exchange - then the next question is, why is the Government giving this management right? That is the sole reason why we, in the United National Party are saying that we will absolutely disown all action that is done and undo what is done like what some political parties did, making a big noise after they came to power on the tax amnesty et cetera. We are saying this with all authority, with all sincerity and being Sri Lankan at heart. We are not talking Malaysia by night, Sri Lanka by daytime and Japan by morning. All we want to know is,

* . . Placed in the Library.

* . . Placed in the Library.

1265 1266

why is the management being given to an X company which has no staff, which has no trading and which only happens to be a company registered in Netherlands being a subsidiary affiliated to Malaysia. The Government says that they are anti-privatization and that they do not want privatization. Then why are you creating one? Then the next point is, if by chance they still want to give this management out for reasons best known - we are happy to see that they are at least pursuing some of the good things that the United National Party had done - then why do they not go through a tender process? If the Cabinet Paper was put for a tender going on the basis that we should give the management rights to X, Y, or Z, that is different. But that is not what is there. It only integrally covers the sale of the shares which has no relevance and no right to be interfered. So, that needs a very categorical answer. At this particular moment, owing to the fact that many aspersions were cast on the United National Party's stand, I table* a document under the heading, "Statement Issued by the United National Party." It says, I quote: The Agreement entered into between the Government of Sri Lanka and NTT for the management of Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) is not favourable to Sri Lanka. The NTT seeks now to exit the Joint Venture Agreement by selling its shares in the SLT. The UNP is committed to the principle of SLT being a public private venture but also recognizes the need to cancel the existing Management Agreement. Therefore, the UNPs decision is that the present Management Agreement with NTT must be cancelled. The Government should buy back the shares of NTT and call for offers from genuine telecom companies interested in investing in SLT and enter into a new agreement favourable to both parties. Then, while mentioning that, I would also like to table* the SLT Shareholders Agreement of 4th April, 2007. On page 12, paragraph 9 states, I quote: "Management of SLT The destiny of an entity, be it whatever ownership, lies in the Board of Directors and most definitely in the Managing Director or the Chief Executive Officer. Here is the relevant area which says about the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Operating Officer. I will read 9.1 (a) to (c) of the same paragraph, because it is relevant. It states, I quote: (a) GOSL and GTH must exercise their voting rights to appoint a GTH Director nominated by GTH as the CEO of SLT. (b) The appointment of :

(i) the Chief Executive Officer of SLTs key operating Subsidiaries and Associated Companies (as appropriate ); and (ii) the appointment of Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer of both SLT and its key operating Subsidiaries and Associated Companies (as appropriate),

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) , .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, just give me two more minutes.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . .

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . .

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It further states , I quote: shall be Restricted Matters to be decided by the Board of Directors in accordance with clause 7.1. (c) Prior to appointing any person as a GTH Director and nominating that person to be the CEO, GTH will consult with GOSL and consider GOSLs views. Now, if this is the right, it has to have a mandate. That is to consider the Governments views as they are the biggest shareholder. So, in legal terms it can be called a very lazy and a lackadaisical deal which the Government has absolutely no control. Then going on further, on page 15 of this Agreement, under paragraph 16.1, you find "Termination events."

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you can table that Agreement. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, then I will table that and also just read two lines. It says, I quote: This Agreement may be terminated by GTH or GOSL (as the case may be) upon the occurrence of any of the following events:- (a) by either GTH or GOSL ( the non-defaulting party ) upon ninety (90) days written notice, if the other party ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Sorry, Hon.
