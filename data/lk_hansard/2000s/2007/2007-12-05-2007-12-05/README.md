( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) , * * : Answer tabled () . . () (i) . (ii) . () (i) . (ii) . () . () . : : SRI LANKAS RESPONSE TO UNESCO DIRECTOR-GENERALS STATEMENT: STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama - Minister of Foreign Affairs) , . The Statement to be made by me is in response to the statement already made by the UNESCO Director-General.

In a public statement made from Paris on 3rd December, 2007, through the UNESCO Press Release No. 2007-154 titled Director-General condemns bombing of rebel radio station in Northern Sri Lanka", it was stated, I quote: "Director-General of UNESCO Koichiro Matsuura has condemned the air strikes on the Voice of Tigers radio station that killed five of the stations staff. A total number of more than 10 people are reported to have been killed in the attack. 'I condemn the bombing of the Voice of Tigers radio station' the Director-General declared, 'regardless of the content of the broadcasts aired by the Voice of Tigers, there can be no excuse for military strikes on civillian media. Such action contravenes the Geneva Convention which requires the military to treat media workers as civilians. Killing media personnel is not going to help reconciliation and I urge the authorities to ensure respect for the basic human rights of freedom of expression'. The press release further states, I quote: Sri Lankan army planes struck the radio station near Kilinochchi in the North of the country on the afternoon of 27th November. Voice of Tigers is the radio station of the Tamil Tiger rebels. Ten civilians are said to have been injured in the attack. There are conflicting reports about the total number of casualties. Upon learning of the statement by the Director-General of UNESCO Koichiro Matsuura, our Ambassador in France and Permanent Delegate to the UNESCO, Mrs. Chitranganie Wagiswara was instructed by me to register Sri Lankas strongest protest at the said statement in which the Director-General has condemned the air strikes on the Voice of Tigers (VoT) radio station, which has been described as a civilian radio station. In a letter of protest from the Government of Sri Lanka addressed to the Director-General of UNESCO, the Ambassador noted that : (1) the Government was surprised that the UNESCO saw it fit to issue such a statement on an attack on a clandestine radio station directly operated by the LTTE, a well-known terrorist organization, which is proscribed in a number of countries including India, the United States of America, Canada as well as the member states of the European Union; (2) only two days before the UNESCO statement, the LTTE exploded a bomb in the Colombo suburbs killing 19 innocent civilians including women and children and that earlier the same day an LTTE female suicide cadre made a failed attempt to assassinate a Cabinet Minister who belongs to the Tamil community ; (3) the Voice of Tigers is neither legal nor legitimate and its programme content promotes and glorifies terrorism and hence it cannot be considered as a "civilian" radio station. In the same vein, those employed at the Voice of Tigers facility cannot be considered as civilian media personnel;

2273 2274

[ ]

(4) reference in the UNESCO Director Generals statement to the Geneva Convention is totally out of context and not applicable as there is no war or confrontation between two sovereign states in Sri Lanka; (5) the LTTE radio facility is in contravention to all internationally accepted norms and that no international convention could give protection to this illegal radio station operated by a terrorist group, the letter asserts that being a propaganda organ of a terrorist group, the Voice of Tigers radio station was a legitimate target for attack in the fight against terrorism in Sri Lanka; (6) it would have been much more appropriate had the Director-General obtained all the facts relating to the incident prior to issuing this ill-informed statement; (7) the Government of Sri Lanka remained deeply perturbed by the contents of his statement and demanded the retraction of the Director-Generals statement; Hon. Speaker, the Director-General was out of Paris yesterday and is scheduled to meet our Ambassador on Thursday, 6th December, 2007 and the Government of Sri Lanka will bring all pressure possible to have the UNESCO totally retracting the statement the Director-General has made so ill-advisedly. Further, Hon. Speaker, we will not permit any organization to be a vehicle for the LTTE to carry out their modes of operation in various manifestations and forms to be surfaced and tolerated and will exercise all means that are within our command as the Government of Sri Lanka and see that all retractions, corrections are always made by the relevant agencies and authorities in the international arena.

Mr. Speaker, thank you for giving me this opportunity - [ ]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Speaker, it is a very important matter that the Hon. H.M. Wasantha Samarasinghe raised in this House. I also wish to add on another very important point to what the Hon. Member has said. Firstly, Dr. P.B. Jayasundara has no right at all to say anything to what has been Stated in this House Further, he has when misled the Supreme Court. When Appropriation Bill, 2008 was presented before this House, there were eight parties that went before the Supreme Court. Within seven days the Supreme Court has to communicate its determination to The Hon. Speaker. During that period the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance submitted an affidavit to the Supreme Court stating the reason for adding Clause 6 to the Appropriation Bill. He said that if was added owing to the fact that there were certain exigencies and insufficient time to come before Parliament for approval . Mr. Speaker, he made as incorrect statement ot the Supreme Court. This economic hit man is hitting the economy. If he hits his personal money, it does not matter. But he misled the Supreme Court.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , . - [ ] I am taking this matter up now as the Chairman of the Committee on Public Accounts, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem is here. I thought it would be discourteous when he to take it up when he is not here. The Hon. Rauff Hakeem mentioned certain activities of the Department of Inland Revenue. Remember, Mr. Speaker, that monies collected by the Department of Inland Revenue have to go to the Ministry of Finance and any refund has to come back from the Ministry of Finance to the Department of Inland Revenue. In that case, the Hon. Chairman of the Committee on Public Accounts did not reveal to this House as to how the approval of the Ministry of Finance has been obtained to refund monies. He has Stated half the truth. Going on further, under the requirement of the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, No. 3 of 2003, this House must be kept informed of the Appropriation Bills approved and subsequently if there are variances, those variances also need to be nofitified to the House. This was not done in 2006 and 2007. But in 2008, owing to the legal action that has been taken -we have taken certain actions according to the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act - ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Mervyn Silva)

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court has been mislied the Parliament has been mislied, I am tabling* pages 44 to 53 of the Fiscal Management Report- 2008 dated 07th November, 2007 issued by the Ministry of finance and Planning. According to this report monies have been spent on the purchase of vehicles for the Chief Government Whips office. Are these urgent expenditure to be spent under Head 240, Department of National Budget? Mr. Speaker, would you permit me on Friday to make a statement in relation to what the Hon. H. M. Wasantha Samarasinghe raised because the Supreme Court has been misled.

: : PRIVILEGE : THREATS TO LIFE

( ) (The Hon. Abdul Bais Kamardeen)

Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring to the immediate attention of this House the law lessness prevailing in of Puttalam and the threat it poses to the tranquil life of the town. With great pain of mind, I would like to draw the attention of this House to the fact that I have become a prime target of the criminal elements of Puttalam. This is a violation of my privileges as a Member of this superior legislative body of this country. Mr. Speaker, on the 01st of December, 2007 at about 10.30 p.m., I was invited as a Member of Parliament and the Deputy Minister of Livestock Development to meet a group of leading businessmen of Puttalam in order to discuss some important matters at the residence of Mr. Ali Shabri, a prominent businessman of the Town at Spill Road, Puttalam. At the entrance of Mr. Ali Shabris residence, I happened to have a chat with a few supporters of mine when a Canter vehicle bearing registered No. LD - 3195 passed us at fiercely excessive speed. At first, I did not pay attention to it and went to meet the people waiting for me inside the house. In the course of the meeting, I received a telephone call from an acquaintance of mine that a group of underworld men were coming to Puttalam with the intention of attacking me. I hardly had any time to consider that information and I decided to deal with it after the meeting. While I was at the meeting, the same vehicle had come back at the same speed along the road, reckless knocked down a driver of mine, Mr. Mujeeb and sped away. This was brought to my knowledge when I came out of the house of Mr. Ali Shabri and at once I decided to proceed to the police to lodge a complaint. Mr. Speaker, when I went to the Puttalam Police, I was rather shocked to see the same vehicle parked inside the police compound. I was told that the owner of the vehicle was under death threat and for safety purposes the vehicle was taken under the police custody after lodging a complaint by its owner. I made a complaint to the SSP as well as the Puttalam Police to inquire about that possibility of any underhand activity which could endanger my life. I informed the police the names of the three people who were travelling in the Canter at the time my driver was knocked down. Unfortunately, the Puttalam Police failed to bring the culprits to book, The following morning the Canter too was released. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, the media, especially a few Sinhala media always spin baseless crime stories and associate my name with such criminal activities

undermining the threats I encounter from the criminal elements. The criminal elements want to portray myself as the most controversial politician of this country with the help of the media. I presume that the electronic media too frequently violate my Parliamentary privileges by broadcasting fabricated stories in their news programmes. I ping my hopes on this superior House that action will be taken to protect my Parliamentary privileges. Thank you. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) 2008 . ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) , .

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem-Minister of Posts and Telecommunication) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Sir, at the very outset let me thank the Members of both sides of the House who made their contributions to the Committee Stage Debate of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunication. Thankfully I have been spared most of the time since the attention of most of the Members was on the Ministry of Media. Sir, today, in the changing world, media and telecommunication are very inter-related subjects. But however, we today have separated these subjects and I am responsible for the area of posts and telecommunication. I find that there are a variety of issues that the Members dealt with this morning. The primary one among them is, related to a committee which I had appointed to go into certain allegations regarding irregularities and corruptions in the Department of Posts. Due to a variety of deficiencies in generating its revenue, the Department of Posts has been operating with a deficit for the last 15 to 20 years. This Department made an operating deficit of Rs. 800 million in the year 2004 and has reached a staggering Rs.2,600 million in the year 2006. However, Sir, I am very happy to say that after we took, certain steps particularly to revise the postal rates in April this year and due to other business activities we were able to put in place, we have now come to a position - with the estimated revenue for this year reaching Rs. 4000 million to get over the deficit if not for the large amount of recurrent expenditure that we have to incur, particularly, as a result of several salary increases that this Government ever since 2004 had introduced. This has resulted in our recurrent expenditure going up by a very large amount and particularly among the recurrent

expenditure portfolio almost 90 per cent of the funds go towards salaries and overtime payments. That being the case and the department having almost 23,000 employees we had to face this difficult situation. But however I have, with a view to arrest this situation, appointed a special unit for postal reforms comprising six members from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunication, Department of Posts and Department of National Budget and they were entrusted with the task of formulating new services and products which could generate more revenue for the Department. The special unit has identified the following areas for development and has prepared several proposals for implementation. They are: 1. Postal network improvement. 2. Introducing new business activities (business mail services). 3. Regularizing existing business activities. 4. Modernizing central mail exchange activities. 5. Improving working conditions at post offices with new buildings, equipment and machinery. 6. Introducing electronic money transfer service. There were several discussions with the officials of the Department of National Budget and the Department of National Planning to secure necessary funds for these projects. It is with profound happiness I wish to state that the Treasury has made necessary allocations to cover three years from 2008 to introduce these new reforms which will bring large expected revenue other than our normal postal activities. We expect to have an allocation of Rs. 300 million extending over the next three years particularly for the Postal Network Improvement Project. This project will provide On Line facilities and connect, in the first phase, 637 post offices islandwide. Thereafter we expect to expand that to the sub post office network as well in order to provide more and more agency and value added services to customers. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) , . . , . , , . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER took the Chair. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Chairman, I was referring to the new Postal Network Improvement Project which hopefully will be put in place within the first quarter of next year and through that we would be able to enhance the capacity of

2399 2400

9 PL 002841 (2008/02)

post offices to accept all financial transactions on behalf of all private and public organizations. All financial institutions, telecom service providers, insurance companies et cetera will opt for joint venture business activities with the Department of Posts. In addition to this, Sir, all private and public sector organizations are moving towards outsourcing all their mail activities and it is time that the Department of Posts also steps into this area. Today there is a private firm called, Topan Form (Pvt.) Ltd. which has taken over a part of this business. That has become a serious matter of concern for trade unions and I am in full agreement with them that we must get this business back to us and this is an area where the Department of Posts can itself handle business mail. To do that, with our expertise in mail handling business, we will have to offer mail handling services to all private and public sector institutions which hopefully will generate a very large revenue. Sir, as it is, I have the figures for this year, the revenue from the business mail. From the bulk mail we have got Rs. 165 million; from the business mail at the Central Mail Exchange, we have got Rs. 421.4 million and from franking machine revenue we have got Rs 914 million. Almost Rs. 1,500 million we have already earned from the business mail section, and of which the Central Mail Exchange contribution is almost 39 per cent whereas outstation contribution has been 61 per cent. This is certainly an improvement considering the earlier years. Therefore, with the estimated figure for December all expected revenue with various other sectors including sales of stamps will come up to almost Rs. 4,000 million and that is certainly an achievement that we have been able to reach after revision in our postal rates. But with the revision of the postal rates too we faced some initial hiccups and certain problems. We will be doing a further revision in order to streamline some of the confusions that have arisen in certain areas, particularly, when it comes to registered postal articles in excess of 30 grams. We would like to introduce some changes so that the burden on the poor masses can be reduced and for every additional 30 grams we would like to bring it down to an additional five rupees rather than the present figure together with that even the parcel rates. There is a slight drop due to our new rate introduction and therefore there again we will have to revise some of those rates in order to catch up with lost quantities that is going to other service providers such as courier handlers in this country. Together with that, we also propose to modernize the Central Mail Exchange activities. The Central Mail Exchange which was opened in 1996 has some very old and outdated equipment and machinery which hampers its day to day operations. This exchange needs new machinery and equipment such as sorting machines, stamp cancelling machines, computers et cetera in order to provide a better working environment for the employees

and good business environment for the customers. This automation programme will definitely enhance the performance of the mail exchange which in turn will help to earn more revenue. We are also thinking of introducing Electronic Money Transfer Service and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the Department of Posts have called for Expressions of Interests from worldwide Fund Transfer Service Providers in order to commence a joint venture business partnership to provide inward remittance service. The introduction of this service will facilitate all Sri Lankans living or working in foreign countries to remit their earnings back to any part of Sri Lanka within a few minutes. This partnership will enable the post to market its larger network of post offices to facilitate receipt of funds into the hands of the ordinary citizens living in remote and rural areas of Sri Lanka. Mr. Chairman, I would like at this juncture to refer to certain comments made by the Hon. Members of the Tamil National Alliance, raising certain issues in the Eastern Province. , - , , , , . 6,000 - . , . , , . , . , . . - . , .

Mr. Chairman, I would like to say a few words about the telecommunication sector. Actually, the posts and telecommunication sector is contributing almost 20 per cent of GDP of this country. Therefore, it is a very important sector which attracts a very large amount of foreign investment. You would have seen in the Sunday newspapers the newly announced charges and the changes to Sri Lankas telephone tariffs, particularly in the mobile phone sector, which have now been made the lowest postpaid prices for low and medium users in South Asia. According to LIRNEasia, a regional think tank, we have achieved this particular target. At the end of March, 2007, there were 5.9 million active mobile phone subscriptions in this country, suggesting that the actual number at this time is close to 7 million. In addition, there were over two million fixed phones including the wireless CDMA phones. Survey data shows that more than 50 per cent of the households in Sri Lanka now have some kind of phone, fixed or mobile. For the first time in the history, the latest numbers show that the Western Province, home to less than 30 per cent of the population, now has slightly less than 50 per cent of the fixed telephones in the country. It is not that more people have stopped getting connected in the Western Province, but even more people are getting connected in the hitherto neglected provinces other than the Western Province. Extrapolation of household survey data shows that households possessing some form of telephone are rapidly increasing in other provinces, showing that much of the massive growth in mobile phones usage, which was more than two million in the year 2006 alone, is actually occurring in the previously neglected provinces such as the Wayamba and the North Central Province.

Not only is the telecom sector bringing dividends directly to the people, but also to the Government and thereby, indirectly, to the people again. The Fiscal Management Report that was distributed to the Hon. Members shows that the Government is projecting the telecom sector as the largest contributor to Government revenue among various other Government owned profit-making entities in 2007. The TRC has contributed almost Rs. 4,500 million and the Sri Lanka Telecom has contributed almost Rs. 2,000 million to the Government coffers. There again, Sir, while this - ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) What about the North and the East? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) In the North and the East, we are carrying on a very large network improvement exercise. In fact, we are connecting the Uva Province together with Batticaloa and various other areas with a fiber network and that network is nearing completion. Once that completion takes place, the network improvement in those areas will be at a very high level. There again, we must say that we cannot be complacent since, in the world context, we still have a lot of room for improvement. A major international data reporting service has announced that the worldwide mobile phone penetration passed the 50 per cent mark on 29th November, 2007. That is, one out of two human beings on this planet today is carrying a mobile phone. India is connecting eight million subscribers in a single month now. That is, connecting more than the total mobile phone customers in Sri Lanka in one month. The Maldives has more than 87 active mobile phone SIMs per one hundred people. That can be explained by the higher per capita income of that country. Pakistan, with a per capita income of around half that of Sri Lanka, now has more than 40 active mobile phone SIMs per one hundred people. Because of early reforms and significant private investment, Sri Lanka pulled ahead of other South Asian countries and is even now at the forefront of technological and market developments. Yet, we cannot be complacent. The Maldives is ahead of us; Pakistan has overtaken us on the mobile phone sector and we are ahead of them overall only because of the CDMA-fuelled growth on the side of fixed lines. We must, therefore, do more. Only 30 out of 100 people in Sri Lanka have mobile phones when the world average is 50 out of one hundred. There is a tremendous hunger for broadband connectivity of adequate quality among our companies and our people so that they too can participate in the exciting world of the internet and benefit from the economic, cultural, educational and other opportunities afforded by new technologies and services. We must, at least, remove the road blocks that stand in the way of multiple operators supplying these needs.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Minister, you may table the rest of your speech. We will include it in Hansard. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) With your permission, Sir, I table* the rest of my speech. Finally, Sir, may I take this opportunity to thank my Secretary, Mr. Piyasena, Additional Secretary and other Senior Assistant Secretaries in the Ministry, my personal staff, the new Postmaster General, Mr. Dissanayake, the former Postmaster General, Mr. Shirvin Senadheera and other officials including the Deputy Postmasters General from various parts of the country for having extended their co-operation to me during this year in the conduct of affairs of my Ministry. Thank you very much.

: : Rest of the speech tabled: Our legislation was last revised in 1996, but most of it dates from 1991.S This 16-year old piece of legislation is clearly obsolete and inappropriate for todays technological and market conditions. It is a road block that must be removed. The whole world is beginning to look at the radio frequency spectrum as one of the most valuable assets belonging to the public. Much of the billions revenues generated by the TRC for the Government come not from license fees, but from spectrum charges. But we can make even more money from spectrum if only we approach its management in a systematic and intelligent way. For example, many countries are beginning to replace analog TV channels that waste a lot of spectrum with digital TV channels that use fewer frequencies and give better picture quality as well. The freed-up frequencies are being given the mobile and broadband applications. Lack of right frequencies at the right time is a major road block on the way to the information society. We have to take concerted action to remove these barriers. Many countries have spent a lot of effort on designing incentives for TV channels to make the transition to digital, and are well on the way to designing efficient and transparent mechanisms to assign the freed-up frequencies to mobile broadband other uses. This is especially the case with the 700 mega Hertz Band that the International Telecommunication Union recently designated for mobile broadband. However, despite the resources at the disposal of the Telecom Regulatory Commission, we have made very little progress in planning for future technologies, content simply to issue more and more frequencies to the analog TV licenses given by the Government that will make the tasks of introducing digital TV and freeing up frequencies for new services even more costly and difficult. Together with updating the legislation, we need to update the outlook and attitudes of the TRC so that it becomes an independent, future-oriented, proactive and professional organization befitting the most dynamic industry in the country. With the liberalization of the international telecom segment in 2003, we saw the emergence of the business process outsourcing or BPO industry in Sri Lanka. More than 4,000 well-paying jobs that earn export

income for the country have been created in a short time. My Ministry will examine the problems these firms face in obtaining reasonably priced leased lines of adequate quality which is an essential input. Our common objective must be the creation of more jobs in the BPO sector to reduce the pressure on Government for jobs. I am gratified that local entrepreneurs and socially conscious city-based enterprises are collaborating on moving jobs from Colombo to the rural areas, using the concept of rural shoring or rural BPOs. Examples range from Machavilachchiya on the border of Wilpattu to Koslanda in the Badulla District. For them too. The lack of reasonably priced leased lines of adequate quality is a problem. Bringing market discipline to the leased-line market will be a priority of the policy setting exercise that will be undertaken by my Ministry. Everyone knows about the major contribution made to our economy by the expatriate workers in the Middle East, who work under difficult conditions and remit their savings home. Unfortunately, the means that have been available for this have not been the most convenient nor the most inexpensive. Now with local banks and telecom operators entering into mobile payments or m-payments, there is potential for low-cost, secure and convenient mechanisms being created for inward remittances by expatriate workers to their families. In devising modem legislation and policies for the communications sector, my Ministry will ensure that the road blocks to these kinds of pro-poor innovations are removed keeping in mind the need for security and other safeguards. Telecom has become the most successful industry in Sri Lanka yielding benefits to all stakeholders, including the employees of the Government Department that since became Sri Lanka Telecom PLC. Consumers are getting a good service at declining prices, the operators are making good profits and reinvesting them in Sri Lanka, and the Government is getting the benefits of a steady source of income for balancing the budget. Sri Lanka Telecom PLC today has fewer employees than it had in 1990. while increasing the number of connections more that fifteenfold. Yet the industry as a whole creates tremendous numbers of jobs throughout the value chain, starting from the people who sell prepaid cards and repair mobile phones to the Sri Lankan software firms that are carving out a distinctive niche in mobile being generated by growth appliactations. All evidence points to economic growth in telecom use. The lessons from telecom must be learned by the postal side of my Ministry. Today, the postal service is a drain on the Treasury. Customers are unhappy about the quality of service they receive and are increasingly bypassing the Postal Department. The employees are also not happy, as shown by their tendency to announce strikes at the slightest excuse. Their colleagues on the telecom side were once highly skeptical about the value of reforms in industry and their organization and opposed them. But today. They are earning much more than their colleagues on the postal side and, I am sure, are much happier, working in a modem organization that places emphasis both on efficiency and taking care of employees. I take this opportunity to seek the co-operation of all to help modernize the postal sector so that it too can become a source of revenue for the Treasury rather than a drain. More money will have to be spent in the short term as we build consensus for change, but the long-term benefits of postal reform for the economy and all the stakeholders, will, I am sure, more than compensate.

ADJOURNMENT ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) , '' '' .

. . Question proposed.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . . . ARREST AND DETENTION OF TAMILS . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I am most thankful to you, Sir, and also to this august Assembly for having given me this opportunity to move this Adjournment Motion today of which, I in fact, gave notice in the morning of last Monday the 3rd of December. Now, with your permission, Sir, I move, Whereas more than a thousand Tamils who were arrested during the last few days by the police and the security forces, are now being detained at several police stations and the Boossa prison on the detention orders issued by the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, under the Emergency Regulations, without any valid reason whatsoever.

And whereas the said arrests and detentions of those Tamils as aforesaid are in gross violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed to them as citizens of Sri Lanka, under the Constitution and more particularly, Articles 12 and 13. This Parliament resolves that all those citizens who are on detention as aforesaid be released forthwith. Sir, when I gave notice of this Motion in the morning of last Monday, the figure of those who had been arrested and detained under the Emergency Regulations by virtue of detention orders purported to have been issued under the hand of the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence were in fact over a thousand. I must concede that the number has considerably decreased or rather lessened now and if I go by what the Minister Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle stated yesterday, in the morning, on the Floor of this august Assembly and thereafter in the afternoon or rather in the evening at a press conference, the number concerned stands a little over hundred. Let it be as it is. My contention, Sir, is that these detainees whether the number concerned is hundred, over hundred or two hundred, whatever it may be, are being detained in violation of their fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution and more particularly Article 12 and 13. I say so, Sir, for the reason that Article 12(1) states as follows. I quote: 12.(1) All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal protection of the law. Article 12(2), Sir, states as follows. I quote: 12.(2) No citizen shall be discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, language, caste, sex, political opinion, place of birth or any one of such grounds:"

2421 2422

2007 05

And there is a proviso to that. Article 13.(1) too on which I rely in regard to my Motion, states as follows. I quote: 13.(1) No person shall be arrested except according to procedure established by law. Any person arrested shall be informed of the reason for his arrest." Now, Sir, there is no denying of the fact that on the night of the last Friday and again on Saturday and Sunday there had been indiscriminate arrests of Tamils in the capital City of Colombo and its suburbs and certain other places in the South of Sri Lanka by the police and the armed forces cloaked with the powers under the Emergency Regulations. These are cases of indiscriminate arrests, random arrests without any reason whatsoever. I contend, Sir, that no one single citizen who was arrested was informed of the reason of his or her arrest as the case may be. No receipt was given as mandated under the Emergency Regulations. They were taken to the police stations, kept there and a sizeable number, a significant number were later detained on detention orders issued by the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence. It is my contention, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that out of more than 2500 Tamils or rather citizens, I would prefer to say, who were arrested 98 per cent were Tamils. There may be a few Sinhalese and a few Muslims who might have been picked up on various other grounds or with a view to give a picture as if there has been no discrimination on grounds of race or language or place of birth. But, these persons have been arrested from their houses, from buses and vans in which they were travelling and they were locked up and now, we find more than a hundred detained at Boossa. Mr. Deputy Speaker, there is no denying of the fact that in consequence of various political representations made by certain Hon. Members of this august Assembly belonging to the government, a good number of detainees have already been released. I have no grouse over that. I am really happy about that. But, there are hapless people, helpless people who know of anybody who can influence the government or for that matter the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, if I could put it in pure legal terms, to have these detention orders revoked. It is my contention that they are being detained unlawfully. They are being detained without any valid grounds whatsoever. One cannot be detained, Mr. Deputy Speaker, with the police or army saying that you are an LTTEer. There is no ground for that. One cannot be arrested with the armed forces or police saying that you have committed an offence under the Emergency Regulations. No. There are a series of Supreme Court decisions, a series of decisions running from that famous case of Rajitha Senaratne, no one other than the Hon. Minister and my good Friend, Rajitha Senaratne versus Punya de Silva case that was decided by the Supreme Court in 1995 and there is the other case, Selvakumar versus Devananda. It was no one other than the Hon. Minister, again my good Friend Douglas Devananda,

which was decided in 1994 by the Supreme Court, which with doubt give to anybody, who can retain his basic sense of sanity, as to how an arrest under the Emergency Regulations should be effected and as to how a Detention Order could be made. But everything had been violated and I find Government officials including Hon. Ministers stating that persons who could not prove their identity were taken into custody and detained. There is no law in this country for detaining a person under the Emergency Regulations for his or her failure to prove his identity. If I do not have an Identity Card then that is a different matter altogether. I cannot be arrested. If I have already applied, got one and lost or did not have it at the time of arrest I cannot be dealt with in such a manner under the law. If I have not applied then that is a different matter altogether. That comes under the Registration of Persons (Amendment) Act, a punishable offence for not having applied and got a National Identity Card. One cannot be detained, Sir, on the whims and fancies of anybody in this country however mighty or powerful he or she may be. That is my contention. I am not on any political ground. I am on constitutional grounds because this concerns fundamental rights, sacred rights, the birth rights of each and every citizen of this country. In this country His Excellency the President is the most powerful, no doubt. He has the powers; Ministers have the powers; Deputy Ministers have the powers; police have the powers; armed forces have the powers. But when it comes to fundamental rights all are equal whether it is His Excellency the President; or for that matter the Hon. Prime Minister for whom I have the highest regards as a noble gentleman; or for that matter my learned Friend, my good Friend, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem; or for that matter my Colleagues of the TNA and, or for that matter an ordinary citizen wearing sarong and smoking a beedi tucking up his sarong and enjoying the free air in any evening on the roads of Colombo or its suburbs or any part of the country including the North and East. All are equal but, it has been violated. It has been violated because they were Tamils. Most of them were from the North and East. Their respective Identity Cards showed that their place of birth was, in fact, the North and East. Some are from the hill country. Just because they happened to be Tamils they have been arrested. My contention, Sir, is that there is no provision under the Emergency Regulations to arrest a person first and detain him later. I repeat. Apparently and obviously these detention orders have been made under Regulation 19, one of the Emergency Regulations dated 13th August 2005. If that is the position the detention orders would show unless tampered with after my contention. It cannot be a lawful law under the law because anybody who could read Regulation 19 (1) - I have a copy of the Emergency Regulations dated 13.08.2005 - would agree with me that the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence by a Detention Order must name the person, ordering the person to be taken into custody and detained and it is for the police or for the armed forces as the case may be, to carry out that order. There is no provision under the Emergency Regulations in regard to the powers given to the Secretary

2423 2424

of the Ministry of Defence to slam down a Detention Order on any citizen of this country who has his fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution and more particularly Articles 12 and 13, to deprive his freedom in this manner. The Supreme Court has repeatedly asserted, What are we doing?, we are refusing, the Government is refusing to abide by the judgments of the apex court, the judgments of the Final Court. That is my contention. It is not going to rest here but, this Parliament has judicial powers. That is exactly where I am. If this Constitution should be respected in to the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, however powerful he may be, I have no grouse in regard to that honourable gentleman, I have no grouse nor grievance, but the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence should uphold the Constitution for the reason that he has taken an oath under the Fourth Schedule to uphold the Constitution. That is my contention. This is a serious issue. If the Government wants us to abide by the Constitution it should uphold the Constitution. It should not violate the provisions of the Constitution, any Article of the Constitution and more particularly the Fundamental Rights enshrined in the Constitution. Sri Lanka had acceded to the Human Rights Conventions of 1966 and also to the First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and where are we now? That is my contention. The Secretary to the Ministry of Defence cannot act mechanically. There should be reasonable information, there should be reasonable suspicion, credible information. People are arrested, put into vans or buses, brought into police stations, locked up and I find Hon. Mr. Deputy Speaker, that some of these people were shifted from certain police stations to the detention camp, particularly Boossa for the reason that there was lack of accommodation. This is the situation. This is a tragedy. This is how my Friends in the JVP were treated, tortured, killed, massacred. Tamil youth were done to death, massacred. Again we have that chapter unfolding. Therefore Mr. Deputy Speaker thanking you for this opportunity, I dare say it is not too late for the Government to accept and release them. Please release them in the name of the Constitution. This Constitution as long as it is there should be upheld by all of us. I talk on the basis of Constitutional Rights and in the name of the Constitution. In the name of Fundamental Rights enshrined in the Constitution, I call upon the Government to act now though it is late. It is better to be late than never. My good Friend, the Hon. Thurairetnasingam I do believe and I do hope and I am very proud to say would second my Motion. I thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker.
