" " . - - . 1978 16 . , , " " "" . . . . . Question proposed.

[.. 10.41] ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Mr. Speaker, we have no objection to the principle of awarding degrees and converting it to a university. But what we see is -

( ) (The Hon. Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka ) It is already a - ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) No, it is not termed as a university in the Act. Now the problem is, this looks like a fraud that is perpetuated on the armed forces. It does not have the genuineness of it. And the other thing is, all the requirements or the requisites for a university are not found in this Act. If one were to read through the provisions of the original Act that was cited by the Hon. Prime Minister, the subsequent amendments and the amendment that is before this House does not give the requirements or the requisites of a university. If you read the Universities Act - I have it here before me - you will see that there are numerous items required. So, what the United National Party is suggesting is, let it be referred to a Standing Committee so that we can go through the whole process, examine in detail the original Act, the subsequent amendments and the amendment you are placing before this House today and then formulate something that will make a comprehensive university. By substituting for the word Academy the word University is not so simple because it has very serious effects. I do not know whether the Hon. Prime Minister will agree to it - [Interruption.] If that is the case we will have to refer it to a Standing Committee. Now, Sir, I will go further. If that is the case, very briefly, is there a University Senate? Now this Act does not speak of a Senate. In the Universities Act there is provision for a Senate and there are a series of requirements. I will come to that. Then there are the objectives. You are having the objectives of the old academy, not of the university. So it needs a change. Then we come to the faculties. Is there only one faculty or a series of faculties? What are the powers of the Senate? Are there any post-graduate courses and so on? There are so many items that required to be embodied in this Act. Now Sir, under Powers, duties and functions of a University, Section 29 ( j ) of the Universities Act states, I quote: to recognize the examinations passed and periods of learning or study pursued by persons seeking admission to, or by students of, the University at other universities or places of learning of university status as are equivalent to such examinations and periods of learning or study in the University, .. Then, Section 45 (2) (xiii) of the Act again very clearly states - I will read that also. I think the Hon. Prime Minister himself should be conversant with what is happening. Now Section 45(2) refers to the Powers, duties and functions of the Council that is being established.

2007 18 69 70

It states, I quote:

45. (2) Without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred upon it by subsection (1), the Council shall exercise, perform and discharge the following powers, duties and functions:-

(i) to hold, control and administer the property and funds of the University; (ii) to select a coat of arms for the University, and to determine the form, to provide for the custody and to direct the use, of the common seal of the University; (iii) to regulate and to determine all matters concerning the University in accordance with the provisions of this Act and of any appropriate Instrument; (iv) to administer any funds placed at the disposal of the University for specific purposes; (v) to receive and accept with the concurrence of the Commission, bequests, donations and grants of property to the University; (vi) to consider the annual report and the annual accounts of the University, and to submit such report and such accounts to the Court and to the Commission.

Like that, there are 16 such functions. Now those functions are not found in this Act. Then another requirement that we do not see is which we find in Section 46 (6) of the Universities Act, which states, I quote: Subject to the provisions of this Act and without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred upon it by subsection (5), the Senate shall exercise, perform and discharge the following powers, duties and functions:-" Those are powers of the Senate. Now, there are as much as seven or eight powers listed here. They are not found in this Bill. I think you will agree, it is not so simple to go through the amendments. Then under Section 48(3) once again there are so many requirements listed in the Universities Act. It states, I quote:

(3) Subject to the provisions of this Act, a Faculty shall exercise, perform and discharge the following powers, duties and functions-

(i) to consider and report on any matter referred to it by the Senate; (ii) subject to the control of the Senate, to regulate matters connected with teaching, examinations and research in the Departments of Study in the Faculty; (iii) to present recommendations and reports to the Senate on all matters connected with the courses of study..

And, so on and so forth. Then, it is necessary that this should be open to the outside world. There are people from various parts of the world who are interested in coming and obtaining degrees here because Sri Lanka is one country that has the most experience of terrorism. You see the terrorism that took place in 1971. You see the terrorism that took place in 1979, 1983 - the Tamil terrorists, international terrorists. The experiences that the Sri Lankan forces, the governments, the politicians will have are enormous. So now you have not provided for that; giving an opportunity for outside students to come and obtain the degrees.

Then, with regard to the postgraduate courses, no mention is made of that . We are all interested in this. It is a very good thing. The knowledge with regard to combat, techniques, strategy and administration of the armed forces are necessary and we must be thankful to Sir John Kotelawala for having established an Academy of this nature. For that, he donated nearly 50 acres of valuable land. Today it is worth millions and because of that our forces are able to meet the challenges coming forth from the various terrorist organizations. Therefore, we are all interested in the welfare of the army. We are all interested in their knowledge. We are all interested in their techniques. Their techniques of combat are very important and essential. I think the Standing Committee composing of members from all parties would be able to contribute tremendously in order to have a fully-fledged university, which would be recognized by the rest of the world. Now that is what is important. Just merely substituting a word may not be sufficient in order to obtain that status. My humble request to you, Sir, is that today we will suspend these proceedings and present this to a Standing Committee so that everyone can contribute towards it. There is so much that can be brought into this. Particularly the procedure, Sir, is very important, if not we will not get any international recognition. There will be the postgraduate courses but there is no mention of that. ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Prime Minister, may be we can pass it in the Second Reading and then put it to a Special Committee as the Hon. Member suggests. We all want this to succeed but there are terrible deficiencies. This is named after Sir John Kotelawala, one of our Prime Ministers, one of the leaders of our Party. I think the Hon. Speaker is aware. He has been a Minister of Education. If you study through that, it need not come under the UGC. But many provisions for a university postgraduate are missing and as he said this is only limited to military officers and public officers. There will be a big demand from outside world to come into this. So it is worthwhile having a Committee of the House, a separate Committee to study this, and we can come back within a few weeks time and pass the Third Reading so that we can make a success out of these universities. The Second Reading can be concluded today.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Now Sir, when we look at the life of General Sir John Kotelawala, he was an exemplary person, a person who was not only a politician but a fully-fledged General of the Sri Lankan Army. The sacrifices he had made and what he had done to the Army are commendable and on an occasion like this, we have to remember the donation that he had made to this country, to the armed

71 72

forces for the furtherance of their knowledge and in order to obtain academic achievements in their own field. But it is very sad today, Sir, to see the Generals of the day are no match to the quality and class of Sir John Kotelawala. He was a person who donated and gifted all what he owned during his lifetime. His properties, his household equipment, his furniture and everything at Kandawala was donated to the Academy as well as to some other social organizations. But what is happening today among our Generals is quite a contrast. The present day Generals are only concerned on amassing wealth, obtaining properties and plundering State funds. It is very unfortunate that it is so - [Interruption.] Colonels and all other high-ups in the army are indulging in money-making. This is what we have to study. If one reads the biography of Sir John Kotelawala who was a General - [Interruption.] I do not know. They are generated from your side mostly, not from ours. The people from our side, even Sir John was the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka whilst being a General in the Army. He set this example as to how an Army General should conduct himself and not plunder State funds. Sir, this is a very unfortunate situation. I am sad to mention this. This is what we hear and see in the newspapers. What is happening today in the armed forces? It is the talk of commissions, acquisition of lands, house and property and so on and so forth. So, I do not want to go further. The situation is extremely sad. Now, Sir, I remember reading that when Sir John Kotelawala completed 25 years as a legislator whilst being a General, all the Heads of States at that time in the whole world, the United States, Australia, India, and UK had all congratulated him for the great service that he had rendered as a legislator and as a Colonel of the Army. Anyway that is as regards him. I would now like to mention some of the problems that the present day Generals face. Sir, it is very sad to hear this. Now with regard to the Defence Ministry, what has taken place quite recently is regrettable, the blunders that the Defence Secretary and his team have made in recent times. I will, Sir, now refer to the recent visit to Delhi by the Committee of three VIPs that has caused much embarrassment to all of us. That is the visit to Delhi by the high-powered Committee to oversee the Indo-Lanka security. It transpired in the news very clearly. What is stated in the Daily News" of 7th September, 2007 is, I quote:

A high-powered committee has been set up to deal in matters affecting the security of India and Sri Lanka, Government sources said. This is what the Sri Lankan Government says. It further states, I quote:

This followed a meeting between two top delegations from India and Sri Lanka in September 3 and 4 in New Delhi.

The Lankan delegation comprised Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunga, Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and Senior Advisor to the President Basil Rajapaksa while the Indian Government was represented by its Defence Secretary Vijai Singh, Foreign Secretary Shiv Shankar Menon and Defence Advisor K.R. Narayanan. The country knows what happened there. That was subsequently exposed. The Indian Minister of External Affairs, obviously responding to the news item immediately rejected it, leaving it necessary for us to eat humble pie. So this is a very sad situation. The Government was forced to offer an apology to the Indian Government. The Indian Government got tough. They said, No nonsense, that the Sri Lankan Government must correct its position. They were very clear on that. But this apology which was to be given to the Indian Government did not appear in the front page. Now, what happened to that? This had been published on page 10 of the Daily News of 10th September which meekly states that there is no decision among those who participated in this discussion.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) No.Sir, that has no relevance..

(The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) But, this is not relevant to the particular topic. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) ? ? ( )

(The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) Accordint to the Standing Orders, he has to speak about something that is relevant to the particular topic. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) ? ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) How do you say that it is irrelevant? No, Sir, I cannot give my time. I will not give my time. . ( )

(The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) This is not relevant. Let me speak. He is saying something about a trip to India. How is that relevant to this particular topic? ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Otherwise? These are defence matters. The Government is trying to say that India and Sri Lanka have agreed on a Defence Council which we never had. India has denied it. If you do not read the newspapers I am not to be blamed. Please sit down. You know nothing.

75 76

( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) How is that relevant to the John Kotelawala Defence Academy ? This is nonsense.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) You know nothing about defence.

( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) I know everything about defence more than you.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Your little knowledge is taking you in the wrong direction. Now, Sir, there was no such decision. India came out very strongly that there was no such decision among those who participated in this discussion to establish an Indo-Lanka high-level Committee on Defence as stated in the report. The statement very unfortunately was issued under the report of the Policy Research and Information Unit of the Presidential Secretariat. Now, Sir, the problem here is this. What is the Government trying to do? Whom are they trying to mislead? Are they trying to show the country that the Indian Government is on the side of Sri Lanka? Or that India is for a military settlement? That is what we cannot understand. The defence establishments were very angry and the External Affairs Ministry officials have been livid that the Government of Sri Lanka was making an attempt to portray that they have won India on board for their military campaign. This was whilst India strongly believes that a settlement to the ethnic conflict could not be carried through a military offensive but a negotiated political process. They say this statement was aimed at creating an impression that the Indians were backing every move of the Rajapaksa administration. This is what is more important. If that was what was intended, it boomeranged badly and ended up in a diplomatic slap in the face of Sri Lanka. A senior Foreign Ministry official remarked that this has happened due to reasons that diplomatic personnel have been bypassed in these types of negotiations. This is the serious thing. Where is the Foreign Minister? The Foreign Minister or the Foreign Secretary was nowhere. So, Sir, we are extremely sorry for what is taking place. What is the plight of the country? What is our image in the eyes of the foreign countries if we are going to come out with falsehood of this nature? This is why I say the defence of this country is in jeopardy. You cannot go on making these false statements and try to mislead both, our own people as well as the international community. That is one matter.

Then, Sir, we come to the other matter. That is, as to what took place? "The Sunday Times" of 16th September, 2007, states, I quote: "Lanka told 'No KP here'." Another serious blunder. What they say is, I quote: " High-level team rushed to Bangkok but hits blank wall." What happened? This man was there. He was arrested. But, it was given undue publicity. As a result of that, the Sri Lankan Government tried to make capital out of this and they missed the bus. And see what the Thai officials say? They say, I quote: Despite media reports, both in Colombo and abroad about Mr. Pathmanathan's arrest, Thai authorities have vehemently denied the incident." Then, it goes on further to say, I quote: " ...Thai Government was .... ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . , [ ] .

, , [ ] . Whereupon MR. SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER [THE HON. GITANJANA GUNAWARDENA] took the Chair. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, I was on the question of "KP", the famous terrorist who smuggles arms into the country and the rest of the world. "The Sunday Times" of 16th September, 2007 reported that a western diplomatic source had said, I quote: "The Thai Government was upset that Sri Lanka did not maintain confidentiality over this move until matters were sorted out." That is the blunder, I say. People rush in the moment they get some information without looking at the consequences, giving publicity to it. As a result, the Thai Government did not want to take responsibility of arresting this man. The article further states, I quote: "Mr. Pathmanathan is a key LTTE member in charge of weapon smuggling and is wanted by the Indians also in connection with the assassination of the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi." We had a wonderful chance of getting information and arresting the sources from which weapons were coming into this country and the financial sources but due to blundering on the part of our people, we missed the opportunity and the Thai Government was also thoroughly displeased at the way in which Sri Lanka was acting.

Then there is the other matter, the very serious situation we are going to face again on account of certain blunders that have been made by the Government through the Ministry of Defence, Public Security, Law and Order. What is that? Again "The Sunday Times" of 16th September reports, I quote: "US Senate turns against Lanka". Never have we had a situation like this in this country. There have been various times at which strictures had been passed on Sri Lankan Governments with regard to various other matters, but this is more serious; this is the worst I have ever seen. "US Senate turns against Sri Lanka". It is a severe blow. The article goes on to state as Section 690 of the document saying, I quote: "None of the funds appropriated by this Act under the heading 'Foreign Military Financing Programme' may be made available for assistance for Sri Lanka, no defence export licence may be issued, and no military equipment or technology shall be sold or transferred to Sri Lanka pursuant to the authorities contained in this Act or any other Act, unless the Secretary of State certifies and reports to the Committees on Appropriations that - ........" What is the use of having defence universities or academies if we are not going to get this assistance, the training that the US Government used to give our armed forces and the equipment that we have been given? I remember this was discontinued earlier. It was the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe who went to the US in 2002, met the President and managed to revise this. So much so, that immediately we got a ship for the Sri Lanka Navy for surveillance in the coastal areas. That was revised with great difficulty by our Leader. Now you have gone and upset the whole thing and we are not going to receive anything. As reported in the article, what does Section 690 further state? It states that assistance would be given if the Secretary of State certifies that, I quote: "(1) the Sri Lankan military is suspending and the Sri Lankan Government is bringing to justice members of the military who have been credibly alleged to have committed gross violations of human rights, including extrajudicial executions and the recruitment of child soldiers;...." These are some of the offences that are being committed here on which the US wants remedial measures taken. Then, it further states, I quote: "(2) the Sri Lankan Government has agreed to the establishment of a field presence of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Sri Lanka." It is very unfortunate that sometimes our Government officials, Ministers call the UN officials terrorists and all sorts of chronic names. The official statement caused ripples of anger. It is something very serious, which I would like to bring to the notice of the House. Why can the Government not comply with these two requirements? It is not a very difficult thing. If you do not do that the repercussions will be severe. Mind you, because of the human rights violation record, with the EU, the European community, Japan, Australia and the UK, you are going to face much worse repercussions. It may be that the aid flow to Sri Lanka might deplete; it might go down.

There will be no further aid coming into Sri Lanka. It is much needed, there is no doubt about it; particularly, military aid if you are going to fight the terrorists. Today the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, Public Security, Law and Order says that there is no settlement, there is no peace process, there is going to be no peace in this country and it has to be a military solution. If that is the case, then you require foreign aid and assistance from India or the UK or the US or even from other parts of the world. You are not going to get any of those things, if that is the case. If you are going for a peaceful settlement, a peace process and peace discussions, then it would be different. In a situation otherwise, I think these enactments that are going to come from the US will have very severe effects on solving our problems locally and that is the reason why I say the Government should comply with the recommendations that have been made by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. Thank you, Sir. [. . 11.06] . . ( ) ( () . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala - Minister of Higher Education) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I am happy to follow my learned Friend, the Hon. John Amaratunga who displayed his capacity and ability for irrelevancies. The purpose of this piece of legislation is to elevate the status of the Sir John Kotelawala Defence Academy to that of a university. The "Mahinda Chintana", that realistic package of policies, under the title "Protecting the State" states that a new National Security University will be established for the purpose of providing theoretical and practical courses and programmes to build up a national security force with high morale, excellent training and strict discipline. I would like to begin by answering the couple of questions which my good Friend, my learned Friend, the Hon. John Amaratunga raised in the course of his speech. In respect of the Sir John Kotelawala Defence Academy, Sir, it has a Board of Studies which is the equivalent of a Senate. In any university, the Senate is the highest academic body. It is the body which takes all decisions pertaining to academic matters. The matters which you raised and the matter which the Hon. Leader of the Opposition raised could be handled perfectly by the Senate which they are proposing to create once the university status has been given to the Sir John Kotelawala Defence Academy. - [Interruption.] Do not interrupt me. I do not want to give way. Do not interrupt. The number of departments of study in this particular Academy are the Department of Civil Engineering, the Department of Mechanical Engineering, the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, the Department

79 80

of Languages, the Department of Humanities and the Department of Social Sciences. Already six departments of study are functioning at the Sir John Kotelawala Defence Academy, which means these departments could be converted into faculties and the Faculty Board will recommend to the Senate as to what needs to be done in respect of that discipline. In addition, - [Interruption.] Please do not interrupt me. In addition, the following are the Bachelor's degrees which if confers: BSc Engineering, BSc Management, BCom, BEd. Then there are postgraduate courses. Postgraduate courses are already conducted by this Academy and then there is a Master's degree course in Management. The number of graduates already registered with the Academy is 1,510 and 95 students have already been registered for the Master's degree, which means this particular institution has all the academic facilities which a university needs. In addition, the Sir Kotelawala Defence Academy is a member of the Association of Commonwealth Universities. Since 1996, all our universities are members of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, which means they will be able to get students to come here to do postgraduate courses in this university. Therefore, all the things which you mentioned, all the things to which the Hon. Leader of the Opposition referred could be tackled once the status is given and it has to be done on the basis of the directives given by the University Grants Commission under that particular provision in the Act to which the Hon. Prime Minister referred. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) There is nothing in the Bill. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Dissanayake) . . . . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala) , degree-awarding status 1978 . , . . . Now, I would like to make use of this opportunity, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to refer to certain aspects of higher education in this country. Before I advert myself to that task, which is an important task in my view, I would like to give certain reasons which led the Government to elevate the status of the Academy to that of a University.

The Sri Lankan armed forces in the last three decades, you are well aware, have become highly professionalized; we have a professional army with a lot of combat experience. Our armed forces, though began as a ceremonial army, have now become patriotic forces engaged in the defence of the country. They are defending our territorial waters; they are defending our territorial integrity; they are sacrificing their lives to defeat terrorism and separatism of an international character and these are achievements by the army. Yesterday, we were given a treat by the three Commanders of the Forces and we were very impressed with the achievements they have made so far in regard to the defeat of terrorism. What I am trying to say is that the role of the army has undergone a transformation in the last several years. Everybody must accept that the role of the army is no more a ceremonial role. It is a professional army with a lot of combat experience. In my view, professionalism in the army needs to be enhanced and it was the need for professionalism which influenced the establishment of this Defence Academy, to which my good Friend, the Hon. John Amaratunga referred and he eulogized the founder of that Academy, Sir John Kotelawala. Nobody wants to deny that. Initially, it came to be started as a training institute for cadet officers of the forces. In 1998, as the Hon. Prime Minister rightly mentioned, through an amendment to the principal Act of 1981 the Academy was given the status of a degree-awarding institute. The initial status was that of a degree-awarding institute. Though the Academy enjoyed the right to confer degrees, its status continued to remain that of a degree-awarding institute. In other words, it fell short of a university. This is what we are trying to rectify. It fell short of a university; it was only a degree-awarding authority. Therefore, it now needs to be rectified and provided with the status of a university. In the past several years, several institutions have been given the status of degree-awarding institutes. It has been done under the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978. My good Friend, the Hon. Anura Dissanayake raised the question and the status is given after careful examination of the credentials of the particular institute. In this case, the Sir John Kotelawala Defence Academys credentials have been thoroughly examined. I spoke to the Chairman of the University Grants Commission and he gave me a detailed account as to how they took the decision in respect of this matter. According to the 1978 Act, the status of a degree-awarding institute can be given and there are certain things which they are expected to do. The first is to admit students and provide for instruction in such branches of learning specified in the order of the University Grants Commission. It specifies the areas, the disciplines, the courses of study which you are expected to teach in that particular institute. The second is to hold examinations for the purpose of testing whether the person has acquired the required competency, required proficiency in the relevant courses of study.

The third is to grant and confer degrees, diplomas, certificates and other academic distinctions on persons who have followed the required courses of study. The fourth is to grant and confer degrees on persons who have conducted research which means research is also allowed and postgraduate research could be conducted. You can invite people from abroad to undertake research in the institute in the field of military science. Today, military science is a developed science all over the world. We know that in the context of technological changes, military science has developed as a separate discipline. In the last several years, several institutions have been given degree-awarding status. They are, the Institute of Technological Studies where the status was given in 1988; the Institute of Surveying and Mapping where the status was given in 1990. Because we have a shortage of surveyors in this country, we need to produce more and more surveyors. Therefore, the Institute of Surveying and Mapping was given this recognition. Then, the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology was given this recognition in 2000 because information technology is also a very important discipline in this country. The National Institute of Fisheries and Nautical Engineering - this is another field which needs to be developed - was given the recognition in 2003. The National Institute of Social Development was given the same status in 2005. Then, there is the Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration and the Aquinas College of Higher Studies. Most of these institutions came within the public sector. The Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration and the National Institute of Social Development are associated with the relevant ministries. The purpose was to create opportunities, Sir, for people in the public sector to obtain a postgraduate qualification. Take for instance, the National Institute of Education and the Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration. They are conducting postgraduate courses in the relevant fields. We need more and more postgraduate-qualified people. We need to develop the postgraduate sector in the universities. We do not want the universities to remain as undergraduate institutions. In Sri Lanka, all universities remain as undergraduate institutions. I always argue for the extension of postgraduate education so that a postgraduate intellectual culture will teach the undergraduate the need for learning. Our universities, since 1942, have become primarily undergraduate institutions, specializing in undergraduate education. The over-emphasis - [Interruption.] My learned Friend, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, please listen to my argument.

Our universities, Mr. Deputy Speaker, since the creation of the University of Ceylon in 1942, have become primarily undergraduate institutions specializing in undergraduate education. The over-emphasis on undergraduate education led to the neglect of the postgraduate education sector. This is my primary argument. This is my fundamental argument with which I am trying to reform the system. I am trying to formulate a new higher education policy through which I intend to expand the postgraduate education in Sri Lanka. Postgraduate education is conducted at two levels in Sri Lanka. There are postgraduate programmes associated with the respective academic departments in the universities which confer MAs and PhDs and programmes conducted by postgraduate institutes attached to universities. We have about 15 postgraduate institutes. For instance, the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine, the Postgraduate Institute of Management, the Postgraduate

Institute of Agriculture and the Postgraduate Institute of Chemistry. I would like to expand the facilities for postgraduate education with a view to restoring, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I emphasize that, with a view to restoring the culture of learning in the universities. This is what needs to be restored in our universities. Today most of the undergraduates are in the hands of a few politically-motivated students who call themselves the saviours of free education. In my view, they are the very opponents of free education. Why do I say so in a responsible place like this? It is this group which destabilizes the universities. In the last one month there were clashes among students in five places and there are deliberate attempts by a small minority of students to destabilize the university sector. It is they who prevent the restoration of the culture of learning. We need to restore the culture of learning, the culture of intellectual activity in the universities if they are to obtain recognition throughout the world. There are students who do not want intellectual life to flourish. An intellectual life should flourish in the universities. With the creation of more opportunities for postgraduate education, the presence of a postgraduate community, a community of scholars engaged in research will change the learning environment of a university. Universities will become more research-oriented. I want the Sir John Kotelawala Defence Academy which gets the university status to indulge in research. They can research into their military experiences. They can research into their humanitarian role. They can research into rehabilitation. There are various sectors associated with military science where fruitful research could be undertaken. Therefore, they will be able to discuss all these things once their board of study is converted into an academic senate. The emergence of a research culture, Mr. Deputy Speaker, will change the learning environment in a university. We need to introduce this in Sri Lanka and the undergraduates who are now bent on agitation would have to change their ways and get involved in the learning process. We need to restore the learning culture, we need to restore the intellectual culture of the universities. In the last eight months in my capacity as the Minister of Higher Education, I have been trying my utmost to restore this intellectual culture in our universities. Hon. Kiriella, in the OECD countries, one PhD is produced annually per 5000 students. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Are you for private universities? . . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala) No. - [Interruption.] We are not for privatization - [Interruption.] I do not want to give way. You are my best Friend from Kandy. I do not want to give way. I have known you in the last 30 years when I was at the university. Therefore, please do not disturb me as a Friend.

2007 18 85 86

In Thailand, Hon. Kiriella, postgraduate studies represent 3 per cent of the overall enrolment. It is 8 per cent in Korea. His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa in his capacity as the Chairman of the National Research Council proposes to provide financial assistance to produce 500 PhDs. Some of the Cabinet Ministers are aware of this and the Cabinet Paper was placed before the Cabinet at the last Cabinet Meeting. That is a great thing. I welcome that and I need to thank His Excellency the President for taking the right decision to improve postgraduate education in this country. It is to be funded by the State and the estimated cost, Mr. Deputy Speaker, is Rs. 4,652 million. Therefore, we are going to spend Rs. 4,652 million from the State coffers to produce 500 PhDs within a period of 10 years which is necessary for this country. You need a postgraduate community of scholars to accelerate the process of economic and social development in this country. According to the programme, Mr. Deputy Speaker, 500 PhDs will be produced in 10 years and this is to enhance the science and technology status of Sri Lanka which is necessary at the given moment of time without which we cannot function as a developing nation.

The Sir John Kotelawala University is already a university in terms of Act, No. 27 of 1988 passed during the presidency of His Excellency J.R. Jayewardene. The amendment brought in today is only for the purpose of changing the name. With the passage of this legislation, the Sir John Kotelawala Defence Academy, once it was called the Academy, becomes part of the university system, though it does not come within the purview of the University Grants Commission. Therefore, this is a very specialized University. It is a non-conventional university. It cannot be described as a conventional university. It has a special role because it specializes in military sciences. The University is a special place of learning, Hon. Kiriella.

Subjects required for military personnel need to be taught, but at the same time try to convert the place into a centre of intellectual activity. Education today is an emotive issue, Mr. Deputy Speaker. We witnessed it in the last - ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) You have ruined the education. . . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A.

. . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala) Hon. John Amaratunga, please do not interrupt me. In Britain, former Prime Minister Tony Blair, as soon as he came to power, gave priority to education. In the same way, Prime Minister Gordon Brown, as soon as he came to power, gave priority to education. The present French President, Nicholas Sarkozy addressed a 30-page letter to all the teachers in France referring to the values of the teaching profession. What a good thing! The President of France, Nicholas Sarkozy - ( ) (The Hon. Selvarajah Kajendren) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I rise to a point of Order. . , . [] . . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A.

( ) (The Hon. Selvarajah Kajendren) Give me one minute, Sir. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, you may continue. ( ) (The Hon.

The French President, Mr. Deputy Speaker, wrote a 30-page letter to all the teachers in France referring to the values of the teaching profession. I was listening to my good Friend, the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa in the morning. This is what the French President said. France needs to rebuild the foundation of its education system. Hon. Deputy Speaker, is my time up?

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You are using the Governments time, Hon. Minister.

( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala) We, in Sri Lanka need to protect our children and schools from a group of teachers who indulge in some kind of trade union action. I would like to tell my good, learned Friend, the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake, that this is perhaps the only country in the entire world - I checked this; I wanted to find this out - where there were trade unions which converted a highly competitive public examination into a trade union weapon. Nowhere in the world

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Are you condemning it?

. . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala) No, I am not condemning. I am just giving you an example. Nowhere in the world has a public examination of a competitive nature been used as a strike weapon. This is all what I want to say. - [Interruption.] Therefore, in my view, Hon. Kiriella, this kind of trade union activities go against the very concept of trade-unionism. Trade-unionism of the 1930s is outmoded today. After the Trade Union Act of 1935 came into operation, that kind of trade-unionism has become outmoded today; totally and absolutely outmoded and it was based on the class-struggle thesis.

- INVESTIGATION INTO DEATH OF TAMIL CIVILIANS BY AERIAL BOMBARDMENT AND MULTI-BARREL ROCKET FIRE . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I move that,

Whereas in the course of the Adjournment Debate in Parliament on the situation in the North-East on Wednesday the 5th September 2007, I stated that over 300 Tamil civilians, men, women and children were killed as a result of aerial bombardment and the firing of multi-barrel rockets by Government troops into territory populated by Tamil civilians. And whereas this statement was made by me on the basis of material available regarding the massive displacement of Tamil civilians throughout the several months during which such attacks continued, resulting in extensive Tamil civilian deaths and injuries and massive devastation of Tamil civilian owned property. And whereas the Hon. Sunsantha Punchinilame, Minister of Nation Building, in the course of his reply on behalf of the Government on the said date, stated that he had verified the position from military officials and the Government Agents in the three districts of Trincomalee, Batticaloa and Amparai, and that as per the information given to him by the said military and civilian officials, apart from two Sinhala civilians who were killed at Kallar in Trincomalee consequent to LTTE shell fire, no Tamil civilian was killed and that it was untrue to state that any Tamil civilian had been killed. And whereas I assert that a considerably large number of Tamil civilians reasonably assessed at around 300, were in fact killed, and that if the said military and civilian officers had in fact given such information to the Hon. Minister, who in turn placed such information before the House, then such officials have regrettably made a deliberate attempt to mislead this honourable House. And whereas the Hon. Minister in the course of his statement said that the Government is prepared to conduct an inquiry to ascertain the truth and whereas such an inquiry conducted at the earliest has become an imperative necessity, to ascertain the truth as to whether Tamil civilians were in fact killed by such aerial bombardment and multi-barrel rocket fire. And whereas it is also necessary to ascertain whether any effort has been made by anyone to mislead this honourable House. I ask whether the Government will take immediate steps to conduct an independent and impartial investigation, through a panel of inquirers, that will carry conviction nationally and internationally, to ascertain the truth as to whether Tamil civilians, men, women and children were killed by such aerial bombardment and multi-barrel rocket fire." I wish to state, Sir, that I was rather disappointed with the response by the Hon. Minister on behalf of the Government. I thought that that response lacked decorum because we were debating a very serious question in

regard to what had happened in the Eastern Province and I would have expected the response from the Government to be more sober, more moderate and to have dealt with the question in a more responsible way.

The killing of innocent Tamil civilians, Sir, even in the course of operations conducted against the LTTE by the Government, constitutes a violation of both national and international humanitarian law and the denial of killing of Tamil civilians, in my submission, Sir, enhances the gravity of the situation and unless the truth is established through an impartial and an independent investigation conducted by impartial and independent persons, such indiscriminate, reckless and deliberate killings shall continue indefinitely.

I do not think that can be permitted and therefore it is my duty to raise this matter once again on the Floor of the House. It is not my desire to engage in any unseemly verbal exchange with anyone in the Government on this question. But, as I have said before, the reply on behalf of the Government in the course of that Adjournment Debate, in my view, lacked moderation and decorum, and since we are concerned with the killing of civilians by aerial bombardment and multi-barrel rocket launchers, and since it is our contention that even while the Government is engaged in prosecuting a war against the LTTE, the Government is not entitled to kill Tamil civilians indiscriminately by aerial bombardment or by multi-barrel rocket launchers, I submit that it is the duty of the Government to ensure the safety of Tamil civilians at all times and, Sir, that is the basis on which I have presented my Adjournment Motion to this House. I might mention, Sir, that the first aerial bombardment commenced on the evening of the 25th of April, 2006, subsequent to the attack on the Army Commander in Colombo, on the village of Sampur, in the course of which eleven Tamil civilians were in fact killed. I had mentioned this to the House in a Debate that took place sometime in May, 2006. On the 26th of April, 2006 in the morning there were again attacks by air, aerial bombardments, and in the course of those attacks three Tamil-speaking Muslim civilians were killed in a village called Iqbal Nagar in the Mutur area. I have got the names of those three persons. Subsequently, Sir, this aerial bombardment and the use of multi-barrel rocket launchers continued. It had sometimes been intermittent and sometimes continuous and in the course of such multi-barrel rocket launcher fire, on the 7th of August, 2006 in a place called Nallur in the Mutur Divisional Secretary's Division, 15 Tamil civilians were killed and 47 were grievously injured. These are matters that can be verified, which nobody can deny. As I said before, the firing of multi-barrel rocket launchers had sometimes been intermittent, it had sometimes been continuous over several weeks and in the course of flushing out the LTTE from villages in the South of the Trincomalee District and the North of the Batticaloa District, such attacks have

13 PL 002492 (2007/10)

111 112

[ . ]

taken place with very serious consequences to the Tamil civilian population both in regard to their personal properties and their lives. There had been deaths and there had been injuries. Sir, I consider it my duty to place before the House certain reports in regard to this matter which have appeared in the newspapers, in the print media. The ''Daily Mirror'' of the 10th of November, 2006 carried a report which had the headline, I quote: "President regrets Vakarai tragedy, orders probe" The report states, I quote: President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday expressed his regrets over the killing of civilians in Vakarai and ordered an inquiry into the incident. While expressing his deep sorrow and regret at the senseless loss of life of innocent civilians at Vakarai, the President condemned the LTTE's tactics of directing long- range artillery fire using human shields, saying such tactics led to this tragedy,......." The President has admitted the fact that civilians were killed but also stated that it was as a result of the LTTE using civilians as human shields that the civilians had been killed. That is another matter which needs to be gone into. Sir, I further quote the ''Daily Mirror'' of the 10th of November, 2006: "Meanwhile, Defence Spokesman and Minister Keheliya Rambukwella said yesterday he regretted the Vakarai tragedy and claimed 23 bodies had been recovered so far while 125 had been injured." Minister Rambukwella states, I quote: "We explained to the Co-Chairs that innocent civilians had evidently been located in a risky area from where the LTTE was firing at us." The report goes on to state, I quote: "He also said that the Government has called for a full probe on the incident and would not try cover up the case" Minister Rambukwella further states, I quote: "According to the ICRC and the SLMM, only 23 bodies had been found and 125 injured." So, this is the reality, Sir, in regard to what happened to the civilians. And there was a report on this in the "Daily Mirror" of Saturday, December 16, 2006. It states, I quote: At least eight displaced civilians including a child fleeing the fighting in LTTE controlled Vakarai were drowned when the fishing boats they were travelling in capsized in rough seas last morning. Batticaloa SSP, Maxi Proctor told the Daily Mirror the civilians were among a group of IDPs in a fleet of 7 fishing boats on the way to government controlled Valaichchenai when tragedy struck. Halfway

through the journey 2 boats had toppled drowning 5 civilians and minutes later another two boats toppling, killing another civilian while the rest managed to swim to safety. That was again as a result of the multi-barrel rocket launcher fire that these civilians had to flee and in the course of fleeing the boats drowned and some persons were killed. In regard to these matters, Sir, we also have the reports of reputed international human rights organizations and I would like to place before the House some of these reports both in regard to the killing of civilians as a result of multi-barrel rocket launcher fire and aerial bombardment and also what the human rights organizations have to say in regard to this claim that the LTTE was using the civilians as human shields and that is how these people came about their death. Sir, page 7 of the Special Report of the University Teachers for Human Rights under the heading, Can the East be won through Human Culling? states, I quote: A leading citizen from the area told us that the death toll resulting from the whole episode of flight ...." That is, people fleeing consequent to multi-barrel rocket launcher fire. "... is close to 180, adding that the list is still a tentative one. An unknown number of elderly and children died falling into pits while crossing Vaharai lagoon by night in a final act of desperatio when Vaharai was being shelled. He explained that many had been killed during flight, because of random or misdirected shelling, and had simply been buried by the roadside and did not go into any official record. The refugees living scattered over Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Killiveddy and far beyond, makes documentation extremely difficult. The number 180 appears conservative, given the Non-Violent Peace Forces figure of above 147 civilians killed in Batticaloa District for November 2006 alone. The number injured would be at least three times that figure. By then there was hardly anyone left in Mutur East and most of them were in the Batticaloa District. Sir, the Non-Violent Peace Force has said that at least 147 civilians were killed in the month of November, 2006 alone and the position of the University Teachers for Human Rights is that an estimate of 180 persons killed having been given by a leading citizen in that area was an underestimate and that a larger number of persons have been killed. I am quoting from the Report of the University Teachers for Human Rights, a human rights organization that has constantly criticized the LTTE for its human rights violations and which reports the Government had used at international fora against the LTTE and therefore, the Government cannot take the position that this is an irresponsible statement made by anyone. The same organization, Sir, in their Report states on page 6, I quote: "The way Mutur East was emptied was so abominable that one must conclude that the eviction of the populace by bombing and shelling was deliberate." I repeat, "bombing and shelling was deliberate." "The people should not have been made to move beyond the nearest school, temple or church. The big school in the area, Senaiyoor Central, had been hit from 25th April. Vigneswara High School in Kathiraveli

2007 18 113 114

was hit in on 8th November killing over 40 civilians. Testimonies we received from civilians confirmed that in general, the LTTE did not fire at the Army from among civilians until the last stages in December 2006. The University Teachers for Human Rights state that on the basis of testimony they received from civilians, the LTTE did not fire at the armed forces from among civilians until late December, 2006. That is the view of the University Teachers for Human Rights so that the allegation of the Government that the LTTE fired from among civilians using civilians as a human shield and that the civilian deaths were caused as a result of the Government firing at the LTTE and also hitting civilians would not seem to be correct, would not seem to be substantiated by the reports of an independent human rights organization like the University Teachers for Human Rights. I would like to read to you, Sir, also the Report of the Human Rights Watch, an international human rights organization which reports have been used by the Government. In fact, the Reports of the Human Rights Watch in regard to the LTTE were the reports on the basis of which the Government had got the LTTE banned by the European Union. You tabled these reports in Geneva and before the European Union and wanted the LTTE banned and this is what they say. I quote: On the Sri Lanka Army offensive in Vakarai, the HRW said, In one of the most deadly incidents of the recent years, government shelling in the Eastern Vaharai area on November 8, 2006 hit school grounds that were housing thousands of displaced civilians, killing 62 and wounding 47. Government forces failed to distinguish between combatants and civilians and may have purposely targeted the school. I am not saying it. The LTTE is not saying it. It is being said by the Human Rights Watch, a reputed international human rights organization. I further quote: Based on interviews with a dozen witnesses and other information, Human Rights Watch found no evidence to support government claims that the LTTE had fired that morning at government forces from the vicinity of the school or had used civilians as human shields to protect themselves from attack. Here again the Human Rights Watch, an internationally reputed human rights organization calls into question the Governments position on whether the LTTE fired from amongst the civilians or whether they used the civilians as a human shield. This is why I say, Sir, that the use of multi-barrel rocket launchers by the armed forces in two Tamil civilian populated areas had been reckless, indiscriminate and deliberate according to the findings of organizations like the Human Rights Watch and the University Teachers for Human Rights. That, Sir, is certainly not acceptable. I want to very strongly submit that the Government is not entitled, on the basis of its claim that it is attacking the LTTE or trying to flush out the LTTE, to cause the death of innocent Tamil civilians by aerial bombardment and multi-barrel rocket launcher fire in this way. It is against both national and international

humanitarian law. It can in fact be termed as humanitarian crime and the Government, I submit, Sir, is not entitled to carry out such attacks against innocent civilians and that is why I say that there has got to be an impartial investigation in regard to this matter. I will now table, Sir, certain lists which have been compiled by me in regard to this matter and I would request you to kindly direct that these lists be included in Hansard at the end of my speech. I table* Annex 1 giving the names of 56 civilians of Mutur East, Verugal and Echchilampattai killed by aerial bombardment and multi-barrel rocket launcher fire in both the Trincomalee and the Batticaloa Districts. I have given the names, ages and addresses of the persons. One is an infant who is one month old. There are elderly people and so on. I table* Annex 2 giving the names of the civilians killed in Koralai Pattu North by aerial bombardment and multi-barrel rocket launcher fire. Thirty two names have been given in that list. There again we have given the names, ages, addresses and the dates of death of the people concerned. I table* Annex 3 giving the names of the civilians killed at Vakarai by aerial bombardment and multi-barrel rocket launcher fire. This list has 29 names. We have also given the names, ages and addresses of the people. There is an infant of six months and a child of one year. Some of them are elderly people. I table* Annex 4, giving the names of civilians killed at Vakarai by aerial bombardment and multi-barrel rocket launcher fire on 5th November, 2006. In this list there are 19 names of persons killed and their addresses. I table* Annex 5 giving the names of civilians killed by aerial bombardment and multi-barrel rocket launcher fire on 8th November, 2006. This list has 28 names. We have given the ages and addresses of the people. I table* Annex 6, giving the particulars of deaths caused in the year 2007 as a result of multi- barrel rocket launcher fire and aerial bombardment and also perhaps in other ways. This list has 75 names. I table* Annex 7 giving the names of 22 persons who have been killed by security forces during the course of these operations - where people have been abducted and gone missing - and so on and so forth.

* ****** . . Produced at end of speech.

115 116

The total number of names, Sir, in all these seven different lists that I have referred to and tabled today is 261. There are so many dead persons who are buried in their compounds. There are so many persons who have died while they were fleeing and whose bodies have been left behind. And therefore, Sir, if somebody was to say not a single civilian was killed and if, as the Hon. Minister of Nation Building, the Hon. Susantha Punchinilame said in Parliament on that date - he had been told by the Military Commander, General Parakrama Pannipitiya or by the Government Agents of Trincomalee, Batticaloa and Ampara - that no civilians had been killed in the course of these military confrontations by aerial bombardment or by multi-barrel rocket launcher fire, that is certainly not a statement which any person can ever accept. And therefore, Sir, we would request the Government to conduct an impartial independent inquiry into this matter. The truth must be ascertained. The truth must be known. I am sorry to state on the Floor of this House that the response by the Government on the date that we had this debate does not inspire confidence that the Government is committed to ensuring that the Tamil civilians are not killed in this way or for that matter, to the ascertainment of the truth when an allegation is made that Tamil civilians were killed in this way. We call, Sir, for the appointment of an independent impartial Commission of Inquiry to go into this question and determine the truth in regard to this matter. I think the truth must be known both to the people of this country and the whole world. I do not think, Sir, any Government is entitled to kill its own citizens particularly the citizens of a minority community, in this instance the Tamil civilians in this way. I would respectfully suggest to the Government that the Commission of Inquiry appointed by the Government could comprise of three persons from the three different communities, one Sinhalese, one Tamil and one Muslim. They could be retired members of the judiciary, the higher judiciary, the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal or the High Court. That would be a very fair arrangement for retired judges of the higher judiciary of the three communities, the Sinhalese, the Muslims and the Tamils to be entrusted with the task of going into this question and ascertaining the truth. And I would even suggest that the Muslim Member should be the Chairman of that Commission. The Muslims are also vital stakeholders in the North Eastern region and these attacks have taken place in the Eastern Province and I would suggest, Sir, that an independent impartial investigation be conducted into this matter. I would respectfully submit that the Government must make no effort to sweep this matter under the carpet. It cannot be disposed of in that way. The truth must be ascertained and I would say that it is the duty of this Government to ensure that the truth is ascertained. Thank you, Sir.
