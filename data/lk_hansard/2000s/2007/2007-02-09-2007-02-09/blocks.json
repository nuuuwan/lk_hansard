Speaker, the practice in all parts of the world where there are Parliaments is for the Minister to be present, so that the Minister can reply to Supplementary Questions. Supplementary Questions are part of the procedure. It is not fair to expect the Chief Government Whip to answer all this. Today there is a Deputy Minister of Finance. He should have been here. Let the relevant Minister be here. If you look at todays Order Paper, who are the Ministers who are required to be here ? The Minister of Trade, Maketing Development, Co-operative and Consumer Services - he is here; the Minister of Health Care and Nutrition - he is here; the Minister of Education; The Primi Minister, Minister of Internal Administration and Deputy Minister of Defence, Public Security, Law and Order, the Minister of Posts and Aviation - he must be hanging from a lamp post in Matara - and the Minister of Urban Development and Sacred Area Development. That is all. I am sure, as far as this question is concerned, which was asked from the Prime Minister, the Deputy Minister of Finance should have been here. He could have answered it. That is all that is required. They all have to be here. What is the use of having a question time if the Ministers cannot be here ? ( ) (The Hon. Wimal Weerawansa) , . . . . . . , , -",

Under the Monetary Law there is a Monetary Board which is a body corporate and according to the Monetary Law all recruitments to the Central Bank have to be done by the Governor and the Monetary Board. There are the ARs and FRs which govern recruitment. Then there are Cabinet decisions. For instance, there was a decision by this Government that a certain number of unemployed graduates had to be recruited. So if you give this to another company, the Minister must state as to why you gave it to another company, whether you have followed the procedure and have done all that. The supplementary question asked by the Member flows from that answer. The moment you see that a different company is doing recruitment the Minister must be ready to give an answer as to why it is that company and not the Monetary Board that is making the recruitments because this is a Corporation that is responsible to Parliament.",

    "text": "intend to cover that ground again except to say that in his brief tenure in this House Mr. Raviraj could be described as a live wire. He took part not only in the activities of the House but also made his contributions to the society at large. Mr. Raviraj was one who got on to the electronic media and spoke about the problems of the Tamils and Sinhalese. In that way he was building a bridge. And there were many people who learned to appreciate the viewpoints expressed by the TNA, thanks to Mr. Raviraj. He did that because he believed in a united Sri Lanka. He believed in the territorial integrity of the country. He believed that we were all citizens of one Sri Lanka and if he is to resolve this issue, speaking on the problems of the North-East conflict to Tamils alone will not do and that he has to address the Sinhalese and the Muslims as well. So he thought by speaking in Tamil he could address the Tamils and a part of the Muslims and that he had to speak in Sinhalese to address the others. And that was the correct approach. He also took up other issues concerning infringement of laws and infringement of fundamental rights which went beyond what was happening in the North-East. He took an active part in all issues. He looked at every issue in this House from a viewpoint of a Sri Lankan and how it would affect us. Of course, he had his own views of what the solution was and that solution, we, in the House agreed with him on some issues. We did not agree with him on others. But, the fact was I think all of us appreciated that Raviraj was sincere and he was committed to upholding the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka and this is why his loss is so great for us to bear. A person who believed in a united Sri Lanka and keeping its territorial while meeting with the justifiable demands of the Tamil-speaking people, is no longer with us. Mr. Raviraj, in expressing his views also expressed the problems that the Tamils face from different groups and the problems they face from the security forces. The fact that he highlighted it does not mean that he was a traitor. These are issues which we, who represent districts in the South as well as the whole country, raise from time to time. Mr. Speaker, there have been a number of Members in this House who have been assassinated by groups which went outside the Parliamentary system and challenged us by resorting to arms, by resorting to terrorism and by resorting to assassination. Of all the parties, I think the United National Party has suffered the most. But, in this case, we cannot say certainly with conviction that Mr. Ravirajs death was due to the work of someone who was outside the system. Mr. Raviraj was killed on a road on which there were two military establishments and one police establishment; two military establishments on either side of the road and one police establishment in the middle. A large number of Members of this House live there. Many other senior public servants live there. It is one of the well-secured roads in Colombo. Then, how did this happen? How was it that the assassins were able to get away in a city which was secured, and close by it was a road which leads to Parliament?",

    "text": "Now, this is one of the serious issues that has come up. Unfortunately, to the minds of many of us in the House, we cannot lay the blame for Mr. Ravirajs death on any terrorist group or on any armed group. Unfortunately, it looks as if it has been done within the system and this is one of the issues that we are faced with today. All the abductions, all the killings in this country cannot be attributed to the LTTE. Some of it is the work of the LTTE and has to be condemned. But, all of it is not the work of the LTTE and certainly Mr. Ravirajs death does not fall into that category of assassinations by the LTTE. The loss is to the country. It is a loss of an individual. But, there is something more. We see more and more complaints of abductions; complaints of killings not merely in the North but also in the South. The son of Major General Fernando, Presidential Adviser on security, was abducted and released and many others also abducted. On Tuesday, when I was coming to Parliament, the media contacted me and referred to an individual whom I have never met; whom I did not know and I had to raise it here. Thereafter, he was found and then the security forces said that he was taken in for having helped the LTTE. Surely, when they took him in they knew who he was. All they had to do was to tell the family. Look! He is being taken in because he is wanted in regard to some connection that he has had with the LTTE. That was all they had to say. When a person is arrested he has to be informed. It is useless doing it 24 hours later after it has been raised in this House. Then, you go and show a video tape. After that video tape is shown do you think that he can be convicted in a court of law? The due process and equality before law have been already transgressed. You cannot convict him. His lawyers will come out and make a big issue out of it. So, where is the procedure? Who is in control of these groups? We find Ministers complaining; we find Members of this House complaining; we have trade unions complaining. The media is frightened today to speak. They do not know what will happen. They say, If we criticize, if we bring this up, we ourselves will become the victims. This is the fear that is prevailing in this country, in the South. This has not happened before. Are we witnessing darkness at noon? That is the question that I have to ask because even amidst the clash of arms the laws are not silent. They have to speak the same principle and what we are worried about and what we are afraid of is that we may be departing from this legal principle. We cannot have the human rights being violated any more. Therefore, while we talk of these issues, what we could do in this House when talking about the late Mr. Raviraj is to establish a Standing Committee of the House to go into human rights to look into whether violations of human rights are being inquired into by the proper authority, not to duplicate but to work along side with others. I think, we in the Opposition seem to be coming to that view. Certainly we will discuss it and we will ask the Government benchers to agree with us so that we can establish this Standing Committee as soon as possible and all the violations of human rights can be gone into.

Even the European Parliaments, foreign Parliaments are taking up these issues . We cannot say that they are supporters of the LTTE. We cannot say that they are anti-Sri Lankan. They want the human rights to be protected. They want our country to ensure that we maintain the same standards as them. That is all we have to do. Having the Government media fired on those friendly countries or those friendly organizations will not help us. We cannot take an ostrich-like approach. So, we in the Opposition will come to the House with a draft resolution which I hope the Government will agree and we can then establish a Standing Committee on Human Rights which is a common practice in many European Parliaments.

Deputy Chairman of Committees, I take this opportunity at the outset to express my deepest sympathies to the family of my Friend, the late Hon. Nadarajah Raviraj. I have known the late Hon. Member Raviraj as a colleague of mine in the legal profession. My Friend, the Hon. Raviraj had a distinguished career as a lawyer, as a State Counsel, as a practitioner at the Bar, as a politician, as the Mayor of Jaffna and from 2001 onwards as a Member of this august Assembly. His capacity to represent the people of this country was demonstrated in numerous ways. He was an example to all Members of Parliament. His ability to speak in three languages; Tamil, English and even in Sinhala surpassed the quality of many of our speakers. I watched him with great interest as a debater. I enjoyed his interventions both as a Member of the Opposition and as a Minister in the Government and in all those submissions he maintained a position. When it came to politics, he looked at the interests of the people that he represented and he represented them steadfastly. When it came to the economic agenda, there too he displayed a great commitment and understanding of the trends emerging in commerce and trade and in industry in relation to the livelihoods of people of all communities across Sri Lanka and particularly in the North of Sri Lanka. On numerous occasions, I recall the requests he made from me when I was Minister of Industries, when I was Minister of Advanced Technology and National Enterprise Development and then again when I was Minister of Enterprise Development and Investment Promotion, to take real term development to the people of the North and the East. That was because he belonged to the culture of politicians who wanted to deliver to the people. During the period that he served in this House, he belonged directly to those who wanted to deliver to the people. With this profile of his, it was very easy to interact with him. He had a view, he took up a position and he wanted it to be raised and made known to the rest of us. In the",

He became a famous participant at television debates. The country watched him. The youth I am sure got educated and realized that these TV debates could get enriched with a diversity of submissions, opinions and positions and leading to one ultimate goal of a democracy, a vibrant one in Sri Lankas culture that is associated and fast becoming rich in terms of our democratic traditions. It is in that backdrop that I was expecting to see my late Friend, the Hon. Ravirajs development in the ranks of the party to which he belonged; becoming a leader in future to represent the people of the North or even the people of this country, because there cannot be a divide or a restriction as we are all Sri Lankans and we are all sons of Mother Lanka. It is with that expectation that we all go and study in Government schools, get free education and end up in the respective universities or institutions of higher education. He studied at the Sri Lanka Law College where I myself received my law education. He was called to the Bar and took oaths as a member of the Bar before the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka and then he joined the Attorney-Generals Department. He served as a public servant and he did well because he contributed in whatever stage of his career to the well-being of our country. When he came to Parliament, as the Hon.(Ven.) Ellawala Medhananda Thero went on to express, where opinions differed, where positions differed, he did not in any way construe that there is a definite difference in terms of the ultimate goals for which we are all committed as Members of Parliament. The sovereignty, the territorial integrity, the lives of our people, the human rights and the fundamental rights of our people should be respected. The right to live in this country without having to face the bullet and without getting knocked down or being assassinated or being abducted are things that we all must have and the late Hon. Raviraj was a major supporter of that view as much as we are advocating it. Today, as the Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka it is my goal to establish with clarity that terrorism should not exist because people should be allowed to live. In a vibrant democracy like that of Sri Lanka, though small, several political shades are there; opinions are there; representation channels are there; political parties are there and we work having been elected by the people of Sri Lanka. On that premise everyone has a channel through which we articulate ourselves. We take up positions, we want them to be registered and we want to canvass these positions. We have to ultimately canvass every position that we take up in a sovereign nation, in a democracy, because people elect us and they are sovereign in terms of the Sri Lankan Constitution It is that Constitution, it is that sovereignty and it is that territorial integrity that we are committed to preserve, protect and progress with whether we sit on this side of",

When it comes to political issues confronting the North and the East, the national question to which we are fast bringing answers with a greater consensus emerging in the House, with all polity coming together in terms of a national focus with an agenda to which everyone can be stakeholders and everyone can own that solution; I am sorry and sad to find that our Friend is no longer with us to share that development. It is that development that we want to instil right across Sri Lanka and then the world community will come to understand our standpoint. It is that standpoint that has fallen as a major responsibility on me as the Minister of Foreign Affairs to articulate both here in Sri Lanka and to the world at large. When we analyze, dissect and go into the annals of our own history from that angle. the acrimony that has existed amongst communities and political parties is evident even without terrorism raising its head and today His Excellency the President, Mahinda Rajapaksa is fast trying to eliminate that. He wants to eliminate that acrimony from the political fabric of Sri Lanka because we cannot have a fabric woven with this acrimony nor can we have a fabric being brought together if there is terrorism that will fast destroy every foundation that we are trying to lay and every progress that we are going to make and the development that we are going to reach. All that will get fast destroyed because a gun, a bomb could take away several lives and those lives will cost the nation. It will cost the nation of its destiny. That is the untold story that we are experiencing today. The leaders have got wiped out and killed on the streets since terrorism has not considered the colour of a person nor has it looked at the political shade to which one belongs nor has it had any respect for or value human life. Being sons of fathers, we are still having fathers getting killed and leaving the children destitute. I am sorry for the loss of a father to the Hon. Raviraj's two children - a son and a daughter - and the loss of a husband to his beloved wife. These are all miseries that flow because of the terrorism that has got registered in this country. This is the problem of terrorism to which we have to find an answer. That is why I mentioned that His Excellency the President, Mahinda Rajapaksa, being a major advocator of human rights throughout his life, has today taken it upon himself to address all these aspects that have coloured our culture, our position both in Sri Lanka and abroad as the value for human life is fast diminishing in our country. Unfortunately, I see only a few hon. Members of the JVP present, here. They will speak volumes on disappearances, if there is one to speak of. These are nothing new in terms of Sri Lankas contemporary history. How did the bodies start flowing in our rivers? How had the waters in our rivers got bloodied?

This is the passage through which we have to navigate our regime with the historical background and the divide that prevails in the country. In the year 2006 we were able to address that by bringing in a larger composition to our Government representing all shades of political lines and thoughts because that was the consensus-building apparatus that we were looking at. This is something that I would like to recall and even the leaders of the United National Party like the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa tried to do.

The elimination of terrorism and the delivery of a political solution are the main objectives of our Government for which we are all committed today. It is in that process, as I mentioned, that we have to look at the bare facts. Should we also look at the handling of operations, in handling the approaches and in looking at issues in the way that it was looked at in the past or should we not turn a new chapter with the polity that has come to stay today where there is a greater understanding amongst all communities for development to be taken to the hinterland of Sri Lanka? That is why our special focus is not to confine development to the areas which are already developed like that of the Western Province but to take it to the North and the East. Has any Government been able to do that? As one-time Chairman of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka, then as Minister of Investment Promotion, I saw the lack of development in the North. Could anyone go there to develop those areas? How can we bring about a meaningful economic advancement to emancipate our people in the North and the East when the public servants",

We cannot have democracy working only in certain parts of the country. It must apply to all parts of the country because our Constitution is meant to cover the entirety of Sri Lanka. It is in that context that we were valuing the contributions and interventions that were coming from our late Friend, the Hon. Raviraj. It is that intervention that we are missing today which came with a very articulated submission before this august House. I am sure all of us share the loss of the Hon. Raviraj. We have to respect his views in that context and we should not forget what he wanted to represent because he was never a terrorist. He stood as a leader who could have represented a very balanced line for an ultimate solution to the problems that they are confronted with in the North and the East. Therefore, today at this Vote of Condolence, once again I reiterate my profound sadness at the loss of our Friend because a person must be able to live freely as others.

(Dr.) Neelan Tiruchelvam who represented the Tamil community and who wanted to expose the subjugation that was prevalent. And today we see that happening in the hands of the LTTE. How much of subjugation are the Tamil people subjected to? Are they free to voice themselves? Could anyone voice or represent when a gun is pointed at you? And it is that culture that ultimately has killed the pluralism, has killed the democracy, has killed the leaders of the calibre of the Hon. (Dr.) Neelan Tiruchelvam, the Hon. Amirthalingam and the Hon. Raviraj on whose demise we are condoling today. What we have to change is this terrorism because it does not see the quality of human life; they have no respect for the children of the people whom they assassinate and it is that that we have to eliminate from this country. This is why we need the rule of law. In the absence of the rule of law, how can we maintain law and order? In order to apply the rule of law we have to have the jurisdiction commanding the rule of law. That is why today we have succeeded in the East, in Vakarai and the people feel that they have got emancipated and they have come out of the subjugation that was prevalent. It is in that context that we have greater responsibility as a Government today to address the political dimensions and the political issues concerning all sections of our community in the North and the East as well. It is that we have to address and in that context we have to participate in this dialogue and bring about a solution. We have to include all parties for a political solution and this is why I have been repeatedly saying as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, we should all become stakeholders in the process towards bringing a solution, even the LTTE. It is that message that I want to convey while participating in the Vote of Condolence of our late Friend, the Hon. Raviraj.",

    "text": "I want to place on record as to how we could look at the developments in the future. It will be on a democratic agenda, on a pluralistic environment with greater respect for human lives and today we have come to that stage and we want to seek the participation of all Members, of all communities, of all political parties and also of all interested groups in this country in order to bring about a solution. Therefore, Sir, in conclusion, may I express once again my sympathies to the family of my Friend, the late Hon. Raviraj. The Scotland Yard Investigation will bring out the culprits who are responsible for it. This is why we have got an independent approach towards this. Nothing should be permitted to go uninvestigated. Sri Lanka has made mistakes. Our Presidents have been killed, our leaders have been killed, our politicians have been killed but those killings have not been properly investigated. No one has been brought to book in the history of Sri Lanka. Our Presidents have been subjected to attempted assassinations and today for the first time under his Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa investigations have started with a view to bring to book those who are responsible and to have the rule of law and also law and order prevailing in our country. With these words I conclude offering my condolences to his family and as a Buddhist may I hope my late Friend will achieve the ultimate bliss of Nibbana and as a Hindu may he find Moksha. Thank you, Sir.",

    "text": "I emphasize the word, \"Tamil homeland\". Sir, the above is quoted from page 5 of the book titled, Sri Lankan Crisis - The Reality. Further it says: At the 1977 General Elections, the Tamil United Liberation Front contested the elections on the platform of restoring the Tamil nation its sovereignty and won 18 of the 22 seats contested, emerging in the process as the national opposition party. The word \"sovereignty\" is being emphasized here. Many people think that sovereignty should not have been touched as if it is something like virginity. Sovereignty is not virginity. It has to be adjusted, amended and adapted to meet the circumstances of a country. I again quote: The Sinhala response to these moves was often brutal in the form of state orchestrated pogroms during which goon squads terrorized Tamils living in the South amongst the Sinhalese. According to Harvard Professor of anthropology Dr. Tambiah, there were seven such pogroms between 1956 and 1983. The last one in July 1983 was the worst resulting in the loss of over 3,000 Tamil lives, which in turn was to result in thousands of young Tamils taking to arms This is an earlier document. Things that are happening day and night, of a total abuse of human rights and killings in such a way whether they be politicians; - we have lost five MPs - whether they be catholic priests or whether they be university dons. The Vice-Chancellor of the Eastern University is still missing. Nearly 55 days have passed. It was a very moving sight to see the daughter crying, I hope my Appah will come back at least tonight on his 56th birthday. To that extent academicians are being wiped out, politicians are being wiped out, judicial officers are being wiped out, catholic priests are being wiped out, innocent girls are being raped and killed and butchered in a most inhuman manner. Why? And they are trying to say that we are the terrorists. Who are the terrorists? It is the Sinhala Government indulging in state terrorism. Let us not mince words from the subject that we are counter moving. Does the worm not have a chance to turn itself when it is being crushed? Tell us, Sir. Tell us. This is what we are asking. When I submitted the document yesterday on Sinhala State Terrorism I was told for the convenience of some others it is not going to be included in the Hansard. All right. Do it. You cannot suppress the truth for a long period. It will burst out in some form or the other. Therefore when we speak of Raviraj, let us think who he is. I am afraid, when I spoke on 22nd November, it was reported the next day; I have no enemies here. My Friend, the Minister Hon. Dilan Perera has said, the way Eelaventhan spoke, had Raviraj been alive in the House today he would have committed suicide upon hearing the speech. What is the speech I made? If Raviraj had a chance of coming back he would have come and patted me and told me Anna, you have done it well. This is the policy he stood for. What is the twisting and turning that is taking place? Unfortunately for us, dead people do not",

Why is this sudden silence by Hakeem and by all the Muslim leaders? You are only thinking of business. Business is all right. But life does not become business. You do not convert life as entirely for business people. Where have you learnt your Holy Quran? Does the Holy Quran not say that if there is injustice take up your arms; take up the sword and fight? Why are the Muslims timid, sellouts, weaklings and collaborators unheard of in any part of the world? I feel so sorry to speak in this manner at this juncture. So, Mr. Hakeem must relearn. I submit this for incorporation in the Hansard. Whether you will do it or not, I do not know. \" \"",

He was outspoken; he was a capable orator; he was able to convey the sense of grievance that he, his people and his supporters felt effectively not only in the Tamil language, the English language, but even in the Sinhala language. He had every right to do this and we respect that right. It is indeed sad that that voice has been silenced. I may not and our party may not agree with what he said.

I view this killing of the Hon. Raviraj as a dastardly act and have attributed it to a third force. There are those who make money out of conflicts. They are the manufacturers, the distributors of armaments the world over. As we know, the most powerful industry in the world, the one that brings in the biggest profit, is the armament industry. There are powerful countries whose economies are largely dependent on the armament industry. Therefore, in this context, they will utilize every difference we have, exploit it so that they can have a conflict developing and sell their arms. There are their agents operating within our country. They influence all sections of our society. They infiltrate, influence different levels and it is in this context that the differences we have among ourselves are magnified and exploited and the conflict is aggravated. So, we have to be aware of this. I have always maintained that the killing of the Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham, another tragic event, was also perpetrated by this third force. We have to, instead of blaming each other and fighting among ourselves, cease to be the pawns of this third force. We have to get together. I think what we have to do is to ensure that every citizen of this country is treated equally and has equal rights and privileges. We have to develop that system. I am very sad that over the years, during this conflict, the Tamil people in particular, but to some extent the Muslims and the other minorities have felt that the majority community has not adequately addressed their needs. Rather than resolving these differences amicably through suitable political mechanisms established, it is unfortunate that it has deteriorated to the point where the minority groups have not only developed their own political parties which are based on minority representation, but also begun to think very sensitively from that same perspective. Every occurrence is then viewed from that point of view. Therefore, these differences get aggravated and exaggerated, as a result. So, we have to work towards changing that situation. The minorities are now asking that they be given sufficient political power in the areas they live together to be able to ensure that their needs are provided for so that they can live in safety. I respect that. It is unfortunate that events have taken us down this road and we have come to this position. But, we have to accept the reality and try to work out a solution. I must say that while respecting the struggle the late Hon. Raviraj carried out, we have to try to work out a solution that should not allow this to continue down this same path to the point of division of our country. That is no solution to this problem.

So, we should not continue down this road. We have to try to emerge from that once again as united Sri Lankan people. That is the task that His Excellency the President, by setting up the All Party Conference, has entrusted to us. I state here that at the meeting of the All Party Conference, I made the point that the Tamil National Alliance to which the late Hon. Raviraj belonged, should also be represented in that. But, it is unfortunate that no one supported my request. But, we have to now get together through this process that the President has started. We have the All Party Representative Committee. Let us through that develop a process by which we can ensure that the rights and privileges of every citizen of our country are addressed and then get together once again as Sri Lankan people so that the differences which have been exaggerated would diminish and we live together as one nation. I think if we can achieve that, then we will be honoring a person who has sacrificed his life, the late Hon. Raviraj. I would like to in conclusion say that I hope those who have been responsible for this dastardly act will be brought to book and I will assure you that the Government of His Excellency the President is committed to do that so that this type of crime will not be repeated.
