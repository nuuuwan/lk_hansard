. . ( ) ( () . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala- Minister of Higher Education) Sir, I am so happy to follow my good Friend, the Hon. Vijitha Herath, but I do not hesitate to reject some of his arguments pertaining to student activism in the universities. I would like to begin by referring to certain important aspects of higher education. Higher education is of paramount importance for economic and social development, which the Hon. Vijitha Herath too stressed

2007 26 827 828

in the course of his speech. Institutions of higher education are entrusted with the responsibility of producing individuals with advanced knowledge and skills required for positions of responsibility in government, business, industry and professions. Therefore, higher education institutions play a very critical role in supporting knowledge-driven economic growth in a country. In most developing countries, including ours, higher education has been the fastest growing segment of the education system. In the last 70 years, our system too has expanded and today it consists of 51 higher education institutions. There are 15 universities which come under the purview of the University Grants Commission. Then, there are two universities which have been established exclusively for the Buddhist Sanga and there are 16 postgraduate institutions engaged in postgraduate education. In the technical education sector, there are 18 technical colleges which come under the purview of the Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technological Education. Sri Lanka is a country in this part of the world where there is a massive demand for both education and higher education and my good Friend, the Hon.Vijitha Herath also referred to it. This could be attributed to the social demand model of education which we created in 1945 under the Free Education System. It served a very good purpose, and now we need to change certain aspects of our higher education policy in keeping with the changes that are taking place globally. That is our present strategy in terms of higher education policy. Though we have a fairly established system of universities, it cannot provide opportunities to all students who aspire to get into the system, and it is here that major policy changes are necessary. The aspects that have to be taken into consideration in formulating a new higher education policy are, first, inequalities in access; second, educational quality and third, relevance. Despite the growth in the number of institutions in the sphere of higher education, there is an enrolment gap. All students who qualify do not get an opportunity to enter the universities and this is a major drawback in the system. I agree, I accept that this drawback exists in the system, and this could be rectified by expanding the non-university tertiary sector. Take for instance, the proposed intake for 2007. It is 19,650. In the Budget Proposals it was stated that the Government proposes to increase the annual intake to 20,000. Since 1993, the intake was increased annually. In 1993, the intake was 9,460 and the intake in 2006 was 17, 248. The most important and the most startling thing was that only 14.4 per cent of those qualified at the A/L were selected. In other words, 210,686 students sat for the Advanced Level Examination in 2006, and the number qualified stood at 119,955 out of which only 17,248 students were taken in which means that nearly 100,000 students, though qualified, were not able to enter universities. Enrolment in Sri Lanka had stagnated at 2 per cent since 1990. This question has to be

addressed immediately. Various programmes, through the use of the Distance Mode Education and the concept of Open Learning, have been devised to help these students to get into the higher education sector. The Distance Education Modernization Project, with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank, has been launched to take new policy initiatives in this direction. Then, technical education institutions are to be expanded with a view to providing more access to those students who wish to enter higher educational institutions. The quality of undergraduate education which the Hon. Vijitha Herath referred to, is a major problem in the system. There is this criticism that the quality of undergraduate education has declined due to a number of factors. Expansion of the system has been attributed as one reason; the rapidity of expansion, it was argued, led to lowering of academic standards in the universities. We want to address this question as our universities are primarily undergraduate institutions. Quality improvement being an important consideration, the Ministry of Higher Education with the assistance of the World Bank, launched a project for the improvement of quality and relevance in the universities. The purpose was to improve both teaching and learning with a view to helping the undergraduates to acquire the competencies and skills relevant to the world of work. An attempt has been made to link the various disciplines with the broader economic and social environment. The most important thing to which the Ministry gave preference was the establishment of a unit for the formulation of development-oriented Higher Education Policy. Since the establishment of the university education during colonial times, no proper assessment was made in the area of policy formulation; ad hoc changes have been made in response to political and popular pressures. With the assistance of the National Education Commission, this policy formulation unit would undertake the formulation of a new development-oriented Higher Education Policy which could address the current issues within the entire university system. New policy initiatives are necessary to make changes in the entire structure, some features of which are today totally outmoded; totally obsolete. Therefore, new policy initiatives are necessary to change the character of the entire system. The primary aim is to promote an intellectual culture by making substantial changes in the learning environment; changes have to be made in the learning environment. Yet another objective is to create a research culture. Universities, in my view, all of you are aware of that fact, should play the leading role in disseminating knowledge through research. Through this kind of programme and policy which addresses quality improvement in the universities, we propose to create centres of excellence, national as well as regional, in the sphere of education. New universities, on the basis of this programame, could be converted into such centres as they are moving away from traditional disciplines with which the entire system was associated with in the last fifty years. We must move away from the

829 830

traditional disciplines and go in the direction of disciplines which could be used to accelerate the social and economic development of the country. There is this criticism that the allocations made to universities have been pruned and my good Friend, the Hon. Vijitha Herath too referred to it. This is a baseless allegation made by a politically-motivated student group who are a microscopic minority bent on the destabilization of universities. In 2006, the University Grants Commission was allocated Rs. 2,929 million; Rs. 193 million was allocated to universities which do not come within the purview of the University Grants Commission and the Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technological Education, SLIATE, was given Rs. 123 million. In the year 2007, the allocation was doubled and the UGC received Rs. 4,800 million; the institutions which do not come within the purview of the UGC got Rs. 160 million and the SLIATE got Rs. 51.5 million. In 2008, the university sector has been given -

( ) (The Hon. Vijitha Herath) Rs. 4,800 million . That is not correct.

. . ( ) ( () . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala- Minister of Higher Education) 2008 , Rs. 16 billion. 16 Capital and Recurrent Expenditure .

( ) (The Hon. Vijitha Herath) What is the amount allocated for Capital Expenditure?

. . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala) 2008, Capital and Recurrent Expenditure Rs. 16 billion . Okay, I do not have much time. By this time, I would like to inform my good Friend, the Hon. Vijitha Herath and this House that nearly Rs. 4,000 million worth of capital projects have been completed. Under the Tsunami Rehabilitation Project, the Ministry of Higher Education received assistance from the Kuwaiti Fund through which we were able to build a hostel at the Medical Faculty of the Ruhuna University which provides accommodation for 400 students and another hostel is to be built at the Medical Faculty of the Jaffna University which is going to provide accommodation for 200 students and the moneys from the same Fund are to be used to construct new buildings in

the universities in the East. In the entire system, there are 41 projects catering to the hostel needs of the students and there are 187 programmes with which administrative and academic needs are looked after. I am tabling* a schedule which is a comparison between students in hostels and students in rented houses from 2005 to 2007. For the SLIATE we have provided funds for seven buildings and with the completion of these, we think we will be able to increase the intake to the technical colleges spread out throughout the country. Recently, the Ministry gave Rs. 300 million to build a hall of residence at the University of Peradeniya and that has been completed. I will place before the House some useful information relating to stoppage of work in the universities. This is another menace, a major destabilizing factor which affects the university calendar. Due to student unrest and non-academic strikes, the Colombo University lost 14 days, the Peradeniya University lost 16 days, the Jayewardenepura University lost 10 days, the Kelaniya University lost 11 days, the Moratuwa University lost 10 days, the Jaffna University lost 9 days, the Ruhuna University lost 9 days, the Eastern University lost 9 days, the South Eastern University lost 11 days, the Raja Rata University lost 9 days, the Sabaragamuwa University lost 12 days and the Wayamba University lost 8 days. This is the nature of the disruption. See the financial loss incurred due to this disruption and no university with this kind of disruption, can work according to the university calendar.

Then, my good Friend, the Hon. Vijitha Herath referred to ragging. Yet another menace contributing to the destabilization of the universities is ragging. This goes on for months and it interferes with the university calendar. The best example is the Aesthetic University at Horton Place, which, according to information available, cannot complete the academic programme within the stipulated period because the students are indulging in ragging for months. I emphasize, ragging must be stopped. . So many parents have written to me, asking me to take stern action against those involved in ragging. Students have been physically harmed and certain students have become mental patients because of ragging. Therefore, I am of the opinion that the Prohibition of Ragging and other forms of Violence in Educational Institutions Act, No. 20 of 1998 needs to be implemented in full. I mean, this particular Act has enough teeth to deal with this menace. The Supreme Court of India recommended that ragging should be included as a criminal offence and action taken against the students who indulge in ragging. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , .

If he has no backbone, let him leave this institution and do some other work. He must use his discretion. They are trying to bluff us. I was in Government Service for 42 years.

30 . 30 . . . . . , . . , . [.. 2.32] . . . ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa - Deputy Minister of Higher Education) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem I feel honoured to get a chance to speak a few words at the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Higher Education and Ministry of Vocational and Technical Training. During this Discussion, we saw different political parties making submissions expressing different opinions. What is it for? It is for the betterment of the future generation in order to give them a better education through schools, technical colleges and universities. But are we united in this opinion? Why can we not be united? Why can we not have a consensus on this? Why do we not come out with a national policy on educational matters, including matters relating to technical education and university education? Are we playing with the education of the future generation? These are the questions I want to ask. Successive governments, which ruled this country have come out with different systems of education and they have done whatever possible. But, still we are having numerous problems. Would you believe that each year, nearly 500,000 youths are being just pushed into the society without undergoing any educational programme? With regard to the G.C.E O/L Examination, you will find that around 275,000 students are pushed out, because out of 525,000 students when 40 to 80 per cent of students pass the exam, what is the programme that we have for the balance 275,000 students? So is the case with the G.C.E. A/L Examination. Out of 230,000 students who sit for the exam, 117,000 odd students are qualified to enter the universities. But what is the accommodation that we have got for the students who are not qualified to enter the universities? According to statistics, the intake

for 2000 was 17,000. Twenty thousand students are going to be targeted to be given university education in the future. The most frustrated are the students who are qualified to enter the universities but are denied entrance. What is the programme that we have for them? Have we got a tangible programme for these students? We are playing with the future of these students. We can form a task force in order to improve the standard of education, improve the standard of English, provide IT education and provide degree programmes which are needed for the economic and social development of the country. Now everybody is talking about the financial constraints. We do not have finances to pump into the education sector. You should know how to earn foreign exchange. That is where foreign employment comes in. The products from the university must not only be suited to the development programmes but also the global market. There are lots of employment opportunities worldwide. Why do we not design degree programmes, technical courses and advanced technical courses to suit the global market? When you go through the global market, you find millions of vacancies in the fields of technical, catering, paramedical and so on. Why do we not target those fields? I feel that if we can get foreign exchange through these fields, all the problems can be solved. Human resources derived from education, technical education and professional education can liberate this country from all the economic problems. In order to achieve that goal, consensus among different political parties is needed. I appeal to the leaders of different political parties to think about it. You can think about our neighbouring countries. Do not be like frogs in the well. Please visit India and see what is happening there. Please visit Malaysia and the desert UAE and see what is happening there? In those countries, the education sector has been given top priority and prominence. So, why do you not visit those countries and design our own system of education? Now there is panic about privatization of education and private degree-offering institutions. But we do not ask you to give up free education. We ask you to safeguard free education. We do not ask you to abolish free education. But, at this juncture when State Universities and Technical Colleges cannot accommodate more and more students and provide more and more education facilities, what could you do? The only option is to invite private participation. The Government should formulate curricula for university education, for technical education and for advanced technical education. The Government should come out with curricula and then seek the assistance of the private participants. If that is done, I think you can get out of all these problems. Today 500,000 students are being just pushed away without any future programme. Now, I come to the higher education system. As the Minister of Higher Education stated, 20,000 students are to be accommodated for the 2008 intake. There again, we are trying to introduce a number of degree programmes, a number of courses and a number of departments, but that is not enough. I do not think that is enough.

With regard to technical education, the Hon. Piyasena Gamage proposed to start a degree programme for vocational training. This should also be considered. He proposed that diploma holders and higher diploma holders should be given a chance to obtain a degree. So the Hon. Piyasena Gamage should consider this. It is okay, you produce diploma holders and from that you can have a fraction of them for the universities. But, there are students who qualify at the G.C.E. Advanced Level. You must also take a few from the list of the "Z" score. This is one thing that I propose to the Hon. Piyasena Gamage. Now regarding the "Z" score system, there were many speeches made. The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen mentioned certain things and my Friend, the Hon. Abdul Bais wants to speak something about his area and the problems that he has. So you can see that our education system has failed to ensure equal opportunities to all the children irrespective of their ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) , .

.. . ( ) (The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa) 15 . ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) , 10 . .. . ( ) (The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa) 15 Notice Board . Please give me the time that has been allotted to me. The present system that is applied, the "Z" score system, is 40 per cent on islandwide merit and then, out of the balance 60 per cent, 50 per cent is on district basis. So you can imagine the situation that is prevailing in this system. Our education system has failed to ensure equal opportunities to all children irrespective of their class, ethnicity, residential, social and political background. The glaring inequality within the system has been clearly evident for many years. Some schools in urban areas like Colombo, Kandy, Galle, Chilaw and Kurunegala have the best of facilities while the schools in the remote and rural areas, and estate schools have little or nothing by way of qualified and competent teachers, libraries, science laboratories and computer laboratories. When there is high inequality in the distribution of education facilities in the country, it is impossible to ensure equality of opportunity. Only about 20 per cent of schools are well equipped while the rest are underprivileged schools.

. . . . , . . , . , . *, . , . Mrs. M. N. Arjuna Nediyakadu, Valvettiturai Date : 22nd Nov. 2007 Hon. Susil Prema Jayantha MP Minister of Education, Ministry of Education, Colombo. Hon. Sir, Mrs. M. N. ARJUNA J/Valvettiturai RCTMS. I wish to place the the following to your perusal and redress. I was appointed as a Volunteer Teacher in 01.08.1981 at the aforesaid school to teach Christianity and the required educational qualification for the post was G. C. E. O/L While in service, under the Teacher trainee Recruitment Scheme my Name apperatred in October 1992 list A and the Serial No. was 66. At this time I was in Colombo and was pregnant. I was unable to travewl and my inability to travel was duly informed to the D. F. Jaffna supported by a Medical Certificate from Pref S. E. Perera, Gynccologist. After my return to Jaffna, I personally called over at the office of the D. E. Jaffna regarding my appointment. Mr. R. Suntharalingam D. E. made me to understand hat I will be given appointment soon after obtaining approval from the Secretary of the Ministry. Although I made repcated requests they were not cared for Anyway, I sent several appeals, I had any hope of being getting appointed. On 20.10.1998 and 07.05.2001 interview were held to give permanent appointment to teachers serving in Government Schools. I appeared for both the interviews. Also I sat the Teachers Service competitive Examination held in 1994, 1995 and 2003 and obtained considerable scores. Presently my name is in the Volunteer Teacher Schedule released for the purpose of verification of Educational Qualification. Accordingly I

appeared for the interview held on 16.11.2007. But age limit and Educational Qualifications are now specified. When I applied to join the J/Valvettiturai RCTMS Tutorial Staff to teach Christianity GCE A/L was not the prescribed educational Qualification for Volunteer Teacher. I would therefore be obliged if you could consider my 27 years of continues service todate in the same school and my contribution towards the Co-curricular and Extra-curricular activities for the school and give me permanent appointment w.e.f. 01.09.1992 the date of my first appointment. In the alternative either from 20.10.1988 or from 07.04.2001 the interview dates. Thank you Yours truly, .. Please find annexed herewith the photo copied of the following documents; 1. Letter sent to His Excellency the President dated 21.12.2000 2. Letter sent to Hon. Minister of Education by Hon. S. Senathirajah MP dated 16.03.2001 3. Recommendation given by Mr. S. Sivarajah, Zonal Director of Education 4. Recommendation given by Mr. Selvaratnam, Zonal Director of Education 5. Attendance sheet 6.

Minister of Education, COLOMBO. Dear Minister, GRANTING OF PERMANENCY - MRS. M. N. ARJUNA, TEACHER The above named was appointed to the post of Vounteer Teacher and posted to J/Vlvettiturai R. C. T. M. School with effect from 01.03.1981. Parmanany was conferred in October 1992 as per List A No. 66. Unfortunately, she was in Colombo at that time and due to premonoy and resultant delicate physical condition, she could not undertake the tedioust journey to Jaffna, in accordance with the medical advice. This fact was promptly intimated by her to the Director of Edication Jaffna on 06.11.1992 from Colombo On her return to Jaffna, the permanent appointment was not given to her despite the handicaps which prevented her from returning to Jaffna and accepting the letter of permanency at the appropriate time. Her repeated appeals in this regard receivwed no response. Which the settlement of her genuine grievance is out-attending, she Speared for the competitive examination for selection of teachers held in 1994/95 and I am informed that she had scored sufficient marks to be considered for conferment of permaneny. Moreover, she had also actively participated in all extra curricular activities in the meantime. She also appeared for an interview held by the Director of Education, Jaffna on 28.10.1998.

In this connection my observations are as follows:- (a) At the time of her joining service, the basic qualification for teaching appointments was only G.C. E. (O/L) and since 1997 it has been elevated to G. C. E. (A/L). This stipulation is not applicable to her as she joined service very muxh prior to this year (1997)- (b) She is now 44 years of age with a continuous service period of 20 years. Taking these facts into due consideration, I shall be glad if necessary instructions are given to the authorities concerned to grant permanency to this teacher with retrospootive effect as per List A No. 66 as this is long overdue. Thanking You. Yours faithfully, MAVAI S. SENATHIRAJAH M.P. JAFFNA DISTRICT. MAVAI S. SENATHIRAJAH Member of Parliament SRI LANKA.

( . - ) (The Hon. P. Radhakrishnan - Deputy Minister of Vocational Training) Sir, I am very happy to speak on the Votes of the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Vocational and Technical Training, which are all knowledge-based. Vocational and technical training in Sri Lanka have a long history dating back to 1893 when the first technical college, now known as the Sri Lanka Technical College in Maradana was established. Over a period of time, the TEVT sector has expanded rapidly and has become an alternative channel for the youth as well as school leavers. Today, a large number of public sector institutions, private sector organizations and non-governmental organizations provide TEVT. Various types of training programmes are offered by these institutions and organizations of various durations. Currently, around 67,000 youth are undergoing training in public sector institutions in programmes leading to certificates and diplomas. In the rapidly changing technical environment today knowledge, skills and aptitude are required to perform well in any occupation. For employment in such organizations, trustworthy qualifications that reflect the level of competency from a trainee is required. It is to fulfill this requirement that several institutions have been established in the public sector. Furthermore, the TEVT sector that formed part of the Ministry of Tertiary Education has been separated and brought under a separate Ministry. However, there seems to be some reservations in the social acceptance of TEVT. Taking this into account, steps have been taken to establish a University of Vocational Technology. This will give added value to the existing Technical Colleges and Vocational Training Centres by providing pathways for middle-level persons to go up to degree level in this field of education. It is expected that jobs in the new era will demand a higher level of competency while the existing jobs will require a high level of skill. With the establishment of nine new colleges of technology at provincial level, we will be able to provide this higher level of education and the skills required. The Ministry is planning to increase the annual intake into TEVT institutions from 67,000 to 100,000 students within the next two years. Keeping in line with this, steps have been taken to establish new technical colleges and vocational training centres and to expand the facilities of existing institutes. Educated youth unemployment has been a major social, economic and political issue in Sri Lanka and the youth insurrections of 1971 and 1987 to 1989 clearly demonstrate its powerful negative impact on

2007 26 899 900

the countrys socio-economic fabric both in the short and long term. Furthermore, it has also been identified as a major contributory factor in the Northern conflict which dates back to the early 1980s. Unemployed A/L students, are a loss to the economy as their skills and knowledge are not being usefully utilized. An important aspect of unemployment is that it is concentrated among the youth and that too among the educated youth. This problem is particularly acute among A/L qualified females. With the establishment of the University of Vocational Technology, some of them can find their way to post-secondary education in the technical field leading to degree level qualifications. Another area of concern is the virtual absence of any TEVT among the plantation youth. The estate sector, where the Indian-origin Tamils dominate the population is categorized as having under-developed education facilities and no priority for skills development is given. Among the unemployed youth specifically in the plantation sector, 93 per cent do not have any type of technical or vocational skills. Thus they are disadvantaged in two areas, namely, educational qualifications and technical and vocational skills, for them to gain better employment. In the plantation region several technical education and vocational training institutes are found but the involvement of estate youth in their programmes is not prominent. Good examples are the Technical Colleges in Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Badulla and Bandarawela. They have Tamil streams at least in a few of the programmes they conduct, but in these programmes only a handful of estate youth are enrolled. The lack of participation of estate youth can be attributed to a number of reasons arising from supply as well as the demand sides of the market. Some of the important reasons are firstly, then non-availability of programmes in Tamil. Secondly, the non-availability of centres in close proximity to their settlement. This creates transport problems which is further more aggravated by the language barrier. The third is the lack of awareness about the available facilities and the usefulness of TEVT to them. And, fourthly, the household financial problems. Recent trends show that an increasing number of youths from the plantation sector are seeking non-plantation related employment. Therefore, training indeed is a priority and providing skills to the estate youth is essential especially in view of the fact that they are increasingly seeking employment outside the plantation sector. The introduction of technical and vocational training will have a positive effect on their prospects of employment outside estates. They need to be equipped with the knowledge and skill to meet the challenges created by these new prospects of employment.

The following steps will be taken in the coming year: * Conduct awareness programmes among the estate youth about the available programmes and usefulness of TEVT to them. * Introduce new programmes in the technical colleges and VTCs in the plantation areas in Tamil. * Develop the New Valley (Wanaraja) VTC into a fully fledged VTC. * Open new VTCs in plantation areas with instruction in Tamil and enrol plantation youth in their training programmes. * Take steps to overcome the shortage of Tamil instructors which is the main reason cited for not conducting programmes in Tamil. Under our Ministry, we have a prestigious institution called the National Institute of Business Management. . . ( .. ) (The Hon. M.K. Shivajilingam) , . . ( . ) (The Hon. P. Radhakrishnan)

. The NIBM is a very prestigious institute. It has not confined itself to Colombo only but it has branches in Kurunegala and Kandy and in the near future I think, it will be set up in Jaffna and Nuwara Eliya as well. I am proud to state here that in all my endeavours towards popularizing and upgrading TEVT among the plantation youth, the Minister of Vocational and Technical Training, the Hon. Piyasena Gamage and the Minister of Skills Development, the Hon. Dayasritha Thissera, extend their fullest support and blessing. We are also fortunate indeed to have ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . .

their assistance. This has made my work in the ministry a pleasant one. With officers of this calibre, it will be easy to re-establish communal harmony and ethnic peace in this country. Moreover, I have to make a small request from the Minister of Education. There is a land allocated for the establishment of a Tamil school in Wattala. I think, the UDA has already agreed to hand it over. I hope the Hon. Minister of Education will take necessary steps to take over the land and establish a Tamil school in Wattala. I have a request to make from the Minister of Higher Education also. That is, to establish a university in Nuwara Eliya which is a great necessity. There are no national colleges in the District of Nuwara Eliya and I request the Hon. Minister to consider that too. Thank you very much. [.. 3.58] . . ( .. ) (The Hon. L.G.

Mr. Chairman, as we discuss the Votes of the Ministry of Education today, I would like to share my thought on the concept of education with the Hon. Members of this House. I would also crave the

indulgence of the Hon. Members to go a little further and dwell on my own philosophy of the type of education that we should adopt in our country. We all know that education is now recognized as an inalienable and fundamental human right throughout the enlightened world. Education is enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the Charter of the United Nations. It is important in the achievement of millennium development goals. Education is the right and prerogative of every child, male and female. Education must not be a means merely to enable a child to read, write and speak and pass examinations or solely of providing skills. Mr. Chairman, through education we must strive to infuse knowledge and correct attitudes and develop a person as a complete human with a head, mind and heart. In other words, education is not just an acquisition of academic knowledge but also spiritual and moral values. This is not my philosophy. These are the words of wisdom of Prophet Muhammad - may his name be praised - over 1400 years ago. We have been paying more attention to develop skills, suit the world order, with less concern to the spiritual and moral values of our society. These skills are to meet the low level needs of developed societies. Much of the social problems we come across today stem from not paying enough concern to religious and spiritual education. Indiscipline, rebellious attitudes, immorality, addiction to drugs, the trend towards consumerism and easy lives, all these undesirable developments are primarily due to lack of spiritual and religious education during the formative years of our children. Consumerism has been elevated; spiritualism has been downgraded. Recently, I read an article of an incident in the United Kingdom where a student raped his own teacher in the school. The student would not have done this crime if he had been brought up in an environment where spiritual and moral values are upheld. In our country too, we read newspaper reports daily of misbehaviour between male teachers and female students; male teachers abusing female students; principals, teachers and students watching pornographic movies and so on. The root of the whole problem lies in the education system that we are following. We are relying on an education system to suit the world order. That is the problem. Our education must not only prepare students to face the world but also teach indigenous values, our religious heritage and cherished cultural values handed down from generation to generation from the olden times. We must remember that the Orient was the fountain-head of knowledge, technology, science, mathematics and

2007 26 911 912

astronomy long, long before and they were transmitted to Occidental by the Arabs. The Oriental World was far ahead of the Occidental World in many respects. India had a higher per capita than the West before western impact. The Al-Azhar University in Egypt was founded in 960 A.D. The famous Nalanda Buddhist University in India was founded 500 years earlier. These seats of learning came into existence long, long before the oldest universities like Oxford and Cambridge in UK, Heidelberg in Germany and the Hebrew University in the old Palestine were established. I am very grateful to the Hon. Susil Premajayantha, the Minister of Education for lending his ears to my request to open religious schools to teach Islam. I must bring to the notice of this House that appointments of Moulavies have been in abeyance for the last 15 years. I thank the Minister for his assurance that he would look into this shortcoming. ( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Minister, please bring your speech to a conclusion. .. ( .. )

( The Hon. M.N. Abdul Majeed)

Sir, can I table the rest of my speech? ( ) (The Chairman) You can table it. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.N. Abdul Majeed) I table* the rest of my speech. I would like to thank the Minister of Education, the Hon. Susil Premajayantha who is looking into the educational needs of all the districts without discrimination to the best of his ability within the resources available to him. I thank the Minister of Higher Education, the Hon. (Prof.) Wiswa Warnapala and the Minister of Vocational and Technical Training, the Hon. Piyasena Gamage. I also thank all the Deputy Ministers and all the Secretaries in charge of Education, Higher Education and Vocational and Technical Training. Thank you very much.

: : Rest of the speech tabled : It is only by teaching religion that we can create a society of cultured people. We have now created a statutory authority to combat the spreading menace of drugs We already have a Narcotics Bureau. In my opinion, there is no need for such measures, if we take concerted efforts to place faith in religious subjects in the school curriculum and also open more schools to teach religious and moral values. Students who pass out from such schools will never be attracted to drugs. On the contrary, they themselves will be the civil guardians to stop the menace of drugs. Hon. Chairman, when I look the Ministrys publication on Progress 2007 and Targets 2008, I see that Religious Education has been placed as number one, out of the 22 items listed for implementation, under short-term and long-term plans. This is a desirable priority. I commend the Ministry for it. Therefore, I am very happy to speak on a subject that been given high priority under His excellencys Mahinda Chintana Programme. We all look forward to its implementation by our energetic Minister of Education, Hon. Susil Premajayantha. Hon. Chairman, the Member of Parliament for Trincomalee District, I must also bring to your notice that education is a sphere where my district has been severely affected by disasters. One is the war which went on for nearly 20 years and the other is tsunami. Both affected education is Trincomalee to a great extent and it is only now that education is slowly being brought back. However, a lot remains to be accomplished to solve the problems of acute shortage of teachers, furniture for schools and building facilities. Almost all the education divisions suffer shortages in one way or the other. In some divisions, the shortages are so acute, that the schools are barely managing to provide education to the students. I do not want to take your time by giving full details of shortages in the district. However. I wish to highlight the shortages only in some divisions so as to give an idea of the dimensions of the problem that we are facing. First, I wish to highlight about the teacher shortages in just two divisions. Kuchchaveli comes under the Trincomalee Education Zone. I give the vacancies of teachers that now exist in some of the schools in Kuchchaveli :- 1. Pulmoddai Maha Vidyalaya Primary education -6 English -6 Science -3 Maths -2 Art -1 I.

Arafat Nagor Muslim Vidyalaya Primary education -4 English -2 Science -1 Social Studies -1 Total -8 Altogether for Kuchchaveli area alone there are 109 vacancies for teachers. Mutur Education Zone is the largest education zone in Trincomalee. The Student Teachchr ratio in many schools are far below the requirements. Again, just to show some examples, I would like to give some figures. 01. siraj Nagar Muslim maha vidyalaya in Mullipothanai has only 27 teachers for 1145 students. 02. In van-Ela Buhary Vidyalaya there are only 17 teachers for 844 students. 03. fathima Balika Vidyalaya : This school has only 9 teachers now and it needs another five teachers. The total requirements of teachers for Mutur Zone are : English Teachers =174 Secondary Teachers =65 Science & Maths =98 Aesthetics =78 Guidance and counseling =47 Teacher-Librarians =32 Education =18

In Mutur Zone, Echchitampattai is an area very badly affected by violence and military operations. Out of 16 schools. 14 have been now re-opened. I must thank His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Minister of Education for taking quick action under the Nagenahira Navodaya Programme to re-open these schools. However, these schools, too, face much shortages of teachers and furniture. As far as Mutur Zone is concerned, I would request more English teachers as this would help the students to proceeed to higher studies. Another reason for more English teachers is due to the Governments wise policy of teaching in English medium from Grade six in schools where this facility could be provided. Kantatalai Education Zone Kantalai Education Zone has more Sinhala medium schools than other zones. This Zone also suffers from shortage of teachersespecially in Padawi-Siripura, Gomarankadawala, Morawewa and Seruwila. The vacancies that need to be filled are : Primary teachers - 27 Science teachers - 28 English teachers - 27 The areas I have mentioned are remote areas. One of the problems is that teachers do not stay long to serve the schools as they are in remote places. I suggest that in recruitment the people of the respective areas be given preference. Generally, a distinction in English is expected of G.C.E. (O/L) for English Teacher Trainees. I suggest that this requirement be released if sufficient students cannot be found who have distinctions in English. Those with credit pass in English could be recruited as Voluntary Teachers and then trained in Colleges of Education or Teacher Training Colleges. Hon. Chairman, I wish to say about shortages of school furniture also. As examples of the acute shortage of furniture, let me give you some figures regarding the Mutur Zone. Students desksType A Required 16975 Available 9448 Shortage 7527 Students desksType B Required 10707 Shortage 6599 Students desks-Type C Available 5050 Shortage 2480 Students chairs -Type A Available 9885 Shortage 1090 Students chairs -Type B Available 10901 Shortage 6505 Teachers tables : 1200 Required.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , .

ARSON ATTACK ON THE SUNDAY LEADER PRESS ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Speaker, I move that, During the early hours of 21st November, 2007, The Sunday Leader press situated within the High Security Zone of the Air Force Camp premises in Ratmalana, where The Sunday Leader, The

931 932

Morning Leader and the Iru Dina newspapers are printed, was damaged and set on fire by a gang of armed persons who had entered wearing masks, after assaulting the employees who were there, causing severe damage to that institute. While nobody has so far been taken into custody in this regard, it can be considered as the biggest attack launched on the media after this Government came into power. Therefore, it is moved in this House that there should be immediate intervention to bring into custody the culprits involved in this attack and that justice be done by taking steps to pay compensation out of Government funds in respect of the damage caused to it. Sir, I stand up in this House at a time when the free media is at its worst of situations, with harassment, intimidation and distortion of truth taking place. This has not only created a problem within the country but it has got international recognition as of now and that is the reason why I move this Adjournment Motion on the recent attack that has taken place on The Sunday Leader press. Hon. Speaker, when I get up at this particular moment I am happy to see the Hon. Minister of Mass Media and Information smiling not knowing what his future would be. At this particular moment we are being rated as one of the worst six countries in the world. We join the select band of Ethiopia, Nepal, Venezuela, Russia, Zimbabwe and you as the Minister join from Sri Lanka. This is the type of background in which we are speaking. At a time when the truth is being stifled and misrepresented and the Government media is having a choice of their own, character assassinating and when the truth comes out from the free media, in order to ensure that this is stifled or to ensure that the truth does not come out, intimidation takes place. Just a couple of days ago The Sunday Leader press was gutted. This is not the first time that this institution has gone through this and it is not the only private media institution that is having this problem.

You would basically find that the Mavubima newspaper is sealed, Iqbal Athas is going through untold miseries, Lalith Alahakoon of The Nation newspaper has been subject to questioning on certain matters that have been reported in the newspapers and Champika Liyanaarachchi of the "Daily Mirror" has been questioned when she had voiced her own independent opinion on certain matters. Parameshwari, you know what she was subjected to and the indomitable Lasantha Wickrematunga, for the seventh time, had to face this deplorable harassment. Not only he at The Sunday Leader but you would find Sonali, Dilrukshi, Arthur; all of them have been subject to various types of harassment. Hon. Minister, you and I in this House would love to cherish free media. All of you speak of it. But does it take place? When we speak at this particular moment you are in the Government. You will be in the Opposition tomorrow. We are in the Opposition today and we will be in the Government tomorrow. But that does not mean that you have got to stifle and intimidate the independent

media. The independent media is a healthy tool, come what may, at any time in any country. And, we being one of the six countries I mentioned earlier shows the calibre that we have fallen into. Hon. Minister, the most shameful thing is that you have been a Minister on all these occasions. When The Sunday Leader was sealed you were a Minister. The last time when it was burnt you were a Minister. [Interruption.] Well, I accept if you say, no, but you would have been in the Government. Now again you are a Minister on this occasion when the Press was burnt down and look at the imputation that is being given by your Deputies. They basically said, Can this not be done to discredit the Government? When they were in the Commonwealth Meeting in Uganda, - what a country to be! - here in Sri Lanka a media institution is being burnt down and they say that it is to discredit the Government. Now, the Hon. Prime Minister is here and the Hon. Foreign Minister who created much news is also here. Are you telling me that every time when something happens in the country it is to discredit the Government? When the cost of living goes up, Hon. Speaker, it is to discredit the Government. When there is a problem regarding Pakistan in the Commonwealth, that is to discredit the Government. But, we are here in Sri Lanka. Then, when there is distorted information about the war, that is to discredit them. Why the hell are you governing then? Please leave and ensure that somebody who can, governs the country instead of blaming the Opposition just for the sake of doing so. If you cannot govern yourselves, do not blame the innocent outside. Does that mean "The Sunday Leader" needs to be burnt? Does that mean the "Mavubima" needs to be closed down? Does that mean Iqbal Athas has got to be harassed? Does that mean Parameshwari has got to be followed by the CID? Does that mean that Arthur or Dilrukshi or Sonali has to be subjected to harassment? Just because Lasantha Wickramatunga has the audacity to give facts in a different way, is this the answer you have to give in the modern world? We are living in the Twenty First Century. We are not living in the Stone Age. That is what your Government is trying to do at every given moment. Look at the harassment some of our Members undergo; the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella and myself. Just because you cannot do business in this country, you are engaged in character assassination saying various things. You are the Minister. Shamelessly your Government institutions are engaged in this type of activities. We, at this particular moment, do not know why and for what reason it has been done. You yourselves have created a huge problem. Your left hand does not know what your right hand is doing. The Leader Publications Limited happens to be in Ratmalana, an area where you have got an airport and which is a high security zone where every 300 or 400 yards you have a police checkpoint or an army

[ ]

933 934

2007 26

checkpoint. This happened at night when certain classified information had come up. Hon. Minister, any sane person - this Government has been running this country for a long period out of 14 years, except for a slight break of two years, under an Executive Presidency - would see the difference in media freedom then and now. We enshrined media freedom, taking away criminal defamation laws and what a price we are paying for that! There are certain people who do not have common sense and the decency to at least give the due credit to the UNP for doing so. Never mind, we will forget that. But, please do not harass the free media. As I said earlier, we are in the Opposition today; we might be in Government tomorrow. You are in Government today and you might in the Opposition tomorrow. Do you want to be subjected to this type of harassment? No. So, on that score, all you have got to do is to ensure that this type of things do not happen, instead of just blaming the Opposition for discrediting the Government. We can discredit you in much better ways if we want to, because you all have got caught with your pants down, to be very frank. We do not need to discredit the Government. You yourselves have done it very well in letting the cost of living to rise; you yourselves have done it very well in the peace process; you yourselves have done it very well by isolating this country from the international community. You tell the USA one thing; you tell India another thing and you have done something else with regard to Pakistan and Japan. You go out, create enemies and come back. Today, when the world is looking down on certain countries, you visit countries like Iran. So, we do not need to discredit the Government. Do it yourselves very well. All you have got to do is, living in the Twenty First Century, to ensure that you do not take the country back to the Seventeenth or the Eighteenth Century by running the Government. That is all we are asking for. Look at where the world has placed Sri Lanka. Due to lack of time, with great respect, Mr. Chairman - I take full responsibility for what is reported - I seek your permission to table* the responses of the IPI and the Commonwealth Press Union appearing in the article titled "Govt. under fire over Leader fire" of the "Sunday Times" of 25th November, 2007 to be included in Hansard. These are not statements against this country, but they have stood up and asked, What is going on in your country? They have very forcefully said this. Likewise, Reporters without Borders and the United Nations have stepped in to condemn this Hon. Prime Minister, you are trying to do your very best at a time when it is impossible for you to defend the Government. Look at what is being told by the international community. At the end of the day, they are necessary to take the country forward. We have the peace process to undertake. You are looking at

the problem from a war perspective. But, at the end of the day, you have to get international support. Then, look at how the New York based Committee to Protect Journalists has responded to this. What do they say? We are living in a banana republic. Have you heard of an incident before, in a high security zone with enough army and police personnel, of masked people, armed to their teeth, coming and ransacking a place that prints newspapers which have been critical of the Government? They are not denying that. If they have been doing something wrong against the Government, why do you not sue them? You tried to harass an innocent young boy just because he produced a telephone bill of a Minister. Was it wrong? At the end of the day, you say that they are discrediting the Government. Hon. Prime Minister, maybe, these are your Government's last days, but please do not resort to this type of actions. Because, at the end of it all, it leaves a very bad taste in the mouth. After all, we have to live with the international community. It must see Sri Lanka as as an up-and-coming country. Maybe, we have problems. Every country has its own problems, but do not create further problems. That is the important thing. You can catch bees with honey than with vinegar. So, if there is a problem, if this institute, this newspaper is producing reports which rank to character assassination, then take them to court. You have a system. That is the place where justice is done. It is done not by allowing some bandits or some politically bankrupt persons, who cannot win an election but who have come in through the National List, to go and create this type of problem. Does that help? I can relate names, but it would not help the process. I do not want to just make it a personal agenda. I am speaking on behalf of all the media institutions in the private sector. They are not our friends. Sometimes, they take the United National Party to task, but they should have that fundamental right: the freedom to report. The media needs to be protected and the United National Party is very firm on that particular stand. Going further, if you take the high security zone, an incident occurred; armed bandits came in and set the place on fire. Hon. Minister, was it with a sense of honesty that you made the press statement? There was the question, how on earth did the fire brigade of Dehiwela-Mount Lavinia come so quickly? You know, Lal Wickramatunga, at 2.45 in the morning, had called the Colombo Municipal Council and they had said, Sorry, please contact the fire brigade of Dehiwela-Mount Lavinia. Are you worried that they came and doused the fire so quickly? Why are you exposing yourself to this type of criticism? Some johnny in your system may have done this. But why should you assassinate your character yourself? That is the problem that every like-minded person is asking. When you say "Anura Yapa", there is a somewhat separate identity that you have created. Are you trying to expose that to destruction just because some

* . * . * Produced at end of speech.

935 936

bandits had gone and ruined that place? I am asking, why did you do this? As I said, this place had been sealed before; it had been burned once before, it had been taken to court before and this is the latest attempt. Are you, by doing this, trying to stop the newspaper? That morning, the newspaper came out; on Sunday, the newspaper came out. You cannot stop it. Can you try to stop information going out? Today, the world has a web base - you have websites and e-mail facilities - it can spread by word of mouth and the television plays a lead role. So, by doing this, you are only trying to say, Yes there is a problem in this Government. We, the Government, want to stop this and that is the reason why we do this type of thing. We condemn this type of absolutely disgraceful, distasteful actions that cannot be defended. Whoever it is, you have to bring them to book. Today, it is almost five days since then and there is not a trace. The police are well aware of it. You speak to the police. Unofficially, they will say these are the goons that came; this is the squad that came; these are the people who came. Then, why do you not bring them to book? This is a time when the courts are open even on Saturday and Sunday and people are taken into custody without rhyme or reason. When you know the things that went on, why do you not resort to that? Hon. Prime Minister, ensure that something is done. We have had enough international debacles. We do not want to create - ( ) (Mr. Speaker) - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

, . , . , . . , . : : Sections of newspaper article tabled : SL back in IPI Watch List The International Press Institute (IPI) has unanimously decided to add Sri Lanka to the IPI Watch List while retaining Ethiopia, Nepal, Russia, Venezuela and Zimbabwe on it. The IPI Watch list includes countries in which press freedom conditions have rapidly deteriorated. The guiding principle behind the Watch List is to open up a dialogue with these countries before they slide into repression, the statement said. Sri Lanka was added to the IPI Watch List in October 2000, after the then President Chandrika Kumaratunga imposed heavy restrictions on the media. However, the Board removed Sri Lanka from the Watch List in September 2003, after an IPI delegation traveled to Sri Lanka to meet Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe and other ministers. Unfortunately, the situation has deteriorated over the last 18 months, and the report of an international mission to Sri Lanka that included IPI in June 2007 said the pressure on the media have multiplied with increasing fears for the safety of journalists, IPI said. The statement also criticized the government for the lack of progress in the investigations of murdered and attacked journalists. Independent Newspapers under threat Executive Director of the Common-wealth Press Union (CPU) Lindsay Ross has written to President Mahinda Rajapaksa urging the Government to investigate the arson attack at the Leader publications print site as a matter of extreme urgency saying this incident raises serious questions over the future safety of all the independent newspapers in Colombo. Excerpts: The Commonwealth Press Union, which represents the interests of the independent press of the Commonwealth, unreservedly condemns the arson attack at Leader Publications print site, on November 21. The intimidation, at gunpoint, of the employees and the subsequent firebombing of the printing presses by masked gunmen are unacceptable in a democracy and we urge the Government to investigate this contemptible action as a matter of extreme urgency. As it is well documented that the Leader has been a frequent and outspoken critic of the Government, it is even more imperative that the Government is even more imperative that the Government is seen to act swiftly to bring the perpetrators to justice. If an incident of this nature can occur in a high-security zone close to a military airfield and guarded by military personnel, it does raise serious questions over the future safety of all the independent newspapers in Colombo. The CPU is deeply concerned over the deteriorating situation with regard to press freedom in Sri Lanka. Over the past two years much of the progress made in recent years has been systematically eroded and incidents such as this only create a chilling atmosphere and ensure that Sri Lanka remains high on international watch lists.

Previous to the Leader attack, we had already recently raised concerns over the plight of the independent Tamil newspapers, including murders of journalists that appear to go unresolved, and the predicament of internationally renowned journalist, lqbal Athas, who has had to leave the country amid very genuine fears for his safety. Just today we received news of yet another journalist abducted in Jaffna. The apparent unwillingness of the authorities to intervene in thise incidents are indicative of a disturbing trend ; that of trying to silence any independent voice that is critical of the government. Whilst we appreciate that Sri Lanka has a serious terrorism probelm, there can be no excuse for suppressing either the rights of individuals to express opinions or for the right of the population to be independently informed of issues of national importance. It is universally recognized that a free press is a conerstone of democracy and if the government of Sri Lanka has a genuine commitment to press freedom it will act swiftly to ensure that independent newspapers and their employees can work in an atmosphere free of free and intimidation.
