( ) (The Presiding Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you Mr. Presiding Member for giving me this opportunity to speak in this House at a very decisive moment; at a time when some of our Friends have parted company and some of our enemies have realized and come back. This is a very sad and tragic situation. However, Parliament keeps on going . Are we not sinking into greater depths? This is the question that everybody is asking. I am happy that the Hon. Prime Minister is here and the Leader of the House is here. We are absolutely at a critical juncture. But are we acting as statesman as expected of us by the people? This is far from the truth. Today, people are talking not of Sri Lanka but of a Free Lanka. The way people are projecting themselves is as if all wars are won, all economic problems have been conquered and the world is at our feet. But the Hon. Prime Minister, you were in India and you know the reality. We have been there acting as a responsible Opposition and we must collectively see whether we are going in the correct way. If this is by chance there is no problem at all. But if it is by choice then it is a problem. If we want to choose the destination that we want to go, the responsibility for the repercussions coming out of that should fall on them. As I said, if it is something well beyond our control, people will understand that. But the Hon. Prime Minister, I do not think your own conscience will agree that this is the case. There was a golden opportunity in this country to take the problems head on. Sometimes people have been accusing the United National Party saying that we are impotent, that we are not forceful enough. We understand the critical factors as a party that has governed this country for most of the time. We know the sensitivities, and we know that if you go beyond a certain point it touches the very nerve of this country. That is the reason why we have been acting more statesmanly. And just because we act in that manner do not ever think that we are weak, we are incompetent and that we are not ready to take on the Government. No, we think that there is a necessity at this particular moment not to think about political divide but ensure that we unite this country. But certain actions of the Government do not prove that at all. The Memorandum of Understanding was something that every single person in this country, be it from North to South or East to West, looked forward to. Do not think that the United National Party signed this through fear or because we are weak. No, we saw that this was the need of the hour and we came forward. Not only the Sri Lankan community, even the international community endorsed this. And there were new avenues that were opened. But within two to three months all this has become an absolute nightmare. The Memorandum of Understanding has become a Memorandum of

misunderstanding. That is what has happened and today it is non-existent. If we go back in history, on the 17th of November, 2005, the Peoples Alliance, we do agree, did get a very small majority. But, whatever said and done, they got a mandate for whatever reason or whatever crime committed in this country. What did they say? They said, We will abrogate the Ceasefire Agreement; we will ensure that you have honourable peace; we will ensure that nobody is ever harmed in this country; that peace would dawn quicker than anybody expects with no deaths at all and we will ensure that all these problems will be brought to an end through a unitary solution. Then, there were many other political rhetoric on the reduction of the cost of living. You would remember them talking about pulling out plugs and a Buddhist regime being brought into existence. Where are we now, Sir? It is with sadness that we are speaking in this House. Are we heading in the correct direction? Today, you would see that this country has problems; the Government has problems; the Opposition has problems and the United National Party has problems. All this reflect that at the end of the day it is the people who have the problem. At every forum, we talk about benefits to the people. But at the end of the day it comes down to very narrow-minded actions. The curse of this country has been that. When we are at the lowest ebb, we have got to think of the best way as statesmen and that is the need of the hour. Look at what had been said by the Leader of the House. The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva has been quoted in The Island of 06th February, 2007. It states, I quote; Rs. 1,000 bn spent on war That is a statement by him. A thousand billion rupees is no mean amount of money. This was mentioned by him. Today the President, the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and every single party collectively say that there is a need to bring peace to this country. They call upon all Opposition parties to unite. We have a situation where all the political parties got together and came up with a formula that is acceptable to all and that was rejected by the very Government that put that Committee into place. Then the newspapers went to town. Yesterday, the TNA very responsibly said that they are not interested in speaking on the peace issue and they basically rejected the offer that was put forward by the President. But the headline of todays Daily News states, I quote: Tamil leaders endorse Presidents call. Invitation to TNA to join Government to establish peace." What more untruth than this? This is absolute hypocrisy. Yesterday they had a press conference and said, This is the area we do not trust. But, this is what

191 192

appears as todays headline in the Government newspaper. Hon. Prime Minister, these are not matters that we can take just at face value. Look at what has been said by many of the Tamil and Muslim leaders. What has the Hon. Rauff Hakeem been saying? Now he is part of your Government. Then look at what the newspaper headlines reported as the Hon. Anura Bandaranaike having said yesterday. What does the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera say and what does the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle say in this House? He is asking whether there is democracy. This is before it spills out to the Opposition and it has become a fashion today. Then, the Hon. Chandrasekaran, I refer to today's "Morning Leader", has been complaining at the Government Group Meeting. The Hon. Radhakrishnan joined him on that. Another newspaper reports, The country is in deep trouble if abductions not arrested, warns Mahinda Samarasinghe. Going on further, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem repeatedly mentioned that the problem in the North is one, the problem in the East is another and requested the Government to ensure that the problem in the East also does not swell like the Northern problem. So, it goes on and on and on. Are we knowingly and willingly heading into further problems? Hon. Prime Minister, from the 17th of November, 2005 up to this particular moment, we have had almost 5,383 deaths. There are abductions taking place. Even yesterday three members of the media were abducted. Then, today they say that they have been arrested. People were abducted, forcefully taken away from their houses without any knowledge. Suddenly, they say that they had been arrested without a legal process for the reason that they have been associated with the LTTE. Whom are we trying to fool? The unions came down very hard on the Government and said, "Please ensure that this is sorted out, if not we will come out as a collective body, teaming up against this type of absolutely nefarious, activities that are taking place. Hon. Prime Minister, the Hon. Joseph Pararajasinghams voice was silenced in this House. Our good Friend, the Hon. Raviraj is no more in this House. At the end of the day, what will happen is, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our Friends. That is the stark reality. The world is talking about us. Hon. Prime Minister, you were in India on the invitation of Mrs. Sonia Gandhi, where you were one of the leading players. What did the Prime Minister of India tell you? What he told you was what he told us - the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Lakshman Kirella, the Hon. Sajith Premadasa and myself. We only want to say, Please do not let this little Sri Lanka be torn to pieces. Power is not something to be held at any cost. There is no point in being greedy for power. We have seen other leaders who have held power through greed and finally what their destiny has been.

There is a point when you say you have got to ensure that the collective good of the people must be looked at. This is where we in the United National Party have been responding to the request of the President and the Prime Minister of this country and the Government and it has had scant respect. We have a political party and the people to look after. We have to ensure that their aspirations are met. But, all this has to be looked at from a collective Sri Lankan point of view. That is why we basically ask, where is this Ceasefire Agreement that is being spoken of? You had four discussions in Geneva. Every meeting was worse than the previous one. Then, you went to India and the President assured the Prime Minister of India that by the end of December, 2006 there would be a peaceful, democratic solution given to the most important issue in this country. Today is the 7th of February, 2007 with nothing in sight. Then the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana presented a report of a group of intellectuals and politicians put together. They came up with a report; that is rejected by the Government. Hon. Prime Minister, the very fact of you saying that your Government would be in jeopardy if you basically submit a democratic solution, that it would bring down your Government does not exist. Our Friends, who were espousing federalism resulting in the downfall of the United National Party during the election process are now with you. The world cannot be fooled any more. You said that this type of elements are the bane of the society, the bane of the country. They are now in your lap of luxury. We, first of all must beg an apology from the United National Party's voters who trusted and placed their faith in them and voted for them. Their destiny will be decided by the people themselves. It is not my intention to run them down for what they have done at their own whims and fancies. But what has happened today, you have to expose to the world. If there is a will, there is a way. The democratic process, the solution is well within your power. You have a makeshift Government that has a majority and we have gone on record saying that if you are able to speak with the LTTE or any other warring faction and create a situation where all Sri Lankans can live, whether they are Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims or Burghers; whether they are Buddhists, Christians, Hindus or Islamists, and if you are able to give a united, Sri Lankan solution, then we will not be opposing you; we will not be standing at every wayside holding placards trying to bring the Government down, but we will assist you at the historical moment to ensure that peace dawns. I am happy to see the Minister, the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana who has come in. You, Hon. (Prof.) Vitharana, know how honourably and how statesmanlike the United National Party has helped you in your cause as much as you have had the conviction and the commitment from day one. Our Leader, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe of

the United National Party, paid the price through two elections to be in that same position. But at the end of the day, are we not thinking of a better Sri Lanka? So that does not mean that we are acting from a point of weakness. I would say that is the strength we have; that is the commitment and sincerity we have. But what has happened to you? You have been hijacked by the very institution that established you into that position. When we spoke with India, we only complimented your services at every point. They did ask. They said that there is a committee report that has come out and "What is your response in todays clandestine political environment?", was the question the Hon. Prime Minister of India asked. The response that spontaneously came was, "How can we politically help a Government that is trying to ruin our own political party? But despite that fact, we will stand tall and help the Government in their hour of need if they are able to sell this proposition to the Tamils or other warring factions and we will not be standing in the way." At that time, if help is required, we will still help you because then people will realize that what we said then is what we have done. What more, Hon. Professor Vitharana, can we do? And we must go further. This is the same thing the Co-Chairs were discussing. We must learn from the solutions in the world around us. You would look at the solution that has been very successful in South Africa. You would see how the Indonesian Ache problem has been solved. You would see that in Nepal the Maoist Movement, which was as ruthless as the warring faction here, has suddenly realized that the democratic process is the only way out for them. Then the peace process in Ireland is an absolute success and they are having elections on the 5th of March, 2007. In the Philippines, the solution to the Moro problem, which had its own problems, is back again on its proper track. So, why are we only shooting ourselves in the feet? The President of France has been commenting on this. President Chirac in expressing his sentiments on Independence Day has repeatedly mentioned the Tamil and the Sinhalese ethnic issue. Now why are we internationalizing this? This is a problem in Sri Lanka. But owing to the fact that we are trying to politicize this locally, we are getting international reputation as two communities fighting. That is the same thing the Indian Prime Minister mentioned to you, Hon. Prime Minister, and also when we went. Mrs. Sonia Gandhi, whom we met, said the same thing. We met the BJP leaders from Vajpayee to Advani, to Rajnath Singh and Viswanath Singh. All of them in one voice asked, Where is the solution? Why is the Government not going ahead now that they claim to have the solution? The JVP is no more, they say. Now you have been supplemented with more Members bringing the number to 123 after a clandestine operation with the United National Party. "Bring a solution before February", was what they communicated to you. Is that not so, Hon. Prime Minister? So, what are we doing?

Then Norway is telling the same thing. The European Union, Germany and the UK, in one voice every week in Colombo say the same thing. Japan is tirelessly trying to get this message across to a Government that is unable to realize that this is the only way out. The obstinateness of the Government that this is possible only through a military solution, only puts us into further jeopardy. If you are able to solve this, then why have you taken 14 months? We have for about 30 years been fighting this war. I, for a moment, do not want to say anything which will jeopardize the motivation of the forces, but all I want to say is that you are responsible for the lapse. Just because you have a strategic withdrawal by the warring factions from the East, it does not mean that you have conquered the East. The North and the East are a part of Sri Lanka. If a bomb goes off in the South, it is as good as an aberration of peace in this country. That is where we require you to come forward and help us. Sir, I am quoting from the newspapers. There are moves for mediation by US special envoys. Again, an internationalization. Thirty eight US Senators sign and tell the President of the United States of America, Please look into that small country, Sri Lanka. Have we not internationalized the issue? When we can solve this well among ourselves, why do we require foreign forces to come in? Is this a desired objective of some of the chauvinistic parties in our country, who want outsiders to come in so that it would be a recurring decimal or a festering wound that the economic growth would not permeate down so that there would always be unemployment, economic chaos and their political journeys would be fostered. This is what we have got to look at. You look at what happened on the 30th and 31st January 2007 in Galle when the Sri Lanka Development Forum was taking place. What a hypocritical lie the government was saying. The next day after the Forum all the papers were trying to project that we have US Dollars 4.5 billion and another US Dollars 4.5 billion has been pledged to this country. It is far from truth. The World Bank Vice-Chairman, Mr. Praful who gave a statement said that this was never a donor pledging meeting. It was only an opening to see what the Government has to offer and how they can take it forward. But, what does the Daily News of 31st January 2007 say? It states, I quote: Donor mandate for 10-year growth plan. And US Dollars 9 billion pledged in next 3 years. If you have the money Hon. Prime Minister why do you not give the prosperity that this country desires? The people of our country are destitute and our roads are in a deplorable state. Our economy is in dire straits. Unemployment is going up. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . 6 - PL 001781

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . Then, the same thing is mentioned in the Dinamina newspaper of 30th January 2007. It states, I quote: " " . . ? Then, you know what happened? This is something which we were absolutely shy of. I am sure the Hon. Prime Minister was also in the same position when the German Ambassador was told by the Government, "You represent your government in full force, if you send a secondary team you will have to face repercussions". That was mentioned to the ambassador and what did he do? He had to get back to his colleagues and he summoned a meeting and said this is what is expected of the government. And then what was the clarion call from them? If they say that this is the repercussion that we are going to face we will take that from the government. We will ensure that we will not send the team that is expected in that case. What a backlash on the Government? Remember, you all are only elected for a limited period of time to govern this country. It is not a permanent mandate for you to govern. This is not your private property. You are accountable to 20 million people . We as the Opposition can also just wait and see the things happening. There is a point beyond which the elastic will stretch and break. So, Hon. Prime Minister, please ensure some sense is maintained. The need of the hour is unity and this is the hour. Do not think that we have any problem or we are speaking through any fear. We, at this moment are having absolute public sympathy with us because people know what has been done to us. They are trying to eliminate our political party which they will never be able to do. There were many instances that they tried to do it. There were many instances where other parties have done it to your party. But at the end of the day our two big democratic parties go on. So, we have got to ensure that we move forward in order to bring peace and prosperity to the country that is certainly looking at us to give that leadership. Look at what the Indian papers say. Hindustan Times of the 1st of February 2007 says, Lanka donors decline blank cheque. This is what goes out to the world. So, where do the investors come in? Today, the cost of living is galloping day by day. There is a 20.2 per cent inflation rate. Now those who basically shouted from this side saying that the cost of living is high have got the authority to bring it down. We will see as to how they respond to this type of call. But, without fiscal management or targeting subsidies do not ever think that you can bring in prosperity that is expected. Cost of living is unbearable. Corruption is galloping by the day . Every institution has its own form of corruption whether it is taking money or whether it is not making decisions or allowing things to happen without checking is all part of corruption. Where are

the jobs that they promised? Where is the investments that they talked of? Today, we are talking of Weerawila Airport which is still accumulating dust on the foundation that was laid. Where is the Mihin Air that they said that will fly on the 4th of February 2007? All this is rhetoric. All this is nonsense. They are trying to use the EPF, ETF money, the Foreign Employment Bureau money to start these type of ventures which are a frolic of their own. People who have not even run a security company are today trying to run airlines. This is the absurdity of this country. Look at what is going on and the senseless war. Is it on purpose that it is going on? No, Hon. Prime Miniser, this is where we have got to look and turn the search light inwards. Political victimization is at its peak. All the unions are being threatened. All the media personnel are being harassed whether it is the MTV or whether it is The Sunday Leader or whether it is the Daily News or whether it is the Daily Mirror or whether it is The Island or whether it is the Lakbima or whether it is the Mawbima. What is going on in this country? Do not think that there is any purpose in trying to persecute one lot. The country has to run through a executive, the country has to run through a legislature. The country must have a judiciary and the country must have a free media to do so. There is no point in stifling one area which would never help for the benefit of this country. People are watching you all. Exasperation has set in and your own people are talking about this. There is no relish in speaking. I can tell that, This Minister said this. That Minister said this. No! The time will come when this autocratic system will break down. So, please ensure that we get together and look at what is expected from us. There is an incredible Cabinet for the first time in the world. Out of 123 Members , 111 Members are holding ministerial office. What is this? I have written to the Guinness Book of Records because you can get another record for this particular situation. But, let us get moving. The Indians are running short of time. They are also having their own political problems. Tamil Nadu is breathing fire. So, let us not make a mountain out of a molehill. Let us solve this problem that is before us. You have a sense of sincerity. We have a sense of purpose. Let us get together and ensure that we deliver what the Sri Lankans want. Chauvinistic elements are at both ends of the spectrum. Whether they are war mongers or whether they are peace mongers they should be thwarted. But, there are the average common thinking people who can achieve the necessary goals that we want. The Hon. Prime Minister, the Hon. Minister Tissa Vitharana we are running short of time. Before too long there will not be a possibility of bringing the warring factions back to peace talks. So, let us seize this opportunity. Let us not be crying for dear Sri Lanka. Let us take this opportunity now and all what I could basically say is get the fundamentals to play and do not think that clandestine operations in trying to break the political parties will ever have a dent in the United National Party. All what we say is that there is a necessity to work together. We will extend our hand.

2007 07 197 198

But, that is for the sake of Sri Lanka and not for the purpose of trying to extol the virtues of Mahinda Chintana. Today, Sir, all what we can basically say is that the world is looking at us with concern. Do not let them laugh at us. The people are suffering. Let them not cry for us. We are there to give leadership. Let us not miss that opportunity. Let the chauvinistic elements not say, This was what we told you all as a democratic party. Now, give us the opportunity. So, I do not want to take further time. I have extended my courtesy to you. All what we can basically say is, please take it in this hour of need with the best of intentions. Let us before the next Emergency Debate say that we have provided a democratic solution to the warring factions. Let us make a dent for the world to reflect their attention and then put pressure on where they should and not on us. Thank you very much. [.. 2.42] . . ( )
