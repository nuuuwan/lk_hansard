III () : () : LOCAL AUTHORITIES ELECTIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL : DETERMINATION OF THE SUPREME COURT

( ) (Mr. Speaker) 122(1)() . 123(1) . . :

: Determination of the Supreme Court : IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA LOCAL AUTHORITIES (SPECIAL PROVISIONS) BILL S. C. (S.D.) No. 01/07 Before : C. N. JAYASINGHE Judge of the Supreme Court N. G. AMARATUNGA Judge of the Supreme Court D. J. DE S. BALAPATABENDI Judge of the Supreme Court Counsel : P. A. Rathnayake PC, Additional Solicitor General, with Indika Demuni De Silva, Senior State Counsel for the Attorney General. Court assembled for hearing on 30th March, 2007 at 10.00a.m. His Excellency the President has addressed a reference dated 29.03.2007 to this Court in terms of Article 122 (1)(b) of the Constitution requesting this Court to make a special determination as to whether the Bill bearing the title Amendment to the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance or any provision therof is inconsistent with the Constitution. The Bill bears an endorsement in terms of Article 122(1) of the Constitution made by the Secretary to the Cabinet of Ministers that in the view of the Cabinet of Ministers the Bill is urgent in the national interest. The Attorney General was noticed in terms of Article 134(1) of the Constitution and Mr. P. A. Rathnayake PC, Additional Solicitor General, assisted Court in considering the constitutionality of the Bill and its clauses. The Bill privides to amend Section 65A (2) of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance No. 53 of 1946 as amended. The proposed amendments are in respect of vacancies arising in the general membership of a Local Authority. It seeks to renumber Sub-Section 65A(2) as Sub-section 65A(2)(a) and delete the paragraph therein commencing with the words where all the candidates whose names were in such nomination paper to the end of that Sub-section. It is further proposed to add two new Sub-sections as 65A(2)(b) and 65A(2)(c).

The said new Sub-Section 65A(2)(b) permits the filing of a vacancy in the general membership of a Local Authority by a person eligible under the said Ordinance where all the candidates whose names appear in the nomination paper submitted by any recognized political party or independent group in respect of the electoral area had been elected or where none of the candidates whose names remain on such nomination paper, have secured any preferences and as a result the vacancy continues to exist. We have examined the clauses in the Bill and we make determination in terms of Article 123 that neither the Bill nor any of its clauses are inconsistent with the Constitution.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, we are not for mixing politics with the game of cricket because it is played by teams and not by the governments of those countries. Therefore, Amnesty Internationals attempt which by any means discourages our team or for that matter any other team should not be encouraged at all. We are certainly against it. But as I mentioned earlier in this House, Hon. Speaker, this is a repercussion that innocent people like cricketers and all others have to face because the Government is violating human rights as much as the LTTE. Both are violating - [Interruption]. Hon. Speaker, they wanted me to condemn it. I have condemned it. But I

2007 03 2527 2528

must give the reasons. My reasons are different from that of the JVP. I think we all agreed that the Amnesty International should not in any way disrupt the proceedings of the cricket match or put our team at risk. That would apply to others also. But having said that and having said what the Amnesty International is trying to bring into the cricket grounds is certainly not going to help the match at all and we, like others condemn it. I would also like to say that this is happening not only here. When we go abroad we are asked, "Do you come from a country which is violating human rights?". Our trade is getting affected. Our aid is getting affected. A billion dollars is getting affected. We have a country in which we have not - [Interruption.] ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe)

Sir, because the Hon. Member said that he did not hear properly what I said and wants it in Sinhalese, I will ask the Chief Opposition Whip to say that in Sinhalese.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike) Sir, as a former Speaker and a senior Member of Parliament I cannot understand why there is such a fuss about this because there is nothing in Erskine May or in Kaul and Shakdher - that is in England and in India - to prevent a Member of Parliament crossing over even ten times a day. He came here and now he has gone back. So, that is his right. Nobody can stop that. But regarding his seat as you rightly mentioned, he must write to you that he has crossed back to the UNP and then you will have to allocate him a seat. That is all.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) That is right. , . . , . . .
