ACTIVITIES OF UNICEF IN SRI LANKA: STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama - Minister of Foreign Affairs) , . UNICEF , . Hon. Speaker, I have given due consideration to the statements made by the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa, Member of Parliament in this House over the past few weeks concerning activities of the United Nations International Childrens Emergency Fund, UNICEF, in Sri Lanka. I wish to inform this House that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already brought these allegations to the attention of the United Nations and has taken necessary action. On 28th November, 2007, the United Nations Resident Co-ordinator and the Country Representative of the UNICEF were summoned by me to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to express our concern on the main issues and clarification was sought. This meeting was also attended by the Director-General of Sri Lanka Customs. In addition, a separate meeting was convened on 29th November, 2007 at officials' level on my instructions with the participation of officials of the Sri Lanka Customs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Manager, Supply and Procurement of the UNICEF. The following four main issues were discussed at these meetings: (A) Import of "Meals Ready to Eat", referred easily as MRE by the UNICEF. (B) Participation of UNICEF Staff members in a local demonstration.

(C) Use of bullet-proof vehicles. (D) The UNICEFs involvement in TRO activities. I will now respond under each of these headings. (A) Import of "Meals Ready to Eat", MRE, by the UNICEF. The UNICEF has imported a consignment of food ration packs under "Meals Ready to Eat" definition on 17th September, 2007 containing 5,640 packs of MREs to the value of Euro 40,537.50 equivalent to Sri Lanka Rupees 6,304,627.12. According to the documents provided by the UNICEF to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this consignment of food has been imported for the exclusive consumption of the UNICEF staff during an emergency situation and kept by the UNICEF in its seven zonal offices outside Colombo and in their main office in Colombo. The United Nations Resident Co-ordinator subsequently clarified that the UNICEF had purchased these ration packs on behalf of 12 UN agencies operating in Sri Lanka to be used in the event of an emergency. The ration is sufficient for three days. Clarification was sought as to why the UNICEF had imported MRE packs for emergency purposes when there is no emergency situation prevailing in the country. The UNICEF explained that according to the normal standard operations of the UN, emergency rations are kept in a contingency stock and distributed to all UN offices throughout the world for the use of its staff. It was discovered that there existed a discrepancy between the shipping document and the Clearance Certificate for this consignment. Since the clearance of the diplomatic cargo is based on the Certificate issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a comprehensive screening system was implemented with immediate effect. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will undertake this task in consultation with the Sri Lanka Customs and other relevant Line Ministries and agencies including the Ministry of Defence, the Telecommunication Regulatory Authority et cetera. The Sri Lanka Customs has inspected a sample of a MRE pack and found that it contained two tins of canned meat, biscuits, cheese, marmalade, milk, sugar and a substance used to warm the food. There was no indication or label which enabled them to ascertain whether the items belonged to the UNICEF or any other UN organization. The MREs were in camouflage packing and had been imported from a military supplier in France. The UNICEF representative explained that the purchase of MREs had been done through a tender procedure and since the quantity was small, it was bought from a military supplier. The UNICEF representative further clarified that the UN logo is used on items imported for charitable purposes. This explanation on the absence of the logo was unsatisfactory, taking into account, inter alia, the nature of the items. The Ministry

2515 2516

[ ]

of Foreign Affairs indicated that it is imperative that the UNICEF or the UN logo is attached to the items so imported, in a clear and a visible manner. The absence of a clear logo allowed such items to be abused by ill-intentioned groups and persons who are not the real beneficiaries - a situation, inevitably resulting in accusations being levelled against the Customs and even the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for any negligent discharge of their duties. Furthermore, the fact that it had been in military camouflage packing itself raises doubt in the event it gets into undesirable locations or to undesirable hands. The UNICEF was requested to propose a mechanism to ensure the safe storage and safe distribution of the MREs. The UNICEF agreed to share information on this with the Government. I have advised that a detailed investigation be carried out in this connection by the relevant authorities. The Criminal Investigation Department is currently conducting an investigation on the import of Meals Ready to Eat packs by the UNICEF as a result of that. (B) Participation of the UNICEF staff members in a local demonstration. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Country Representative of the UNICEF on 22nd November, 2007 to the Ministry and expressed serious concern on the participation of several members of the UNICEF staff in a public demonstration in June 2007 and I requested them to take appropriate action including the withdrawal of the relevant international staff from Sri Lanka and the termination of the relevant local staff. I strongly conveyed to the UN Resident Co-ordinator at our meeting on 28th November that the participation of his staff in a demonstration was unacceptable and requested that the services of such staff be terminated immediately. The participation of the UN staff in such activities is in violation of its mandate and a breach of privileges and immunities provided to the UN staff by receiving States under the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations. The Government will take stern action against those who are found guilty after an inquiry, if there is strong ground to believe that there had been an abuse of diplomatic immunities and privileges in accordance with the measures open to the receiving States to deal with such situations. During the meeting the UNICEF Country Representative acknowledged that four staff members of the UNICEF participated at the demonstration which is a violation of the UN mandate and informed that inquiries are presently being carried out by the UN Department of Human Resources in New York. The UNICEF informed my Ministry on 4th December, 2007, consequent to my intervention that the two international staff members namely, Mrs. Lara Scott who

worked as a Management and Co-ordination Project Officer and Ms. Rachel McKinney who worked as an Emergency Education Co-ordinator have been withdrawn from the country on 6th November, 2007 and 4th November, 2007 respectively. The contract of Ms. Patricia Purvez who worked as a consultant was terminated on 19th October, 2007. My Ministry will advise the Controller of Immigration and Emigration to deport any expatriate who stays in the country in violation of the relevant regulations even after their contracts have been terminated. UNICEF has informed that it will keep my Ministry informed regarding the case of the national staff member. The Country Representative of UNICEF informed that the concerns of the Government of Sri Lanka have already been conveyed to the Head Office. I will call for every involved officer's immediate termination in the event such a person continues to serve in this Agency. ( C ) Use of bulletproof vehicles. Regarding the issue of the use of bulletproof vehicles, the UNICEF Country Representative informed that only one vehicle fitted with bulletproof plate is available in Batticaloa. This is to ensure the safety of its staff from explosions. My Ministry informed the UNICEF that fixing a bullet-proof plate to a vehicle without approval from the Ministry and the Department of Motor Traffic is a breach of the relevant regulations. It constitutes a significant alteration to the vehicle, permissible under the Motor Traffic laws of the country. The Commissioner of Motor Traffic will be made aware of this situation for suitable action. ( D ) UNICEFs involvement in TROs activities. On UNICEFs involvement of TROs activities, the UNICEF Country Representative confirmed that there was no evidence of any illegal transactions that had taken place between the UNICEF and the TRO. However, as a measure of confidence-building, the UN Headquarters is presently carrying out a full audit with regard to the alleged involvement of the UNICEF in TRO activities. The outcome of the audit will be shared with the Government of Sri Lanka. At that time, I will also make it available to the learned Members of this House. The position of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is that we will not permit any organization to function in Sri Lanka in violation of the national security interest and that of our territorial integrity and the sovereignty of our people. We will take every measure to ensure that our standpoint prevails in the future.

The legal position relating to the aspects of immunity from criminal jurisdiction concerning diplomats and officials of the United Nations : Diplomatic agents. The aspect of immunity from criminal jurisdiction concerning diplomats is governed by the provisions of Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, 1961. Diplomatic agents enjoy immunity from criminal jurisdiction of the receiving State, that is the country in which they serve. Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations very lucidly states that a diplomatic agent shall enjoy immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving State. However, the sending State, the country from which the diplomats come into serve in other countries may waive such immunity from jurisdiction as per Article 32 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations - 1961. Such waiver should always be also be expressed. That is provided in Article 32(2) of the same Convention. Officials of the United Nations. The law governing immunities and privileges accorded to officials of the UN is governed by the provisions of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, 1946. In terms of the applicable Articles of the Convention (in particular Article V, Section 18), officials of the United Nations are immune from legal processes in respect of words spoken or written and all acts performed by them in their official capacity. Accordingly, such UN officials enjoy immunity from being subject to investigations conducted by the local law enforcement agencies. However, if there are strong and serious grounds to believe that there had been an abuse of diplomatic immunities or privileges, there are measures open to a receiving State to deal with such situations. If prima facie material is available to reasonably believe that such abuse has taken place, a request could be made to the relevant UN organization in question to co-operate with an investigation in the interest of justice. It should be stressed that there is a duty on the part of persons enjoying such privileges and immunities to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving State and to ensure that such privileges and immunities are not abused for extraneous purposes or personal benefit, other than for purposes as are necessary for the independent exercise of their functions in connection with the organization. Such persons should also bear in mind the tense environment, as well as the compelling security factors prevailing in the country at present. Therefore, it should be noted that the current developments should be viewed in this overall context. Thank you, Hon. Speaker.

Hon. Speaker, I thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to raise a very important matter of Privilege which concerns not only me but the entire 225 Members in this House. Sir, you would remember the Determination of the Supreme Court on the Appropriation Bill, 2008 was tabled before this House on 6th November, 2007, just a day before the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill was taken up for Debate. I draw your attention to Clause 6 of the Appropriation Bill which states as follows, I quote:

"Any money allocated to Recurrent Expenditure or Capital Expenditure under the 'Development Activities' Programme appearing under the Head 'Department of National Budget' specified in the First

2531 2532

* . . Produced at end of speech.

[ ] Court. Hon. Speaker, I draw your attention to pages 44 to 53 of the Fiscal Management Report - 2008 dated 7th November 2007 issued by the Ministry of Finance and Planning which I table* to save time. I want it to be included in the Hansard. These pages disclose the shocking utilization of this secret fund of monies between 1st January 2007 and 15th October 2007, mainly to purchase luxury vehicles to Government institutions including the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. On page 44 of this Report it is clearly stated that the expenditure referred to in Clause 6 of the Appropriation Bill is for unforeseeable requirements. Therefore, this would come within the provisions of Article 151 of the Constitution which provides for unforeseen expenditure and mandates Supplementary Estimates to be presented without delay to Parliament after such expenditure is incurred. Therefore, the statement made by the Secretary to the Treasury, Dr. P.B. Jayasundara to mislead the Supreme Court that Clause 6 of the Appropriation Bill contains allocations for development activities to be voted in terms of Standing Order No. 131 after specific consideration being given by Parliament of the budgeted expenditure under this programme is utterly false. So, the Secretary to the Treasury, Dr. P.B. Jayasundara had knowingly and deliberately misled the Supreme Court. Hon. Speaker, if the expenditure is specified, as so stated, and would be approved by Parliament after specific consideration, then what is the reason to permit the Secretary to the Treasury, Dr. P.B. Jayasundara to transfer such funds to any other programme under any other Head for other purposes without the approval of Parliament and without even informing Parliament through a Supplementary Estimate as required by Article 151 of the Constitution? Hon. Speaker, contrary to such position, the Secretary to the Treasury, Dr. P.B. Jayasundara, as recorded in the Supreme Court Determination, in his submission had further knowingly and deliberately said an untruth to the Additional Solicitor-General, Mr. P.A. Ratnayake, PC. It states, I quote: The immediate responsibility of meeting unexpected expenditure under other Heads and programmes would finally rest on the Department

Schedule, may be transferred to any other Programme under any other Head in that Schedule, by Order of the Secretary to the Treasury or any other officer authorized by him. The money so by a supplementary estimate submitted by the appropriate Minister. Hon. Speaker, you will note that the Supreme Court in its determination in relation to this unconstitutional provision has stated as follows:

The Additional Solicitor-General submitted that there is no abdication of Parliamentary control of public finance, since money could be transferred by the Secretary to the Treasury in terms of Clause 6, only dependent on the amount voted by Parliament for 'Development Activities (Head 240 -Department of National Budget - Programme 2). He submitted that the amount would be voted in terms of Rule 131 of the Standing Orders after a specific consideration of the budget expenditure under the Programme. In doing so a Committee of the whole Parliament would in terms of the Standing Orders take cognizance and deliberate not only whether the amount appearing under the Programme of Development Activities should be approved but also take cognizance of the fact that the Secretary to the Treasury is authorized in terms of the principal Clause to transfer any sum under that Programme to meet expenditure under any other Head and Programme.

On this basis it was submitted that the vesting discretion by Parliament in the Secretary to the Treasury would only be after due and proper consideration and cannot amount to an abdication of Parliamentary control of public finance as contended by the Petitioners.

It was further submitted that in any event the amount so transferred by the Secretary to the Treasury would be to meet expenditure under any other Head and Programme already included in the Appropriation Bill.

Therefore, it is very clear that the Secretary to the Treasury, Dr. P.B. Jayasundara had knowingly and deliberately said an untruth to the Additional Solicitor-General, Mr. P.A. Ratnayake, PC, that a full disclosure is in fact made to Parliament, for Parliament at its Committee Stage discuss and approve the items of expenditure only in respect of specific purposes in terms of Articles 149 and 150. Hon. Speaker, it is very clear therefore, that the Supreme Court had been misled with falsehood to believe that the expenditure under the "Development Activities", Head 240 - Department of National Budget, is in fact for specific purposes and specified expenditure and would, therefore, be approved by Parliament at its Committee State giving specific consideration to such expenditure. This is an utter falsehood that had been uttered by the Secretary to the Treasury, Dr. P.B. Jayasundara to the Additional Solicitor-General, Mr. P.A. Ratnayake, PC, knowingly and deliberately to mislead the Supreme

2007 06 2533 2534

of National Budget. In this context it appears that from the year 2003 a budgetary method has been adopted in which a relatively large sum is allocated under the Head 'Department of National Budget with an attendant reduction under other Heads and at times a further cut proposed by the Minister to balance the Budget, on the premise that urgent and immediate excess expenditure under other Heads be met by a transfer from the Head, Department of National Budget. The submission of Addl. Solicitor General is that such action is necessary in view of the volatile state of the countrys financial position resulting from a variety of factors, including the escalating defence expenditure caused by the war, steeply rising oil prices, inflation and an unfavourable balance of payments situation resulting in the downward trend of the Rupee vis--vis other currencies. We have to accept the submissions of the Additional Solicitor General as to the context in which Parliament has passed into law clauses to the same effect consistently from the year 2003 onwards. The volatile situation may not provide the space and time for a supplementary estimate and the machinery of Government could otherwise come to a halt. A degree of flexibility may therefore be necessary as contended. We are also inclined to agree with the submissions of the Additional Solicitor-General that the establishment of a Contingencies Fund to meet urgent and unforeseen expenditure as envisaged by Article 151 is farfetched in the current fiscal context plainly due to a lack of resources. Hon. Speaker, in the context of what had been stated to the Supreme Court by the Additional Solicitor-General, Mr. P. A. Ratnayake, PC, on the falsehood uttered by the Secretary to the Treasury, Dr. P. B. Jayasundara, your attention is drawn to the provisions contained in Article 151 of the Constitution. Article 151(1) of the Constitution states, I quote: Notwithstanding any of the provisions of Article 149, Parliament may by law create a Contingencies Fund for the purpose of providing for urgent and unforeseen expenditure. Article 151(2) of the Constitution states, I quote: The Minister in charge of the subject of Finance, if satisfied -a) that there is need for any such expenditure, and b) that no provision for such expenditure exists, may, with the consent of the President, authorize provision to be made therefor by an advance from the Contingencies Fund. Article 151(3) of the Constitution states, I quote: As soon as possible after every such advance a supplementary estimatesshall be presented to Parliament for the purpose of replacing the amount so advanced. Therefore, the Constitution has specifically provided for urgent and unforeseen expenditure without stipulation of any limit or cap, whatsoever, and reporting thereof to be made to Parliament only after the expenditure had been incurred with the approval of both the Minister of Finance and the President. Therefore, the necessity of approving a Supplementary Estimate before urgent and unforeseen expenditure is met, because the machinery of the Government could otherwise come to a halt as was falsely stated by the Secretary to the Treasury, Dr. P. B. Jayasundera to Mr. P. A. Ratnayake, PC, does not in fact arise since such urgent and unforeseen payments are provided for in the Constitution and Supplementary

Estimates to be submitted only after the payments have been made with the approval of Parliament. The Sinhala version of the Constitution clearly stipulates, Hon. Speaker, you being a scholar in the Sinhala language would understand better, that such reporting of urgent and unforeseen expenditure to Parliament has to be made without delay, . Can we violate such a constitutional provision? Therefore, Hon. Speaker, a suspicion arises as to what prevents reporting of such urgent and unforeseen expenditure to Parliament without delay, . The question also arises as to why and how the Secretary to the Treasury, Dr. P. B. Jayasundara had knowingly and deliberately said an untruth to the Additional Solicitor-General, Mr. P. A. Ratnayake to mislead the Supreme Court that Supplementary Estimates have to receive prior approval of Parliament to meet urgent and unforeseen expenditure before such expenditure is met? Why did he utter such a blatant untruth? Hon. Speaker, is it not to hide such expenditure on bribing Members of Parliament to cross over and support the Government and bribing other officials with luxury vehicles and other incentives? Surely, Hon. Speaker, these cannot be urgent and unforeseen expenditure. If this is how control of public finance by Parliament is denied, then, why do we bring a Budget to approve recurrent and capital expenditure under all Heads of Ministries for the next year? Hon. Speaker, Article 151(2) of the Constitution contemplates a consultation between the Minister of Finance and the President for consent to be obtained from the President to make provision for such urgent and unforeseen expenditure. Therefore, the question arises as to whether the Constitution requires that the Minister of Finance and the President have to be two different persons. Has the Constitution not been violated in that regard? The only exception stipulated in the Constitution is that the President shall be the Minister of Defence as was determined by the Supreme Court sometime back. Hon. Speaker, you are constitutionally bound to ensure that the Business of Parliament is conducted according to the Constitution. That is your prime and solemn duty and the responsibility for which you have been elected and you have assumed office under oath to uphold and defend the Constitution. Please ensure that you do so. I know, Hon. Speaker, that you have the strength, the courage and the conviction to do so and I am bringing this today because after the Report of the Public Accounts Committee was tabled in Parliament, it seems that there is a clear division between the Finance Ministry and the rest of the institutions in the country.

, . In my speech, I would like to respond to some of the issues that were raised by the Hon. Members of the Opposition including the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa, the Hon. Nandana Gunathilake and also the Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne. It is very important for us to understand the current dimension of the countrys security needs and the international support towards addressing the Sri Lankan agenda. The speech I am making today is on what is most needed in the country and it is our responsibility to get that across to the international community in order to strengthen the local operational requirements in countering terrorism, which has affected Sri Lanka for 30 years. We must remember the causes that contributed to our having to confront terrorism at the current level. All its manifestations have not been created by the Government of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa. President Mahinda Rajapaksas administration came into being two years ago, to be exact. We have got to confront a situation that was brought about, as stated by the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa, with the introduction and creation of the CFA, to which no one from the UNP benches seems to be claiming responsibility today as understood by the statement made by the Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne. It was an Agreement that was structured, orchestrated, authored, created and delivered to the country without anyone knowing what was in it. There was no consultation of anybody, no approval, no Cabinet decision, no consultation with the Members of Parliament and no discussion in this House before the introduction of the CFA. Today the CFA has taken a different dimension affecting our international profile. Here is a situation where the LTTE is given parity with the sovereign State, as correctly stated by the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa, and that is the challenge we have to face internationally. So, today we are countering that well and I am glad that we have a transparent environment where we address issues directly with clarity and credibility. That is how we have fashioned our interfacing with the Ministry of Defence, Public Security, Law and Order. As Minister of Foreign Affairs, I must say it is important that my Ministry interfaces with the Ministry of Defence, Public Security, Law and Order. As much as the responsibility of safeguarding the sovereignty and the territorial integrity and looking after the national security requirements of the country lies with the Ministry of Defence, Public Security, Law and Order, it is the responsibility of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to see that the support of the international community gained through bilateral and multilateral fora is there and our

international relations are sound to strengthen our operations to establish security in the country. The LTTE has been able to expand their terrorist atrocities for it to take an international dimension. They did not stop at only killing leaders of Sri Lanka, but struck other countries killing leaders including the then Prime Minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi. That is the international dimension that terrorism has taken. So, we have to counter the dimension it has taken. When we are faced with such a situation, the LTTE was brought into parity with the State. CFA . LTTE , LTTE . It is against that development only today the Government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa is making every effort to get international co-operation. Our successes locally will have to be adequately supported. We would not be able to exercise the military operations that are needed in the endeavour to counter terrorism if we do not have the international backing. That is why I am very pleased to announce to the House today on the occasion we are discussing the Votes of the Ministry of Defence, Public Security, Law and Order for 2008 that international backing has come in an unprecedented manner in terms of our efforts to counter terrorism and take out the LTTE. I will cite some clear instances where we have enjoyed their support, not only in procurement of arms needed to maintain the sovereignty of our country, but also whilst countering terrorism. We have been able to take out LTTE ships in the mid seas, in the international waters without any issue being created by the countries concerned. We have been able to strike. How have we been able to destroy them if we did not have the international backing? What the United National Party perceives and would expect to happen is international isolation of Sri Lanka. But, it is not the case; it is the other way round - we are getting the international backing towards addressing this problem of considerable dimension. Mr. Chairman, we have been able to tackle the maritime issues well in securing the territorial waters of Sri Lanka. We have been able to strike the LTTE ships and boats carrying arms shipments. We have enjoyed the co-operation of India in countering, restricting, controlling and eliminating the sea routes that the LTTE hitherto was enjoying. We have got the backing of the entire Asia for the operations that have been undertaken both at sea and on land. About our procurements, I will cite one instance where we had to get twenty two countries to back us in getting down an arms delivery by air from a location in the United States. How did we succeed? Twenty two countries had to clear air passage for this aircraft and the Sri Lankan Government's standing with the international

[ ]

2007 06 2597 2598

community contributed immensely and clearly, enabling the supplies to come unimpeded and also without any difficulty or restrictions. That is the type of support we are currently enjoying. Today, the capacity buildup in the defence establishment - in the Air Force, the Navy and the Army - has to be recognized. They were starved at one time. We are all aware of the type of allocations that went into defence. Could they have even the shoes needed for the soldiers bought at one time? In fact, there were concerns expressed by several countries about the lack of attention paid to the armed forces of our country. Today, the soldier is being built up. , , , . . . We need intelligence officers to interact and also to be interlocutors in dealing with our defence and intelligence requirements. We have been able to establish a number of bilateral agreements with several countries in the world on sharing intelligence. They are co-operating bilaterally and multilaterally because they have understood the need for us to counter terrorism. A universal standing should be there for a country that is affected by terrorism. It is from that angle we are addressing today the international dimension terrorism has taken and making efforts to counter terrorism. I am pleased to announce to this House on this occasion the efforts taken by the military establishment in the country. Our defence agenda needed to counter terrorism targeting locations including the North has to be implemented with clear directions and that, we are now pursuing with the support of the other countries. We do not have a hidden agenda. That is something I am very pleased to announce to the House. We did not want to say about something that is not there in Sri Lanka and something that is not happening in Sri Lanka. We did say to the international community, to the world that we have terrorism, it originated from Prabhakaran and the LTTE and it is important that we block the avenues that bring support for terrorism from all angles. The international Tamil diaspora has mostly been the victims of this because their money is being collected, extortion is on and they have been subject to various types of intimidatory activities. Today, the world has opened its eyes to that cry and we find that a number of arrests have been made in the United States, Canada, France and in Australia, on which prosecutions are now taking place. Unless we block all these fund-generating avenues for procurement of arms, we would not have an end to terrorism surfacing in this fashion. I am pleased to announce that the interfacing that has been going on between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence, Public Security, Law and Order has

tremendously helped addressing these issues. Today we are in a position to speak to the world at large because we are kept correctly informed as to what is being done by the defence establishment. It is that connectivity that His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa has been able to build. Earlier it was a different game. No one knew as to what was happening in the other arm of the Government. Today everything is interconnected and interrelated and it is on that ground that the image building exercise is being carried out by the defence establishment. The image of a country and its profile must be maintained at a high level. This is a vital requirement and in that context countering various issues that the international community sometimes raises against us is being undertaken by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs assisted by the Ministry of Defence and the Attorney-Generals Department. When people go missing, we are in a position to answer correctly as to what the number is; what their names are; what the issues are and what the dates are. We know everything and that is why we are in a position today to communicate, to counter, and to address the solution in terms of what is required. Today, the strategic area of co-operation and the operational area of co-operation are more transparent. It is very unfortunate that when we have to take on the heavy challenge of security being established in the country, sometimes it has an effect in compromising the liberty of the people. Yes, there are restrictions that come but at the same time we have to prioritize our approach. Safeguarding the rights of our people and their lives comes first. Yesterday, there was a bomb blast at Kebithigollewa for the second time. The first took place last year. The Nugegoda bomb blast took place only a few days ago and terrorism will surface unless it is countered and eliminated. That is a lesson that one has to learn. There is no party division necessary in this exercise. What you need is unity in our efforts. It is Prabhakarans agenda that the United National Party is trying to address. If we are united and go in one direction, it is that direction that can bring about lasting solutions to these issues. The issue is - ( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Minister, please wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Mr. Chairman, please give me one more minute. I also would like to address the issues relating to several NGOs that have sometimes been raising their cry. Yes, we are looking at these matters. The Secretary to the Ministry of Defence has co-operated immensely in addressing the issues that have been raised sometimes. The clear example is the Eastern Province. No one thought that we could get the LTTE out of the Eastern

Province so soon and so well. Today, the development agenda has been started in the Eastern Province and that is due to the efforts of the defence establishment. They were the ones who went there first and now development must take place. First comes security and then development must take the scenario. That is what a country is all about because a country cannot stand on development without security and without security there cannot be stability. These are the basic principles in governance that one has to learn. Every month we have a debate on the extension of the Emergency in the House, which I think, my good Friend the Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne did not take much notice of. It is through that Debate that we discuss all these things. It is the transparency which is important for a country where there is democracy. Every shade of opinion comes through this House every month during the Debate on the Emergency Regulations. Emergency Regulations are needed in order to strengthen the military to counter terrorism. For the purpose of record I table* the rest of my speech and would like it to be included in Hansard. Mr. Chairman, I must compliment His Excellency the President, Minister of Defence, the Hon. Prime Minister, the Deputy Minister of Defence along with the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and all armed forces personnel together with their Service Commanders for the efforts they have made in bringing about stability and countering terrorism in all its manifestations. Thank you. : : Rest of the speech tabled: Since assuming office as the Foreign Minister, I have been of the firm view that a greater interface between the work of the Defence Ministry with that of the Foreign Ministry is necessary both at operational as well as strategic levels, which we have achieved. At the operational level, (a) we have almost doubled the number of defence attaches in our missions; (b) entered into a number of intelligence sharing agreements; (c) facilitating meeting of the defence requirements of Sri Lanka through friendly countries despite the high level of operation we are at present. A few would know that the recent procurement and transportation of ammunition for the Bushmaster required approvals from 22 countries and that was all arranged by a network of Sri Lankan missions abroad. (d) despite the constraints and the difficult policy decisions that this

Government had to take in facing up to this threat of terrorism, I have used every opportunity to emphasize to my foreign interlocutors that we would not compromise the sovereignty, territorial integrity, national security and public safety and as to why the military operations, until recently in the East, or now in the North, including the air attacks are necessary. At the strategic level, (a) not only has Sri Lanka made its presence for the first time at the ASEAN Regional Forum and the Shangri-La Dialogue Security Summit, but also I have been accompanied to these forums by the Secretary to Defence and the Chief of Defence Staff. This has enabled Sri Lanka to present its case squarely to the highest levels of defence establishments of key countries. (b) Sri Lankas endeavours has included a particular focus on initiatives of maritime security where we have sought and obtained a considerable support in stemming the tide of terrorism which threatens the unity and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. (c) from the time the superficial peace through the CFA enabled the LTTE to rebuild its image before the world, Foreign Ministry has proactively sought to refocus global attention on the continuing terrorist challenge faced by Sri Lanka and given its wide global network the challenge it poses to the international community at large. The International Conference on Countering Terrorism held in October in Colombo with participants from 23 countries once again brought to the forefront the brutality and the widespread nature of atrocities of LTTE no longer confined to Sri Lanka affecting the whole world; (d) for the first time we were able to document the atrocities committed by the LTTE abroad and the action taken by the international community against the group through a series of publications brought out by the Foreign Ministry. We have developed a network of persons across the world who are monitoring its every move. (e) we have also succeeded in lobbying to ensure that the international community move beyond merely proscribing the group but also take tangible action against its front organizations as was done in the last month with respect to the TRO by the US Government. We are appreciating all the assisance that Sri Lanka has been able to gain from the international community in our effort to counter terrorism; (f) Through diplomatic efforts we have also succeeded in terminating the LTTEs longstanding use of Intelsat-12 to broadcast the Tamil Television Network (TTN) which was operated from Paris. We have also met ahead the criticisms levelled against Sri Lanka by the LTTE, its front organizations and also by some International Non-Governmental Organizations (INGOs) in the realm of alleged human rights violations, displacement and humanitarian conditions in the operational areas. Since April 2007, the Ministry has taken the initiative and constituted an Inter-Ministerial Co-ordination Committee on Sri Lankas Image Abroad to monitor and expedite investigations into allegations relating to human rights violations. Chaired by the Secretary,Foreign Affairs, the Committee consists of representatives from the Presidential Secretariat, Ministries of Defence, Foreign Affairs, Disaster Management and Human Rights, Re-settlement and Disaster Relief Services, Justice and Law Reforms as well as representatives of SCOPP, army, navy, air force, police and the Attorney-Generals office. This mechanism has helped making it more transparent to the public and the international community Sri Lankas proactive stance in addressing such allegations while enhancing humanitarian access and space. Press releases issued by the Foreign Ministry have documented how mischievous

2007 06 2601 2602

allegations have been countered, the due legal process followed and modalities instituted to ensure that incidents of concern are dealt with so as to avoid recurrence.Conscious of the important role played by the Sri Lankan diaspora in influencing host country policy, an effort is being made to mobilize the diaspora community to serve Sri Lankas national interests. On Pakistan issue at CMAG, much has been said by the UNP as to how I as the Foreign Minister let down Pakistan by the manner we conducted ourselves at the CMAG. As recently as, I believe, on Tuesday, the UNP spokesperson Gayantha Karunatileka held a media briefing calling for action against me. The High Commissioner of Pakistan Shahzad A. Chaudhry who met me the same morning, brought to my attention that last Thursday,on the 29th November, at a meeting the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Wickremasinghe had inquired whether Pakistan was satisfied by the manner in which Sri Lanka conducted itself in the context of suspension of Pakistan from the Commonwealth. The High Commissioner said he had categorically told the Leader of the Opposition that Pakistan was absolutely satisfied. In fact, High Commissioner Chaudhry told me two things: firstly, Pakistan greatly appreciated that the Foreign Minister stood by Pakistan until the very end and secondly, the support for Pakistans cause canvassed by His Excellency and me at the CHOGM and the CMAG respectively will be remembered by Pakistan for a very long time as was the assistance rendered by Sri Lanka in 1971. So much for Hon. John Amaratungas charge at the Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the Pakistan High Commissioner was "very angry" and Hon. Gayantha Karunatilekas call for "action to be taken against me" [..1.35] ( ) (The Hon. Chandranehru Chandrakanth) , . . . . , . , . - - . , , . , , - -
