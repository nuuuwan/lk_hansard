    "text": "I move, That the Programme be reduced by Rs. 10. Hon. Chairman, the Sri Lanka foreign policy and foreign relations as of today is in a very critical condition, for that matter in dire straits. Of recent times, from the events that took place it is very clear that there is a complete blunder. Now, I would like to say that the present Government has systematically antagonized the international community. For that matter, it has antagonized the United States of America, the European Union, the Secretary General of the United Nations, India and of late, Pakistan. The Hon. Prime Minister made a statement. I do not agree with what he said. What happened was completely different. I will come to that later. Sir, in the past Sri Lanka was a respected country. The whole world looked up to Sri Lanka at different times. The leadership that some of the Sri Lankans gave in matters of important conferences and committees that took place both in the UN and outside UN, to refer by name, people of the calibre of Ambassador Shirley Amarasinghe and presently of Dr. Jayantha Dhanapala, Dr. Rohan Perera and above all, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, the late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar, had been exemplary. They maintained a high dignity of standard in Sri Lankas foreign issues. It is sad to say that in the recent past Sri Lanka could not sustain and maintain this honour and dignity. Now, Sir, it is important to state that those in charge of foreign policy today do not appear to have any understanding on the management of foreign relations and diplomatic practices. There was an article today also emphasizing on these matters and the most important thing is that the countrys foreign policy is not the decision of any single individual or the vision of any single individual, but it is based entirely on perception of our national interests. So it is a common interest that matters at a particular point of time and on different issues as to how they could be secured best. What the country is at large is what is most important and of interest. Sir, with regard to the matter of suspension of Pakistan from the Commonwealth, this is a very important issue for this country. That is what transpired quite lately. As a consequence of such an action, it should have been studied and a decision taken as to whether it was in our interest to be a party to take such a decision. If we were very good friends, or if Pakistan was a friend of ours, we should have opted to be out of that meeting saying that we cannot be a party to it. But we did not do it. Instead, the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs continuously participated in the deliberations. But none of those steps",

What happened was that, without proper assessment or understanding of what the relationship with Pakistan means to our national security, this decision was taken. It was a unanimous decision that the Foreign Ministers took in regard to the expulsion or suspension of Pakistan from the Commonwealth. So, there is no question of saying that the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs objected or that he was interested in safeguarding Pakistan. That is the condition. So, apparently what we see is that the Hon. Minister and the Secretary happily went along with the other Foreign Ministers in the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group to suspend the membership of Pakistan. Another thing was that if the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Secretary were very keen in protecting Pakistan, they should have tried to avoid this item from coming into the agenda of the Meeting of the Heads of State. But that was not done. That is what is called discreet diplomacy, which should have been applied. Today, for what has been done, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and His Excellency the President are in a difficult position and I do not know how they are going to explain it to the country. Sir, on the 12th of November, the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, as they call it, met at the Marlborough House in the UK. That was an extraordinary session to consider the situation in Pakistan. This meeting was chaired or presided over by the Foreign Minister of Malta. There were several other Foreign Ministers from the member countries and our Minister of Foreign Affairs too was present. They had a very long discussion of the situation in Pakistan. Our Minister of Foreign Affairs also participated in it. But nothing was said by him to the effect that Pakistan should be given a chance and so on. What transpired at that meeting was, the Action Group expressed its grave concern over the matters that were taking place in Pakistan: the abrogation of the Constitution, the dismissal of the Chief Justice, the promulgation of Emergency, a series of violations of fundamental principles of democracy. The Action Group had a very long discussion and came to the conclusion that, as the next meeting was on the 22nd of November, if, after reviewing the progress, Pakistan had failed to implement these necessary measures, it would suspend Pakistan from the Commonwealth. So, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who participated on the 12th of November, knew very well what was to come. Sir, it was long before the 12th of November that the whole world knew what was happening in Pakistan, the way they were violating the principles of democracy. So, I do not know how the Hon. Prime Minister could come to this House and say that the Minister of Foreign Affairs agreed or objected or voiced his concerns for Pakistan. There is nothing to say that in any of the Minutes. Then, Sir, the next meeting they agreed to hold in Kampala in Uganda on the 22nd of November. At that meeting, it was decided that if, still for all, Pakistan had",

Our Minister was also present on that occasion. I guess, the Secretary also would have been there and the Hon. Minister knew very well what was going to happen. There is no question of the Minister saying, \"I did not have instructions as to what I should do\", whether he should object to the suspension or move on with the suspension. If he says that he had no communication or gives such a flimsy excuse for what has taken place, it is a very serious and a sad situation, Sir. Then, on the 22nd, as I said earlier, they met in Kampala and found that the conditions that were laid down on the 12th of November had not been fulfilled and it was a unanimous decision to suspend Pakistan and also the suspension to be included in the agenda of the Meeting of the Heads of State which was to take place on the 23rd instant. On the 23rd, the Heads of State met and surprisingly our President objected to the suspension. Our Minister had been a party to the unanimous decision of the Foreign Ministers who met on the issue of Pakistan. There was no vote taken though the Hon. Prime Minister said that there was a vote. There was no necessity for a vote because all the Foreign Ministers unanimously agreed that Pakistan would have to be suspended. According to the Foreign Minister or the statement that appeared in the press, he had no communication as to what action should be taken. There was another comment made asking, did he not have even a cellular phone to find out what happened? ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)",

The President states at one stage that the Foreign Minister was told specifically to object to the suspension of Pakistan. I do not know how far that is correct. If he was told, why did the Foreign Minister not either get away from that meeting, leave that meeting or voice our objection and prevent the Action Group from arriving at the decision? So, Sir, this is a very serious situation. At one stage, the Hon. Minister says that he had no instructions. At another stage, he says there was a lack of communication. And in another statement, it is stated that the President very clearly informed the Hon. Foreign Minister not to allow the suspension. So, there is a serious doubt about the conduct of Sri Lanka in this question of Pakistan's suspension. I do not know whether the President and the Foreign Minister are playing games. This is a very serious situation. If, by any chance, after the President having told very clearly to the Foreign Minister that he should object to the suspension of the membership of Pakistan at the Foreign Ministers Meeting, he had not done so, that means he has defied the Presidents order. It is a very serious thing. In such circumstances, what would be the obvious conclusion? Nothing, but the President must sack the Foreign Minister. He has to either ask the Foreign Minister to tender his resignation or he has to take some drastic action. If not, at least, the Opposition will have to move in on this situation knowing the good relationship that we have had with Pakistan in the past several years, both in cultural and economic affairs and more particularly in matters relating to defence. Pakistan was one of our very good friends who came to our rescue in the most difficult times when the LTTE was trying to create problems in Sri Lanka. There were similar situations in Sri Lanka. I think previously on the Palestine issue, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera had to face a similar situation. This is nothing new. Today, Sir, to tell you the truth, if this Foreign Minister is removed, there are so many who are waiting to step into the shoes. A number of people who have gone from this side to that side are very anxiously waiting. There would not be a problem. The Hon. Minister is my good Friend, but I cannot help it. In view of what has taken place, I will have to drive this point home in order to indicate what is going to happen. ( ) (An Hon. Member) What about the Deputy Minister? ( ) (The Hon.

    "text": "At the correct time, he will be so. So, the Presidents belated objection was of no use and the country was put into a very embarrassing situation. Sir, in the light of these circumstances, I do not how we are going to face this situation. The Ambassador for Pakistan in Sri Lanka was very angry that the Foreign Minister who attended the Ministerial Action Group Meeting did not object, that he was silent and allowed the unanimous decision for the expulsion of Pakistan from the Commonwealth. Today, the situation is very bad. There are so many other matters that the Foreign Ministry has blundered. Take, for example, the question of career diplomats. They are all frustrated. Some of them say that it is better to scrap the Career Diplomats Service because there is no purpose as there are only 33 per cent career diplomats who have got postings while the rest of the postings that have been made are from outside. They say that they are all political stooges. So, there is a lot of frustration in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Many of the career diplomats who are holding ambassadorial posts or high commissioner posts have requested experienced and trained personnel to be sent into their Missions, but the people who are sent are raw hands without any experience and there is a serious problem in most of the embassies. Then, also take the question of the travel advisories. The UK, the USA and Japan have issued travel advisories to their citizens warning not to go to Sri Lanka. I do not know what effort has been made to correct this situation. Then also look at the treatment that some of the foreign dignitaries, especially those in the field of human rights, got when they came to Sri Lanka to assess its position. Particularly, when Sir John Holmes arrived here and went back, the Hon. Minister Jeyaraj Fernandopulle said that he is a terrorist. It is very unfortunate. Not only the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle but also the Hon. Prime Minister on one occasion accused him. So this is the type of treatment that we give to people who hold high office in the international field. As I said earlier, the good relations of Sri Lanka with the rest of the world is in jeopardy. It is unfortunate that at a time like this when we need the assistance of the foreign countries, we have been antagonizing them and the people of this country have to suffer ultimately.",

    "text": "Sir, I would also like to mention a few words about the awards received by Justice Christopher Weeramantry. He is the recipient of the UNESCO Prize for Peace Education in 2006 and The Right Livelihood Award in 2007. He is a great person. We have to appreciate that a Sri Lankan has risen to this position. Justice Weeramantry was a Judge of the International Court of Justice and later became its Vice President and is currently holding very high positions. There is another gentleman, Sir, whom I would like to mention and that is none other than Dr. Jayantha Dhanapala who has received the MacBride Prize for the services that he has rendered in the field of disarmament. These are very eminent people and particularly Dr. Dhanapala had a very good career. He was the Under Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs in the United Nations and at one stage, when I was the Foreign Minister, he was the UN Assistant Secretary-General and today his services are highly recognized by the international community. Sir, it is sad to hear what is taking place in the Foreign Ministry today. It may be that experienced career people are not there to advise the Minister. There are enough talented people in the Foreign Ministry. There are very capable people. Recently, Mr. Weerasinghe who was in Brussels, a well-experienced person in the field of trade and commerce, was recalled. I do not know why. He had another year or two left but suddenly he was recalled. So, these are the types of things that are happening and ultimately Sri Lanka has to suffer. It is our duty to tell the Hon. Minister not to flock the Foreign Ministry with political stooges. It may be that you have to accommodate a few people but it should not be the majority. During the time when I was the Foreign Minister, we had an understanding with the Foreign Service that 60 per cent of the overseas postings should be given to career diplomats and 40 per cent to outsiders and it worked very well. There was no reason for frustration or any other problem in the Ministry. But today it is completely the other way around. People are being deprived of their rightful positions, of their experience, of their knowledge and of their education. What happens is, ultimately the country has to suffer. So, we are very sorry for what is happening in the Foreign Ministry and that is why this blunder on Pakistan took place. I cannot understand the Minister saying that he was not aware of what was in the agenda. Surely, the agenda would have been discussed beforehand, before they attend the meeting. The Hon. Minister and the secretary should have known what was in the agenda. To say that he was taken by surprise or that he did not receive instructions or that he had no communication, I cannot understand. It is a shame. And this situation ultimately has developed into a state where the good relations between Pakistan and Sri Lanka have been affected. Thank you, Sir.",

John Amaratunga went through a full story of imagination, deception, untruth and dishonesty. At least having stepped into the Foreign Ministry for a short time, the Hon. John Amaratunga should have known how we decide at international fora. If we are at the SAARC, decisions are made by unanimity. If we are at the Commonwealth, decisions are made by consensus. The little English will give you greater clarity between the definitions and the interpretations of these two basic words. Deception cannot be practised all the time. My stand taken at the CMAG not only in London but also in New York in September in terms of the Commonwealth's position vis-a-vis that of Pakistan was that - though I did not want to labour saying what I did - compulsion is there now in the face of deception that is being practised and the Opposition having lacked anything else to raise a matter of this nature. Pakistans suspension from the Commonwealth was discussed first in New York in September on the sidelines of the UN Assembly and in that I held the fort for three hours where I said that Pakistan should be given time to revert to democracy. I said this is not the time for us to take decisions hard that would ultimately negate the process of democracy for the country and for its people. President Musharaff was taken into the Commonwealth in May 2004, still wearing the uniform. The mandate of the CMAG was to decide where the uniform should be: whether he should hold the dual role of President and that of the Army Commander. I said give him time because there is a process that they have unleashed within the country and an agenda that they are pursuing, an agenda where the Supreme Court had to decide after President Musharaff's election whether he is still to wear the uniform. I got time for Pakistan and I was ably assisted by my Foreign Ministry officials. And, then suddenly there was another meeting to discuss about the removal of the Chief Justice of Pakistan, and an emergency meeting was held on the suspension of the Constitution of Pakistan, where a state of emergency was declared under a Constitutional Order being announced by President Musharaff. On the 12th of November, in London, I held the fort for six hours",

On one side there is extremism, on the other side there is terrorism and on another side, there is feudalism and there is a very little room for democracy. It is our duty to see that Pakistan is fully engaged by the Commonwealth and suspension is not the option and that held ground. After six hours everyone agreed unanimously that we can extend the time period by ten days to meet again in Kampala and then again I raised this issue at which the United Kingdom fielded two Ministers, David Miliband, the Foreign Minister of the United Kingdom and Mark Malloch Brown, the Minister for Commonwealth Affairs, both sitting at the same session against eight members of the CMAG. I must state now, breaking the tradition of the Commonwealth, that my sole voice held the fort for six and a half hours. The meeting lasted for 12 hours. What is there for a meeting to last for 12 hours, till 12.00 oclock in the night if there was consensus at the beginning, if there was unanimity? What is this misinterpretation of the facts? It is deplorable that the Hon. John Amaratunga can lower himself to these depths in the Parliamentary annals of misrepresentation to the House. I remained silent. There is a limit to untruth and deception and I am sorry to note the depths to which the bankruptcy of the United National Party has been taken into, by the few Members who are there now. This is the plight of your party. Understand the situation in the correct context. Why should President Musharaff acknowledge my contribution to my President in Kampala on a telephone communication? Why should Inamul Haq, the Foreign Minister of Pakistan, keep acknowledging me on the telephone all the time? Why should the Pakistan Government issue this statement which states, I quote: Sri Lanka is a member of CMAG and its Foreign Minister, who represented his country at the CMAG meeting, urged the Commonwealth to send a delegation to Pakistan to assess the ground situation rather than taking the hasty decision of suspending Pakistans membership. Pakistan itself had proposed such a visit to CMAG member countries. This is the official statement coming from the Pakistan Government on this issue and thereafter Inamul Haq, the Hon. Foreign Minister of the caretaker government of Pakistan called me twice to appreciate my contribution. Not that I want to claim these things but now that deception and dishonesty is becoming the order of the day, let me just correct the lines for the purpose of record. In terms of our focus, I will begin with the Commonwealth. In the international arena, at one time you, the Opposition, thought that we are doomed because there was no direction. When the peace talks ended in October, 2006 the international opinion, the international direction was turning much against Sri Lanka and the Opposition hoped that it will be the order for 2007.

The East will become a hot spot and disastrous consequences will follow. How is the international community going to relate to Sri Lanka? How is India going to be supportive of Sri Lanka? How about the money coming to Sri Lanka from Japan? How is the United States going to look at this engagement without political proposals on the table when we have surrendered the sovereignty of our people through various mechanisms that were practised in the guise of the Ceasefire Agreement? Here is a different arena, a new era being opened up for the aspirations of the people and our bilateral relations to get reflected in the world fora. How will we focus these things against this background? That was their calculation and it was in fact a right calculation looking from the limited resources that the Opposition commands in understanding the passions of to wait, a Government would like to take forward . In that backdrop I became the Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka on 28th January, 2007. How did we strive the world order? The agenda that I advocated should be the agenda of Sri Lanka rather than trying to react, trying to respond to the world agendas that various countries might like Sri Lanka to follow. That is where unanimity has to come. How could we adjust that? Every time we get up in the morning, we have to see what the Western agenda is, what the Eastern agenda is, what the Indian agenda is, what the Japanese agenda is and what the US agenda is. No, we must articulate an agenda of Sri Lanka and that is the agenda that I structured, which has brought the current developments in our pursuit for international recognition and acceptance. It is through these processes that we have the best of relations today with India and the co-operation that India is extending to Sri Lankas polity in terms of a greater prosperity to our people. We are looking at the strongest bilateral relations. It is in that context that we are looking forward for an early visit by the Indian Prime Minister in the year 2008, after 22 years. The recognition and reciprocation of how Sri Lanka has fashioned itself to suit the needs of its people, the priorities of our country safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity and how we are trying to take this forward, are the things we are going to look at. It was difficult but we have had over ten meetings at the highest level between the Prime Minister of India and our President; between the Foreign Minister of India and myself and between the Defence Minister of India and myself and these bilateral meetings have led us to strengthen our relationships. We had ten meetings within eight months. I attended five of those along with our President when he met the Prime Minister of India. Where do you find this type of close relationship? That is a matter of envy to the Opposition, I understand. That is something we cannot help but these developments are bringing us results.",

    "text": "Now, let us take Pakistan. Today, we have been the voice of Pakistan; when Pakistan is at its worst peril within its polity of destabilized conditions. We want an early return of stability to Pakistan and its security has to be strengthened and here it is a comparison between security and liberty. We are standing by Pakistan because Pakistan is our friend and we maintain the closest of relations with Pakistan. That is how we are looking at these matters. We do not have anything to hide when we are close to India and Pakistan. This is the correct pursuit of Sri Lankas agenda on non-alignment. That is what we believe in. We consciously believe in that and at the Commonwealth meeing, we killed two birds with one stone, one for India and one for Pakistan. We were the proponents of Mr. Kamlesh Sharma, the Indian candidate for the post of Secretary-General of the Commonwealth. Our President had the foresight to do that. In April 2007, at the SAARC Summit we said that there must be unanimity among the SAARC to nominate the candidate. We were firm that India should hold the post of Secretary-General of the Commonwealth from 2008 onwards when Mr. McKinnons term ends and the Indian Government accepted our proposal and fielded a candidate. At the the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, CHOGM, our President said, It is the turn for Asia and let us have the Indian candidate. The Indian candidate had it; it was by a contest but the announcement was made as if it was by consensus. That is how things are announced. We do not reveal inside discussions in the international fora and those are the greatest traditions that we are bound to maintain when we are sitting in these forums. Then, came the Indian stand in support of us. On our pursuits for greater ties between India and Sri Lanka, we will soon be entering into the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, CEPA, with India. Negotiations have entered its final phase and that is the co-operation we are enjoying now. The FTA which was introduced by the PA administration is now yielding the highest results in terms of our bilateral trade with India and these are getting fashioned through the efforts of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These things will not happen just by chance. We have to plan, structure, approach and that is how we are pursuing the direction of the foreign policy of Sri Lanka. When you take Pakistan, we held the fort for Pakistan and that is why I said that we killed two birds with one stone at the Commonwealth. Sri Lanka has been recognized for the third successive term and has been called to serve in the CMAG because of our contribution. What the Secretary-General said was announced. The leaders want Sri Lanka to be engaged in the CMAG because we are the best to pull Pakistan back into the Commonwealth with improvements within the system. That is the confidence they have placed in us. I did not want to say that - we have earned that respect - but because the Opposition is bringing in various other connotations I thought it is best to put the record straight.",

    "text": "In the context of our international relations today, we have won a seat at the UNESCO for another term. How did we get 130 votes? The entire West voted for our candidate at the election. It is not easy to get a seat because there is a contest and others also want to get seats. When you get a seat, the worst qualification is to continue in that seat because at the end of the term it has to be offered to another. But we thought, no, we must have another term. I had to draw the campaign. We fielded the best team from the foreign office and we canvassed. We started canvassing in September for the October election. But we did well with 130 countries supporting us for our second term election to the UNESCO. That is the acceptance we have got. Then where was the ARF? Was the ARF membership there for Sri Lanka earlier? This year I went to Manila for the Asian Regional Forum, ARF. What did I articulate there? Countering terrorism. One of the main agendas of the Foreign Ministry today is \"Countering Terrorism\" and getting the support from the world community. Has it not been done now? For the first time during my period, the Tamil Rehabilitation Organization, TRO, has become a banned organization in the United States of America and I have made it happen in Sri Lanka too. I gave an assurance when I announced this on the last day, that the USA has banned the TRO after a major investigation. I went to the State Department of the United States twice over this year. I went to the Treasury Department and to the office of counter terrorism. We canvassed. We made our case known and a lot of things are being done which I do not want to tell because this is not the place for us to share the intelligence work that we do with certain countries. During my visits to Washington, I briefed senior officials of the US administration on the current situation in Sri Lanka and expressed appreciation of continued US support to Sri Lanka. I also sought greater vigilance and greater action by the United States law enforcement authorities in countering front organizations of the LTTE and combating illegal fund raising by the LTTE in the USA. I emphasized the need for those front organizations to be proscribed, adding that it would send a strong message to the Tamil diaspora not to support the terrorists. In this context, I have already welcomed the US Department of the Treasury announcement on 15th November, 2007 that it was freezing the US-held assets of the Tamil Rehabilitation Organization, TRO and believe it will encourage other countries to follow. In the field of defence co-operation recently, the US Ambassador to Sri Lanka handed over a radar-based maritime surveillance system and several rigid Hull Inflatable Boats, RHIBs to the Sri Lankan Navy on 8th November at the Naval Dockyard in Trincomalee. The equipment was provided under Section 1206 of the US National Defence Authorization Act, which provides",

Both the surveillance system and the inflatable boats are designed to enhance maritime security by increasing the Sri Lankan Navys ability to detect off-shore smuggling activity. When the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa asked whether we are going to ban the TRO in Sri Lanka, I got up and said, Yes, we are going to do that thorough a Cabinet Paper, and immediately within a week I delivered the results. The TRO is banned today. That may be to the dislike of a lot of people. That is why I now see that there is sudden pressure developing in the Opposition ranks targeting the Foreign Minister, that he must be removed. I must state that the monies that have been flowing from the TRO has been going to certain individuals. It is a known fact - Rupees one million a month. Why do you not find some major issue to hang on to? Do not go by deception and falsehood. Hang on to some good string without putting a bigger rope. [Interruption.] Why do you want to suggest a rope, Hon. Amunugama, to the Opposition because they might put it round their necks soon? Get on to the correct facts. I knew that the TRO ban is going to activate the UNP to this level. It did not take one week after the TRO ban, suddenly the Foreign Minister is getting targeted, not by the TNA, but by the UNP. It is a sudden development. I am used to these things. This is nothing new. But we stand by what is right for the country. As regards China, we are in the best of relations, over one billion US Dollars being committed by China for the development effort of Sri Lanka. The President went to China in March and see the results. Norachcholai Coal Power Plant was stalled earlier. A lot of projects in Sri Lanka were not getting materialized. Vested interests have come into bilateral agreements. Unless it gets into the hands of one, two and three, nothing was moving and we had a transparent arrangement through the intervention of our foreign office personnel. Our Ambassador in Beijing made things happen and to make things happen it took only six months. I went to see the Hambantota development work along with the President. Today you can see a port coming up in Hambantota. It took only six months. Also, the work of the Norachcholai Coal Power Plant has been started. This again shows our bilateral relations with China. There is also a National Performing Arts Centre which was to be built at the former Nomads Grounds. It was held up. Its work will be started in December through an outright grant given by China. Apart from that, several bridges are coming up, as well as the construction of an International Buddhist Centre which I proposed when I was the Minister of Enterprise Development and Investment Promotion. I was able to talk about it with the President of China at the banquet. I gave the brochure that we prepared for it, saying Please look at this for international Buddhist zone development assistance. That is how we do things. That shows our economic ties, the greatest of all.",

We did not fear to enter into the ACSA with the United States because our relationship is at the highest level. Today the American Ambassador is going to Trincomalee to distribute boats to facilitate our radar systems in the marine sector in order to combat terrorism openly because we have told the United States what we stand for. They have to respect us and they have demonstrated that respect by engaging themselves fully in our efforts to counter terrorism and now assistance has come from the United States. There was a lot of noise being made in the House that our relationship is now getting affected because there are no political proposals on the table. Political proposals will come at the right time. But, we have shown the world that we stand on principles. Our sovereignty and territorial integrity come first, and above all, the people of all communities matters best for us, Sri Lanka. That is our wealth. That is the wealth we are trying to protect, enhance and develop with foreign relations, international dimensions and that is our focus. Did you put out books in countering terrorism openly citing and taking this message right across the world? It is the foreign office of Sri Lanka today that has measured the needs and reacted to the situations and has a proactive relationship with the world at large. Today, the UN has enhanced their relationships with Sri Lanka. Some said that we have called names. Yes. Sometimes names get called. In this House how many names get called across this divide. This is a democracy. This is where sometimes we just have the banter in terms of our language. But, does it mean that our country's position gets altered merely because of some words ? No. That is the difference and today we have got the United Nations Development Programme assistance for Sri Lanka for the next five years enhanced by US Dollars 250 million. And that is how we are looking at it because we want that assistance to go for the humanitarian and infrastructure sectors development of the Eastern Province. And who thought that I could seek assistance for the Eastern Province development from the international world today? Everyone thought that Trincomalee to Thoppigala would be a war zone in Sri Lanka.",

The institutions that come under my Ministry are, the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka - BOI, the National Gem and Jewellery Authority, the Gem and Jewellery Research and Training Institute, the Sri Lanka Inventors Commission and the National Enterprise Development Authority. But obviously, the focus of todays Discussion will be on the nature and quantum of Foreign Direct Investment to this country. The earlier Speaker, my good Friend, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella referred to the fact that there is diminishing foreign investment in Sri Lanka. But the facts are quite the reverse.",

    "text": "I will read to you from the Central Bank Report which gives the exact details of Foreign Direct Investment to Sri Lanka from the year 2000 to 2007. In the year 2000 we had US Dollars 175 million as FDI; in 2001, US Dollars 82 million; in 2002 , US Dollars 172 million; in 2003, US Dollars 199 million; in 2004, US Dollars 223 million; in 2005, US Dollars 272 million; in 2006, US Dollars 480 million and I want to assure you that by the end of this year, Sri Lanka would have received US Dollars 630 million. According to our statistics, up to September we have received US Dollars 437 million and by the year-end, we would have had US Dollars 630 million which is the highest-ever Foreign Direct Investment to Sri Lanka. - [Interruption.] That is just a cheap shot. I am reading to you from the Central Bank Report. But this is not the only indicator, my good Friend. If you look at donor assistance - the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella mentioned about the Tokyo Aid Conference and the gathering of Ministers. I want to remind my good Friend that subsequently we had a meeting in Kandy. You remember the donor conference in Kandy when I was the Minister of Finance. And, early this year we had the donor conference in Galle with His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, our President as the Minister of Finance. We had the same number of donors there. In fact, we had a much larger commitment of funds. So, the argument that has been going throughout this morning that the international community has lost confidence in Sri Lanka and is reducing its contributions to Sri Lanka is totally false. I want to assure you that there has been a steady growth in Foreign Direct Investment to Sri Lanka. We have been able to streamline many of the operations of the BOI. I will give you in the course of my speech, the other details. You asked as to how many projects have been undertaken under the \"Mahinda Chintana\". I want to tell you that from January to September 2007 we have undertaken 119 projects in all parts of the country. I table* this document, Projects Commenced Implementation (January - September, 2007). It gives the name of the project, the quantum and the location of the enterprise.",

So, like that we have some more and I am going to give you the information - [Interruption.] Yes, Sir. It is in small print. But I will give it to you and it will also be tabled. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Why do you not table the number of acquisitions you have wound up? ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I will table all that. Do not worry. We have a special programme to revitalize the factories that have closed down. I will give you a very good example which is the Thulhiriya Project. The Thulhiriya Complex which belonged to a Korean company was closed down - the Kabool Lace (Pvt.) Limited and the Kabool Lanka (Pvt.)Limited. We have now completely rehabilitated it under the MAS Group and today it has won a global award as the most eco-friendly garment enterprise. It is a garment hub with a billion dollar investment. We have found new investors such as DOGIFA, even from a country like Spain and I am very happy to say that His Excellency the President was there one month ago and I think my good Friend and Minister, the Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne - this is in his electorate - will give you the details if you want. So, the general perception that you are trying to present to the country is simply not true. Now I want to tell you that in the BOI, we are now trying to focus on the potential of this country which can easily generate US Dollars one billion a year. You pointed out that we are borrowing money. But, Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, the answer to that is, since we cannot generate adequate wealth in our own country for investment, we have to find Foreign Direct Investment. Your earlier criticism was that we were borrowing US Dollars 500 million as commercial credit but we have been able to get US Dollars 630 million as direct investment. There is no debt component. The money comes in without going through the Treasury and being reallocated. It is coming direct to the project and can get off the ground very fast. So, today if you look at Vietnam and China, their fantastic growth is driven by foreign investment. China is not developing on internal savings. Vietnam is not developing on internal savings. It is one hundred per cent driven by foreign investment. In fact I have given directions to the BOI to study the Vietnam concessions to adopt our investment programme one hundred per cent to the Vietnam and Chinese programmes that are available in the country and I want to come to this House with legislation, if necessary, to bring our Foreign Direct",

The tea industry is now getting very close to that. About US Dollars 900 million can easily become a one billion dollar industry. Hon. Kiriella, you yourself was a Minister in charge of Plantation Industries and you will agree that very soon we should be able to go into a one billion dollar industry. Then, we have the tourism industry which is now earning US Dollars 500 million. So, if you can double that, another dollar for dollar, we can easily go into the one billion dollar category. We have tremendous opportunities in the gem and jewellery industry. For the first time, this Government under this Budget, has given every possible concession to the gem and jewellery industry and we can make it into a one billion dollar industry. I am glad to say that Mr. Chanaka Ellawala, who is a leading gem businessman in Sri Lanka has held a press conference and given a pledge on behalf of the gem manufacturers and exporters that on the basis of these concessions that have been given in this Budget by His Excellency the President, he will very soon be able to convert the gem and jewellery industry into a one billion dollar operation. I think the Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne will confirm this. We have cleared unnecessary taxes. We have cleared all the immigration and customs formalities so that once again Sri Lanka can become the hub. Unfortunately due to wrong policies, it has moved to Thailand. Today, Thailand is a hundred billion dollar industry when it comes to gems and jewellery. We are getting only US Dollars 500 million of which US Dollars 300 million comes from the diamond trade. Gems count for only US Dollars 100 million and jewellery for US Dollars 100 million. So we have to revamp that completely. These are natural assets of this country and I am sure that in the coming year we will have to do much more. Then, Sir, the garment industry is already a three billion dollar industry. We must have agro-industries. We are very much below our targets in the thrust area of agro-industries. This is one area we can develop. I am glad to say that irrespective of any political consideration we are now expanding agro-industries in Nuwara Eliya. We have just given land to grow flowers for Mr. Jayakodys cut-flower industry. Today, Sri Lanka is the number three cut- flower supplier to Japan. So, it is a tremendous success story. Today we are beginning to export fruits and vegetables. I want to tell my good Friend, the Hon. Bimal Ratnayake, that every single pineapple produced in Sri Lanka can be exported. They are telling us, We do not have enough supplies. We can bring money. The Hon. Member knows that very well. We have to expand our agricultural area. I must pay a tribute to the Hon. Anura Dissanayake. When he was the",

We have set apart a special zone in Mirigama. A hundred Chinese investors are coming to Sri Lanka. Each will bring a minimum investment of US Dollars 250,000. Soon after this Budget is over, on the 19th or the 20th, I will be going to Shanghai to start that procedure. So, by next year when we have the Budget Debate, we will have a hundred strong Chinese investment zone near your electorate.",

Then only these IT companies will come in, make the initial investment and if they are successful, they will go on to their own campuses. Then there is this BPO operation. We have wonderful people in Sri Lanka. They speak very well. They know the language whereas in India, now people say that when you call from California, you get an Indian accent. Sri Lankan BPO people do not have that accent. In India they do not stay in that job for more than three or four months. Our people are more loyal. If you see the HSBC in the evenings because of the time lag, it is like a new city. People are coming and getting employed there. We have tremendous opportunities. We are starting a very big Techno-Park, IT Park in Henegama in Katunayake. You would have read in the newspapers that we have already called for quotations. Then, with regard to the development of the Eastern Province, I am glad the Hon. Amaratunga also referred to it. We have to develop the Eastern Province. If we develop the Eastern Province, our present 7 per cent growth can go up to 9 per cent. This is the least developed area. Those poor people, we have to help them in every possible way. They are the people who have suffered from this conflict. Hon. Ratnayake and I went to Ampara. Those innocent people have nothing to do with it. They are not involved in politics though we are shouting here. They only want to look after their paddy fields, do their fisheries and send their children to the university. We have very big plans today. We want to have a marine university in the Ampara District; we want to develop the Batticaloa University; we have discussed with India to have a huge coal power plant in Trincomalee. The Mahindra Group wants 1000 acres build a new city like the one which has been built in Chennai. When you go to Chennai, Hon. Shivajilingam, see the Mahindra World City there. We are going to do the same thing in Trincomalee. I am glad that the Hon. Navin Dissanayake was able to negotiate that. We are thinking big. So give us a chance; join us. We must work together. Developing the East is not a political matter.",

The importance of these Ministries cannot be discussed in a couple of minutes, but let me do my very best in this given opportunity. First, I will speak on the subject of foreign affairs. I must say that there seems to have been some problem. There is no smoke without fire and on that score I would say that the foreign policy of a country should be shaped for the material benefit of the people of the country, for the citizens of Sri Lanka and for the mutual benefit of the two countries that we have been discussing today. You can be either non-aligned or fully aligned. But what we are doing is, we are aligning ourselves with people who cannot do anything and alienating ourselves from people who can do everything. That has been the policy. I do not think that this is the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagamas creation. But it is the creation of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the Sandhana Government. You are carrying a bad brief. That is the problem. Now there have been",

    "text": "many miscommunications. Let me get on to the problem that arose in Kampala. Hon. Minister, I must say, being a party stalwart you mentioned that the UNP is doing this. Hon. Minister, but you are a creature of the UNP. So, you should not forget that. You are a UNPer and you castigate the UNP for saying that. You are aware that it was during the United National Party regime that Sri Lanka gained Independence. So, we have a feeling that no other party has, and we want to cherish, foster, nurture and take it forward. So, the foreign policy has to be guided from a point of view of a win-win basis. We must realize the geographical location we are in. We must realize the regional and global politics we have to play. And, we have to use it to the best of our ability manoeuvring through the system in order to ensure that it is on a win-win basis. But the slimy approach that was shown is not what is expected of the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry. We have got to show maturity. Trying to say that you killed two birds with one stone, Hon. Minister, I do not think comes from you. This is something which is pushed on to you at a time the country is going through a very hard time. Through this, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has displayed a lack of maturity, I must say. It has hit against the iceberg which the country is now reeling. Now why do I say that? I must say the foreign policy of a country should be magnanimity to all with enmity to none. That should be the cardinal principle of a foreign policy. I must say that there is no necessity to align ourselves. But we need friends in the region and that is why India is playing a pivotal role. Pakistan is another regional friend. There are many others of which I will give examples in the next couple of minutes. Hon. Minister, the foreign policy that seems to be projected and practised is like courting one person, flirting with another and trying to relax with some other person. That is the type of approach that the Government of Sri Lanka is confronted with today. Now are we going to correct this? I do not think I will have to repeat myself once again because you are an able man. We have exported you from this side to that side owing to that fact but you are unable to deliver it due to an incompetent Government. But, that does not mean that the country has to sink. We will correct that situation. Now, what is the situation? The general atmosphere today in Sri Lanka is that we are alienating all our friends. Now look at India. You tell India, You are too passive, you do nothing. Then, you go to USA and say, You are annoying us. Then you go to Japan and say, You are too passive. Then you call EU and say, You are teasing us. You call Germany and say, You are interfering with us. You look at the United Kingdom and say, What are you doing? You are trying to create friction within them. So with that approach how can Sri Lanka move forward? On one side you look at China and say, China is helping us and on the other side you say, China is giving arms to the LTTE. Then, with regard to Pakistan who has been a friend of ours, you voted them out at the Commonwealth. That is the policy",

    "text": "that we have been pursuing up to now. I repeatedly say that the sagacity of the Leader of our Party and Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, has always shown that there is a necessity for our priorities and relationships. He always considered India as a friend of ours and I guess the respect he gets is as good as what a Head of State gets, or may be even better. That is why today India is an important friend of ours. Likewise in the region, we have Pakistan who has been a friend from day dot. Look at the regional politics which I just mentioned. Then you have the Asian politics. Japan and China are there. Then you have got the world politics. Are we a country that can be arrogant to everybody and muster a clear path without any of them? No, Hon. Minister. You can catch more bees with honey than with vinegar. You have to ensure that you do not change policies. The world has 222 countries. The approach we are making a suicidal one. We are trying to be machos in the world. Where angels fear to tread, we are trying to exhibit saying \"Let us take the world on\". Look at how we have antagonized India. India is a country that has come forward and said that they need to ensure there is a strong political solution to the problem we have in our country. Time and again India has been consulted and it was promised in December 2006 at the All Party Conference - under the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana and the Hon. Dew Gunasekara who were actively participating in it, but today seem to have retired - that they would give an All Party Resolution. That was postponed for February with much disgust for the Indians. Then, you promised that you will do it before May. Then, you promised that you will do it before August but yet you have not done it. Are you telling me that India is happy with this type of thing? They are our friends in need. They are telling us, Please come out with a solution. You might pass the Budget and tell us that if we take a stand, there will be problems of political survival. These type of games where you run with the hare and hunt with the hounds, must stop. You must have the ability, the character, to muster support and go forward. There were many instances like when the late Mr. J.R. Jayewardene was confronted with a the situation during the World War I and II, where he had to say certain things but he stood by his conviction. Likewise, when there were problems and when he had to take certain stands with regional friends, he took the decision and stood by it. When UK who supported us went to Falkland Islands, we had to take a stand. When there were certain situations in the Middle Eastern countries, there were stands that were taken. You cannot be passive. You cannot be there unable to take a decision. Governments are there. Governments do not mean personal decisions, Hon. Minister. After you authoritatively mentioned it in Parliament, I thought it was my bounden duty to respond with authority. That is why I browsed through the Resolution",

    "text": "of the Commonwealth Heads of State and got information. I guess there is a distortion between what is being told and what is in reality. Pakistan newspapers state, \"Our friends have betrayed us\". That is the headline news in the last three days referring to Sri Lanka. Why do they say that? In the Statement of the Commonwealth Heads of State they say that there were ten countries. You do not deny that. You were one of them. That is the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group called the CMAG. At that particular meeting, Hon. Minister, you may not have got a clear message from the Government. Then the Government is held responsible. You do not need to put the cap on if the Government has screwed up. I must say it with all reasonability. If that is the case, what the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella was trying to say is that if the CMAG did not have the unanimity, this Resolution would never have come about because you have to have unanimity. Lack of unanimity is the only problem. So, Hon. Minister, there may be compelling decisions that you had to take. In that case the Government is held responsible. If not, then you have to give an answer which is suitable and acceptable. We have had a friend at a time of need and now the Pakistan newspapers state that their friend has let them down because Sri Lanka was the last person to respond to this Resolution.",

At that Cabinet Meeting the Secretary to the Cabinet was told to please ensure that it is recorded that they are going to support Pakistan. What did you say? You said, I am sorry, I cannot say that. The Hon. Deputy Minister was there. Tell me that you did not say so. If there were clear signs, Hon. Minister, why did you not say so? If there was a genuine mess up, why did you not say so? We are all fallible. We make mistakes and correct them but do not sacrifice the country for the absolute incompetence of fifty-two Cabinet Ministers or the one hundred and seven Ministers. At the end of the day Sri Lanka must go forward. The Sandhana Government can crash tomorrow but Sri Lanka cannot be allowed to crash. That is what I have to state.",

    "text": "( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you. I am just being told by the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella who was a former Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs that Heads of State cannot reverse their decisions. In the assembly you cannot say, I am sorry. I got up late. I could not communicate and so on. All those are bunkum. When a decision is made at the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, that is what is most important. Hon. Minister, you and I have been to conferences of the World Trade Organization. We are with the world. We know that. You do not need to tell us that. So, in regard to this matter, they had an agenda. Heads of State are only a rubber stamp. Now what has His Excellency the President done there? He cannot rectify that. Even if Mr.Gordon Brown was there he could not have rectified that because it is a done deal. I think now we have to correct it. Otherwise we have to live with it. How are we going to do that? You may suddenly go to Pakistan to meet Nawaz Sharif or Benazir Bhutto. But that will not help Sri Lanka because we did not stand by them in the hour of need. Do not compare India with Pakistan. India has been a tower of strength to us. They have done millions of favours to us without making a noise. Therefore, at every given moment we have been basically very close to the foreign countries. Sometimes they do feel very disappointed, dejected or absolutely angered. India has been there for us from day dot at every given moment. But when you try to compare what India has done with the rest of the world, they will naturally get antagonized. So, do not try to do that. If the Government by error has done it, you have to correct it yourselves. Ensure that you get into the correct mode. We have amateurs running the system. There had been major problems earlier. I do not want to put everything on to you. Hon. Minister, but now you are the Captain in the Ministry. You cannot relegate it to somebody else. If there is a problem in the Ministry; if it is a credit it has to come to you and if it is a debit, which is more prevalent today, you have to take it on. That is what you are there for.",

You are telling the rest of the world to ban the LTTE. But here you are catching the TRO with which you have no relationship. It is not a subsidiary company. I will ensure that I send you the Hansard unless it has already been erased for some reason or the other. I will accept what you say. Is this a part of the deal like the RADA? Is this a part of a deal like Do not vote? Is this the continuation where the supply source is being told to get out of the Commonwealth? Is this part of the deal that is going on? We need to ask these questions because here various things are done to people who are doing innocuous businesses to character assassinate them. Now, you said that there are TRO monies coming into certain places. Ask the Central Bank what they have done. You are quite right because we remember looking into this at the COPE. They do not do anything there. They blame a businessman who is trying to promote investment and then they blame me saying, monies are coming from Tigers. Why the hell have the Tigers got to send me money if they did not want to elect the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe as the President of this country? Is there any logical sense, Hon. Foreign Minister? This is the problem. Your Government does not have logical sense. So, the lack of sense is making the country go in a wrong direction. The Foreign Ministry has to play a lead role regarding the Ceasefire Agreement. Either you implement it or abrogate it. That is what you have to do. There is no point in your taking either of the positions. That is what the foreign ministries and foreign governments are telling you. Please ensure that you take a stand. Now, you said that you were to do certain things. With regard to the TRO ban, well, we give the credit to you. If that is the case, who got the LTTE banned? It was possible because of the Ceasefire Agreement. The EU, the Canadians and the Australians, all banned because of that. You do not give credit to the United National Party for doing so. You always say that there seems to be somewhat an alliance between the Tigers and the UNPers, not knowing that the United National Party has done the most internationally against the LTTE. We need the world community to solve this problem. You can be a macho, you can shove with your head, but at the end of the day, you need the international community to isolate them. \"Terrorism has no place to hide\". That has been one of the biggest mottoes. If that is the case, we must have the international community to ensure that they do not hide anywhere. That is the most important thing. Look at what Senator Lee Harvey said? Are you able to meet him and solve the problem? Arms were not coming from America. The Hon. Ranil",

Then, look at the EU, the labour GSP problem. Is the Foreign Ministry saying, \"No\"? We struggled and got the labour GSP plus benefit to the country. You know what has happened? They gave it on three conditions: the peace process, the human rights and the working rights benefits that were there. All those three are broken. They are in jeopardy. Today, the exports are going to EU because of the fact that we got the labour GSP plus. Are you saying, \"No\" ? You have got to protect these. If not you will have a major problem. Once again, look at BIMSTEC. What is happening there? Look at the WTO? Have you taken a stand on that? Look at India, the CEPA that is there. Look at the free trade agreements that we started.

Now, on the existing basis, why the international community is looking at Sri Lanka with circumspection is because we have not taken a stand on anything. We do not have an APRC proposal. That is being put into hibernation. We do not have a policy to say we are aligned or non-aligned. We sacrifice the best of friends at the worst of times and then, we flirt with the worst of people at the worst of time. That is what is being displayed in this country. That basically has led us into a death trap and the Foreign Ministry has to ensure that we resurrect ourselves. Hon. Minister, on a lighter note there are certain decisions you have got to take on granting visas to tourists which I have mentioned before. We must get the tourists who are coming in, subject to certain conditions of course. The embassies must be advised not to waste time in the issue of visas. Some tourists who come into this country thinking that they need not get visas to enter Sri Lanka, when on arrival face visa problems, they avoid Sri Lanka and go to Singapore and Hong Kong as these countries do not need visas. Please ensure that we correct this particular situation. Then, the other matter is the arrangement made by embassies to counter LTTE propaganda. Embassies must be able to counter LTTE propaganda promptly. We find that countering is far too slow. That has been one of the problems. The United National Party has been always there to ensure that we eradicate terrorism. We have never taken a stand against that. That is why, we basically say, \"Ensure that we act together\". That does not seem to be happening. I know for a fact, certain embassies of ours do not even have money to entertain VIPs when they come. This is a fact because they have told me this with all sincerity. That is the problem. There is no point in taking the Minister out for dinner when he visits that country. There are people whom you have got to lobby. Lobbying needs to be done. Today, the world has changed to such an extent that you have got to catch the correct person at the right time. I think, we have about 35 to 40 Missions. Reduce it to 20 if required, if you do not have money. That is the problem. We have got to allocate money where it is required. There is no point blaming the Foreign Ministry officials. They have got some very professional people, I must say. Over the years they have developed. But, their full potential is not being used or harnessed owing to the fact that we have not realized what our actual direction is. The Government does not know in which direction to turn. They put signals to the left and turn to the right. So, how can we expect the officials to follow when the Minister himself does not know what to do. You may be a Minister today, tomorrow you may not. Now, look at this newspaper caption - GL to do what Bogollagama could not do. What the hell did you do? Or can GL do what you could do?

    "text": "pressure on your position. Now do not think that the TRO is a problem. The TRO is no problem. That is the convenient excuse you are giving. When there is a problem, confront it. That is what leadership is. As regards foreign jobs, there are a lot of people working overseas. I remember I met you in a flight when you were coming back from Kuwait. There are problems that remain unresolved. If you take insurance, what is the service you give them with the monies that are collected ? The Kuwait returnees are still awaiting for the Rs. 150,000 that they need to get. Exchange gains are there. You are trying to pay them at the last revenue rate that we have got, when you have encashed them at a higher rate. Each of those families can get another Rs. 150,000. Investigate into the officers who try to play merry hell out of those funds. Please ensure that that is done. That is their money, not money that belongs to the Government of Sri Lanka. They have made sacrifices during the war in Kuwait. Then, look at the Government of Sri Lanka going on bended knees to the HSBC to take a loan at 8.25 per cent interest when the NRFC guys who are bringing into the country almost US Dollars two billion being paid only 3.75 per cent on NRFC. What is the policy of this Government? You are running after the foreigners and paying them high interests. Why are you not giving that interest to your own Sri Lankans who are bringing revenue to this country? Mature people are investing outside. The people who basically bring money to encash are the only ones who bring money into this country. Ensure that we encourage them to bring this money. Pay them 2 or 3 per cent more. All this is owing to the fault of the economic policy of this Government. Then, Hon. Minister of Enterprise Development and Investment Promotion, I have to rush through this quickly owing to lack of time. Look at the Vision of your Ministry you are basically promulgating. It states, I quote: VISION To make Sri Lanka the most preferred destination for investment in South Asia. Now, you know that one of the biggest investors in this country, Mr. Raj Rajaratnam of Galleon, brings money into this country. You are accusing him for money laundering. Is this the preferred destination for investment that you are talking about? Every Johnny knows that he owns John Keells, NDB and Nations Trust. The day before yesterday he bought the Ceylon Leather Corporation and then for political reasons you are castigating him. The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama knows as to what a lot of investments I sponsored and brought for Sri Lanka on your behalf, during the tenure of your office and you also helped. Likewise, the Hon. Amunugama also knows. So, is this the preferred destination that you want investors to come in?",

An innocent person who is unable to go for a car buys a bike. You charge him 25 per cent higher by this particular Budget. You give the company that brings Rexton diesel vehicles at 400 per cent duty, an investment facility whereby the 400 per cent duty is reduced to 15 per cent duty for a diesel engine. For the 300 units that have come in, the country has lost Rs. 1900 million. Is this the BOI policy? Is this what you mean by sustainable development ? I am only giving you a classical example with Customs entries in my hand. I salute that investor who basically took the BOI for a ride. That is his business. He is a businessman. He is basically there to do business. On one hand, a guy who is basically surviving, unable to walk, goes by bike and he is charged 25 per cent more by this Budget. On the other hand, a person who can well afford to go by plane to another country buys a Rexton vehicle paying 400 per cent duty. That company is given the facility of bringing diesel engines instead of diesel cars at 15 per cent duty, a reduction of 385 per cent. The country has lost Rs. 1900 million. Is this the logical sense of BOI ? -[Interruption.] That is why I said that I take my hat off to that investor who did it. He has taken the BOI for a ride. I mean, the BOI has not seen through. You have an assembled vehicle that comes at 400 per cent. You have no value addition - [Interruption.]",

Dear Sir, Bringing the body of late Sritharan Jeevajothy to Sri Lanka I wish to bring to your sympathetic notice that my daughter Sritharan Jeevajothy who was sent to Damam for employment there by Ashraf Agency, Colombo (telephone number 077 7325459) had died there. I had information of the demise by an unknown person (telephone number 00966565708791) three days ago. She left the Island in October, 2005. The deceased received communications from us under address M. A. Kareem, C/o R. A. Rajah, Post Box No. 6408, Damam31442, K. S. A. I am unaware of the place she was working. Her cousin who works in Saudi has imparted an information confirming the demise and that the body is lying at the Susmitha Hospital, Damam on 03.10.2007. The telephone number of the informant, Mr. Ruban is 0096641739634. I shall be grateful if you will please cause the body to be sent to me as early as possible. Yours faithfully, Mrs. Thavanayagam Chandradevi (mother of jeevajothy) .",

Pakistan 2.CMAG recalled the CHOGM Communique of November 2005, in particular the statement by Heads of Government that the holding by the same person of the offices of Head of State and Chief of Army Staff is incompatible with the basic principles of democracy and the spirit of the Harare Commonwealth principles .. until the two offices are separated, the process of democratisation in Pakistan will not be irre-versible. (They) urged Pakistan to resolve this issue as early as possi-ble, and not beyond the end of the current Presidential term in 2007 at the latest. 3. CMAG also recalled its statement of 12 November 2007, follow-ing its extraordinary meeting on Pakistan in which it had urged the Government of Pakistan to fulfil its obligations in accordance with Com-monwealth principles through the implementation of the following measures: * immediate repeal of the emergency provisions and full restoration of the Constitution and of the independence of the judiciary. This should also include full restoration of fundamental rights and the rule of law that have been curbed under the Proclamation of Emergency;",

    "text": "* President Musharraf to step down as Chief of Army Staff as promised; * Immediate release of political party leaders and activists, human rights activists, lawyers and journalists detained under the Procla-mation of Emergency; * Immediate removal of all curbs on private media broadcasts and restrictions on the press; * move rapidly towards the creation of conditions for the holding of free and fair elections in accordance with the Constitution. CMAG agreed that at its next meeting on 22 Novermber, if after review of progress, Pakistan has failed to implement these necessary measures, it will suspend Pakistan from the Councils of the Common-wealth. 4. The Group expressed disappointment that while there had been some progress, these conditions remained substantially unfulfilled - the State of Emergency had not been lifted, the Constitution and independ-ence of the judiciary had not been restored, and fundamental rights and rule of law remain curtailed. 5. Although there have been indications that President Musharraf may remove his uniform in the coming days, the Group noted that de-spite repeated promises made to remove his uniform, President Mushar-raf continues to hold the offices of both Head of State and Chief of Army Staff, even after the expiry of the Presidential term on 15 Novem-ber 2007. CMAG acknowledged President Musharrafs intention to remove his uniform and looked forward to him doing so as soon as pos-sible. 6. CMAG welcomed the release of detainees in recent days but, at the same time, expressed concern at the journalists, lawyers and human rights activists who continued to be in detention and at the recent further arrest of many journalists who were protesting against continuing Gov-ernment curbs on private media broadcasts. 7. CMAG noted the announcement by the Election Commission of Pakistan that parliamentary elections will be held on 8 January 2008. While it welcomed this important step it nevertheless concluded that Pakistan would need to move rapidly towards the creation of conditions for the holding of free and fair elections. 8. The Group took note of the letter received by the Secretary - General from the Caretaker Prime Minister of Pakistan, and seriously considered the points raised in it. CMAG warmly welcomed the commit-ment to continued engagement with the Commonwealth expressed in that letter. It also noted Pakistans own decision not to attend the Kam-pala CHOGM. It appreciated the invitation for a CMAG delegation to visit Pakistan. 9. CMAG agreed that, notwithstanding some progress by the Paki-stan government since its last meeting, the situation in Pakistan contin-ued to represent a serious violation of the Commonwealths fundamental political values. CMAG regretted that the Government of Pakistan had failed to implement the necessary measures set out in the CMAG State-ment of 12 November 2007. Accordingly, consistent with that decision, CMAG suspended Pakistan forthwith from the Councils of the Com-monwealth, pending the restoration of democracy and the rule of law in that country. (1) 10. The Group recognized the mutual interest of the Commonwealth and Pakistan in remaining engaged in this critical period. CMAG there-fore requested the Secretary - General to remain engaged and to deploy his good offices as appropriate and in consultation with the Chairperson of CMAG. It also affirmed its strong commitment to remain engaged with Pakistan, as a valued member of the Commonwealth, to work to assist the return to democracy in that country. 11. CMAG renewed its call to the Government of Pakistan to imple-ment the necessary measures listed in its Statement of 12 November as soon as possible. It agreed to review progress following the conduct of scheduled parliamentary elections in January 2008, including possibly through a visit of a CMAG Ministerial delegation to Pakistan.",

Kones and Mr. K. Pathipan in the B Report (192/06) of the Jaffna Magistrates Court, before which the case is pending; furthermore, the Jaffna police received no report of the killing of Mr. Pathipan on 16 August 2006 and threats to the life of Ms. Kones; The May 2006 attack was reportedly the fifth attack on Mr. Kajendrens office; on 26 April 2006, the SLA not only set his office on fire but also beat four students who were there and badly injured one of Mr. Kajendrens assistanta, Mr. Prathipan as it happened, who was admitted to hospital; moreover, the SLA told the students that they would not allow Mr. Kajendren to come back to Jaffna alive; the police have reportedly taken no action; according to the authorities, the Jaffna Police have received no complaints about the burning, by the SRLA, of Mr. Kajendrens office on 26 April 2006 and threats to his life by the SRLA; During the attack of 13 May 2006, property reportedly worth six and a half million rupees was destroyed, as were official records and documents; the high toll of destroyed property is due to the fact that the ISATE has closed its office in the face of the threats made against it and transferred all valuable property to Mr. Kaiendrens office. Hoping that his status as a member police are unable to give an exact estimate of the loss, but doubt the figure given by Mr. Kajendren; (e) Dr. Jayawardena : Dr. Jayawardena has long been subjected to death threats, more recently by the so-called Karuna group; in early December 2006, a Singhalese language website portrayed Dr. Jayawardena as a traitor to the Sinhala community who would soon be killed; more recently, the State-owned ITN television refused to broadcast Dr. Jayawardenas response to accusations by the Minister of Agriculture broadcast by ITN in which he had been depicted as a sympathizer of the LTTE; the authorities have provided Dr. Jayawardena with additional security but turned down his request for a back-up vehicles, stating that he faced no particular security threat; however, there are intelligence reports that he does face a particular security threat and which recommended that he be provided with adequate security, and yet additional security personnel cannot accompany Dr. Jayawardena when he travels; the matter was raised as a privilege issue in Parliament, and Dr. Jayawardena has lodged an application in the Court of Appeal under Article 140 of the Constitution, requesting it to direct the police authorities to provide him with the requested back-up vehicle and radio equipment; in July 2006, he filed a second application seeking redress against a government order and subsequent court action to have him evicted from his official residence, Considering that, according to the sources, many of the TNA parliamentarians concemed rergularly leave Sri Lanka for fear of their security, only returning for parliamentary sessions, and that some of them cannot use their parliamentary offices in their constituencies for security reasons, Bearing in mind that Sri Lanka is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and is therefore bound to respect the right to life and to security guaranteed in Articles 6 and 9, respectively, 1. Is alarmed at the death threats and attacks perpetrated against these members of parliament, most of whom belong to the TNA or are perceived or portrayed as being sympathetic to the Tamil community; 2.

Wishes (I) to receive cartification as to the kind of intelligence report required for Dr. Jayawardena to receive the security he has requested, given that both the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and the Directorate of Internal Intelligence (DII) concluded that he was under threat and should be provided with appropriate security, and (ii) to ascertain whether any action or decision has been taken by the Privileges Committee to which Dr. Jayawardenas security situation was referred over on year ago; 8. Hopes , that given the urgency of the matters under consideration, the Appeal Court will rule shortly on Dr. Jayawardenas applications under Article 140 of the Constitution, since without such a ruling this redress may become inoperative; 9. Requests the Secretary General to inform the authorities and the source of information accordingly; 10. Requests the Committee to continue examining this case and report to it at its next session, to be held on the occasion of the 117th Assembly (October 2007.) [.. 3.21] ( )",

Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs for the efforts they have made to save the life of the poor hapless girl, Rizana, hailing from Mutur in the Trincomalee District. I do hope their efforts would ultimately bear fruit. Also I am duty bound, Sir, to place on record my sincere thanks to the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs for having intervened in the matter concerning four Tamil youths hailing from the Batticaloa District who have been sentenced to death in Qatar recently. When I raised this matter with the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, I should state, Sir, he readily agreed to intervene and did, he intervene and I do believe, in this matter too, ultimately the lives of these youths, who were, in fact, denied a free and fair trial on a charge of murder that was committed or alleged to have been committed in the course of a sudden fight, would be saved.",

If you are unable to take a stand, just keep quiet but what are we doing when there is an act of terrorism or an act of violence in one particular country and people are killed? Messages are rushed expressing condolences and solidarity in the fight against terrorism as if Sri Lanka has taken upon itself the task of dealing with terrorism in each and every corner of the world. It is a laughing matter but at the same time, shamelessly the Government of Sri Lanka is trying to please Pakistan bending over backwards. If this is the foreign policy of this Government, one can only sympathize with this Government. This policy is fundamentally flawed; it is inherently flawed. As I have just stated, it is based purely on domestic concerns. Of course, domestic concern is also a factor to be taken into consideration in formulating a foreign policy. I am not ruling it out but it cannot be the sole criteria. But here we find that we have formulated a policy, if at all, I could use the word, \"formulation\", thanks to the experts in the Foreign Ministry, many of whom I believe, would be listening to my speech, a policy that is ill-conceived in that, it is based solely on who is aiding us, who is assisting us, who is giving us loans and who is donating us military hardware, weaponry in fighting a civil war, in fighting our own people, if I could put it. We are unable to solve this problem because the political class of this country, Mr. Chairman, is power hungry, is selfish, is self-oriented, is opportunistic and is not worried about the people who are being killed, whether they be Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims or of any other origin. We are here in an air-conditioned Chamber. But in the North and East who are dying? They are Tamils, Sinhalese and Muslims, ordinary boys, and even girls. We forget that. We are not mindful of that. We formulate policies and go all over the world.",

    "text": "Now we find, Sir, that Sri Lanka is bending over backwards to please Pakistan. Why all this? Just for military aid; just for military hardware including the multi-barrel rocket launchers that were said to have been responsible for stopping the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in October, 2000 at the very gates of the Jaffna Town in their military campaign to take it over and so on and so forth. So, I find, Sir, that our foreign policy, I am very sorry to state, instead of being based on an international perspective, I am very sorry to state, I repeat, is based on domestic constraints, domestic compulsions and domestic issues. Was it so in the early 1950s? No. Though it was a pro-Western foreign policy, there was a clear policy right from 1947 to 1956. Then, with the Hon. Solomon West Ridgeway Dias Bandaranaike assuming power after the so-called 1956 Revolution, we had a tilt, though it was said to be non-aligned, towards the Soviet Bloc. That had been the state of affairs till 1977 except for the days of the National Government from 25th March, 1965 to May 1970, for a period of five years. Thereafter, we all know what happened. With Junius Richard Jayewardene coming to power, ultimately realizing his ambition, there was again a tilt towards the West. And, with the national question assuming military dimensions and the military conflict engulfing the whole country since 1983, it became a policy based on domestic compulsions and it continues to be so. It is a very sad state of affairs. Of course, the world has become a global village. Though the world has become a global village, we find this little Island of Sri Lanka basing its domestic policy and holding briefs for this dictator and that dictator or for that matter that regime and this regime for the simple reason that the Government concerned has been helping this Government in facing the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Is it the way to formulate a foreign policy? I am not blaming the Hon. Minister. He is only a representative of the Government. He is doing his best. I can understand him. He is doing his best. But I find fault with the foreign policy of this Government. For that matter, when there has been a rebellion in Myanmar where Buddhist monks had been at the very head of it leading marches and getting arrested, tortured and ill-treated by the military regime there - because there also we find a military regime - was there a whimper of protest here? Was there a protest launched? Again, I am not blaming the Hon. Minister. What did the Government do? The Government has been going all over the world with a begging bowl asking for military aid, asking for financial aid to fight the ongoing civil war and in the process it has no alternative than to hold a brief for dictators like General Musharraf. It is a very sad state of affairs. As if the Government of Pakistan is a noble one and as if General Musharraf is a saint, we find voices emanating even from this side as if a great sin has been committed and that needs to be rectified. And in the process, I am rather afraid, the Government of Sri Lanka is on a slippery surface, on a slippery terrain in that it is rubbing India on the wrong side. I repeat, it is rubbing",

I remember him not as a very young person but as a mild, middle-aged person who came to my fathers house in 1994 to support him at the Presidential Election. Of course, at that time he was very much against the LTTE but now I see that he has changed his views. Of course, we also have a dictator in Sri Lanka. In the North of Sri Lanka, we have a dictator who also suppresses the rights of the Tamil people. He also shoots the Tamil people who go against him. Just like General Musharraf was termed an alleged dictator, perhaps the Hon. Sri Kantha should talk a few words about the dictator in the North because, without talking about the dictators here, how can we talk about the dictators in Pakistan? -[Interruption.] Please, you had the opportunity. Let me speak.",

When you go to sleep tonight, you can think about the dictator in the North before you talk about the dictator in Pakistan. Mr. Chairman, let me speak a few words about the Board of Investment and also the Ministry of Enterprise Development and Investment Promotion that come under the purview of the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, the Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne and myself. Very valid points were raised today. We welcome all the constructive criticisms that the Opposition has levelled against us which would hopefully lead to more meaningful steps being taken so that we can rectify our own mistakes. , , 265 . 240 . , . 25 . , INGO campaign , . I would like to particularly mention here that investment flow from China and India is what we should be particularly concerned about. If you look at the investment flow from the Western European countries, it has not been to our satisfaction. Actually, I would say that Sri Lanka should be able to attract investments mainly from India, China, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and also Singapore. These are the areas that we should be concentrating because I think, the West has already taken a strategic decision to invest in other countries, particularly China and India. So, Sri Lanka should be able to attract a large investment flow from India and China and this is where the Board of Investment has to strategically place itself and look at these two countries as the bulk and foundation of our investments would be coming from them. , 265. . , . 20 265 . . campaign - - . .",

    "text": "We heard many speakers from the Opposition talking on various subjects. Fortunately, for us I must thank them, that they have not been able to pinpoint any shortcomings in the working of my Ministry or my officials. I thank very specially the United National Party for this. Of course, I am not going to respond to the various other things that were mentioned but a very pertinent point was raised by a Member of the JVP, the Hon. Bimal Ratnayake, and I think it is my duty to respond to him. This was regarding the intake and the holding of examinations for the Foreign Service. It is a fact that Foreign Service examinations were not held for two years, and not for four years as he mentioned. But, I must tell you that it was first gazetted in 2004. The Public Service Commission has turned down the advertisement and said that it has to be re-advertised due to a technical defect. In 2005, the exam was held but up to 2007, people were not taken in. It is only after the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama took over at the end of January that he expedited it and within two months there was a fresh intake into the Foreign Service. During the two years in question , the Minister of Foreign Affairs was none other than a very close friend and now their partner in crime, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera. There was also an allegation about appointments from outside the Foreign Service. I have with me the figures that have been given. From the time the Hon. Minister took office, we have appointed 29 foreign service officers and 12 outsiders. Generally, there has been a ratio of 60 : 40, but here it is lopsided, the other way about and it is 29 : 12. We have nominated 11 Heads of Missions from the Sri Lanka Foreign Service and 6 outsiders. During the time of the United National Party even the clerks, drivers and peons were sent from either the then Foreign Minister's Electorate or all the people were from Akurana. These are things we have not forgotten. These are on record and they were all Members of the UNP. I must bring to your notice that this time we have not appointed a single local recruit on home-recruited contract basis, or a driver or peon who is from outside the Foreign Ministry. That is something that we have maintained up to now so that we are able to give an opportunity to the people who are working with us within our Ministry to go to these positions on home-recruited contract basis. One other matter I would like to reply is with regard to the allegation that the Pakistani newspapers have stated, Sri Lanka, their friends have let them down. We have checked with our Mission in Islamabad and Karachchi and I can categorically state there is no such mention in their newspapers today. Hon. Chairman, I think I have just half a minute. There are many matters I could not speak about but I would be failing in my duty if I do not thank my Ministry officials headed by its Secretary, Dr. Palitha Kohona and all the officials here who are in the box and the public",
