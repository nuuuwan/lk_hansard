( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Venerable Sir, I thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak a few words on the Ministry of Industrial Development and the Ministry of Rural Industries and Self Employment Promotion.

I think my previous Colleague spoke on the rural industries. So I thought I will speak a little on the industrial sector. After all, it is a very important sector in this country but I do not know what emphasis is placed on that. I like to remind you of a saying that was used in Bill Clintons campaign, Economy, you stupid economy. That is the most important aspect at this particular moment. I have been repeatedly saying in this august Assembly that if we lose the economic war we have lost all wars. I think, this is only lip service without absolute attention being paid. We all know that the Gross Domestic Product of this country has almost 20 to 21 per cent on the industrial sector. Hon. Minister, you have a very important task in your hands. I do not know whether the emphasis is divided into many ministries but at the end of the day, industrial activities is what makes or breaks a country. I just like to refer to the last statistical output where a big noise was made by mentioning that exports increased by 19.2 per cent in September without showing the relevant imports that have also gone up by 25 per cent. So, effectively, the balance of payment has a deficit of 6 per cent. Now this is something which has been going on from the year dot. This has not been corrected. This is the first thing the country must address. We are living well beyond our means. In order to avoid these problems we talk of increasing the local production. Hon. Minister Welgama, your Government has been talking of this rubbish from 1972. Where have you taken this country? At every given moment you blame the open economy as if the entire panacea for ills is to have a closed economy. Why are you not bringing it ? Instead of trying to say that there is an importance in the domestic industry, ensure that we look at it practically, go away from the political rhetoric and get into the real situation. , . 1972 . , , . . Now the most important aspect when you talk of industry is the industrial inputs. Cost of borrowing, cost of capital, the infrastructure that goes along, the macroeconomic picture, the inflation and then thereafter the Government's attitude towards industry. Now, is there a genuine attempt being made to develop these industries? Inflation is running at 21 to 22 per cent. There are some pundits at the Central Bank who talk the hind legs off a donkey. That is the problem you are faced with. We are not the only country that is exporting. As a result, we have got to face competition. When you face competition, we have got to put ourselves on an even playing-field. I am sure my good Friend, the Hon. G. L. Peiris must be having a tough time when he goes overseas trying to sell the country because we are not being put on an even playing-field. When we have cost of borrowing at 21 to 22 per cent, when we have inflation at 21 to 22 per cent and when we have archaic regulations, how are we able to

2007 22 417 418

compete with other countries that have changed in modern times? So I guess the most important thing Hon. Minister, is to ensure that you have easier credit. Now, there was a laudable project started by you in the last Budget, namely the Lankaputhra Bank, but this is only lip service. We were examining the loans that have been given by Lankaputhra. It is highly subject to -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, all I am trying to say, Hon. Minister, is this. I know that there is an intention and an interest, but you have got to ensure that there is a very clear focus on this. You must ensure that the ingredients are there to get the industry moving. For that, you have to see that inflation is controlled. There is no point in talking of domestic industry if you cannot control inflation. Remember, during our time we managed to bring it down to 6 to 7 per cent while we had a fiscal problem. We had to take a very tough stand. Likewise, the lending rates of banks are at 18 to 20 per cent. It is humanly impossible for anybody

to do business. Especially if you take India, its rate of inflation is at 5 to 6 per cent. You are talking of Japan, where the rate of inflation is at 0.5 to 1 per cent. In Malaysia, it is at 3 to 4 per cent. Hon. Minister, this is the first task as the Minister of Industrial Development you must do. Now look at the textile industry. That is why I just - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Kumara Welgama) Under the Gamata Karmantha programme, the lending rate is 13 per cent.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Okay.

( ) (The Hon. Kumara Welgama) That is only for the 300 projects under the Gamata Karmantha programme.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I read the "Review of Activities - 2007" of your Ministry in the morning. You have received 118 applications. But nothing has been done. This was started in 2006, Hon. Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Kumara Welgama) This has been given to the BOI and the Ministry of Industrial Development. So, altogether we have now approved about 88 projects. I think the BOI has also done a great job there.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Okay. Let us stop applauding and get the job done. Today the problem we have, Hon. Minister, is this. , " " . ? . , , , . . . ? . . . . [ ]

Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you very much for giving me an opportunity to speak a few words on two very important industries of our country. Firstly, Hon. Minister, I must say that the two industries that are in your hands should be exploited to the maximum. If you take the geographical location of Sri Lanka, we have not taken due cognizance of that fact and we seem to be missing the bus at every given moment. You would see that there is a boom in the aviation sector in Asia and the shipping sector is becoming robust with the Indian subcontinent turning to be a production hub. But, we do not seem to be taking once again the benefit of the strategic location. But, there are two ways of doing this. Either the Hon. Minister should have his hands on it or he should rely on the officials. I am informed that the Hon. Minister who relies on the officials is at least giving an opportunity for the professionals to do what they think is necessary. Let me start by referring to the aviation sector. In The Island" newspaper of 8th October, 2007 there is a text of a speech made by the Hon. Minister at the Opening Plenary of the 36th Session of the Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization under the heading "Aviation - the way forward". There, he states that the objectives set before him are attainable and he goes on to state about the necessity for having an alternate runway. Now, all that knowledge is history. The unfortunate situation is that we do not take this to the advantage of Sri Lanka.

2007 22 473 474

Mr. Presiding Member, now if you look at the aviation sector, we have only one international airport. Look at the number of airlines that are not coming in. Cathay Pacific, Etihad Airways, KLM, Martinair, Korean Air, China Airlines et cetera are not coming into our country. That shows that there is an underutilization of the potential in this region. If we are next to India with almost a billion people there, if Hong Kong is a success story owing to China, why has Sri Lanka not been able to take advantage? Lack of foresight, lack of interest and lack of knowledgeable direction are the key points. I say it is useless just pinpointing on the present Minister. A golden opportunity has been lost out perennially for decades and unfortunately nobody has been making an initiative to take advantage of this strategic location. Look at Dubai which is having two airports and building the third one which is to be opened in 2012. Look at Singapore which has three terminals and opening another one. Look at Bangalore which seized the advantage when we, the Sri Lankans, were keeping our eyes on it and opportunities have been lost out on that basis. Therefore, I earnestly call upon the Hon. Minister to ensure that you have a team of officials who are competent enough to look into this and take advantage of that. If you look at our Airport, it is like a cemetery now. Owing to the situation in the country, tourists are not able to come. Then, owing to the privatization of AirLanka, you have a situation where the ground handling is exorbitant that many of the casual or scheduled callers are saying, "There is no point in coming to Sri Lanka because the turnaround cost is very high" -[Interruption.] Listen to what I am saying rather than jumping like a jack-in-the-box. [Interruption.] You had better listen. Come and sit here and listen - [Interruption.] I guess you go through the VIP lounge. We go through the normal channel. That is why you do not know the difference between the two. So, if you look at our Airport which has to be robust; you do not have passengers at the Airport, so what else do you expect? Even the analogists do not understand because that does not seem to be within their knowledge. Cargo handling is an area which can be exploited. Unfortunately owing to the handling cost, we are losing our opportunity once again. Now, this is a sector, Hon. Minister, on which I can speak for hours and it is a sector which I really love to give my maximum assistance, if possible. Hon. Minister, now let me come on to a very vital subject, the SriLankan Airlines. You have got another 130 days to make a decision which is a fait accompli to you. The 10-year contract is coming to an end. What has the Ministry done in order to safeguard the future of this airline? I came across a newspaper article which states SriLankan Airlines aims to be Asias top carrier. These are nonsensical hallucinations. You basically have only 130 days for the contract to lapse. Thereafter, where will this airline end up? Now by chance, if it is going to be re-looked at, have you called for tenders? Have you

looked at the opportunities to see who will be able to take this forward? If not, what is the next option? If you are not going to call for tenders and give it out, why have you not made provisions in this Budget to take the airline back again? One hundred and thirty days is a very short time to plan the future of an international airline. Today its staff is jittery thinking as to what their future is going to be. You must know that this is not a task like running a couple of trishaws or private buses. This is an international airline - [Interruption.] So, on that basis - [ ] . . [ ] . . . [Interruption.] - These people are fooling around. Ten years ago when I was speaking about it in this House they ridiculed me. But today everything what I have said has come to pass. Where is the money that we made from this airline? Where is the destination of this particular airline? Today it is an aimless orphan. SriLankan Airlines is being used like a puppy dog; they are made to do the bull work but where is the profitability going? ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) . ? ? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , title , airline airline . [ ] . . ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) . , . ? . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . -[ ] ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) . . . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . what is the revenue that we have earned from the SriLankan Airlines? Ten years ago, when I got up and said that this is the most inimical airline privatization,

475 476

[ ]

they said that this was not a privatization and that this was a gift to SriLankan Airlines, and they laughed. Today, the same people are accepting it saying, Yes that is the case. We said, Do not privatize the ground handling. They did not accept it and today you are trying to take it back again. We said, Do not take catering, but the situation has come to pass now. Now if negotiations are going on, what is the basis? After the 10-year exclusivity comes to an end, are you going to give it lock, stock and barrel back again without calling for tenders? Why are you not looking at the other airlines taking advantage of this? So on that particular basis, these people who do not even know to run a bus are talking of how to run airbuses. That is the sadness of this.[Interruption.] So listen at least at this moment. [Interruption.] What is the dividend we have got from this particular Airline? For 10 years, we have only got Rs. 2.7 billion. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) - [ ] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) ? ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage - Minister of Power) .

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] " . , "

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

" . . I refer to the Rs. 2.7 billion dividend that this airline got. Where is this revenue that we got from privatization? The last dividend that we got just before privatization was Rs. 3 billion from Mr. Harry Jayawardena when he was the Chairman. The entire 10 years of the Emirates management brought in Rs. 2.7 billion. What is the meaning of this? When they slaughter like this without any future projection, this is what happens.

Then as regards the magazines in the SriLankan Airlines, I table* an inflight magazine of theirs. Now this is the magazine to promote the country and the airline. This magazine - [Interruption.] Can you control the House, Hon Presiding Member? What is the purpose of this? This is like a

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] rowdy - [Interruption.] This magazine does not even promote one hotel in this country. All hotels are in Maldives, in India and other countries. So is this a SriLankan Airlines magazine, I ask you ? The SriLankan Airlines is one problem. When termination of the SriLankan Airlines agreement is now on the card, you have another whizkid who has basically never been in the aviation industry coming in with Mihin Air. A country where today people are unable to eat a square meal is talking of the second carrier, budget carrier. . , " " . ? . . " . " , , . ? You are spending Rs. 1500 billion. From where does that money come? Where is the return to this? Lankaputhra Bank has given a long-term loan, which is unserviceable. Today, this airline is losing almost Rupees three to four million a day. The loan factor is 60 to 70 per cent. So even if it is 120 per cent, they cannot make profits. Look at the amount outstanding in the Petroleum Corporation. .

expending money and their exclusivity has got the SriLankan Airlines to earn about Rs. 1.4 billion. What is the future of this country? If it is in the hands of SriLankan Airlines, I am made to understand through the negotiations that you are trying to - But, on the basis of a futuristic airline, you have got to plan the industry. You are not looking at one particular sector. This is what we are asking from the Airports and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Limited. Ensure that these are taken in totality. Then, look at the Mihin Air - ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) What is going to happen on the 14th?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You are very interested. I heard that you are also coming to this side on the 14th. I know that you are extremely worried about it. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) What is the ministry? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You do not worry about that. We are more interested in the country than the ministries. Today, the country is in deep trouble. Going on the basis of Mihin Air, you are having two aircraft that is parked there. The load factor is not there. You are looking at the third aircraft that is coming up. Hon. Minister, when we asked you as to how the money is coming - last time you were very, not you, - whoever answered previously was not able to give a correct picture. Subsequently we were able to find out through the Finance Ministry that it has been subverted through other processes and then, finance of this particular airline is coming on. Let us be straight. What is the purpose? If this type of airline is coming forward, ensure that there is proper and legitimate financing. Going on that particular basis, all we can say is that we are playing around as if we are playing with some toys. Hon. Minister, this is an industry from which you can make billions of rupees. Look at Singapore, look at Dubai, without anything in their hands they have become absolute points of entrepreneur hubs. So, if this can be done by countries that do not have potential, we, next to India, have a glaring opportunity before us, to be a hub. Please ensure that you have a non-political team at least for future posterity. [Interruption.] I said, "with potential", not two people. . . . . . On this

particular score, I am saying that the aviation industry is not being fully utilized. So, go ahead and ensure that you do it and not start this nonsensical Mihin Air, giving excuses as to what needs to be done. Then, as regards the shipping industry -

( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) ? . ? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The shipping industry is another important matter, Hon. Minister. Just opening up ports in every corner or every lagoon is not the answer. But the shipping industry needs to be protected. You have to foster it. You have got to give strength to that. Look at this particular Budget for 2008. Three proposals have been made. A ship purchased to be registered in Sri Lanka will be exempt from Port and Airport Development Levy. This type of negligible things do not bring in ships to this country. Registration does not take place just because of this type of rhetorics that are mentioned. Shipping is a billion-rupee industry. I do not know who has these types of ships. But, it is a billion-rupee industry. Just to attract, you cannot simply say one per cent or half a per cent indirect taxation, and then you are going to give registration. Then, the next one is the flag of convenience. For how long has this talk about the flag of convenience been going on? You are selling the same old thing once again. This same proposal came in 1998. Last year also this proposal came in. Is there no innovativeness in the Budget presentation? The shipping industry is something from which you can make billions of rupees, as I told you. But you are not doing so. What are these three facilities that are given, which have been given time and time again? What is that we cannot give? There are much better things that can be done. There are other related activities of shipping that have been ignored. Look at the shipping industry. You are saying to register under a flag of convenience. The LTTE is having 20 to 30 ships and what are they basically registering? So, you know that these are things of an easy nature. But you are not taking in the actual industrial value of this. You are looking at the potential of political value. Please do not politicize the economy; do not politicize this industry. Being a brother of His Excellency the President, you have all the right. You do not need to listen to

anybody. But ensure that you speak to the professionals. I have little knowledge but there are people who have much better knowledge. Ensure that you enlist their support. Look at the industries; look at the Freight Forwarders' Association. Bring them into this picture. They are the captains of this industry. They ask, What the hell is going on in this country? When you look at the shipping industry the third incentive mentioned is, Customs duty on freight charges. This is like trying to tell a child "I will give you an airbus just to travel". In this instance it is as if you are giving all Sri Lankans to have a walk on the moon. These things are not attainable. Today we have ships of the sixth or seventh generation which are taking 20,000 to 30,000 containers in one go. How can you afford to give such puerile proposals and try to develop the industry in this country? There are better things that can be done. Why are you not taking advantage of that? Look at the transshipment that is there. We are overpricing ourselves. That is the critical factor. I forgot to mention one matter. That is, the building of a new airport in Weerawila. You want to build that; well and good. But you are building that without the Environmental Assessment Impact Certificate. Officials of the Environmental Authority say that they have not given authority. Now you have stopped going ahead with that. Suddenly if they say environmentally that is wrong, then why on earth have you selected that point? Likewise considering the ports that are there, you must look at whether they are sensible.

) (The Presiding Member) .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Give me two more minutes, Sir. When I talk of the transshipment, we are overpricing ourselves. The Ports Authority, owing to the humongous expenditure, is trying to get revenue by increasing the rates. This is not an insatiable demand. This has basically demand and supply. As soon as we increase our prices, they will go to an alternate market. Colombo is not the only point for transshipment or entrepot trading. They go to Singapore where there is much higher productivity. On that score, they can go to Oman which is developing or al-Fujeira. So ensure that we do not kill this industry before we can even take advantage of it. We took advantage. My political guru, the late Mr. Lalith Athulath Mudali, did not have shipping knowledge. He got the professional around him. He looked at the potential that was there and he exploited it. He brought the port from the 115th position in the world to the 20th position. But thereafter we started politicizing it. Many people run to this as if it

2007 22 481 482

is a huge gold pot in the world. Please ensure that corruption is stopped. This is not a place where you can poke yourselves and create 100 jobs or 500 jobs. Look at the potential that is there. The Southern Port is there for development. If the Southern Port is to come up, is infrastructure sufficient to take advantage of that? Just having a port in the breakwater and having four or five berths will not help. If you cannot bring the containers out; at the moment about three million containers are being handled there. I do not think you can handle any more. So, if you put another south port there, you have got to bring it to dry ports. Now, the road structure, have you planned for it? No. On that score how are we looking at these matters? I am talking on a non-political basis because this is a sector in which I have basically been playing a pivotal role. Many people get a wrong inference when I speak on this. But all I want to say is, do not neglect this field. You can create thousands and millions of jobs on this. We should not give ourselves away to India which is basically looking at this with the new Sethu Samudram channel being opened up. Do not just sit and think that our shipping industry will be in a static position for a hundred years to come. India is very ambitious. They are looking at 13 to 14 metres draught at the moment for Sethu Samudram but, if we suddenly decide to go to 16 to 17 metres, we are dead. That is the reason why we should always take full advantage with India being there. Call them in as partners. There is no problem at all. Look at Dockyard where there is another huge potential.

Today, I read in the newspapers that one of the largest ships has come in there for repairs. We must be proud. We must give them tax exemptions. We must give them all the possible facilities. Have a dockyard built in Hambantota without wasting time. You cannot have a port in Galle; you cannot have a port in Colombo; you cannot have a port in Oluvil and another one in Hambantota. Ensure that there are deep harbour facilities. It is correct to do that. You can do refuelling, bunkering and things like that. Ensure that a dockyard is built there if you are so keen to do this. Do not waste US Dollars 288 million on something of which the turnover would be absolutely nothing. You have a natural harbour in Galle. You cannot have another just about 100 or 50 or 60 kilometres away. It may be politically saleable, but economically is it saleable? So, that is what you have got to look at. Then, another sector that comes under your scope is the service industry. The Mahapola Training Institute is there. That is something which is being politicized today. The Hon. Dilan Perera and I were in the COPE when the Mahapola Training Institute came before us about a month ago. We felt so sorry for the politicization that is taking place. There is some person who has been appointed politically. He thinks that he knows the industry very well and tried to teach us. All we say is, ensure that professionals are put in.

( ) (The Presiding Member) .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) .

( ) (The Presiding Member) 4 .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, ensure that you take advantage of that. Then the people working on board, the crews, can be trained and sent off. Please take note of it. These are what you have got to do. There are a lot of other industries related to shipping and aviation. You must take advantage of them. Remember, shipping and aviation keep the hotels going; the subsidiary industries going and the lorry transportation going. All this is going on because of these sectors. Now in many areas, owing to the fact that the industries are crashing down, you are having a reverse trend. There is a decline taking place. So for this, open it up, but ensure that you do not politicize it. Put in professionals; get the people in the industry to go on and at least, ensure that the decline that has taken place is arrested and then move forward. All I want to say is, ensure that you take the maximum advantage out of that and a non - politicization process goes on. Thank you.
