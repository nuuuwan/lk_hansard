- PEACE PROCESS AND CURRENT SITUATION PERTAINING TOTAMIL CIVILIAN POPULATION IN THE NORTH-EAST

[. . 9.48]

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)Mr. Speaker, I have given notice and accordingly movethe following Adjournment Motion.

That the Parliament do adjourn today to discuss the followingmatter of urgent public importance The peace process and the current situation pertaining to the Tamilcivilian population in the North-East of Sri Lanka.

The matter which has caused the most utmost agitationin recent times in the minds of all who very much wishthe peace process to succeed has been the efforts at dis-mantling the merger of the Northern and the Eastern Prov-inces. This development was in consequence of threepetitions filed in the Supreme Court on the 11th of July,2006, by certain persons who in my submission do not fallwithin the category of historical inhabitants of either theNorthern or the Eastern Provinces, alleging a violation oftheir fundamental rights.

It is relevant, Sir, to mention at this point that PresidentChandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga had on 10th

November, 2005 made an Order under Section 37(2)(b) ofthe Provincial Councils Act, No. 42 of 1987, and publishedin Gazette Extraordinary No. 1420/27 of 23rd November, 2005postponing the date for the holding of the poll in regard towhether the two provinces, the Northern and Eastern

Provinces, should be administered together or not, to 16thNovember, 2006 in the Eastern Province and to 5th December2006 in the Northern Province. This postponement byPresident Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was thetwenty sixth postponement over a period of 18 yearscommencing in 1988 and ending in 2006, starting withPresident J.R. Jayewardene and subsequently effected byPresidents R. Premadasa, D. B. Wijetunga and ChandrikaBandaranaike Kumaratunga. During the severalpostponements effected by the President ChandrikaBandaranaike Kumaratunga commencing 1994 and expiring2005, over a period of 11 years, the present PresidentMahinda Rajapaksa was either a Minister or the PrimeMinister in the Chandrika Bandaranaike KumaratungaGovernment, and therefore, accepted the validity of thesaid several postponements effected by the PresidentChandrika Bandaranike Kumaratunga as Executive President.

The Supreme Court delivered its judgment on 16th

October, 2006. The court held that the purported amendmentof the Section 37 (1) (b) of the Provincial Councils Act bythe President J. R. Jayewardene by an Emergency Regulationwas invalid and consequently the Proclamation made bythe President on 8th September, 1988 constituting theNorthern and Eastern Provinces as one unit was invalid.I have, Sir, dealt with this matter fully in the course of thestatement made by me in Parliament on 7th November, 2006.

While we respectfully disagree with the view taken bythe Supreme Court based upon a procedural flaw, it isdifficult to comprehend that this so-called procedural flawwas discovered only after a period of eighteen years andafter several successive Presidents had during this periodacted in pursuance of the Proclamation made by PresidentJ. R. Jayewardene in 1988.

It would, Sir, be relevant to be reminded that but for theorder delivered by the Supreme Court on 16th October 2006,President Mahinda Rajapaksa would have been required tomake a determination on whether the poll should be heldor postponed by November, 2006 and given the conditionin the Indo-Lanka Accord that, All persons who have beendisplaced due to ethnic violence or other reasons will havea right to vote in such referendum (poll); necessaryconditions to enable them to return to areas from wherethey were displaced will be created. And in view of thiscondition not having been fulfilled; it being well-known thathundreds of thousands of displaced Tamil civilians,particularly from the Eastern Province, had not returned tothe areas from where they were displaced and conditionsnot having been created for their return; and over 250,000Tamil-speaking civilians largely from the Eastern Provincehaving been displaced in 2006, no referendum or poll couldhave been held in terms of the said Indo-Lanka Accord andin the face of the said reality President Mahinda Rajapaksawould have had no alternative but to postpone the datefor the holding of the referendum or poll for a further date.The only other alternative would have been for President

2007 10187188

Mahinda Rajapaksa to defy the Indo-Lanka Accord, aninternational treaty, by which he is bound as the ExecutivePresident of Sri Lanka. It has to be pointed out, Sir, withrespect that the judgment of the Supreme Court has had theeffect of saving President Mahinda Rajapaksa from thispredicament.

The Governor of the North-East Provincial Council wasone of the respondents in the said petition. It would bepertinent, Sir, to quote what he stated in the said judicialproceedings. I quote from the affidavit dated 31st August,2006 filed by him in court. In paragraph 03 it states:

(a) the petitioner has contravened the rules of your Lordshipscourt by failing to cite the necessary parties to thisapplication;

(b) that your Lordships court is precluded from granting the reliefagainst His Excellency the President, as His Excellency thePresident cannot be made a party to this application in termsof Article 35 (1) of the Constitution;

(c) that the petitioners application is time barred;

(d) that the petitioner is guilty of laches;

(e) that the petitioner is guilty of acquiescence in the subject matterof this application and / or is guilty of inaction and / or lackof diligence.

These averments were made, Sir, by the Governor in theaffidavit he filed in the Supreme Court because the petitionerhad made his application after 18 years from the date of thepurported infringement, the time limit for such complaintsbeing, in terms of the Constitution, within one month ofthe date of such infringement.

Further, Sir, the historical inhabitants of the EasternProvince, the vital stakeholders, not having been maderespondents in the said proceedings, the case of the vitalstakeholders would not have been presented to court. Itneeds to be pointed out that their application to intervenewas also refused by the court. I have dealt with this matterfully, Sir, in the Statement made by me in Parliament on 7th

November, 2006.

I further quote Sir, from the affidavit of the Governor. Inpara 09 it states:

I am advised to state and therefore I state that the said regulationmade by President J.R. Jayewardene under Section 5 of the PublicSecurity Ordinance had the legal effect of amending / modifying Section37 (1) (b) of the Provincial Councils Act, No. 42 of 1987.

Further, para 21 states, I quote:

I further state that in the said circumstances, the fundamentalrights of the petitioner enshrined in Article 12(1) of the Constitutionhave not been violated

He continues to state, Sir, in paragraph 34, I quote:

I am advised to state and I state as follows :-

(a) that the petitioners application is time barred,

(b) that the petitioners application is misconceived in law,

(c) that the petitioners application does not conform with therules of the Supreme Court,

(d) that the petitioner has failed to establish any infringementof the fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 12(1) of theConstitution; and

(e) that in the circumstances the petitioner is not entitled toany of the relief as prayed for.

The above, Sir, reflects the position taken up by theGovernor of the North Eastern Province and therefore, bythe Government of Sri Lanka in the Supreme Court. If theabove was the position taken up by the Government of SriLanka through the Governor of the North Eastern Provincein court, is it not obligatory on the part of Government tosustain that position? The court does not and indeed cannotprohibit the merger. It merely states that a certain step takenby President J. R. Jayewardene was defective and thereforeinvalid.

It must be submitted, Sir, here, there is a very popular beliefamong some ill-informed people that the Supreme Court heldthat there could be no merger. The Supreme Court did nothold any such thing. The Supreme Court merely held thatthe procedure adopted by President Jayewardene to effectthe merger, was defective. We therefore, submit, Sir, that itis obligatory on the part of the Government to cure thatdefect. If the Government does not do so, it can only meanthat the Government is using the judgment of the Court asan excuse to avoid fulfilling its obligation. It is relevant, Sir,to examine the official reaction to the judgment of the Court.The Daily Mirror of 17th October 2006, the day after thejudgment, reported that several ministers had at theGovernment Parliamentary group meeting stated that theywere unhappy with the judgment. Amongst them were, theMinister of Trade, Commerce, Consumer Affairs andMarketing Development and Minister of Highways and ChiefGovernment Whip, the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, theMinister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Ports andAviation, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, the Minister ofConstitutional Affairs and National Integration, the Hon. DewGunasekara, the Minister of Healthcare and Nutrition andLeader of the House of Parliament, the Hon. Nimal Siripalade Silva and the Minister of Public Administration and HomeAffairs, the Hon. Sarath Amunugama. I have not the slightestdoubt that many other Hon. Ministers and Members ofParliament were of the same view. In a significant statementin Parliament on 19th October, 2006, the Leader of the SriLanka Muslim Congress, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem stated that-

I quote:

..it certainly would be too nave to assume that Muslims wouldbe overjoyed..

That is regarding the de-merger of the Northern andEastern Provinces.

knowing fully well the timing and the implications of thisJudgement.

The Hon. Rauff Hakeem further said; I quote:

We cannot be nave so as to ignore the sentiments of ourTamil brothers.

The Hon. Rauff Hakeem Sir, also emphasized:

Of particular significance is the need to address the Muslimdimension in a permanently merged Northern and Eastern Province.

That was a statement, Sir, made in this House on behalf ofthe Muslim people by the Leader of the Muslim Congress,the Hon. Rauff Hakeem.

This dimension, Sir, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem referred to,is the legitimate aspirations of our Muslim brethren whichI have not the slightest doubt, the Tamil people and thoserepresenting them including the LTTE, fully comprehendand will accept.

It would be relevant, Sir, for me to examine the viewsexpressed by the international community. The Co-Chairsof the Tokyo Donor Conference representing a group of58 donor countries and consisting of Norway, the EuropeanUnion, the USA and Japan have expressed their views on12th September, 2006 at their meeting in Brussels before thejudgment and the Co-Chairs have stated, Sir, I quote:

There should be no change to the specific arrangements forthe North and East which could endanger the achievement ofpeace. The legitimate interests and aspirations of all communities,including the Tamil, Muslim and Sinhala communities must beaccommodated as part of a political settlement.

The Co-Chairs issued yet another statement after theirmeeting in Washington D.C on 21st November, 2006 afterthe judgment which I now wish to quote, Sir.

At the same time the specific arrangements for the North andEast should not be disturbed as they are fundamental to continuingthe dialogue to achieve an agreement. The legitimate interests andaspirations of the communities, including the Tamil, Muslim andthe Sinhala communities must be accommodated as part of a politicalsettlement.

That has been, Sir, the views expressed by the Co-Chairsboth before the judgment and after the judgment. The Co-Chairs of 58 donor countries; consisting of as I mentionedbefore, Norway, the USA, the European Union and Japan,being responsible members of the international communitywho were involved in the peace process of Sri Lanka, haverealized the importance of sustaining the merged North-East until such time as there is a final political settlementthrough negotiations, through dialogue and the Co-Chairshave in no uncertain terms expressed that view both priorto the judgment and after the judgment. Our neighbour, Sir,and regional power India has been very much in touch withthe President and the Government of Sri Lanka on this issueboth at New Delhi and during the Non-aligned Summit atCuba in September, 2006. It was the Indo-Lanka Accord of29th July, 1987 which brought about the merger of theNorthern and Eastern Provinces as one unit on the basis ofthe historical, incontrovertible reality that the Northern andEastern Provinces were the areas of historical habitation ofthe Tamil-speaking people. New Delhi has expressed itsstrong commitment to the provisions of the Indo-Lanka

Accord. We were informed by high officials in New Delhion 21st September, 2006 that the Sri Lankan Governmenthad assured the continuance of the existing arrangement atthe meeting between the Hon. Prime Minister of India andthe President of Sri Lanka at Havana in Cuba in September,2006.

A delegation of the ITAK - Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi- met with the Hon. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on22nd December, 2006 at his office in New Delhi. We toldthe Hon. Prime Minister that the merger of the North-Eastwas the cornerstone of the peace process and that the peaceprocess would crumble unless the merger was sustained.The Hon. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was in completeagreement with that view and unambiguously reiterated tous, Indias commitment to the restoration of the status quoante of the merged North-East, as per the Indo-Lanka Accord.

Following the judgment of the Supreme Court, Sir, theHon. G.G. Ponnambalam MP, on behalf of the ITAK madea statement in Parliament on 19th October, 2006 setting outour initial reaction and sought a response from theGovernment. The Hon. Prime Minister made a statementin Parliament on the merger of the North-East Provinces on7th November, 2006. The Hon. Prime Minister in the courseof that statement did not shut the door. He outlined severaloptions that were available to the Government. In fact, Irequested the Hon. Prime Minister to kindly send me anEnglish translation of the Statement he made in Parliament.He was very kind enough to do so and I wish to quote fromthat translation, which the Hon. Prime Minister sent me. Iwill refer to one of the options in the Hon. Prime MinistersStatement.

The moving of a Bill and passing the same in Parliament, underArticle 154A. (3) of the Constitution for the purpose of laying downnecessary criteria and formulating legal provisions to integrate twoor three adjoining provinces as a single administrative unit, to decideon a structure whether the integration of the said provinces shouldbe continued with or whether the said provinces should remain asseparate administrative units.

This option suggested by the Hon. Prime Minister in thecourse of the Statement made by him in Parliament on 7th

November, 2006 is akin to the provisions of Section 37 ofthe Provincial Councils Act, subject to whatevermodifications. The Hon. Prime Minister has thereby, onthe basis of this Statement, accepted that the Governmentcan take corrective action.

Sir, on the same date, 7th November 2006, I made acomprehensive statement in Parliament on behalf of theITAK, tracing the history and justification for the merger,stating our views on the proceedings before the court andurging the Government to take necessary corrective actionto restore the status quo ante pertaining to the merger.

On 16th November, 2006 a delegation of the IllankaiTamil Arasu Kadchi, on the invitation of the President, metwith him. Matters pertaining to the merger of the North-East Provinces were discussed. After the said meeting, the

2007 10191192

ITAK met with the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, Leader ofthe Opposition. Consistent with the position taken by hisparty since the announcement of the court judgment, theHon. Ranil Wickremasinghe assured us that his party wouldextend to any legislative measure to validly restore the statusquo ante pertaining to the merger, the fullest support.

Subsequently, on 20th November, 2006, I wrote toPresident Mahinda Rajapaksa and I would seek yourpermission, Sir, to read that letter to this House.

It states, I quote:

Your Excellency,

Merger of the North-East Province

I refer to the discussion we had with you on the 16th instant inregard to the above.

You will appreciate that this the most basic issue in the evolutionof a negotiated political solution to the Tamil question.

We impressed upon you that the Northern and Eastern Provinceswere constituted as one unit, on the fundamental and incontrovertiblebasis, that the said provinces were the areas of historical habitationof the Tamil speaking people.

This fact was accepted in the Indo- Sri Lanka Agreement signed byShri Rajiv Gandhi, Prime Minister of India and Mr. J. R. Jayewardene,President of Sri Lanka on 29th July 1987. This we submit is aninternational treaty which Sri Lanka is bound to honour andimplement.

Under the 13th Amendment to the Constitution and the ProvincialCouncils Act, President J. R. Jayewardene had constituted the twoprovinces as one unit.

After the constitution of the two provinces as one unit, he providedfor the poll to determine whether the said two provinces shouldcontinue as one unit or be separate.

The date for the poll has been extended by President R. Premadasa,D. B. Wijetunga and Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga for overa period of 18 years. Three successive Presidents have therebyaccepted the constitution of the Northern and Eastern Provinces asone unit by President J. R. Jayewardene. They thereby honouredand implemented the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement signed between theHeads of two States.

The Supreme Court has held that the amendment of the ProvincialCouncils Act by President J. R. Jayewardene, by an EmergencyRegulation is invalid, and therefore of no effect in law and thatconsequently the proclamation pertaining to the constitution of thetwo Provinces as one unit is invalid.

The Supreme Court has not held that the provisions of the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement or the legal provisions pertaining to theconstitution of the two provinces as one unit are invalid. It onlyquestions the procedure adopted by President J. R. Jayewardene toconstitute the two Provinces as one unit.

You told us that you had instructed the Attorney-General to makesubmissions to Court to prevent the dismantling of the North-East asone unit and that you were not happy with the decision of the Court.

We urged you to take necessary corrective steps to constitute theNorthern and Eastern Provinces as one unit, so as to remove thedefect pointed out in the judgment of the Court. This also becomesnecessary considering that no appeal is available from the saidjudgment.

We also pointed out to you that any poll in the Northern or EasternProvince to determine whether the two provinces should be one unitor be separate, can only take place when there is in existence a North-East Province, constituted as one unit, and in accordance with theprovisions of the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement.

We also pointed out to you, that you could without difficulty musterthe required support in Parliament to cure the defect pointed out inthe judgment of the Court. Since meeting with you, we have metwith Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, MP, Leader of the Opposition whohas assured us that his party would extend to any such legislativemeasure to validly restore the Status Quo Ante, the fullest support.Many other parties will extend to you the fullest support. You willdefinitely receive overwhelming support, to have the requiredlegislative measure enacted.

. . ( )( - , )(The Hon. H. R. Mithrapala - Deputy Minister of Trade andCommerce)Hon. Member, are you agreeable to hold a Referendum?

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

After I finish my speech, I will certainly respond to anyquestion you raise.

. . ( )(The Hon. H. R. Mithrapala)

I asked for a clarification.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

I will be dealing with that matter as I go on. Sir, I furtherquote from my letter to the President:

We also need to point out that the constitution of the Northernand Eastern Provinces as one unit, relates to the basic fundamentalrights of the Tamil speaking peoples, and is also intended to attenuatethe injustice meted out to the Tamil speaking peoples in the EasternProvince, by the Sri Lankan State, since Independence. This basicfundamental right cannot be set at naught by any reference to Tamilmilitancy. It must not be forgotten that such an arrangement wascontemplated even in the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact of 1957,long before the birth of Tamil militancy.

Any effort to use the technical flaw referred to in the judgment ofthe Court, to dismantle the constitution of the North-East as one unit,in accordance with the provisions of the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement,would only mean that the Tamil speaking people are being denied abasic fundamental right recognized by the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement;that the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement itself is being disregarded; thatthe unjust gains brought about by the Sri Lankan State sinceindependence in the Eastern Province, so as to disproportionatelybenefit the Sinhala people is sought to be retained, and that theGovernment is not concerned about the Tamils concluding that theyhave once again been cheated. It is my duty to point out that suchan unjust course of action cannot bring about peace.

193194

I appeal to you to do the correct thing, by taking corrective actionto restore the Status Quo Ante pertaining to the constitution of theNorthern and Eastern Provinces as one unit, and thereby honourand implement the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement.

I look forward to hearing from you in regard to your decision.

I have received an acknowledgement from HisExcellency the President to my letter, but he has notresponded to the contents of my letter. We urged, Sir, inthat letter that corrective action be taken to restore the statusquo ante pertaining to the constitution of the Northern andthe Eastern Provinces as one unit and thereby honour andimplement the Indo-Lanka Accord. As I said before, wereceived an acknowledgement.

More recently, Sir, the Hon. Dilan Perera, Deputy Ministerof Justice and Law Reforms, in a statement to theVirakesari, the Tamil newspaper, referred to deficienciesin the Sri Lankan Constitution, which were an impedimentto the resolution of the national question. He also statedthat the bifurcation of the North-East had retarded theprospect of a resolution to the national question. He furtherstated that if political decisions were continuously reversedby the court, the Tamil people would begin to regard thecourt as belonging only to the Sinhalese people. This iswhat the Hon. Dilan Perera has said in an interview to theVirakesari. Tragically, Sir, the Tamil-speaking peoplestrongly feel that way because the five-judge bench in thede-merger issue comprised entirely of judges who were fromthe Sinhala community. Given the strong ethnic dimensionof the issue before the court and the sensitive issue of therights of Tamil-speaking historical inhabitants, a courtreflective of ethnic pluralism would have been free of suchsuspicion.

Even more tragically, Sir, three of the judges who heardthe de-merger issue also constituted the Court in the casepertaining to the P-TOMS, the Post-Tsunami OperationalManagement Structure. That matter also related to tsunamireconstruction in the predominantly Tamil-speaking North-East. It is well known that this arrangement too was struckdown by the Court and yet another opportunity to get thepeace process back on track was lost in that way.

I remember, Sir, the Hon. Maithripala Sirisena, who wasthen the Leader of the House, wanted to table inParliament the MoU for the establishment of the Post-Tsunami Operational Management Structure, the P-TOMSarrangement and there were Hon. Members in this Housewho tried to manhandle him; physically prevent him fromdoing that. But despite that, the Hon. Maithripala Sirisenatabled that MoU in Parliament. If there was a vote takenon that in Parliament, I have not the slightest doubt, thatthat would have been passed by Parliament by a two-thirdsmajority, not by a simple majority, but by a two-thirdsmajority. The Government of that time, when Mrs.Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was the President

[ . ]and the incumbent President Mahinda Rajapaksa was thePrime Minister, the UNP and many of us, the minorityparties, would have supported that and it would have beenpassed in Parliament by a two-thirds majority. PresidentMahinda Rajapaksa himself would have supported that inParliament on that day because that was his Governmentsdecision and the MoU was brought before Parliament andtabled in Parliament in terms of a decision of hisGovernment.

Sir, in Aceh in Indonesia, the opportunity afforded bythe tsunami has helped forge a political settlement betweenthe Indonesian Government and the rebels in Aceh. Andtoday there is peace in Aceh. If the P-TOMS arrangementhad not been struck down on a petition filed in the SupremeCourt and had been implemented, the country would notbe in the dire crisis in which it is today.

It is absolutely imperative, Sir, that the persons whoopposed the P-TOMS Agreement clearly understand that.That is, had the P-TOMS Agreement been implemented andthe post-tsunami operational work commenced, this countrywould never have gone into a situation of further conflictand war.

President Mahinda Rajapaksa has talked of a Referendumas a means of deciding whether the North and East couldbe merged. Sir, it is necessary to point out that the policydocument presented to the country before the PresidentialElection, the Mahinda Chintana, though it containedreference to various aspects of the North-East conflict, didnot contain any reference to the dismantling of the North-East merger.

The two Agreements signed by the Presidential CandidateMahinda Rajapaksa with the JVP and the JHU did notcontain any reference to the dismantling of the North-Eastmerger, thought the Agreements substantially related to theNorth-East question. The North-East merger existed at thetime of the Presidential Election.

It is clear, Mr. Speaker, that President Mahinda Rajapaksadid not obtain a mandate from the country for thedismantling of the North-East merger. The country couldhave well taken the view that it would be a very unwisestep. It is my contention that a well informed country wouldhave taken that view.

It must be pointed out, Sir, that President ChandrikaBandaranaike Kumaratunga, who wholeheartedly supportedthe Indo-Lanka Accord, polled 62.28 per cent of the voteat the Presidential Election in November, 1994. PresidentChandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, who continued withthe North-East merger, polled 51.12 per cent of the vote atthe Presidential Election in December, 1999. As pointedout by me earlier, Sir, President Mahinda Rajapaksa was aMinister and thereafter Prime Minister in the Governmentsof President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga andaccepted the policies of the said Governments.

2007 10195196

President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Sir, polled 50.29 per centof the vote at the Presidential Election in November, 2005.Though the Tamil people largely did not vote at thePresidential Election in November, 2005, PresidentMahinda Rajapaksa did not win in any one of the electoraldistricts in the North-East. He polled less that his rival inthe Jaffna and the Vanni Electoral Districts in the NorthernProvince, and less than his rival in each one of the districts- Batticaloa, Digamadulla and Trincomalee - in the EasternProvince. It cannot be claimed that President MahindaRajapaksa has a mandate from either the Northern Provinceor the Eastern Province, particularly in regard to mattersrelated to the North-East. This, Sir, is the factual realitywhich, in the present circumstances, needs to be stated.

The Indo-Lanka Accord of 29th July, 1987 and theProvincial Councils Act, No. 42 of 1987, contemplate aReferendum to be held only where adjoining provinceshave been constituted as one unit with one provincialcouncil, one governor et cetera. The Indo-Lanka Accordfurther stipulates in paragraph 2.4 that All persons whohave been displaced due to ethnic violence, or other reasonswill have the right to vote in such a referendum;Necessary conditions to enable them to return to areasfrom where they were displaced will be created. Hundredsof thousands of Tamil people continued to be displaced;the necessary conditions to enable them to return have notbeen created and with all the violence being unleashedagainst the Tamil people in the North -East presently,several tens of thousands more of Tamil people arecontinuing to be displaced. In these circumstances, aReferendum or any other electoral process in the presentsituation would be illegal, fraudulent and totallyundemocratic.

We would strongly urge that the Government should notallow itself to be goaded by some of its alliance partnersto take actions that would be against the long-terminterests of this country. We strongly submit that theGovernment should not make the judgment of the courtan excuse for embarking on a course of action that isfraught with frightfully harmful consequences.

The option outlined by the Hon. Prime Minister in hisStatement on 7th November, 2006 and referred to by meearlier provides an opportunity. We would strongly urgethe President and the Government to take corrective actionas the judgment of the Supreme Court only outlines aprocedural flaw in regard to the manner of the merger soas to restore the status quo ante pertaining to the mergedNorth-East. Such a measure, we are certain, will haveoverwhelming support in this House.

It was the JVP, Sir, which mounted challenges againstthe P-TOMS arrangement and the North-East merger incourt. Both these arrangements pertained to the North-East. The JVP contested the Local Authority elections inthe Digamadulla and the Trincomalee Districts in the

Eastern Province on its own in 2006. An examination ofthe results of these elections would clearly indicate itsdismal performance even in the Sinhala majority localauthority areas, invariably ending up at the bottom of thelist, not winning a single seat or winning just one seat andvery rarely, I repeat, very rarely, two seats. It did not haveany chance in the predominantly Tamil-speaking, Tamil orMuslim local authority areas. I wish to raise the question,Mr. Speaker, as to whom the JVP represents when it raisesthese extreme anti-minority positions that cause much harm,particularly to the Tamil-speaking people in the North-East?The JVP, Sir, had the audacity to aver in the petition filedin the Supreme Court on the merger issue that 62 per centof the land area in the Trincomalee District and 72 percent of the land area in the Ampara District are Sinhalamajority areas, though the Sinhalese are only 25 per centof the population in the Eastern Province, 33.62 per centin the Trincomalee District and 37.64 per cent in theAmpara District.

Can the JVP explain to this country how the Sinhalesewho in the Eastern Province were only 0.53 per cent in 1827,4.66 per cent in 1881, 4.53 per cent in 1921 and 9.87 percent in 1946, about which time the country attainedIndependence, came to exercise control over 62 per cent ofthe land area in the Trincomalee District and 72 per centof the land area in the Ampara District? The JVP isobviously thinking that such an outrageous situation isperfectly justified and that the Sinhala position in theEastern Province must get even stronger. It is suchdisproportionate, unreasonable and unjust claims that arethe key factors motivating the bifurcation of the North-East,a determination in the crudest possible way to retain theunjust gains since the country attained Independence. Veryclearly the intention is to convert the Eastern Provincewhich is historically and traditionally a preponderantlymajority Tamil-speaking area into a Sinhala majority areaat the earliest. How can the Tamil-speaking people, Sir,Muslims and Tamils, who are 62 per cent of the populationof the Ampara District have only 28 per cent of the land,while the Sinhalese who are 38 per cent have 72 per centof the land? It is the question that needs to be answered,which the Tamils and the Muslims will answer in due coursetogether.

I wish to make it perfectly clear, Sir, that my argumentsare not advanced against the Sinhala people. As I have oftenstated in this House before, I have much affection for theSinhala peasant who in my view is a very decent humanbeing because I have mixed with them so freely and theyhave mixed with me so freely, that I know that the normalSinhala peasant is a very decent human being. I do notwant to be misunderstood as saying anything against theSinhala people. But it is our duty as elected representativesof the Tamil-speaking people to ensure that the legitimateinterests of the Tamil-speaking people who have never hadequal treatment in this country are adequately safeguarded

197198

at least in the areas of their historical habitation, againstthe political machinations of those who want to promoteSinhala hegemony and supremacism in every part of thecountry. This is what, Sir, we find unacceptable andsomething that we possibly cannot condone.

The electoral verdicts at elections in the North-East since1956, have clearly demonstrated the Tamil aspirations; theyhave overwhelmingly supported the Federal Party and after1977 till 2004, the Tamil United Liberation Front. Thishas been so at the Parliamentary Elections in 2004 and theLocal Authority Elections in 2006 in the Eastern Province,in the Trincomalee and Digamadulla Districts, which werecontested on the ticket of the Federal Party. An examinationof the results would cleanly demonstrate the wish of thepeople. Local Authority elections were not held in thepreponderantly Tamil Batticaloa District and the districtsin the Northern Province.

At the District Development Council Elections in 1981,the last election held before the displacement of Tamilscommenced in 1983, due to violence unleashed againstthem, the TULF won the elections in every district in theNorth-East; Jaffna, Mannar, Vavuniya, Mullaitivu,Trincomalee and Batticaloa other than Amparai. Sincethe formation of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, the SriLanka Muslim Congress has received substantial supportof the Muslim people.

The electoral verdicts delivered in the North-East haveconsistently supported a North-Eastern Tamil linguisticregion. This has been the cornerstone of any peacefulpolitical resolution of the Tamil question. This is theaccepted position of all Tamil political parties - every oneof them.

Even the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact of 1957contemplated the concept of a Tamil linguistic region. Ifthe Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact was implemented,a Tamil linguistic region would have become a reality in1957. This, Sir, is intertwined with the dignity, personalsecurity, and well being of the Tamil-speaking people. Acompromise on this fundamental position will endanger thedignity, the security, and well being of the Tamil-speakingpeople particularly in the Eastern Province. The Tamilstruggle in the past 50 years has been primarily to safeguardthe interests of the Tamil-speaking people in the EasternProvince, who faced the danger of being devoured bySinhala colonization in violation of the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact of 1957 and the Dudley Senanayake-Chelvanayakam Pact of 1965, which were intended toterminate Sinhala colonization but which were notimplemented and colonization continued. The Indo-LankaAccord recognized this reality. Any effort to subvert theacceptance of that reality would destroy all prospects of apeaceful resolution.

[ . ]Tamil civilians in the Eastern Province, are presentlybeing specifically targeted through violence to weaken theTamil people. The majority of those who have beendisplaced, amounting to over 250,000 in 2006 and thosewho have fled from the country to Tamil Nadu in SouthIndia also in 2006, amounting to over 16,000 are from theEastern Province.

It is the failure of successive Governments, Sir, to respectthe democratic verdicts of the Tamil people that has resultedin the conflict. It must not be forgotten that in this countryonly Tamils were victims of violence till about the late1970s and early 1980s. For over three decades we, theTamils were engaged in a peaceful non-violent democraticstruggle, but did not achieve anything.

What happened to the Bandaranaike-ChelvanayakamPact? What happened to the Dudley Senanayake-Chelvanayakam Pact? Did we ever raise a gun? Did weever attack a Sinhalese person? Did we ever attack a Muslimperson? Did we ever attack anybody? Were we not theonly ones being attacked? Were the Members of Parliamentwho performed Sathyagraha at Galle Face Green in 1956not attacked? Did they not bleed? Did they not come toParliament with bleeding injuries? Were our people notmassacred in all parts of the country? Were our people nottaken in ships to Jaffna and Trincomalee? Do not talk ofthe LTTE and talk of violence as if you are all innocentbabies or the only violence in this country has been theviolence of the LTTE. LTTE was never created by us. LTTEwas a phenomenon created by you, by the violenceunleashed by you on the Tamil people. Please, do not forgetthat. But, we want all this violence to come to an end. Wewant all violence to come to an end and we want talks totake place and a solution to be taken place on the basis oftalks. It must not be forgotten, Sir, that only the Tamilswere the victims of violence till about the late 70s and early80s. For over three decades the Tamils were engaged in apeaceful, non-violent democratic struggle but did notachieve anything. This is a fact that cannot be denied. Theconflict cannot be resolved by subterfuge and deviousdeceptive processes; such action would only aggravate theconflict.

Sir, if governments can be established and governmentscan be changed on the basis of the Sinhala vote in thecountry, most parts of the country being Sinhala majorityareas, why should not the Tamil-speaking vote determinethe right to governance in the Tamil linguistic area in someadequate and durable way? The North and East areunquestionably predominantly Tamil-speaking contiguousareas. Every district in the North and the East has a Tamil-speaking majority. Why have you not respected our verdictsof 1956? Look at the results in 1956; in 1960 March; in1960 July; in 1965; in 1970. We have overwhelminglysupported a federal solution. We never asked for separation.There was no violence on our side. Our election manifestoin 1970 clearly stated that we opposed separation. It is there

2007 10199200

in the Parliament library. You can go and see it. We toldthe Tamil people, Do not support separation; vote againstany candidate who contests on a separatist ticket and manyof them lost their deposits. Is that not the truth? What didyou do to bring about a solution to this country? Nothing!You only kept hammering us. I was in the Sathyagrahacampaign in 1961. We were assaulted. We were locked upin Panagoda. We were the first occupants in the PanagodaArmy camp before the Army went there. That was whathappened to us and today you talk of LTTE violence. Wedo not support violence at all. We are against all forms ofviolence. We want all violence to come to an end - bothon your side and our side and we want all the people tolive in this country in terms of a respected dignified solutionwhere we can live as brothers; as human beings. The causeof the conflict, Sir, not coming to an end, has been therefusal to recognize this reality.

We would urge, Sir, the Government to adopt a just andreasonable approach to resolve the national question in amanner acceptable to the Tamil- speaking people of theNorth-East. Efforts to destroy the Tamil struggle through amilitary action against the Tamil people, or to destroy Tamilsolidarity through subversion and intrigue must inevitablyfail.

Before I conclude Mr. Speaker, I want to make referenceto a rather interesting article which has been written by Mr.B. Raman who was Additional Secretary in the CabinetSecretariat of the Government of India at New Delhi andwho is presently Director, Institute for Topical Studies,Chennai. He writes on behalf of the South Asia AnalysisGroup. What he says is very interesting because it is verythought provoking and thinkers and analysts who arewatching the development in Sri Lanka are probably ableto foresee where Sri Lanka is going or where the Tamils inSri Lanka are being taken to. I place on record some of theparagraphs of Mr. Ramans article. He has talked aboutPresident Mahinda Rajapaksa pursuing a strategy for adictated peace in an earlier article.

In this article which appeared in the Daily Mirror of 09thJanuary, 2007 Mr. B. Raman states, I quote:

In pursuance of its strategy for a dictated peace, which will removethe Eastern Province from the control of the Tamils and ultimatelyconvert it into a Sinhalese majority area.........

This is exactly what I have been saying. He further states,I quote:

.......... through the resettlement of Sinhalese ex-servicemen andothers, the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government has already initiated anumber of steps by taking advantage of the silence of the internationalcommunity, includingIndia, on its policy of using its Air Force, heavyartillery and forced starvation to force the Tamils into submission.

He goes on to state, I quote:

The first batch of about 80 Sinhalese ex-servicemen for re-settlement was brought to Trincomalee under Army protection onDecember 30. More are expected.

Eighty ex-servicemen have already come for settlementin Trincomalee and more are to come. He goes on furtherto state, I quote:

Not only Sinhalese extremist leaders, but also Buddhist monkshave been associated with the plan for the dilution of the Tamilpresence and influence in the Eastern Province.

It will not stop at Trincomalee. It will go to Batticaloa.It will go to Ampara. We can be sure about that. I wouldlike to know from some responsible person in Governmentwhether this information is correct. A person who held thepost of Additional Secretary in the Cabinet Secretariat inNew Delhi in the Central Government has written an articlewhere he says that on December 30th a batch of 80Sinhalese ex-servicemen have already been brought toTrincomalee under army protection to be settled inTrincomalee. Is this correct, we would like to know? Therewas a time in 1983/1984 when you tried to settle ex-convictsin the Manalaru area, in the Weli Oya area to prevent thecontiguity between the North and the East and we knowwhat happened. Violence escalated. Now is this true? Iwould like before this Debate ends for somebody on behalfof the Government to kindly tell this House whether 80Sinhalese ex-servicemen have been brought to Trincomaleeon the 30th of December under army protection to be settledin Trincomalee? If it starts in Trincomalee, it will happenin Trincomalee, it will happen in Batticaloa, it will happenin Ampara and it will happen all over the Eastern Province.We can be sure about that.

He goes on to state further, I quote:

The ultimate objective of Mr. Rajapaksas advisers is to reducethe Sri Lankan Tamils to the status of the Red Indians (of Sri Lanka)kept confined to certain reserves as museum pieces. A more anti-Tamil group of hardline advisers Sri Lanka has not had since theTamils rose in revolt in 1983.

We are goint to be like the Red Indians. According toMr. Raman the Tamils of Sri Lanka who are a historic racewith an ancient civilization, an ancient language and whohave historically inhabited a certain area are going to belike museum pieces. I may not be living in that land. Imay long be gone by the time that happens but those RedIndians are bound to be very dangerous people, that I amquite sure about.

Commenting on the military situation Mr. Raman in thecourse of his article refers to a statement made byLieutenant General Sarath Fonseka - that the operations inVakarai have been somewhat delayed on account of the badweather and so on. But Mr. Raman in his article states, Iquote ;

A new consignment of arms and ammunitions from Pakistanincluding artillery shells is expected shortly and once that arrives,the offensive is expected to be stepped up.

That is what he says. So, you see this is the situation inwhich we are. Therefore, it is my duty Sir, once again toappeal to the Government not to pursue this very dangerousagenda. It is an agenda which will not succeed because itis an immoral agenda, it is an unethical agenda beingpracticed against the people who have long stood for apeaceful, democratic, non-violent solution and only whenyou started genocidal attacks against our people was thereretaliation by our youth. Prabhakaran in the course of hisMartyrs Day Speech in November, 2005 said, I am givingyou time. Please come up with a solution that will beacceptable to my people, that will satisfy their legitimateaspirations. He said that one year ago. Have you comeup with any solution? What happened to the report of themajority experts committee that sat recently? I do not wantto go into that question because we were not involved inthat. But what happened to the report of that committee?The JVP walked out, JHU threatened to tear it up and HisExcellency the President said, We have nothing to do withit. The Hon. Minister of Mass Media and Information onbehalf of the Government said, We have nothing to do withit.

. . ( )(The Hon. H. R. Mithrapala)

Why did you reject the draft Constitution of 2000 ?

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

We were prepared to fully support the 1995 Bill. We didnot reject it. There was no vote taken. You could not carryit through. That was the reality. But we were prepared tofully support the 1995 Bill which was never brought toParliament. So, Sir, please stop this bogus complaint aboutthe Tamils not being prepared to accept a solution. Thefact of the matter is that you have never been able to comeup with a solution. What happened when the Hon. RanilWickremasinghe tried in 2002 and 2003? What happened?The LTTE came up with some proposals for an ISGA. Whathappened? Everything was sabotaged. Ministries were takenover. The Parliament was dissolved. Now, the formerPresident says, I made some tremendous mistakes. I shouldnever make those mistakes. She is now crying about that.What is the use of crying now? This is the reality. Then,Madam Chairperson, I wish to say a few words briefly aboutthe current situation in the North and East. We are gravelyconcerned, Sir, with the violence being unleashed againstour people. Even recently in Illuppaikadavai in Mannarinnocent Tamil civilians have been killed as a result of theaerial bombings. I have got the list of persons who havebeen killed. Sixteen persons in all and amongst them, achild of one and a half years, children of four, five andten years and old people of 63 years, 59 years are there.There are several injured persons including men, womenand children. Thirty six persons have been injured and havebeen taken to hospital as a result of the aerial bombings.Even the UN has referred to it. We know what happened atVakarai, Kathiraveli as a result of the heavy shelling on the9th and 10th of December when on each one of those daysover 20 people were killed. And we know what happenedin the previous month, on the 8th of November, when as aresult of shelling over 40 people were killed. Bombing,shelling is resulting daily in the death of people. Pleasestop this. It will not take you anywhere.

I was recently told at a conference that some of thesecurity officials had with some European ambassadors, whenthe ambassadors had talked about shelling and aerialbombing in some of these areas a very senior army officialis supposed to have said that it cannot be avoided becausethey have got to get rid of the LTTE. Then, one of theambassadors had asked a question, Will you do this if thepeople living in that area was Sinhalese and not Tamils.There was no answer. There was dead silence. Did youbomb when the JVP was carrying on a revolt in severalparts of the country? Did you shell like this? We are makingan appeal to the Government. Kindly do not continuekilling our people in this way.

Recently, there have been killings of a number of people.Three young civilians have been killed in Trincomalee justa few days ago, innocent people. A young boy, Sir, by thename of Jeyarajah Jeyadeepan, 23 years, another boy bythe name of Achchudan Sasitharan, 31 years and another

2007 10203204

boy by the name of Niroshan Patrick, 19 years. One of theseboys was due to go abroad in two days time. There wassome attack on some naval vehicle some distance away.Three young Tamils were picked up at different places. Twopersons at Chelvanayakapuram and one person atAnpuvalipuram. They have been shot and the bodies werethrown on the place where the attack took place. Recently,there was an attack on an agricultural farm in Vavuniya.They went into the agricultural farm school and severalstudents, boys and girls, were shot dead and several wereinjured. This is going on, Sir. This must stop. Our peopleare suffering without food in Vakarai. I am told that thereis not even food for one day. There are almost 14, 000people still living in Vakarai, Kathiraveli area. They haveno food. I have spoken to the President sometimes, andthe President has sometimes said to send food. The lorrieshave been sent back by the army. We have raised the matterin Parliament. We have written to the President. We wouldrequest the Members of the Government who are here toimpress upon the Government that food must goimmediately to Vakarai. As far as Jaffna is concerned,600,000 people are living there. I am told that there isscarcity of food there. The Hon. Premachandran spoke inParliament yesterday about the cost of various food itemsin Jaffna. I believe some food has gone there through sometraders recently. But that is not enough. Please do not usefood as a weapon of war. Please do not use our people foryour convenience; for your military convenience. We donot want to defend the LTTE. That is not part of our duty.You say that the LTTE is using people as a human shield.

( )(Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thero)

Why do you never condemn the LTTE attacks?

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

People have been living in that area for generations andcenturies.

( )(Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thero)Hon. Member, you never condemn the LTTE. Why?[Interruption.]

( )(An Hon. Member)You never condemn the army killing there- [Interruption.]

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

No, please, let the Venerable Priest say what he wantsto say. We do not support any violence. We condemn allviolence.

( )(Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thero)

That is very good.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

We have said that all the time.

( )(Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thero)

We appreciate that.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

But when you go and bomb in Illuppaikadavai and killinnocent people, I am not saying that it must happen. Butyou must be able to understand why it is happening.

( )(Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thero) ?

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

I am not saying that it must happen - [Interruption]

. . ( )(The Hon. H. R. Mithrapala)

Prabhakaran carries arms. Why do you not -[Interruption.]

( )(An Hon. Member)

That is because of you.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

You mean to lay down arms? [Interruption.]

. . ( )(The Hon. H. R. Mithrapala)

You failed to request. You make the same request fromthem. You are frightened. You are in the custody of theLTTE.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Madam, I want to finish my speech. Then at least anotherMember can speak from our party. But I want to kindlysay, I want to make a final appeal to the Government.Kindly do not persist in dishonouring the Indo-LankaAccord. That is an international treaty which we are boundto observe. You are bound under international law to honourthat treaty. Your failing to honour that treaty will haveserious consequences. Please do not violate the fundamentalrights of the Tamil-speaking people. Kindly honour thatobligation. Kindly ensure that the status quo ante in regardto the merged North-East is restored as per the Indo-SriLanka agreement.

Kindly stop starving our people. Kindly stop killing ourpeople, both in the LTTE controlled territory and theGovernment controlled territory. I am making a veryhumble and fervent appeal to you on behalf of our poorcivilians. Our people are suffering. Do not make our peoplecontinue to suffer. We should not do this. I will never bea happy man if the Sinhalese people are suffering in theway in which the Tamils are suffering now. You all do notsuffer. You do not know what suffering is. Please stop thissuffering. Please do not compel our people to suffer anylonger. Please send food both to Vakarai and to Jaffna andplease stop killing our people.

Thank you, Madam.

The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, please. You have only twentyminutes.

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

Madam Presiding Member, at the very outset, I mustrecord my humble protest at the limited time that has beenallotted to us. In fact, I took this matter up with the Hon.Chief Opposition Whip and I was told that we were allot-ted one hours time. This morning, I suddenly discoveredthat we have been given just 20 minutes. On a subject ofthis nature, which is so vital to us, who represent the inter-ests of the Muslims, particularly living in the North-East,a party which has a preponderant mandate of the people,to be given such a paltry time is an absolute injustice,Madam Presiding Member.

Anyway, I would try as much as possible to restrictmyself to half an hour. I am sure the Hon. Members rep-resenting the United National Party would bring this tothe notice of the Chief Opposition Whip and accommo-date us. Added to that, we have this other difficulty: allthe Opposition Members have to go for the funeral of theformer Minister, the Hon. Nissanka Wijeyeratne. There-fore, I believe there would be some extra time availableand I would proceed to use that time.

Leader of the Opposition has also arrived in the House,I must here divert and say a few things in English, MadamChairperson.

The Hon. Prime Minister outlined various options afterthe judgment of the Supreme Court. There are seriouspolitical implications arising out of the issues that have beenraised in Court and certainly we do agree that the Courtonly questioned the procedure relating to the merger. Butthen, the United National Party as a principal oppositionparty is also sometimes attempting to approach this issuelike an ostrich burying its head in the sand. I must veryreluctantly say this having observed their stand before theAll Party Representative Committee a few days ago. I wasvery disappointed when I heard about the submissions madeby the Hon. K.N. Choksy.

213214

[ ]

Unqualified support for the merger is something that theSri Lanka Muslim Congress could never agree to. Therewere certain options mentioned in the Committee A Reportof the Experts Committee of the All Party Conference thatraised a huge furore all over the country. There were variousextremist forces that prevailed on the Government todistance itself with the so-called majority report. The onlyredeeming feature in that majority report was the differentoptions that were proposed. Those options had some issueswhich could be of some relief to beleaguered minorities likethe Muslims and also the Sinhalese in the Eastern Province.But what the United National Party has finally done is tosimply talk about or request the Government to bring aMotion to the House to enable an unconditional merger ofthe North-East. That would never be possible given theintricacies of the problem.

( )( + - )(The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition)Hon. Member, I think, the Hon. Choksy has presented apaper. The UNP will be making its stand known at the nextmeeting. I think the APRC is meeting on the 22nd of January.

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)But the UNP has a duty to clarify -

( +)(The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe)We already are in consultation with all of you and weshould do that. You know our views on that matter. TheUNPs position will be made known at the next meeting.But, under the MoU, we will be having bilateral talks withthe Government on the proposals because the Co-Chairswanted the two main parties to submit but that does notmean it is something exclusive of the two main parties. Wehave to draw on the consensus of the APRC and then wehave to work on it. So I have to meet the President on thisissue and work out the mechanics. The UNPs position, wewill be announcing may be at the next meeting. We didnot have enough time. I was not in the country. I justarrived.

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)Thank you very much.

I am quite relieved that the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghehas mentioned here that they would give a detailedproposition after having discussions with the other minorparties, including the TNA. Here it is of paramountimportance that the Tamil National Alliance has a dialoguewith the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress for us to come to someconsensus on this issue.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)I want to assure my good Friend, Sir, that we are of theview that the Muslim people living in the North-East mustbe satisfied, must find any final formula acceptable to them.We have no reservations in regard to that matter. When Ispoke in the morning today - the Hon. Rauff Hakeem, youwere not here at that time - I emphasized that a particularsignificance is a need to address the Muslim dimension ina permanently merged North-Eastern Province and I said,this dimension is a legitimate aspiration of our Muslimbrethren which I have not the slightest doubt that the Tamilpeople and those representing them including the LTTEfully comprehend and must accept. There is no questionabout it.

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)Thank you very much. Thank you very much for allwhat you said. I am sorry, I was not in the House whenyou mentioned all that.

Then, I would also be permitted to remind the TNA, atleast the party that the Hon. Sampanthan represents in theHouse, that the TULF in its 1977 Election Manifesto veryclearly outlined what the solution should be for theMuslims. It said, within the State of Eelam - which bythen was the battle cry of the TULF - the Muslims living inthe Eastern Province or Muslims living in the North-Eastwould be entitled for their right to self determination andfor autonomy in their areas. But at least that has to be speltout quite openly. This is what you told the people and gotthe mandate in 1977. Not only that, the TULF Constitutioncarried the same provision as part and parcel of theConstitution itself. That being the case -

None of the Hon. Ministers are in this House unfortu-nately for an important Debate of this nature. I would liketo request the Hon. Members present here - the Hon. DullasAlahapperuma, quite a strong person in the Government -

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

He is much stronger than a Minister.

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

He is seated in the back benches of this House. He ismuch more powerful than a Minister, I believe.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

He is the deputy President.

( [ )(The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

Let it be so. Let us introduce the post of a deputyPresident. You do not have to give it to the minorities. Youcan appoint another Sinhalese and if it is to be Mr. DullasAlahapperuma, we would always welcome him. He is afriend of the minorities and he thinks very lucidly aboutwhat these problems are. In fact he and I have been toNorthern Ireland studying the ethnic issue there several yearsago when we were on the Government side and I wouldlike to appeal through him to the Government to providesome security to the chairmen and vice chairmen of thelocal authorities in the North-Eastern Province. The SriLanka Muslim Congress governs about eleven PradeshiyaSabhas and local authorities. Particularly the Chairman ofthe Kattankudy Urban Council has made a request forsecurity. In fact there is a serious situation there and I wouldlike the Hon. Dullas Alahapperuma to bring this to thenotice of the Government. I would like to *table therequest made by the Chairman of the Kattankudy UrbanCouncil, Mr. U.L.M.N Mubeen. It has been sent to theInspector-General of Police. Kindly look into this requestand provide adequate security, particularly because of theprecarious security situation that prevails currently in theEastern Province.

Thank you very much Madam, Chairperson.

( )(The Hon. Felix Perera)Yes.

( )(The Hon. Suresh Premachandran)You have been preaching and advising the TNA very much.But I am asking you, why can you not ask the President andthe Government to stop this aerial bombardment? Why canyou not ask the President to open the A-9 road and allow thefood to reach the people who are in the North and the East?Then, see whether the talks can be started or not. I promiseyou that once you stop the killing and allow the food toreach those areas, definitely that will be a way to start thetalks - [Interruption.]

( )(An Hon. Member)Who has to do it first?

( )(The Hon. Felix Perera)First, of all, something has to be done on your part, not onour part.

( )(An Hon. Member)First, you ask the LTTE not to do it.

( )(The Hon. Felix Perera) . , . . . ? [ ] . ?

( )(The Hon. Suresh Premachandran)Hon. Minister, yesterday when I was speaking - I think,you were not here at that time - I explained very clearly whatthe situation in the North is, especially in Jaffna. The Hon.Prime Minister was here at that time.

The schools have started. But, so far they have not sentthe text books. There are no exercise books, pens, pencils noteven food. Food is still in short supply there. Childrens milkfood and other goods are still in short supply. I explainedeverything yesterday. Unfortunately, you were not here.Actually, those goods are not adequate. In Vakarai, leavealone the LTTE, there are more than 14,000 civilians whohave been living there without food from 20th Novemberonwards.

You are a responsible Government. You were elected bythe people. You have to be answerable. You are talking abouta liberation movement or guerrilla organization. But, youare an elected Government. You have a responsibility. Doyou think the people of Vakarai belong to some othercountry? No, they also belong to Sri Lanka. Therefore, inthat situation, you have a duty to feed them. Is it not so?

( )(The Hon. Felix Perera)Yes, Please, sit down, . . , . . , , , . . . , . . , . .

We were elected, weare in the democratic process. But, you are not willing totalk to us. That is the pathetic situation in this House, Sir.
