Thefact of the matter is that you have never been able to comeup with a solution. What happened when the Hon. RanilWickremasinghe tried in 2002 and 2003?

Even recently in Illuppaikadavai in Mannarinnocent Tamil civilians have been killed as a result of theaerial bombings. I have got the list of persons who havebeen killed. Sixteen persons in all and amongst them, achild of one and a half years, children of four, five andten years and old people of 63 years, 59 years are there.There are several injured persons including men, womenand children. Thirty six persons have been injured and havebeen taken to hospital as a result of the aerial bombings.Even the UN has referred to it. We know what happened atVakarai, Kathiraveli as a result of the heavy shelling on the9th and 10th of December when on each one of those daysover 20 people were killed. And we know what happenedin the previous month, on the 8th of November, when as aresult of shelling over 40 people were killed. Bombing,shelling is resulting daily in the death of people.

The lorrieshave been sent back by the army. We have raised the matterin Parliament. We have written to the President. We wouldrequest the Members of the Government who are here toimpress upon the Government that food must goimmediately to Vakarai. As far as Jaffna is concerned,600,000 people are living there. I am told that there isscarcity of food there. The Hon. Premachandran spoke inParliament yesterday about the cost of various food itemsin Jaffna.

In fact he and I have been toNorthern Ireland studying the ethnic issue there several yearsago when we were on the Government side and I wouldlike to appeal through him to the Government to providesome security to the chairmen and vice chairmen of thelocal authorities in the North-Eastern Province. The SriLanka Muslim Congress governs about eleven PradeshiyaSabhas and local authorities. Particularly the Chairman ofthe Kattankudy Urban Council has made a request forsecurity. In fact there is a serious situation there and I wouldlike the Hon. Dullas Alahapperuma to bring this to thenotice of the Government. I would like to *table therequest made by the Chairman of the Kattankudy UrbanCouncil, Mr. U.L.M.N Mubeen. It has been sent to theInspector-General of Police.
