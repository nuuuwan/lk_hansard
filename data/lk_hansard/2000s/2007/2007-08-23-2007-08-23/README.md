Also, there may be errors and omissions in figures and it is recommended to refer Central Bank publications for any clarifications. The bidders are requested to do their own due diligence before submitting the proposals.

Government taking pro - active approach to increasing flexibility of the expenditure Base The removal of the fuel subsidies has significantly altered the expenditure base in the country Removal of fuel subsidies Total payment of fuel subsidies declined over the years : Rs. 9.4bn in 2006 (up to June), Rs. 26bn in 2005 and Rs. 18.5bn in 2005 The government revised domestic fuel prices in 2006 and 2007 and will continue to adjust based on international prices The Provision of fuel subsidies discontinued and oil companies were allowed to determine petroleum prices based on the international price from July 2006 CPC hedged its oil purchases for the first time in early 2007 with the view of maintaining stable retail prices Other expenditure trends are also positive Wage increases in 2006 reflect increasing administrative capacity of the government, such as in the Inland Revenue Department, which has almost tripled its staff, and BOI, which bodes well for future revenue collection and administrative effectiveness Higher interest payments reflect higher interest rates domestically and globally

2007 23 1765 1766

Inflation increased as a result of removal of subsidies in a strong domestic demand environment Inflation 91 - day T - Bill rate & Fed fund rate

The monetary policy in 2006 was focused on containing inflationary pressures while facilitating the continued growth momentum of

the economy Inflationary pressures emanating from removal of subsidies on fuels, increased domestic demand and international prices of some imported items required a further tightening of the monetary policy Key policy rates were raised 4 times in 2006 and once in 2007 accompanied by aggressive open market operations Meanwhile, the Central Bank also continued its efforts to strengthen monetary policy transmission by communicating monetary policy

and improving the efficiency of the financial system March and June 2007 Reserve Money targets were met. The Central Bank is strongly committed to maintain all targets from the Road-

map for Monetary & Financial Policies.

( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha)

Madam Presiding Member, on behalf of my party, the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi, I am happy to participate in this Debate that is in progress. From the Government ranks there is a pious proclamation that this Bill is being piloted through Parliament with the noble purpose of upholding the rule of law. At the very outset, I am rather constrained to state that this pious proclamation on the part of the Government does not carry any conviction with us, given the fact that what is obtaining in this country is, in fact, an unfortunate situation wherein we find serious crimes including murder, rape, abduction and robbery being committed all over the country and more particularly in the war-torn North-East. Before dealing with that aspect of the matter, I would like to make a few comments on behalf of my party in relation to this Bill and more particularly to certain provisions therein. Madam Presiding Member, I find that there are certain strange provisions that are being repeatedly sought to be placed in this Bill, which had been in force till May this year for a period of two years. It is very unfortunate that the Government has slept over the matter without knowing the fact that the period of operation had lapsed at the end of May this year and it has taken almost two and a half months for the Government to pilot this Bill through Parliament with retrospective effect so as to clothe with legality all that has taken place under this Bill since the end of May this year so that they would be legal in the eyes of the law. Anyway, I have no quarrel over that given the fact that the Government has been preoccupied with various other matters and I do appreciate that; I do understand that. In relation to the provisions of this Bill, there are two or three matters I think I am duty-bound, not only as a Member of the Opposition, but also as a member of the legal profession, which is supposed to be a noble profession in this country too, to submit for the consideration of this august Assembly. I find as in the case with the earlier Act with the same caption that the accused, under this Bill, is not given or rather denied the right to cross-examine any witness presented by the prosecution at the preliminary inquiry. Even the Magistrate before whom the inquiry is to be held does not have the power to do so or does not have the power to give an opportunity to the accused or to his pleader, as the case may be, to cross-examine the witness concerned unless, of course, the prosecution agrees to place the witness concerned in the hands of the pleader or the accused, as the case may be, for cross-examination. At the same time, Madam Chair, I find that this particular provision has no extension of applicability in relation to the accused or a witness or witnesses, as the case may be, who could be presented to give evidence on behalf of the

accused in an inquiry of this nature. The Bill is silent, strangely silent on this matter while it is quite categorical in its assertion that no cross-examination of any witness for the prosecution is permissible, unless of course, the prosecution is willing to place the witness concerned for cross-examination. The Bill is very strangely silent on this matter though it makes provision for the accused and also for any witness on his behalf to give evidence. So, one has to presume that in the event of the accused choosing to give evidence on his own behalf and also in the event of his leading evidence through his own witnesses, the accused or the witnesses, as the case may be, would be cross-examined by the prosecution. This goes against the very basis of justice, Madam Chair, because the law and furthermore, our Constitution say - I do not think anyone would quarrel with me over that - that every citizen is equal before the law and he is entitled to equal protection of the law. While thinking of the purpose of this Bill sought to be presented by the Government - in that, there have been repeated assertions by very many eminent Members of the Government, some of whom are also members of my own profession, that it has been brought in for the purpose of speedy investigation and also for a speedy inquiry of cases at the magisterial level so that there would be a speedy process in relation to criminal offences, major, serious and grave criminal offences, and the culprits concerned could be brought to book without any undue delay - I find, Madam Chair, that some of the provisions need a rethinking, a rethinking that instead of clothing the prosecution with the authority to submit or not to submit its own witness for cross-examination by the accused or his pleader, I think discretion should be given, if at all for justice to be maintained, for the Magistrate concerned to decide on the whole question of whether a witness for the prosecution should be submitted for the cross-examination on behalf of the accused. At the same time, I think a rethinking is needed, a reformulation is needed in relation to the provision of the accused being given an opportunity to testify on his own behalf and also in exercising his own right to lead evidence on his own behalf. There is a great danger in that. While the prosecution can withhold its own witnesses from being cross-examined on behalf of the accused, it can always cross-examine not only the witness for the defence, but also the accused himself or herself, as the case may be, in the event of the accused choosing to lead evidence through his or her witnesses and also choosing to depose on his own behalf. This is a matter I believe, and I do hope would attract the attention of this august Assembly so that the necessary amendments could be made. Madam, though we have had this for the last two years, I find the police statements that are generally recorded throughout the country are in the Sinhala language. And, given the fact that the Police Department lacks the necessary personnel who are competent in the other national language or rather the other official language of this country, namely, the Tamil language, my

1839 1840

own language, that in the event of a person making a statement in Tamil, it could not be recorded in Tamil. We find all the statements regarding the investigations generally and unavoidably are recorded in the Sinhala language. When one makes a statement in Tamil and when it is being recorded in Sinhala, naturally and obviously and automatically and inevitably there would be discrepancies. When this statement is read out, and when it is being read out in the Sinhala language, for instance in a court of law either in the North or in the East - now we are rather compelled to talk not about the North-East, but the North or the East. I will come to that later at an appropriate time - the witness concerned, with the interpretation available in the Tamil language and given the fact that we do not have adequate competent interpreters to interpret something from Sinhala to Tamil and from Tamil to Sinhala not only in the North-East, but also in Superior Courts in the rest of the country, there would be practical difficulties. The Police Officer given his inabilities and shortcomings in relation to recording a statement under these circumstances would be, unavoidably, making errors. What is the net outcome? The witness is given an opportunity to make alterations, additions or amendments. In such a scenario, there are bound to be errors; there are bound to be discrepancies in the so-called deposition of the witness concerned when this statement is read out, interpreted and when the witness is being given the opportunity to make alterations or additions or amendments and to be called the deposition recorded before the Magistrate concerned to be forwarded to the Attorney-General for an indictment in this case before the High Court. What would be the net outcome at the trial in the High Court ? This would necessarily have an impact on the outcome of the case. It would necessarily lead to a situation where the culprits concerned would be able to evade the process of law and would be able to get away easily. So, I think, the Members from the Government ranks - I am very happy that the Hon. Anura Bandaranaike is here. Though a non-lawyer I think he is more competent than very many lawyers in this country, in that, if at all he would be making a speech today he would be able to focus some attention on this. This is a serious matter. Given the purpose of the Government piloting this Bill today, this is a very serious matter. On one hand, you are shutting out every opportunity for the accused to cross-examine. On the other hand, the Bill is silent on the issue of cross-examination, the right to cross-examination of the prosecution, of the accused or his witnesses. If one goes by the Bill, I think the prosecution can insist before the magistrate concerned that it has a right to cross-examine either the accused or the witness or both in the event of the accused choosing to call evidence in addition to deposing before the magistrate concerned. This is rather a precarious situation, Madam Chairperson, which I think, I am duty-bound to place before this august Assembly. Now, we find the government ranks repeatedly asserting that this is a must. This is a must in the interest of justice. This is a must in the interest of rule of law. But, what is

happening in this country Madam? What is happening in the North and the East? Has the Government succeeded in arresting even one single person in regard to any one of the murders of civilians that had been perpetrated in the North-East since January 2006? I challenge the Government to mention at least one name of one suspect arrested in relation to even one single case of murder perpetrated in the North-East since January 2006. Government cannot place it. Nobody can place it except for the arrest of certain suspects in relation to robberies perpetrated in the thick of night during curfew hours in Jaffna. That too, after the Hon.Chief Justice gave definite and strict instructions to the Inspector-General of Police to have these culprits arrested, and in consequence of which four or five or six persons were arrested in Jaffna. And thanks to the efforts of the learned Magistrate of Vavuniya, there were arrests by police of certain persons involved in the cases of robberies perpetrated during curfew hours in Vavuniya town a few months ago. There has not been one single case of arrest in relation to major crimes committed while the so-called war was in progress or has been in progress in the North-East since January 2006. This is the state of affairs. Madam, motorcycle-borne murderers are responsible for the continuing cases of the murder of civilians in the Jaffna Peninsula including Jaffna Town. The victims include not only youths but also elderly and even young women returning from their places of work. Obviously, these victims are supposed to have had some links with the national resistance or rather the national renaissance on the part of the Tamil community. That is a different matter altogether. Or, it may be that some of them might have been suspected to have had some links with the LTTE. If anyone has been suspected, arrest him, bring him to book and detain. We have no quarrel with that. Deal with the person concerned in accordance with the law. But what is happening? An open licence is being given in the name of the law, in the name of governance by the powers that be to armed groups that include elitist groups of the Sri Lankan Army in the North- East. They are responsible. Karuna group is responsible. I do not find the Hon. Douglas Devananda here. His EPDP is responsible; PLOTE is responsible; a segment of the ENDLF is responsible; other paramilitary groups are responsible; elitist groups of the armed forces are responsible. Not one single case of arrest, not one single case of investigation, not one single case of preliminary inquiry since January 2006 under the earlier law that has lapsed in May, 2007 for which a new lease of life is sought to be given through this Bill. With this state of affairs, I would like to ask every Member of the Government ranks who has the conscience still active and alive whether they can expect us, the Members of the Tamil National Alliance, to place any faith in the so-called noble purpose that is being trotted out, that is being tossed about by the Government ranks as the primary reason for the piloting of this Bill. On one hand you say crime is on the increase. You say there are cases of abduction, there are cases of rape, there are cases of abductions for ransom, murders, so on and so forth.

On the other hand, the Government has given a free licence for dirty, dastardly, cowardly, cruel and crude elements in the North-East, some of whom do not know even their own initials, to parade with the arms given by the Government. With the arms given at the cost of public money, innocent civilians, innocent Tamil civilians are being done to death with impunity. Madam, I am very sorry to state that with the bleeding heart I am compelled to participate in this Debate. If I do not state these matters to be placed on record, I am afraid that I would be failing in my duty. We are with you. We are with you for the implementation of the law, if you are sincere and serious about it. What is Karuna group doing? Whose arms are they weilding? The Government says, some Members from the Government ranks are being repeatedly asserting at press interviews as well as from public platforms that the LTTE is roaming about with weapons that as long as the LTTE is there with weapons, they cannot disarm the Karuna group. I am at a loss to understand that. This is an irrational, illogical and inexcusable explanation that has been trotted out, Madam. You are fighting the LTTE. The LTTE is the other side to the military conflict, that is the offshoot of the political question of this country. That is a different proposition. That is a different scenario. That is a different story altogether. But in the Government controlled areas in the East, when you allow an armed group or groups to roam about with weapons in the name of aiding the armed forces in upholding the rule of law, what is the meaning of it, Madam, I am compelled to ask. Going by the same argument, can anybody tomorrow form his own armed group, an underworld group and come forward to assist the armed forces so that they could be permitted to roam about, kill, maim, rape, rob and abduct? I am forced to ask this question. When one talks, he has to talk with some sense, he has to talk with logic and he has to talk with conviction. I find, repeatedly there are assertions from the Government to the effect that Karuna group cannot be disarmed. I ask them, is it not against the law? Under what law Karuna group is being permitted to keep about 30 youths in their camp in Tirukovil using weapons given by the Government? I am asking, Madam. What has the Government done in relation to the investigation pertaining to the cold-blooded murder of 18 aid workers attached to the French NGO in Mutur in August last year? What has the Government done? Has one single suspect been arrested?

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! Hon. Member, you have one minute more. .

( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) Thank you Madam. What has the Government done? What is the purpose of keeping an investigative machinery in this country? People are being arrested for

keeping a packet of Ganja or pickpocketing somebody in the bus or abusing his or her neighbour or taking away another mans wife with her own jewellery. They are being arrested. They are being paraded before courts, remanded and if there are serious allegations, I have no reluctance to say that they would be brought under this Bill which would soon become a law.

But at the same time, armed groups who have no qualms of conscience, no rules of behaviour, no understanding of decency, who know nothing about democracy are being given an open licence to do everything is against the rule of law. As a lawyer I am asking, as a citizen of this country I am asking, as one who believes in the good nature of men and women I am forced to ask, are you not cheating yourself? Is it not duplicity? What the hell are you doing when this man Karuna is doing all these things? What the hell this Government is doing when murder, robbery, rape, abduction are being perpetrated in the North-East with impunity? Do I have got to prove your credentials? No point in bringing this law with pious pontifications. Whom are you trying to cheat? Are we puppets or are we duds to remain silent spectators when all these grave crimes are being perpetrated? I am asking you as one who loves the law, who believes in the rule of law and who abides by the law. You have to prove.

Fight the LTTE if you want because I know the LTTE is also capable of fighting as long as there is fighting. We can wait and see provided that fighting ends during our lifetime. We can wait and see. We have seen it for the last 22 years. Not that I am for the fighting. I want fighting to be stopped and peace to prevail through a political solution. I still believe in that though I find intransigence, inexcusable intransigence in relation to this obscene, obsession that goes along with the commitment to a unitary state. Anyway, I will deal with that on another occasion. There are people in this country, there are Members in this House who want the fighting to go on. They want to live on the blood of innocent Tamils, Sinhalese, Muslims and others so that one day they can come to power and I think sensible Members would know whom I mean. They want this Government to fight on. They want the next government to fight on, provided they are not a part of it. They want the next, next, next government to fight on so that this country will become bankrupt, be bleeding to the maximum and one day they can come to power. I would tell them, Madam, to use this opportunity. If at all they are

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! Hon. Member -

( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) I am winding up in a minute. If at all they are coming to power, they will be coming to power in a divided Sri Lanka, only in the Southern Sri Lanka, not in the Sri Lanka that is still intact territorially and constitutionally.

So, Madam Chairperson, I thank you for the opportunity that is afforded to me. I think, sensible Members, cultured Members, all of us are supposed to be cultured and sensible, but anyway I am compelled to appeal to sensible and cultured Members, to consider these matters so that one day sanity would prevail and people would be in a position to reap the benefits of this type of law. I thank you, Madam.

Please, give me just one second. Sir, the Human Rights Watch Report on Sri Lanka states, I quote: "Mr. Iqbal Athas, Consultant Editor and Defence Correspondent of "The Sunday Times", a long-standing journalist has been responsible for several exposures of corruption in the Defence Establishment. "" . ; . It further states, I quote: "As a result of some of his exposures in regard to the Sri Lanka Air Force his house was forcibly entered into and he was criminally intimidated with bodily harm. Two Air Force personnel who were involved in this incident were convicted and sentenced. The case is now in appeal. As a result of this incident, President Kumaratunga provided personal security for Mr. Athas. Then again in August, 2006 Mr. Athas wrote critically on certain matters concerned with the Sri Lanka Army. No sooner did this article appear, orders were given for the withdrawal of his security, which order was later countermanded on a request of the Chairman, Wijeya Newspapers Limited. In the week immediately following his revelations regarding the MiG -27 deal in "The Sunday Times" on 12th August, 2007, Mr. Athass personal security was completely withdrawn without any reasons on the instructions of the Secretary, Defence. Then on the night of 18th August,.. That is, this year. .the static police guard placed at his residence was withdrawn resulting in Mr. Athas and his family having to find shelter elsewhere. He had been warned by his own sources of a possible intrusion by armed persons later that night under the guise of a search of his premises. Such occurrences have taken place at least on two earlier occasions." , " 27" . 25 planes. , 25 '' ? 25 . , 25 ?
