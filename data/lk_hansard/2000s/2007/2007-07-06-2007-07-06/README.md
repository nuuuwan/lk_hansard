Minister, I hope you would not mind if I ask a pertinent Question because I know that you are trying to make a valiant effort to clean up the place. You have gone on the basis of trying to ensure that everybody, before they go overseas, register themselves at the Foreign Employment Bureau. I presume that it is correct, but on the second score it has been said that it can be decentralized. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) It is completely decentralized. We have already set up 24 centres and I intend increasing the number of centres to ease out the rush. Everyday there are about 500-600 people and sometimes it goes up to about a thousand. So,

[ ]

2469 2470

there will be a such and there will be certain practical problems that they will encounter. To avoid that we hope to increase the number of centres and decentralize it. The fact of the matter is that some of these people who are sent by the agents are not subject to proper medical checks. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Minister, on the same score when this was publicized, there were certain people in Avissawella and Padukka who were acting like subagents and used to collect money. Now that was not the intention of your Ministry. There were some people who have taken the law unto themselves and said, We are the agents of the Foreign Employment Bureau, we can sign on their behalf, and have collected Rs. 5000 per person. I did not bring it to your attention at that moment because I thought it was just a teething problem. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) It is a multi-purpose intention.The fact of the matter is that sometimes people who have no limbs are given medical reports. Instead of Sumanawathie, Karunawathie goes for the medical test and once they go over there, they are faced with many problems. Therefore you need to have some control over them. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) There are other subagents and pimps in the process who collect monies for and on behalf of the Foreign Employment Bureau. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) It is full of pimps and subagents. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It is better to have an extensive information campaign because you are collecting quite a lot of money and the services that you intend giving these people should also be highlighted. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) In fact we are preparing a comprehensive policy paper on this which will be presented to the Cabinet next week. Once it is presented to the Cabinet I will make a cope available to all of you.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Please ensure that is done.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella)

It is a very comprehensive policy paper on this subject.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

One other thing is please do not put the collection of all these monies into Mihin Air. Now EPF, ETF, Lankaputhra-

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella)

I will give you one assurance. It is under consideration. I am not leaving out any business opportunities that can take place. But the fact of the matter is that it will be scrutinized to the extent that we will have about two or three consultants ; we will have some reports only on that basis. I underscore that, if at all we consider it.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Ensure that is done, and nobody forces you into that.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella)

Nobody can force me, I can assure you that.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Hon. Speaker, give me one minute. - [Interruption.] Give me one minute. In the 1960s, in England, John Profumo was the War Minister. He deliberately misled the House. There was an allegation that he had an affair with a certain woman. He made a statement in Parliament saying, I have no affair. In the following week it was disclosed in the newspapers that he had misled the House and the House of Commons Journal 62 and 63 clearly state that when a Member of Parliament misleads the House, it is contempt of Parliament - [Interruption.] . . , . He is the Fourth Defendant - [Interruption.] He is the Fourth Defendant. . , " ". ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . . ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, I am not going to talk anything about the statement that he has made. That is a different matter. But, he has told an untruth to Parliament on a specific question raised by you as the Speaker and myself. He said that he has nothing to do with this case - ( ) (Mr. Speaker) - [ ] ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) - and he is not a respondent. - [Interruption.] No, no. Sir, please listen to me. - [Interruption.] You should read the script. He has specifically said that. I mean, we are not worried about the statement. The issue is that he has told an untruth to Parliament. He has misled the Parliament. [Interruption.] He is even trying to mislead the Supreme Court. Now, Sir, I will show you the relevant areas to prove that he is the Fourth Respondent. We are not going to debate on the merits and demerits of the case. That is where the Standing Orders prohibit. Here, to prove that he is the Fourth Respondent, I will just refer to some of the statements that appear in the judgment, Sir.

2493 2494

It states, I quote: ..the 4th Respondent, being a Minister of Nation Building, appointed by His Excellency the President, ... [Interruption.] By none other than the President. ... has resulted in a serious disruption of the economic activity in the area affecting over 35,000 persons with serious implications on the economy of the country, we direct the Registrar to send a copy of this order and of the papers filed to the Secretary to His Excellency the President... This is not something which pertains to the Court House only. Then, Sir, it further states, I quote: The interim order in terms of prayer (e) against the 4th Respondent carries with it the implication that any action on his part which tantamounts to a disruption of the action taken by the authorities in terms of the orders made underparagraphs (c), (d), (f) and (g) would be specifically dealt with by Court as being in Contempt of the Authority of the Court. ( ) (An Hon. Member) There you are! ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) It is very specifically mentioned that if he continues to disrupt the Sugar Company, he will be dealt with severely. - [Interruption.] Sir, under such a situation he, very well knowing that the Supreme Court, the Chief Justice has reprimanded him for unauthorized illegal activity, disrupting the country, disrupting the economy - ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) No - [Interruption.] All this is not necessary if he had admitted - [Interruption.] If he had only admitted that he is the Fourth Respondent this Debate would not have been necessary. - [Interruption.] ( ) (Mr. Speaker) ,-

PREVENTION OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE PRIME MINISTER FROM HOLDING CABINET PORTFOLIOS [. . 11.00]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I move, That this Parliament is of the opinion that the President and the Prime Minister be prevented from holding any Cabinet portfolio in order to have a very effective administration and to critically review performances of their Ministers. Madam Chairperson, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to present a Private Members Motion which I think is very opportune and also timely. As you know, I am a Member who tries my very best to instil discipline and positive ideas into the people of this country. Looking at the annals of history of many countries, I believe that we have many things to learn from countries that have developed so rapidly as well as get empirical evidence of countries that have been more poorer than Sri Lanka when we gained Independence and are better off today. So, at the very outset I would like to state that I presented this Motion not with any political malice because I am taking the entire system from day one itself. As you would see, I have been presenting Private Members' Motions for the last seven years and I am happy they have come to fruition today.

If we look at the Sri Lankan contemporary politics in the recent past - I look at it from 1978 when the Executive Presidency replaced the non-Executive Presidential system - we find that the President and the Prime Minister have become two very important and specific persons. We believe it has its merits and demerits. His Excellency J. R. Jayewardene was the first President under the Executive Presidential system. When he was the President the Hon. R. Premadasa was the Prime Minister. Thereafter, His Excellency R. Premadasa became the President and the Hon. D. B. Wijetunga was the Prime Minister. Then, His Excellency D. B. Wijetunga became the President and the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe was the Prime Minister. Next, Her Excellency Mrs. Chandrika Kumaratunga became the President with the Hon. Mrs. Sirima Bandaranaike and then the Hon Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka being Prime Ministers. Thereafter, there was a change in the system where Her Excellency Mrs. Chandrika Kumaratunga was the President and the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe was the Prime Minister. Again, Her Excellency Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike became the President with the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister. Subsequently, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa became the President with the Hon. Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka as the Prime Minister. All these were executive office-holders. I am only referring to the President and the Prime Minister because the Motion states that persons who hold such high, dignified offices should not be holding Cabinet portfolios. They should be well above the rest and have an overview from the top.

Hon. Prime Ministers role is to give support to Parliament and to His Excellency the President to carry out this. You are an arbitrator. You have to be a facilitator to the others. - - . , ensure that you look into this matter. Look at todays circumstances. Okay, let us look at the situation from 1994 to-date. Has there been a progress? No. There is degradation. . , there has never been a situation where such a lot of disaster has taken place in such a short period of time by such few people. , , . . , . . . . . . 108. 65 . ? . , ; . , . . . . . , " , 12 , " . , , . , . . , . . . ? . . , . , . , , "

Therefore, we appeal to the Indian Government that in its enlightened self-interest it must reshape its foreign policy. Yes, in its enlightened self-interest, India must rethink, reshape and reorient its foreign policy towards the Tamils. But if India refuses to learn from its past, what can we do? There is an umbilical cord between Eelam Tamils and India. Culturally and linguistically, we are all one. The Indian policy of appeasement, the Indian policy of magnanimity has been interpreted by our Sri Lankan friends, our Sinhala friends, as a sign of weakness. India should not fall prey to the Sri Lankan thinking. We know that India would do the right thing at the right place. But they did blunder in 1987. The "Indian Peace Keeping Force" became a "People Killing Force". Thousands of Tamils were killed; our Tamil leaders like Kumarappa, Kulendran and 15 others were killed. They changed the history much to our dislike. Now I am going to deal with an issue that has been rightly raised - I use the word "rightly" - yesterday by our UNP Comrade Lakshman Senewiratne. Today's "Daily Mirror" reports what he raised as "UNP says VIPs behind abductions". Abductions are not the only subject. That subject itself is serious, but the money that was obtained by abductions is being deposited in the Caribbean Bank. . , , . , - - , . , ! .. - , , ? . . , . . . , - .

The Northern and the Eastern Provinces are the historic habitation of the Tamils and we will have them. We are not asking for anything that was not there. What we had, what we lost, we will regain and reassert. None on this earth can prevent it! This is the month of July, a month of revolution. Thank you.

The Sri Lankan Government has now accelerated its oppression against the education and academic sector of the Tamil society. Mass arrests and abductions of students and academic staff, distribution of death notices, intrusions into the campus premises and assassination of intellectuals including the Vice-Chancellor of the Batticaloa University are taking place on a daily basis. The culture of learning has been replaced by a climate of fear and a sense of utter hopelessness in the academic community. Freedom of speech is non-existent. Innocent Tamils are kept under siege by the military and are virtual prisoners in their own land. State-orchestrated terror and violence, indiscriminate heavy artillery shellings and aerial bombings are daily occurrences in the North and the East of Sri Lanka. Military occupation of Tamil business and residential areas is widespread. Continuous search operations, mass murder, arbitrary arrests, detention, torture, rape and disappearances have become the order of the day. That is why I have been repeatedly saying that the army occupying the Northern and the Eastern Provinces is an army of occupation and an army of aggression. Unless it quits, please do not speak of peace. On 22nd February, 2002, our dearest leader, the uncrowned king of the Eelam Tamils, Velupillai Prabhakaran, entered into an agreement with the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe. It was a historic event. Five years have rolled on and nothing

2545 2546

meaningful has been done. It is virtually a dead letter. I told the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, You have performed a historic act, but you look helpless when it comes to its implementation. This is where we are. So, what is the hope? Can we have any hope in these matters? There is extreme human suffering, an economic embargo, a ban on medicine, stoppage of food supplies to refugees, no freedom of movement for Tamil civilians and closure of main highways. None of us can get back to where we were from last August; 12 months have rolled on. What do you think of peace? What do you think of amity? What do you think of fair play? Where is it? It is a mere theoretical play. Media censorship is keeping human rights transgressions, State-aided murders, kidnappings and rapes away from the international radar. This is where we are. Mr. Sunanda Deshapriya, in his lovely interview published in the "Daily Mirror" says that the military and the Government are guilty.
