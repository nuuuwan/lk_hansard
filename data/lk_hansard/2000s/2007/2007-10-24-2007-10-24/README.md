PARLIAMENTARY QUESTION ON AGREEMENTS SIGNED WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES Agreements under the purview of the Ministry of Export Development & International Trade as of January 2006 Sri Lanka - Israel Agreement on Trade and Economic Co - operation An Agreement on Trade and Economic Co-operation was signed be-tween Sri Lanka and Israel in April 2007, with a view to expanding and enhancing the bilateral trade and economic co-operation between the two countries. The Agreement focuses on promoting, expanding and strengthening bilateral trade and economic co-operation through the establishment of a Joint Committee, which aims to: identify and resolve problems pertain-ing to the application the Agreement ; identify new areas of mutual inter-ests ; making appropriate recommendations aimed at further promotion of trade and economic co-operation. In addition, the Agreement envis-ages encouraging and enhancing facilitation of trade fairs, exhibitions and conferences between the two countries. The enhancement of relations with Israel is beneficial in the light of its enhanced participation in FTAs with several important trading partners such as the US, Canada, and the EU, as well as Turkey and Mexico. This Agreement is therefore of strategic significance to Sri Lanka, which may consider this Agreement as a launching pad for similar agreements with the above - mentioned key markets. Further, the Agreement will help to strengthen already significant trade relations between the two countries. Total trade turnover between the two

countries has remained at an average level of US$85.058 million for the past five years, and exports increased from US$28.9 million in 2004 to US$42.4 million in 2005. Sri Lankas key exports diamonds, ready - made garments, tea, woven garments and rubber gloves, with Israel being Sri Lankas 10th largest importer for ready made garments, and 4th largest importer of diamonds. There are also prospects for other products such as footwear, coconut products, rubber tyres, spices, fruits and vegetables and plastic articles. In addition, the Agreement provides opportunities to encourage Israeli investment in key sectors of gems and jewellery, electrical and elec-tronic ventures, pharmaceutical products, agricultural machinery, plastic and leather products, iron and steel products, garments,automobile and heavy machinery industries, as well as technology transfer in the devel-opment of Sri Lankas agriculture. Sri Lanka - Jordan Trade Agreement Sri Lanka signed a trade agreement with Jordan in May 2007, replacing an earlier agreement which had been signed in 1965. The objectives of this Agreement are the promotion, expansion, development and diversi-fication of trade relations and promotion of economic, trade and invest-ment co-operation between Jordan and Sri Lanka. In particular, the Agreement seeks to promote business contracts be-tween enterprises and organizations of Sri Lanka and Jordan and ex-change of economic information and the establishment of joint ventures, commercial centers and other ways of economic co-operation. It also provides for the facilitation of business delegation visits, trade fairs and

exhibitions, and the movement of goods intended for such trade exhibi-tions. The implementation of this Agreement is expected to be through a Joint Committee at official level, which will review and further the implementation of the Agreement ; explore possibilities of promoting and diversifying trade, investment and economic relations, including industrial and services co-operation, identify new areas for such co-operation ; to consult and negotiate on any issues arising either in the course of development of trade relations between the two countries, or from the implementation of the Agreement Implementation of the Agreement would result in the expansion of the existing levels of bilateral trade, economic and investment co-operation between Sri Lanka and Jordan. The Agreement can lead to diversifica-tion of trade relations, which at present is dominated in both countries by one product. There are a number of areas in which Sri Lanka has poten-tial to develop its exports, including jewellery, tobacco products and plastic and rubber products. In addition, both countries have similar areas of interest for investment and development, including the textile and apparel sectors, the IT sector, the pharmaceutical sector and the tourism sector (with special focus on cultural and archaeological tourism). This Agreement would allow the countries to explore mutually beneficial ventures for the joint develop-ment of the above sectors. The Agreement will also help further develop bilateral economic rela-tions between the two countries, which would contribute to any future advances under the G - 11 grouping of countries. Jordan is a member of several regional agreements with a number of important countries in the Middle East. It is a member of the Greater Arab Free Trade Agreement (GAFTA) and the Agreement for the Establishment of a Free Trade Zone between the Arabic Mediterranean Nations(AGADIR Agreement.) It also has entered into a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Singapore, a Jordan - Euro Association Agreement, and an FTA and a Bilateral In-vestment Treaty with the U.S. In view of Jordans involvement in such Agreements with several important countries, Sri Lanka entering into a Trade Agreement with Jordan will be of Strategic significance to Sri Lanka, and it could be considered as a first step to an FTA between the two countries in the future. The Agreement will also help to further strengthen already solid trade relations. The total trade turnover between the two countries has been steadily increasing over the past five years. With total turnover in 2005 being US$ 42.74 million, as compared to US$21.21 million in 2000. 1. Cultural Exchange Programme between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Government of Pakistan for the year 20072011 The above Programme was signed on 31st March 2007 in Islama-bad, in pursuance of the Cultural Agreement signed on 10th De-cember 1973 between the two countries.

The agreement provides for collaboration in a number of areas including culture, archae-ology and archives, sports, youth affairs, education, information and media development.

COMMITTEE ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF PARLIAMENTRIANS

Geneva, 11 June 2007 Dear Dr. Jayawardena, In the absence of the Secretary General, currently on mission abroad, and on behalf of the Committee on the Human Rights of Parliamentarians, I wish to inform you of the outcome of the Committees last session, held during the 116th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Nusa Dua (Bali, Indonesia)- Before doing so, I would like to reiterate that the Committee was very glad to have had the opportunity of meeting you again during the session. On its behalf, I wish to thank you again for the information you provided.

As you know, at its 116th session (January 2007), the Committee decided to merge you case with that of the parliamentarian of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) who have also been the target of death threats and other harassment. At its session in Nusa Dua, the Committee decided to make this case public and consequently submitted a draft resolution for adoption to the Governing Council. Please find enclosed the relevant resolution, which was adopted unanimously.

You will also find attached the resolutions which the Governing Council adopted on the cases of Mr. Pararajasingham, Mr. Raviraj and Mr. Dissanayake as well as the confidential decisions on the cases of Mr. Badar and Mr. Cader.

The Honourable Doctor Jayalath Jayawardena Member of Parliament No. 555 Wewala Church Road Weligampitiya, Ja-ela Colombo Sri Lanka

1541 1542

As regards Mr. Johnstan Fernando, the Committee requested the Secretary General to institute the preliminary investigation and to seek the views of the authorities on his situation. However, for the Committee to proceed it is necessary that a formal witten complaint be addressed to the Committee, preferably by Mr. Johnston himself. I would be grateful if you could inform him accordingly. The Committees next session will be held from 16 to 19 July 2007 at IPU Headquarters in Geneva. We would be grateful if you could ensure that any new information or observation you may wish to bring to the Committees attention reaches our office before the session. Yours sincerely, Ingeborg Schwarz Secretary Committee on the Human Rights of Parliamentarians

There are very serious lapses in these foru revenue departments and we cannot allow them to continue. Therefore, it is my duty to submit a report on the four revenue departments mentioned in the Special Report that has been submitted by the Auditor-General. We have been having several sitting but the only difficulty is that the verbatim reports of the sittings are getting delayed because the Hansard Department appears to be giving us some step-motherly treatment. Only the reports of the Debates in the House are given priority. But the reports of the PAC have been very much delayed. In fact, I have been telling this to every Hansard Reporter who comes to the Committee. I know their difficulties. I know they are having time constraints. We understand all that. But I would appreciate if the Editor of Hansard would expedite this arrangement and give us the verbatim reports early so that I can finalize my report within next two weeks.

Mr. Speaker, the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara is also a very active Member of my Committee. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

In fact, in regard to these particular four revenue departments, on every sitting I think he has, as much as possible, participated and he knows what has been going on. He would bear witness. I am sure even the Hon. Wasantha Samarasinghe and others will bear witness. I have not shirked my duty. I have been very tough with these officials. I have taken whatever action possible. In fact, there were certain very difficult situations that were arising with the Secretary to the Treasury. We did not want the Secretary to the Treasury to come and get into unnecessary arguments with the Members. Thereafter, we got him to send the Deputy Secretary to the Treasury and in fact last time, I told the Deputy Secretary to the Treasury very clearly what action needs to be taken as a Department Head for failure to hold an internal inquiry. It is a very serious matter. The Committee was misled in my opinion, by the Chief Accounting Officer saying that the Attorney-General had informed him that there is no need to hold an internal inquiry while the CID is conducting its inquiry. We completely disagreed with that. We will find fault with the officers concerned for what has happened. But, in the meantime I do not think anybody can bring back the lost files; definitely an internal inquiry has to begin fast. But then, I will have to give him all the reasons for the lapses that have taken place. I am going to mention that in my report and also, if I can have the verbatim reports before that, I could state all the reasons and then write to the officials concerned and inform the President also, as the Minister in charge of the subject that immediate action must be taken. This is a massive fraud, the proportion of which is mind-boggling. Therefore, I take my hat off to all the Members who participated from every party, even the Government Members, the Hon. (Prof.) Wiswa Warnapala and others, have been very tough on all those officials who came and in fact the conduct of some of those officials during our inquiries were also not very savoury. In that regard, we will be making our comments and taking necessary action. But, in the meantime, we should not bring the Committee into disrepute by raising this issue in the Chamber. They could always discuss this with me. In fact, yesterday also we discussed and I told them, Wait, let me get the reports. Once I have the verbatim reports, let me prepare it properly and present it". We do not have to score brownie points here and I am sure all the Members will agree with me. We must do it as a collective Committee and this is very unfortunate. This has never happened before. I do not think that we should do it that way. We are all agreeable as to what action should be taken. But then, as the Chairman of the Committee, I have certain responsibilities and I have to also see that I will not be held at fault later. This is not for any personal benefit or kudos that I am trying to do this. I believe we are going to meet now. Though what has happened is unfortunate, we will meet together, discuss this matter and then take whatever action we need to take.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , ? ( ) (An Hon. Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Speaker, as the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, I have to discharge my duty with diligence. I only wanted to have the verbatim report in my hands in order to prepare a complete report and also to justify the decision I was going to take. Last time when the Committee met, there were four Members. I wanted to call all of them. In fact, I wanted to mention it to a complete Committee which we have summoned today, and to say what action we are going to take and what are the reasons. In fact, some of the officials who are assisting me have discovered some new evidence which had not been there. Copious documents are to be produced before us. Most of the documents have been hidden away. Some of these officials of the Auditor-Generals Department have been functioning under severe duress. I would make a recommendation to Parliament for some reward to be given to them. The Leader of the Opposition and the others are here. You must understand that there are certain traditions that we have maintained in this House. We do not come here to score points. They are trying to accuse the Chairman, having sat together and seen what we have been doing. As far as I am concerned, I have acted very diligently and discharged my duties perfectly. Whatever action we take, we have to justify and support with all the documents that we can produce together with the replies they gave. The delay is by the Hansard Department in giving us the verbatim reports in time. For several months, it has been delayed. I have been asking them for the last one whole month.

What is happening is, people are trying to score political points. Mr. Speaker, with all responsibility, I am asking you to agree with the Party Leaders to open the Sittings to the media. What is happening is, all the Members come to collective decisions, we tell them this is how we are going to do it and the next day, to get political advantage they run to the press and tell various things.

One of the biggest difficulties we have is that we have to function with all responsibility. I have been Chairman previously also. But the difficulty is that we have to correct certain impediments that have been put in our path. Particularly if you open this to the media, half the problems would not be there. Then, the next day, the media will report and there will be pressure. - [Interruption.] What is happening is, everybody is running to the media, saying whatever they want.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Speaker, once again I am very disappointed in the sense, you know these Members are new to the Committee. They have been there; they have been functioning very well. I appreciate all their work, but there is a procedure to be followed when we take a decision. Before I send out a letter, I will have to put it to the Committee as a whole; I have to give a chance. That is why I am preparing the details because then the other Members will also know. This is a decision I am very firmly in support of. But then, I will have to prepare the supporting documents and put it to the Committee and then send it out. That is the only procedure we follow. - [Interruption.] We have to follow that procedure. - [Interruption.] Without putting it to the Committee, how can I send it? - [Interruption.] As the Chairman, I cannot just send out orders. I will have to put it to the Committee and send it out - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . -

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Speaker, may I clarify the correct position? The correct procedure is this. Oversight committees have total power to go into the entire financial control of all the institutions that come under them. If we see there is a lapse by not having an internal inquiry, we are entitled to direct the Chief Accounting Officer to do so. That has already been done; the Chief Accounting Officer has been told several times about his failure to hold an internal inquiry. On that, the Chief Accounting Officer told one thing to the Committee. In fact, I was misled by what was said, that the Attorney - General had given cover for not holding the internal inquiry. Unfortunately, we are

yet to get that particular verbatim report. Once we get the verbatim report, I want to mention that he had said so on such and such a date and that there are other reasons - why a particular officer should have been sent on compulsory leave. They should have dealt with the relevant officer in some way. In my opinion, I am now saying this because it has come out in the open, the Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue should not be allowed to interfere even if he is taken out - it is up to the appointing authority, the President, to decide whether to send him on compulsory leave or to attach him to the Ministry and then conduct the internal inquiry - and it must be made out of bounds for him. Because, we see that there are several reasons why he should not be allowed to. The entire Rs. 3.3 billion fraud had taken place during the period when he was in charge of the VAT Division. It is a very, very serious matter. There are several reasons - we have come across a particular circular which had been issued by him and that circular is very, very suspicious which had gone after four days. We are getting all those reasons together to send the letter out. I cannot understand why before that all the Members are against that. [Interruption.] I am fully in agreement.

Speaker, I was listening to the Chief Government Whip. He quoted Article 55 of the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution. Article 55 (3), states, I quote: "Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article, the appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of all Heads of Departments shall vest in the Cabinet of Ministers, who shall exercise such powers after ascertaining the views of the Commission."

So, that gives the power of the Cabinet to take action against Heads of Departments. I do not think anyone is contending that any other body has that power. But, I think the Opposition is going on the basis of another fact. Firstly, I would like to quote Article 4 (a) of the Constitution. That is what, I think, the Hon. Wasantha Samarasinghe had raised. the legislative power of the People shall be exercised by Parliament, .........

2007 24 1567 1568

The judicial power of the people in regard to the powers and privileges will be exercised by Parliament. Then, you have the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act. You also have the Standing Orders. All these have to be read together. Before the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act, Chapters X and XI of the Constitution, which give the powers of Parliament, should be read first. Then, paragraph (2) of the Standing Order No. 125 - Committee on Public Accounts - states, I quote: (2) It shall be the duty of the Committee to examine the accounts showing the appropriation of the sums granted by Parliament to meet the public expenditure and such other accounts laid before Parliament as the Committee may think fit, along with the reports of the Auditor-General on local authorities. " Paragraph (3) states, I quote: "(3) The Committee shall, from time to time, report to Parliament on the accounts examined, the finances, financial procedures, performance and management generally of any department, local authority and on any matter arising therefrom. So, the PAC, under the powers of Parliament, has the right to send in a report and ask for certain disciplinary action to be taken against a public officer. Thereafter, it is up to the Government, if it is an officer below the rank of the Head of the Department, to send it to the Public Service Commission and if it is a Head of a Department, to the Cabinet to decide on further action. Then, under Article 43 of the Constitution, the Cabinet is responsible to Parliament. So, once the recommendation is made, it goes before the Cabinet and the Cabinet must either say, We have acted" or "For this reason, we are not acting. Thereafter, the House can take it up for debate. You cannot use Article 55 of the Seventeenth Amendment to shut out the powers of the Public Accounts Committee or of Parliament. - [Interruption.] ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) That is, I think, what the Hon. Wasantha Samarasinghe has come out with. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) Article 55(3) of the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution states, I quote: Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article, the appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of all Heads of Departments shall vest in the Cabinet of Ministers, who shall exercise such powers after ascertaining the views of the Commission. , .

Mr. Speaker, there are two issues in this. One is, the Hon. Member Wasantha Samarasinghe raised the issue of Privileges of Committees of Parliament and the House as a whole because we have a right to even punish witnesses who come before the Committees and mislead us. That is what he read out and he is perfectly correct. Then, regarding the issues pertaining to dismissal and disciplinary action of public servants, the Committee Chair, during proceedings if he finds that accounting officers and the chief accounting officer have not acted as they should have under the Establishment Code, we could always write to the Public Service Commission and ask them to act according to what we feel is correct. And if we fail, then we can take it up, if we are Ministers at the Cabinet or, we can even make a report to Parliament.
