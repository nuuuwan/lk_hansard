However if the Non-Performing Loan portfolio is maintained at the lowest point of 8% as against the loan portfolio, it is considered as having reached the benchmark. In the computation of the benchmark, re-scheduled and written - off loans will not be taken into account. 5.2.5 Computation of Variable Component (i) The allowance will be paid Pro-rata Basis after computing the number of days of participation in comparison to the number of days on which Mobile Services. Deposit Mofilisation, Loans recovery and similar programmes are jointly conducted by the bank and the branch union of the respective bank for the advancement of the bank.

Mr. Presiding Member, I am speaking at a time when the \"Mahinda Chintana\" has failed and the economy in this country has collapsed. The Government shows growth, but an inflated growth because industries have not grown by any means in the country. The growth they are showing is coming not from domestic industries. Due to high unemployment, our local workforce is going overseas since there is lot of overseas employment and it is the increased revenue being received from these workers and the depreciating rupee that is showing us this growth. Usually there has been a trend in this country; it has been a historic trend where the demand for electricity has gone historically and in parallel with the growth of the GDP. This year, the demand for electricity is 4 per cent. This by itself explains that the GDP growth rate that the Government is showing us is inflated. The CEB was established by an Act of Parliament in 1969. It was the UNP administration that established the CEB. It was with the hope of having an efficient and reliable power sector in the country that the CEB was formed. In 1971 the subsequent Government took away this independent authority that the CEB had by enacting the Finance Act of 1971 bringing the CEBs financial reporting also within this by making it yet another Government department. The CEB continues in this form even today. In 2001, the then Prime Minister, the Hon. Ranil Wickermasinghes Government came into power at a time of a major power crisis. There were power cuts of 8 to 9",

    "text": "hours a day. That was how we started. The power generation sector was in tatters and we had to bring about a solution to ensure that the sector can be reformed. We brought a Bill to Parliament and everybody in this House at that time agreed to that Bill. It was the Electricity Reform Bill. We brought it to ensure the security of the CEB; that it cannot be sold without amending the Act in Parliament. It was brought in merely to make the CEB a far more efficient unit. The Government of the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe went out in 2004. But subsequent governments have neither moved ahead with these reforms nor have they brought any other reforms to bring the CEB back on track. The CEB faces colossal losses. The Hon. Minister himself said that there were losses amounting to about Rs. 60 million a day. That would be about Rs. 3 billion a month and he says that this can only be attributed to the increased fuel cost. But I do not agree with the Hon. Minister on that. This has to be attributed to lot of bungling that has taken place over the years. I agree with you, Hon. Minister, what you said about the Generation Expansion Plan which has not gone on track. For that, governments that were there since 1994 must also be responsible. I will speak about the Generation Expansion Plan later. But even right now I do not agree with the way the CEB is moving forward with this Generation Expansion Plan. The power sector has a major crisis and we should always try to resolve this by reforming and restructuring the power sector. Hon. Minister, I was really disappointed over one matter. I thought that you were of a totally different calibre. That is, the CEB recently acquired a new chairman. He is a person with a bad track record. He is a person who was ousted from a different government institution on charges of corruption and mismanagement. But you have now brought him into the CEB. I never expected this of you. Even at the CEB, everybody talks of corruption of the Chairman and you still continue to keep him. I am really surprised at this. He owns an audit firm. He spends time canvassing business for this audit firm. If you call the Ceylon Continental Hotel and ask for him in Room 701, they will say, I am very sorry. His is not in at the moment, neither is Mr. Rohana Kumara. I do not know who Mr. Rohana Kumara is. But this is where the Chairman operates from. So, you keep a man like this; a man who was ousted from a very, very- [Interruption.] Sir, I am sorry. I do not want to get into this. . . .",

China at one stage of their development process said, Growth at any cost. But China is now saying, It is not growth at any cost. We are going to slow down growth because our impact on the environment is so huge that we have to stop, resolve those issues and then move forward. They have moved away from growth at any cost. Here we are getting advice from China and we have passed on the construction of the coal power plant to China. Chinas coal power technology is very old and right now we are using some technology that is 20 years old.

The most expensive unit of electricity is in Sri Lanka. Therefore, this is impeding our competitiveness in the sector and also in the region. Especially if you look at countries such as India or Pakistan, the energy cost is very much less than in Sri Lanka. So, we are very dependent on heavy oil and this has led to a large burden on the Ceylon Electricity Board. Actually, I would like to mention that - we have a very dynamic, young Non-Cabinet Minister and also a very senior Member of the SLFP as the Minister of Power and Energy - while I commend your actions on trying to make urgent reforms, the Ceylon Electricity Board must also look within itself because I see a very heavy diesel mafia in the Ceylon Electricity Board. Whoever comes to power must confront this issue very seriously because every time there are proposals to weaken the diesel lobby, there are voices within the Ceylon Electricity Board protecting it. So, it is very easy. Once you get into the system, you buy heavy oil for the diesel generators and keep rolling it. But who pays for this? It is the consumer who pays for it. We are, I think, paying about Rs. 6.70 per unit now. But this definitely has to come down to about four rupees, five rupees or even six rupees. That is the regime we are looking at. If we want to attract investment into this country, if we want to have competitiveness in this sector, we must have low energy prices in Sri Lanka. Otherwise, Sri Lanka cannot take off. That is why I am saying, in that light, it is very commendable to note that this Government has",

    "text": "When are you going to complete these projects? The important thing is that. You all have been talking of those, but they have not materialized. ( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) I am not the subject Minister, but I think the Norochcholai Project will be completed in 2010. The Upper Kotmale Project is on line and that - the second phase - should finish in 2009. As far as the Thermal Power Plant in Trincomalee is concerned, I cannot give you an answer because that is now under negotiation. But I think the Line Minister will give you a more specific answer on that. Therefore, I would like to emphasize that in the light of these developments, Sri Lanka cannot be depending on heavy oil for energy anymore. We must look at sustainable energy; we must look at renewable energy. Certainly, options such as biogas must be looked at because those are cleaner, environmentally safe options that are available in the world today. Okay, we have now looked at coal power generation. Coal is the cheapest energy option for Sri Lanka. Now we are emphasizing on coal and there are two coal-fired power plants that have been approved for construction. So, those will go ahead. But, the Ceylon Electricity Board cannot take on the huge debt burden that it has. How can the Ceylon Electricity Board clean up its balance sheet? Clearly it cannot, not with the ongoing operations. So, at the moment - I think the Hon. Minister and the Non-Cabinet Minister would agree with me - if you do not have major reforms in the Electricity Board, we would be failing the public of this country. I am very sad to note that for private sector reforms, only Rupees eight million has been allocated for 2008. So, I think if you want to have a reform-minded Ceylon Electricity Board, the Minister cannot do it by himself; the Non-Cabinet Minister cannot do it by himself. It has to be done in consultation with the employees of the Ceylon Electricity Board; certainly with the large stakeholders who are part and parcel of the Ceylon Electricity Board. I would like to tell the officials of the Ceylon Electricity Board who are here today that you should also be progress-minded and reform-minded. You should not",

There is the ability, but, I guess, lack of coherence and consistency has led them into a situation where it is very difficult for them to take on national policies. All I could say is that these two very specific, leading Ministries are related to infrastructure development. In the process, power generation is a critical factor. Another thing is, we are caught up in the whirlwind of petroleum prices, which are going up by the day, a problem that is inherent to countries that do not have petroleum resources, such as Sri Lanka. But let me say that, before going into that further, it is a self-created problem.

We are there; we are strong enough; we have good connections and we will ensure that we overcome this.\" So, do not complain when this happens. The problem has grown out of proportion which, I must say, is not easy for anybody to handle. But that is where the problem is. If things are sailing smoothly, you do not need a Government. When things are in a turmoil only, you need people like the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama to fight the system. His mischievous smile only says that he accepted the challenge, but he has not been given the opportunity to do so. The oil prices have been going up in comparative terms. If I may draw your mind back to the United National Party days, in 1977 you could have bought a barrel at two or three US Dollars. When we handed over in 1994, it was at US Dollars 16 to 19. Then, when we took over again in 2001, it was at US Dollars 21. When we left, it was at US Dollars 40. So, it keeps moving up. The rising oil price is a problem, Hon. Minister, that we all face. So, I guess it is not fair to put the blame only on the Hon. Fowzie or you, Hon. Minister, but on the Government. Each Government has to tackle its problems. You cannot attribute the war to just one person or one lot. It has been there from 1976. It started from there and still goes on. So, we must have the courage to accept that there are national problems. - [Interruption.] My wisdom has always been there. The problem was, you tried to politicize that wisdom and you got yourselves screwed up with the system. I always say that the economy cannot be politicized. That has been the slogan I have been using all over. I also remember the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama very aptly saying, \"We cannot be an island of prosperity in an ocean of poverty\". That is something which we always harp on and live on. We try to show a small 0.2 per cent growth and forget the rest of 99.98 per cent without looking at poverty alleviation. So, we have to change our entire mentality. If the United National Party had been there, the first thing we would have done is, have a good fiscal policy; there would have been discipline in the financial system. What would have been the net result of that? You would lose on the other side - there would be no subsidies, no goodies and no harping on providing jobs. Our investments during the two years of fiscal management were to ensure that there was growth, the profits were ploughed back, the dividends got into the hands of the people and those benefits trickled down. But, instead of giving that opportunity, when the economy was just about to take off, the Government was dissolved. Now you compare today's situation with what went on. We made the economy strong and gave it to you and you are running it down again. That is the actual situation.",

    "text": "If we were in Government today, do you not think the dollar would have been controlled by us? It would have been, at least, at Rs. 88 to Rs. 90. Today, the dollar is crashing in the world. Do not think that the dollar is appreciating and only the rupee is depreciating. Today the dollar is depreciating against the rest of the currencies. If, when the dollar was appreciating against the rupee, we were able to appreciate our rupee, had we been there, we would have brought it down to about Rs. 85. So, instead of converting the dollar at Rs. 115, if we convert it at Rs. 85, one-third of your problem would have been solved. There have been various challenges coming from Ministers on that side asking, \"Can you do that or can you not?\" All we say is, please do not challenge us. We have done it; we have performed, proved and shown it. So, let us get moving. I do not need to tell you the benefits that would have accrued had the dollar been converted at Rs. 85 instead of Rs. 115. Do not try to justify your case. Why can you not? We have done it. Sir, in this Budget, quite rightly, when the prices of oil in the world market are going up, you have proposed a reduction in the VAT on petrol from 15 per cent to 5 per cent. But would that benefit be passed down to the consumer? This is the mafia in the Petroleum Corporation. Looking at private companies, if they get a return of 6 to 7 per cent, you say that there are private mafias. Which is the biggest black market in this country? It is the Petroleum Corporation. Whether you make it or break it, it is a decision on manufacturing. But, when you import petrol you can get a litre at around Rs. 58 to Rs. 68 and you sell it at Rs. 117. So with all the ramifications that follow, with the taxes, the levies and all put together, with a profit margin you have almost a 100 per cent return. So, is that not a Government-operated mafia? There is no point in blaming the Hon. Fowzie. He is doing his best within his area. Look at the overall macroeconomy; it is static. You are looking at an inelastic demand, taxing beyond acceptable levels and putting the entire burden on the country. Likewise - I am just deviating - take the financial area, the interest policy. In order to curb inflation, you are issuing Treasury Bills at 20 per cent and as a result you are paying almost 10 per cent interest unnecessarily which amounts to about Rs. 120 billion. Sir, Rs. 120 billion is almost 10 per cent of your total cost in the 2008 context. So, I say that fiscal management is absolutely essential on this score. At this particular moment each sector only contributes to the microeconomy. Now the Petroleum Corporation is basically importing and selling. Earlier you laughed at us when we, the United National Party, said that we will ensure that we have a peg between import and sale because prices fluctuate with the daily purchases. You laughed at us at that time saying that it is a wrong policy. Now you are adopting a worse method. At one time the dollar-value of petroleum products that came into this country was not converted",

    "text": "into rupees. Who was the exposure of the risk? It was the Petroleum Corporation. The Petroleum Corporation, through the Peoples Bank and the Bank of Ceylon, as of today, has US Dollars 888 million which in real terms is almost Rs. 91 billion in rupee debt because the dollars were not converted into rupees. Hon. (Dr.) Amunugama, former Minister of Finance, you would agree that Rs. 91 billion coming in as a risk exposure owing to the exchange loss would mean a dent in our economy. For how long can you go on like this? Then, there are two \"economic terrorists\" in the system. I am naming them for the first time because I thought that they were decent gentlemen but when I see them carrying out political victimization, I thought that there should be a limit to protect them: Dr. P.B. Jayasundara on one side and Mr. Nivard Cabral on the other. What are they doing? They are selling dollars forward. They made the Petroleum Corporation go forward on a road show with Deutsche Bank and going to get Rs. 450 million. Where are you going? It is a debt trap. Hon. Minister, please do not put two of your heads into this because at the end of the day, history will judge you as traitors. These Government servants bring things on a platter and they get the Minister to keep the tab and get you scolded. Sir, 90 per cent of the problems are created by the officials and innocently, owing to the lack of knowledge of certain Ministers, they fall into this trap. So I am telling you, you are heading into a debt trap. Remember, in 1996 and 1997, countries like Indonesia, Malaysia and Korea went through this type of difficulty. At that time their countries came burning out. Today, Sri Lanka is heading into a fast phase, into that particular debt trap. Why? Instead of half per cent loans, you are borrowing one per cent loans which are conditional. You are going for conditional loans which can be obtained from any bank. You can go to the Bank of Buffalo in the USA and get a loan at LIBOR plus 2 or 3 per cent without any problem. Sir, private companies are borrowing today at LIBOR plus 0.67 per cent, which is roughly about 5.5 per cent, but the Government of Sri Lanka is borrowing at 8.25 per cent. Today, Singapore is trading on a reverse repo basis, at 9.25 per cent. So the country's benchmark is going up by the day. Each sector has its own problems because the dollar-value on petroleum products were not converted into rupees. They are going to borrow dollars which will keep a five years' benchmark and when sold out you are going to be led into a debt trap because you are not going to have further revenue. So, there is no point talking about microeconomy. You have to talk about macroeconomy. We are always talking about the light posts that are there and the petroleum stations that are not sold out and about trade union actions. If we do not look at these two thrust industries that are leading this country, we will be dead and gone. So that is why always say, please do not colourize this economy.",

    "text": "Look at the Petroleum Corporation. When they import and sell oil there is an X amount of cost involved. When they produce and sell oil, there is an X amount of cost involved. I know the producing capacity may not be 100 per cent sufficient to meet the demand. So it would be a make or break policy or a make or buy policy. On that score, I am made to understand that there would be more importing than producing because of the cost factor. So why not outsource this? There were talks about a second refinery, a third refinery and so on but owing to major problems which are unknown to many of us, this is being held back. They put the blame on the unions. You have the courage to boast and tease the politicians that you have started both Norachcholai Coal Power and the Upper Kotmale Hydro Power Projects. Why do you not do the same thing when it comes to the national policy on refineries ? That is the problem. So, here you cannot be led by the tail. The head must take the decision to move forward. Do not blame the entire political system. Everything is related to war. In that case you need to convert this country into a war council. A vote against the Budget, you say, is a vote against the war. Now, at this moment when we are talking, the Pesalai Police Station is being attacked. Are you saying \"No.\"? Then, the wife of Brigadier Channa Rupasinghe, Area Commander of Puttalam, has been killed at Kiribathgoda. Why do you not realize that terrorism is moving forward? If you have captured the Eastern area and if you are supposed to finish the war by the end of this year, what is all this ramification? The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana and the Hon. Dew Gunasekara are innocently sitting like two lambs there. An order comes, \"Close the APRC.\" Then what is the policy of this Government? That is one of the major problems. Have you got a solution to that? We are all moving in one particular direction. We know what the problem is; we have located the problem but we are dancing around it and not solving it. You do not have the guts; you do not have the conviction. That is what I am saying about this Government. So look at the basis of the make or produce or import policy which is most important. I am basically saying at this moment that mismanagement of the economy is not only coming from each Line Ministry but from the Finance Ministry downwards but because of lack of knowledge, they are unable to take correct decisions. The Defence Ministry owes the Petroleum Corporation almost Rs.18 billion. On that score, they have got to take it as a finance costing. I cannot blame them. As an entity, they have got to look after their own interest. So when they bring in the cost of capital plus the debt outstanding which has got to be written off, the Government says, \"You have got to look after one another.\" Then you put a cost for borrowing and bring that in and the consumer pays for the inefficiency and",

    "text": "incompetency. Is that because of the war? Simply because of your inability you have spent more than what is required. Putting everything on the war is a heinous crime. Today, the biggest expenditure is not the war expenditure. It is the interest, Rs. 580 billion; it is the capital amortization, Rs. 280 billion and then only comes the expenditure on defence. Whether there is a war or not, tomorrow we have to, in any case, carry a cost of about Rs.100 billion. For God's sake, do not make this county a war council. If you want, say this country is on a war-footing. Otherwise, get out of the myth that war is the panacea for all ills. While you attribute everything to the war, there is another self-created baby in hand, Mihin Air, from which Rs. 330 million has been outstanding for almost eight months. Are you telling me that that cost is not a burden on the Petroleum Corporation? Why should we blame the Petroleum Corporation? Owing to decisions that are made in a whimsical manner, in a lackadaisical manner without any futuristic plan, there is a debt created and the Petroleum Corporation has to carry that baby. What is going on? Who is going to answer this? Do you think that the innocent people of this country want Mihin Air to go to Dubai or Buddhagaya? What nonsense are you talking? When people are unable to have a square meal today, you are looking at the other things that are there. Remember, that debt is inbuilt even in the cost of kerosene oil. That is what you have got to look at. You have got to look at this from a macro point. Forget the micro picture. You are basically living in a make-believe world. You are saying that oil is going to be produced in Sri Lanka in 2011 or 2012. For God's sake, stop fooling. First find oil. In 1976 or 1977, during Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike's time, they found oil in Pesalai. We are still using that oil. What a hypocrisy? What nonsense? First find oil. Sometimes the cost involved in exploring oil might be more higher than buying it from some other country. So, let us see as to where it is deposited. Well and good! Now you are having road shows and trying to sell the oil resource. But, let it be done on a tender basis. Do not select and say, It is given to India with compliments from Sri Lanka\" or, \"It is given to China with compliments from Sri Lanka. That is nonsense. The interest of Sri Lanka has to be looked after first. If you are friendly with India give it to them like the LIOC, but with a policy. Ensure that the competency of tenderers is taken into account in awarding the tender. Oil is not found in a hard compartmentalized base. The seismic study that has been done shows that there is oil in certain areas. I am not too knowledgeable about the areas where oil is deposited. They say it is in the Upper Basin, the Lower Basin or in the Mannar Basin. But, at the end of the day there are eight specific areas where oil is deposited. The Government is trying to give",

If one succeeds in getting a block without a tender, then his cost will be less and he will be competing in an uneven playing-field. So, the Government must take a decision and go forward on an even basis. Do not make a suicidal approach in the little hope that we have oil. I suppose there is a major problem with regard to oil. I am not saying so at all. We never said that. It is you who said that. You were the ones who said, We are not bothered. We have Arabian Friends. When the price of oil goes up in the world market, we know how to remove the plug. All those were said by you. So, please do not point the finger at us and ask, What is the situation? I am *tabling a document on the Financial Performance of the CPC. In Table 12 you find the contribution to the Government. In the year 2006 it was Rs. 26.41 billion. That is, Rs. 26,410 million. In the year 2007 - I think it should be up to August with the book been printed by now - it is Rs.18 billion. That is, Rs. 18,000 million. So, is this not a Government mafia? Is this not a black-marketing mafia? So, what I am saying is that if you are pointing your finger at the private sector, the co-operatives and the joint ventures when they get a return of 10 per cent saying they are doing black marketing, first point your finger at the Petroleum Corporation. Look at the Government. It is not a bottomless pit that you can collect revenue. Please, ensure that you think on that basis. Then, Sir, as I have spoken sufficiently and at length within this short time on the Petroleum Corporation, it is my bounden duty to speak a few words on another important sector, which is the make or break of this country, when the Hon. Minister and the Deputy Minister are here. Sir, infrastructure is very important; whether it is roads, ports or airports, they have to be supported through power. Power is a crucial factor. Demand, I am made to understand, even with the economy crashing, has a 12 to 14 per cent growth per year. Are we catering to this demand? The United National Party from 1977 to 1994 ensured that we give a thrust to the production base with the power generating capacity moving tremendously. Thereafter, from 1994 to 2001 - the previous Speaker, the Hon. Navin Dissanayake, I am sure in his enthusiasm to defend the Government forgot that his own father-in-law started the \"Kukule Ganga\" Project, did say that only 20 megawatts was added to the national grid -[Interruption.] I am talking about what he said.",

Karu Jayasuriya moved it forward. You have private power generation such as ACE Power Generation which I think is a step in the right direction because today the Government cannot do business. The Government should adopt policies to outsource. That is the best way forward. I am convinced that outsourcing is far cheaper than generating on your own. But, there is a mafia.

There are certain issues that you have to look at on an all-party non-political basis. We have done so. Are we being castigated? Are we being harassed just because we said so? But, you are unable to even think that far. That is the sadness. Going on further, I think, the Hon. Navin Dissanayake mentioned of a right factor, the macropicture. The CEB cannot extricate itself without cleaning the balance sheet. This has been going on perennially. There is almost, I think about Rs.110 billion in debt. The long-term debt is about Rs. 85 billion to Rs. 90 billion and about Rs.30 billion is in short-term debt. How can you extricate? You have a balance sheet that is not properly valued. If you value it and bring it into the books, then depreciation will come out. International auditors are not going to accept it as we whimsically decide as to how we do our accounting. Let us take those into the books. Actually, if you want to restructure the CEB, ensure that you do so. Otherwise, you are pawning the unborn future for todays survival. That is what you have done to the economy. That is what you are doing to the infrastructure. Why can you not take courage? You say that you are fighting the war and going to capture the North by the end of the year. Why can you not do this also in the same way? If you have the guts to do that, why can you not do this?

The baby is carrying the parents today. The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage is very good in assisting you in the same process. He is wearing half the suicide bomb. The balance sheet needs to be corrected. Then you can go forward and get loans. Instead of the HSBC going forward on behalf of the Government and doing the peons job, if the CEB can go forward and say that this is our 10-year policy, then you are talking a different language. You do not know the actual difference between how you should go and what you should do. That is why I say you are a Government that is incompetent, inept and trying to cover up your corruption through the war and doing nothing properly. You expect the United National Party to come and clean the job like a janitorial service and then you are ready to kick the guys out again. That is what has happened. Is it not? Do not look at the",

Minister, to come to this Parliament and defend such a loss? - [Interruption.] Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, you have got a call from Uganda and you are upset from morning. We know who the future Prime Minister is going to be. You can easily move from your seat to that seat. At least you are living with that hope. Never mind, it can be in two days, four days, on the 14th or may be next year. We will look at it - [Interruption.] Do not worry - [Interruption.] You corrected that? That means you have already made him the Prime Minister - [Interruption.] No. Up to now you still have plans for a loss of Rs. 49 billion. You cannot cover up that loss unless you increase the prices by 85 per cent or you get the Government to give you Rs. 49 billion. You can never correct that. Do not mislead this House, Hon. Minister. I think you must accept this and say, Yes, in January we are going to raise the prices. [Interruption.] So, leave it to us. That is our job. You castigate us for making the economy. At least the Hon.(Dr.) Sarath Amunugama had the courage of conviction, when we did the right thing for Sathosa, to congratulate us. I thank him at every given time. He is not like the spineless Ministers on your side who cannot get up and say the right thing. He had that courage. [Interruption.] Why? Are you going to laugh at him for doing so? His Excellency the President also said the same thing. Now you laugh at him also. You dare not do that. I bring your mind back to his speech of 4th February where he said, I do not want people singing hosannas for dinner, be constructive in criticizing the Government. You do not have that type of people in your Cabinet. That is the problem. I am trying to give you a little bit of oxygen because you do not have it. You are in negative terms today - [Interruption.] We are going to do that. Before long we will form a UNP Government. Do not worry about that. That is why we are trying to mitigate the loss because, when you hand over the Government to us in the way you are spending today, there would not be a tomorrow. We want to at least mitigate that loss so that when we take over the Government, it will be easier for us to run. So, now what are you saying? - [Interruption.] Never mind. Johnston Fernando, Dayasiri Jayasekara, Edward Gunasekara and I are here. We are all one and the same. We have put our shoulders to the wheel. You were so bankrupt that when legitimate monies came to this country, you had the audacity to say that these monies came from the Tigers. Then, why the hell did the Tigers not appoint Ranil Wickremasinghe as the President ? - [Interruption.] Why ? Only that ? Are you not giving more than that ? Leave our problems to our party. You handle your party. You are really upset over the Ugandan call today. Why ? Will that postpone your promotion ? This is the problem. Now he has made me the - [Interruption.] , - leader.

    "text": "the CEB generates 17.7 per cent on the basis of thermal energy, IPP generates 32.8 per cent and small power producers, 3.5 per cent. The hydro element is basically 45 per cent. I believe the Hon. Minister will also agree with me that the crux of the matter is this. Nowhere in the world does a country depend so much on imported auto diesel, particularly for the generation of energy. Other countries depend on this type of thermal energy, auto diesel, may be up to 10 per cent of their total generation of electricity. The maximum would be 15 per cent. But the picture here is a desperate one because more than half the generation of electricity in this country is dependent on imported auto diesel. I need not go into the reasons. It is quite possible that when these plans were made, prices of oil were quite low and as a convenient method of supplying, our local refineries must have resorted to this type of excessive use of oil. People also talk of an oil lobby in the Ceylon Electricity Board. I am not referring to the present Ceylon Electricity Board but that is old history. For the last 25 years we have been hearing of a petroleum or oil lobby within the Ceylon Electricity Board. But I do not want to go into that matter. The fact of the matter is that we are depending excessively on imported auto diesel for the production of electricity. Unless we change that pattern, we become totally captive, totally vulnerable to the vicissitudes of the oil market globally. When oil prices go up even by a few Dollars, the Ceylon Electricity Board has to face a very critical situation. When the Ceylon Electricity Board faces a critical situation, we know they come to the good Hon. Minister and the Hon. Deputy Minister in charge. Then they have to come to the Cabinet to ask for an upward revision of the tariff. So, this is the situation. I must say it as a compliment to the Hon. John Senewiratne. He has always focused on this and it is this Government that has made the biggest investment in alternate forms of electricity. Look at Norachcholai. For the first time, this Government has found the money, the location, the companies and the people and we are well on track to achieve the first 300 megawatts of coal power electricity generation in Sri Lanka. This 300 megawatts which should come on stream in the year 2010, will also see phase II and phase III of Norachcholai so that we would have a total of 900 megawatts coming out of the Norachcholai Coal Power Plant in Puttalam. We have also invested in the Kotmale hydro power project which should generate 140 megawatts. There is also the Kerawalapitiya 300 megawatts project and the Uma-Oya project, - for which I am glad to say, His Excellency the President will be signing the agreement in a few days in Tehran, - that will generate about 80 megawatts. So, I want to tell this House that it is only under the present administration and under the leadership of the Hon. John Senewiratne, that the Government has taken meaningful steps to break this deadlock of depending on auto diesel for our electricity. That is the crux of the matter. Unless we reduce that dependency and bring it down, may be to 10 or 15 per cent from the current 50 per cent or above of auto diesel usage, we cannot find a solution.",

The first breakthrough in trying to reduce the cost of electricity is Norachcholai and to this day you have not accepted that and you are still trying to sabotage it. Then, look at what we are doing in Kotmale. We are negotiating with the Government of India to add 800 megawatts in Trincomalee. Trincomalee is an ideal location for a power plant. That was sabotaged by people on both sides. Long years ago, the Hon. Rukman Senanayake will remember, the first BOT proposal was for a power plant in Trincomalee.

    "text": "Sir, I will just summarize by saying that the problem of power generation in Sri Lanka is only marginally connected with the price of oil; it is really connected with our dependence on auto diesel, 50 per cent and above, which no country in the world does. We should bring it down to 15 per cent. If we can bring down our dependence on oil to 15 per cent and go to alternative energies like coal, wind and hydro, then I think we can bring down our tariff. It is useless talking about oil everyday, if we cannot reduce the dependence of the Ceylon Electricity Board on imported oil. I want to thank the Hon. John Senewiratne because he is the first Minister who has insisted that we should break this oil monopoly. He has had a lot of problems also, I think, in the Ceylon Electricity Board because of that and he has had to grapple with this problem. But, he has stuck to it and as long as we stick to that policy, I ask the Opposition, please, not to start agitating about Norachcholai again. Every time we want to get away from this oil dependency, somebody in the Opposition begins to create trouble. Let us look on this as a national policy and try to reduce our dependence on auto diesel oil. Thank you. ( ) (The Chairman)",

    "text": "( . . . - , ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie - Minister of Petroleum and Petroleum Resources Development) Mr. Chairman, my Ministry is mandated to supervise and regularize all the downstream and upstream activities in the petroleum industry. As promised in the \"Mahinda Chintana\" programme, this Ministry is dedicated to oil exploration in Sri Lanka through which we can see a prosperous future for the country. Annually, the Government of Sri Lanka spends over US Dollars two billion to import crude oil and other petroleum products. Since Sri Lanka has not yet become an oil producing country, it imports the total requirement of crude oil. With regard to petroleum products, Sri Lanka produces only 50 per cent of the petroleum requirement through the refinery at Sapugaskanda. The balance 50 per cent is being imported at present. Over the last 15 years or so, the demand for petroleum products has risen annually at an average rate of about 5 per cent. The current annual requirement of crude oil in the country stands at around 16 million barrels. In addition, another 10 million barrels of petroleum products such as gas oil, gasoline, jet fuel and fuel oil are imported annually incurring a colossal amount of foreign exchange. Hence, if we explore oil, we would be able to save foreign exchange and invest money for the development of the country. At this moment, I am happy to bring to the notice of this Assembly, the initiatives taken by us in respect of the upstream petroleum industry during the past year. We have commenced formulation of regulations as per the Petroleum Resources Act and arrived at the final stage of",

    "text": "designing the Petroleum Resources Agreement. After completion of the bidding documents, tenders have been called for oil exploration in three blocks in the Mannar Basin. We held three successful road shows in London, Houston and Kuala Lumpur to give publicity to the oil exploration opportunities in Sri Lanka. At that time, several companies that represented Caltex came forward to tell the whole world that you can come and invest. If they are interested in exploration, we are also happy to accommodate them. But they will not be the successful tenderers unless they give the best offer to Sri Lanka. There is no question of giving any extra support as mentioned by the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa. That is a wrong charge he made against us. If Chevron is also a successful tenderer giving the best offer, they will succeed. Otherwise they will not get it. Furthermore, plans are underway for conducting two dimensional seismic surveys to identify the oil deposits in the Southern, South Western, Eastern and the North Eastern areas of the country. It is a well-known fact that the world is experiencing the worst ever global crisis for petroleum prices for the past few months. Even the most developed countries like the USA, the UK and Germany have strongly felt the impact of the rising oil prices this time. These are the highest ever oil prices experienced in the world so far. It is still not over and the future could be even more difficult for countries like Sri Lanka, while our Government has to fight against the continuing terrorist activities in the North and the East, to save the nation and bring lasting peace to our people. We have imported crude oil in the month of October at the price of US Dollars 79 - not at US Dollars 68 - but still we have not increased the price of petrol. You can import crude oil at US Dollars 79 but petrol prices have increased more than that. This crude oil is what we import and refine, and we make profit on that. We saw this challenge far ahead in time and the anticipated burden on the national Budget, as a result of the rising world oil prices. Analyzing the cost structure of fuels, we found that the major cost factor is the purchasing cost of the petroleum fuels as crude oil for the refinery and the finished products such as petrol, diesel, kerosene, furnace oil and aviation fuels at a cost of over US Dollars two billion per year. Todays world price for petrol is US Dollars 102 per barrel and US Dollars 115.55 per barrel for diesel. The resulting retail selling price of petrol should be Rs. 121.01 per litre and Rs. 91.59 per litre for diesel. Since the current selling price of petrol is Rs. 117 per litre and Rs. 75 per litre for diesel, the consequent loss to the CPC is around Rs. 3.5 billion per month if we continue for the next two months. You may note that a barrel of crude oil was traded at US Dollars 37 per barrel three years ago when compared to the price of US Dollars 89 per barrel today and the domestic prices then set at Rs. 70 per litre of petrol, Rs. 44 for diesel and Rs. 25.50 for kerosene oil. 8 PL 002709 (2008/01)",

    "text": "We identified the major areas to concentrate more, such as the purchasing cost of oil where the landed cost contributes up to 60 per cent for petrol and 80 per cent for diesel in the retail selling price of fuel. Secondly, the financial management of the CPC requires proper management of foreign exchange with the assistance of the Central Bank and the Treasury to identify the inefficiencies in the system and take remedial action, stock control and product inventory management, where stock losses and thefts can happen. Labour issues have also been identified as equally important, where many attempts have been made to resolve labour problems such as salary anomalies, stagnation at the same grade for more than ten years and awarding permanent employment to persons who have been serving in the Corporation for many years on contract basis. Thereby a better understanding has been developed with all the trade unions in the CPC, the CPSTL and the management. If I am to mention a few things about the key areas, we have firstly maximized the utilization of the newly built Muthurajawela Terminal at a cost of Rs. 12 billion and brought larger oil tankers saving US Dollars 230,000 per shipment on freight charges, pipeline cost and jetty charges. This terminal was hardly utilized earlier and contains around 100,000 metric tons of diesel at present. We have explored the possibility of signing term contracts with suppliers for longer periods, which has a potential of obtaining better prices than normally received prices through the formal spot tender procedures. We have also initiated the first ever oil hedging which the Hon. Member called \"horse racing\" in Sri Lanka and several other oil hedges, which brought in profits of US Dollars 3.5 million to the Corporation. In spite of the long- outstanding debt of the CEB, armed forces and other State institutions, we have been able to operate the CPC in a viable manner, without heavily burdening the public while offering subsidized fuel prices of more than Rs. 20 per litre to the CEB and giving them a breathing space until the end of this year. The proper financial management of the CPC in this manner has enabled us to manage the oil crisis in the most beneficial manner to the country. Besides, we have initiated an ERP, Enterprise Resource Planning project to computerize the whole network of the petroleum installations in the country which would enable us to obtain online, valuable, timely and accurate information which facilitates better management of CPC and CPSTL. This project is scheduled to be completed within the next 12 months. Mr. Chairman, I do not think that there will be much time to reply to the questions raised. Therefore, I would like to have the rest of my speech tabled*. In the meantime, I will like to mention one or two important matters.",

    "text": "We have closely monitored the operations and management of the two main terminals and bulk depots, where we identified many shortcomings and malpractices and took immediate action to arrest the situation and initiated internal inquiries to carry out technical audits and punish the responsible officers, if any. We have formed an effective investigation team within the institution and have managed to arrest many private bowsers which have been continuously robbing the customers by adjusting the tongue levels, having concealed tanks, breaking the seals and stealing products on the way. They have been properly dealt with and their bowsers have been suspended from operations. These things have been happening in the CPC unattended for generations until we had to eliminate them one by one. We have re-organized the Agro Chemical Function to directly reach the farmers without going through the intermediate distributor offering them very attractive prices and have boosted up sales. This project, we consider as a service to the farming community. We are exploring the possibilities of providing fertilizer to the agriculture sector at affordable prices in the near future. With a view to earn foreign exchange and to re-capture the bunkering market, a new BOI company was formed in order to be better focused. In this project, we have also identified a huge potential for bunkering off Galle and Hambantota Ports. In addition, we may create a competitive market in the Colombo Port which could even benefit the other activities there. The proposed CPC head office building at Dematagoda is in the final evaluation of selecting the construction contractor, which is at an estimated cost of Rs. 1.5 billion. We want to complete this building as quickly as possible because we are paying a very heavy rent. We have not forgotten the long-term investments required in the petroleum industry such as the Sapugaskanda Refinery Expansion Project, where the tenders have been already floated for the feasibility study, which will be followed with the project implementation. The refinery expansion project, estimated to cost around US Dollars 700 million, will enable the production of most of the petroleum products required in the country at a cheaper cost, including sufficient amount of LPG for the CPC to enter into retail marketing again, creating a better environment for competition. His Excellency the President is seeking the assistance of the Iranian Government for a loan to start this project. The long-outstanding project of the CPSTL has commenced, to put up two parallel pipelines for white oil and black oil from the Colombo Port to both the Kolonnawa Terminal and the Muthurajawela Terminal,",

    "text": "along with a new pipeline to the CEB Kelanitissa Power Station, as two of the existing pipelines have already been abandoned due to the badly deteriorated condition and the balance three pipelines which are 40-70 years old are in a critical operating condition. This project is scheduled to be completed within two years on a fast-track programme at an estimated cost of around US Dollars 60 million. The CPC has also committed to supply low sulphur furnace oil to the Kerawalapitiya Combine Cycle Power Plant under construction, through the proposed pipeline from the Colombo Port to the Muthurajawela Terminal, considering its national importance. The most important thing is that we will minimize the public interference, land acquisition and displacement of squatters in selecting the routes for the proposed pipelines, this time. Moreover, my Ministry has actively contributed to ensure the national security in the country by strengthening the security status of the oil terminals, refinery and other oil storage facilities. We have acquired the private lands adjoining these places and have also taken measures to acquire CPC properties which were abandoned in the recent past. The Ministry conducts regular monthly security committee meetings with the officials of the security forces and the officials of the CPC and CPSTL, to review the security situation. As you are aware, many countries in the world have already commenced the use of alternative fuels for their energy requirements. Accordingly, a committee is currently engaged in drafting legislation for processing and usage of alternative fuels in Sri Lanka. Now we have opened the lubricant market in Sri Lanka for potential entrepreneurs. It is evident that many countries in Asia are experiencing problems after liberalization of the lubricant market without proper safeguards. Unlike other products, where the quality of the product will be noted almost immediately, the effect of using substandard lubricants will only be seen after it has caused much damage to the engine. Consumers would opt for cheaper lubricants unaware of the consequences of using substandard lubricants and thereby end up spending more on engine maintenance and health care. Also, the use of such substandard - [Interruption.] I will come to that. ( ) (The Hon. Bimal Ratnayake) , .",

    "text": "* : : Rest of the speech tabled : Also, the Use of such substandard lubricants in heavy machinery and power plants would be detrimental to the manufacturing and power sector. The National Policy for Liberalization of the lubricant market was formulated by my Ministry to face the above challenges. Above all , my Ministry has taken initiatives to match the demand of the country for petroleum products through improving efficiency of storage and distribution. As you know, the most economical way of distributing fuel is transportation by train. Accordingly, my Ministry has taken action to co - ordinate with Department of Railways and CPSTL to promote the transportation of fuel by train. At this juncture, I would like to highlight some of the important measures taken by us to regularize the activities of the players in the industry. As you know, the monopolistic power enjoyed by the CPC is no more and LIOC is also operating in the field. Since 2006, there was a big issue related to subsidy and there was a dispute between the GOSL and LIOC in this connection. Hence, it became necessary to execute a Settlement Agreement between the two parties. With the intervention of my Ministry, it was possible to execute this agreement successfully. The percentage throughput entitlement of CPC, LIOC and CPSTL has been determined under this agreement and it is being monitored by the Ministry with the assistance of PUCSL. In addition to above, we had to deal with the issues which had cropped up consequent to the signing of the Share Sales and Purchase Agreement with LIOC. There was a big demand from the CPC employees and Trade Unions to transfer Third Player filling stations held by the Treasury to CPC. My Ministry was successful in obtaining the concurrence of the LIOC for this transfer. In concluding my Budget speech, I would like to emphasize that, we very well understand the difficulties and grievances of the people of this country. and therefore, we have taken all possible steps within our purview to purchase the fuel in the most beneficial manner to minimize losses, corruption, wastage and improve the efficiency of operations and adopt proper financial management of both the CPC and CPSTL and also to invest on the infrastructure development for a better future. With all that, we have been able to stabilize the retail petroleum price to the consumers, in spite of the highest ever world oil prices prevailing at present, while operating the CPC and the CPSTL in a viable manner, without burdening the Treasury for funds. Mr. Chairman, I have carefully taken note of the very constructive criticisms as well as suggestions made by Members of the Government and the Opposition. Let me assure to this house that due consideration will be given to the views expressed by Members in executing the various action programmes under my Ministry. While I thank the Members of the Parliament for their support and co - operation, I wish to take this opportunity to place on record my appreciation of the commitment of the team of officials of my Ministry, so ably led by the Secretary of the Ministry, Mr. A.P.A. Gunasekara, the Additional Secretary Mrs. Kanthi Wijetunga and Senior Additional Secretary Mrs. Mangalika Adikari and other officials such as Mr. Ashantha De Mel the Chairman of Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and Members of the Board and Dr. Neil De Silva, Director of Petroleum Resources Development Secretariat, all of whose positive contributions have helped very much to achieve fixed targets of various stages of development of our Ministry activities last year. I am therefore, confident that the Members of this house will shun their political differences and join in our march to progress and prosperity. Thank you.",
