    "text": "Committees and Mr. M. S. M. Zuhair. Adviser to the Committee on Public Accounts for having worked tirelessly for the last two weeks to finalize an extensive Report to be presented to this Parliament. May I be permitted to read certain excerts from the Executive Summary, Mr. Speaker? ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, I wish to quote from Major Findings under the Executive Summary. * Your Committee is in agreement with the findings of the Auditor-General that the Inland Revenue Department had fraudulently refunded VAT to the tune of Rs. 3.6 billion during the period 15.11.2002 to 15.08.2004. * Subsequent to the above report, the Auditor General notified your Committee of a further fraudulent VAT refund of Rs. 315 million made during the period 19.03.2004 to 11.08.2004 thus increasing the above identified. VAT fraud to Rs. 3.9 billion. Your Committee is of the opinion that this appears to be merely the tip of the iceberg, and further investigation will be required to ascertain the full extent of the de frauded amounts. * The actual total fraudulent VAT refunds in the years 2002 to 2004 is likely to be much higher than what is presently discovered. * Your Committee noted that lack of supervision as well as possible collusion among certain officers at the various hierarchical levels of the Inland Revenue Department had resulted in these fraudulent activities. * Your Committee found that the incumbent CommissionerGeneral of Inland Revenue had been the Senior Deputy Commissioner in the VAT Branch from the inception of the VAT system up to 30.06.2003 and had been the Commissioner-in-charge of the VAT Branch from 01.10.2003 to 03.01.2005. * If fraudulent refunds of this magnitude, both in absolute and relative terms were made without his knowledge while he was performing the supervisory role of the VAT Branch, as its Deputy Commissioner and as the Commissioner of the Branch, then the incumbent Commissioner-General of Inland Revenues supervisory ability is highly doubtful in the very least. * Refunds amounting to Rs. 3.648 billion out of the total fraudulent VAT refunds of Rs. 3.922 billion identified thus far had been made during the incumbent CommissionerGeneral of Inland Revenues tenure as Commissioner-VAT during the period 01.10.2003 to 03.10.2005. To the Report, I have annexed an illustration by a graph to show the extent of refunds going out during his period. * Your Committee discovered that subsequent to the original audit query dated 26.03.04 on fraudulent VAT refunds, the then Commissioner-in-Charge of VAT (present Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue), issued a circular dated 30.03.2004. This circular, issued without the knowledge and approval of the then Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue, restricted audit and investigative on Refunds on Exports to one VAT Audit",

    "text": "* There seems to be a strong correlation between the advent of the tenure of Mr. A. A. Wijepala to the position of Commissioner VAT and the increase in payment of fraudulent VAT refunds. I have again given another chart to show as to how the increase in fraudulent VAT refunds is taking place. As per the details submitted by the AO to CO That is the Commissioner-General and the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, on 16th January 2006, your Committee was shocked to learn that documents relevant to 183 out of the 235 refunds made could not be traced. Even though this fact had been reported to the Ministry of Finance in January 2006, neither the Auditor-General nor the police had been notified. Furthermore, no internal investigations had been initiated so far to identify persons responsible. Mr. Speaker, in fact it is the current President who had finally called in the Criminal Investigation Department to go into this matter much later, though it was known already to the Ministry of Finance and to the officials in the Inland Revenue Department through the audit query. Subsequent to the fraud being exposed by the Auditor-General through an audit query addressed to CAO and AO on 03rd June 2005, your Committee identified an inordinate delay in taking action upon the matters reported. Most importantly, your Committee takes serious note that a Departmental inquiry had not been initiated, pertaining to the issues raised by the Auditor-General. When this was questioned, the CAO/AO informed your Committee that this was not done on the advice of the Attorney General which your Committee later found to be incorrect. Your Committee also observed that the Financial Regulations & Establishments Code requirements had been disregarded in not holding an internal inquiry despite the magnitude of the fraud. Then, I referred to the GST fraud which appears to be the fountainhead of this entire fraud. I do not want to go into those details. That is part of the Report. I have also dealt with in detail, fraudulent assessments amounting to almost Rs. 200 billion where an attempt was made by the people both within the department and outside that the computer system be manipulated to the extent that these two VAT assessments amounting to Rs. 200 billion issued by the department could not be viewed through the computer screen for control and audit purposes. I again quote the Executive Summary : Your Committee moreover found that the IRD had entertained two bogus VAT declarations made by two non-existent firms at the end of September 2004 even though the departments own investigations carried out on 16th August 2004 established the fact that these two entities were non-existent. The individual taxable supplies declared in the two documents amounted to Rs. 1,216 billion and Rs. 108.4 billion totaling to Rs. 1,324.4 billion which constituted 73.5% of the GDP of that year.",

    "text": "It is mind-boggling to think that officials had overlooked such an amount which could ever be considered as exports. Your Committee noted that those two firms were the recipients of the highest amount of fraudulent VAT refunds out of the twenty firms identified in the Rs. 3.6 billion VAT fraud. In this regard your Committee observed that the two fraudulent declarations were arranged with the intention of confusing the VAT files relating to the said two firms and your Committee is of the view that the responsibility lies with the supervisory staff of the IRD. Your Committee was surprised to note that CAO/AO had not taken prompt action despite the amount involved in absolute and the relative value being unrealistic and excessive. As per the evidence made available to your Committee, tax in arrears as at the end of the year 2000 was Rs. 22.4 billion which increased to Rs. 67.3 billion as at the end of 2003 and subsequently to Rs. 157.6 billion at the end of year 2006. The tax in arrears as a percentage of collections during the year 2000 was 19 per cent which had increased to 62 per cent in the year 2006. When reviewing the position for the year 2006, your Committee found the annual tax collection had increased by Rs. 55 billion over the previous year while the tax in arrears had also increased by a similar amount during the same year. This shows the inefficiency of tax collection in this country and in fact, Mr. Speaker, I read an article published in The Bottom Line newspaper of Wednesday, 28th November, 2007 which states that Sri Lanka is ranked at 163 out of 178 countries when it is compared to the efficiency of tax collection. The article Further states, I quote : Analysts said that the rankings are a slap on the face of the Government Treasury and tax authorities and administrators in general. This is what the newspaper report states. I just quoted it as an example to show how the inefficiency in tax collection is being viewed by this particular report that had been occasioned by the World Bank together with Price water house Coopers. The Executive Summary Further states, I quote : As per the Performance Report - 2006 of the IRD, Rs. 125.6 billion out of Rs. 157.7 billion of taxes in arrears has become bad and doubtful. This is again another very serious matter that the Committee has taken not of. Then, VAT is arrears position is much worse than the total tax in arrears. I again quote : By its very nature, there is no reason to have heavy accumulation of VAT in arrears, as VAT is collected by third parties on behalf of the Government and remitted to the IRD within 20 days after the closure of the VAT period. Surprisingly VAT in arrears had increased drastically and amounts to Rs. 74.4 billion as at the end of year 2006. As at 31.03.2007 VAT in arrears is 51.6 % of the total taxes in arrears and stands at Rs. 86.6 billion out of Rs. 167.7 billion.",

    "text": "Your Committee found that within the 1st quarter of 2007 VAT in arrears had increased by another Rs. 12.1 billion to Rs. 86.6 billion. Then, Mr. Speaker, I would also like to deal with certain large defaulters of VAT in excess of Rs. 10 million. There had been only 233 institutions that have been identified and in that regard, we had told the IRD that due to the limited number of institutions involved which owe VAT in excess of Rs. 10 million and considering the high value of these assessments that there should have been some special attention paid to collect these overdue amounts. When the Chief Accounting Officer and the Accounting Officer were examined by your Committee they failed to show any progress over the recovery and provide any updated information on this matter. Then there are many issues relating to non-compliance and there is one other issue I would like to deal with in the VAT fraud. Deliberate delays in initiating inquiries on audit queries raised on 26th March 2004 allowed Mr. Z. Jayatilleke, Deputy Commissioner in charge of VAT refund, who is presently in remand custody, to retire on 27.01.2005 with full pension rights without any inquiry. The other officer, Mr. Ambepitiya, who is in remand custody and is presently being prosecuted, continues to be paid his full salary without any internal inquiry. Under the Establishment Code discretionary power is vested with the Head of the Institution to recommend to the disciplinary Authority to interdict the person as the offences identified warrant an interdiction or alternatively sending the said party on compulsory leave of full-pay. This was purposely not done in our opinion, and in that regard we have analysed the Establishment Code and the Financial Regulations in detail and those are contained in the annexed chapters. Your Committee found the Internal Control Systems to ensure prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the maintenance of the accuracy and completion of Accounting Record for timely preparation and presentation of reliable financial information to be very poor. The secrecy Clause as stipulated in the Inland Revenue Act has been used as a shield to cover up misdeeds committed and to avoid internal investigations and inquiries. This situation has been further aggravated in certain situations when some senior officers continued to serve in the same post for prolonged periods within the same branch or unit even after obtaining promotions. Mr. Speaker, I come finally to the recommendations. In addition to the individual recommendations given in each of the following Chapters, your Committee submits the following recommendations : Your committee recommends an investigation to be carried by a team of Inland Revenue Department officials under the purview of your Committee. The boundaries of that investigations should expand beyond the reported VAT fraud and cover the possible irregularities of tax collections and fraudulent tax refunds not yet detected. To facilitate the conduct of an unimpeded and independent investigation as proposed by your Committee it is imperative that the present Commissioner General of Inland Revenue Department should be relieved of his duties until the investigations are over as the role he has played, directly and indirectly in this matter is open to question.",

    "text": "The proposed investigation by your Committee is of paramount importance in exercising parliamentary oversight of public finance. The Presidential Commission already appointed may conduct its inquiry independent of the investigations proposed by your Committee. Mr. Speaker, there are some several other recommendations on issues of good governance and certain measures to be taken to improve the deficiencies that we have seen and finally I have recommended this as well : Finally your committee proposes the enactment of a Public Interest Disclosure Act to enable and encourage public sector employees to expose corruption and malpractices in the public sector with the guarantee of absolute confidentiality and protection from any possible victimization. In this regard the Ministry of Finance must initiate action to examine examples of whistleblower protection legislation in other countries and adopt the necessary measures. In this regard, Mr. Speaker, I must personally appreciate the efforts taken by a team of officials led by the Auditor-General who was in-charge of auditing, the Inland Revenue Department who very courageously had gone ahead with the findings and have maintained a high level of integrity despite immense pressure being brought on them and therefore, it is incumbent on us to recognize their efforts and reward them. Together with that, Mr. Speaker, in conclusion I would like to refer you to one other matter. Mr. Speaker, there was an acrimonious debate on the delay to submit this Report but then, we have taken time to see that we submit all the necessary evidence, both documentary and oral, so that there would not be any doubt as to the veracity and integrity of our effort. Mr. Speaker, I implore the Members on both sides not to impute political motivations to this Report. These matters are of such grave nature that if we do not highlight these issues, the confidence the common man has on the integrity and efficiency of the Inland Revenue Department and the Ministry of Finance and Planning is in danger of being seriously eroded. This is no witch-hunt against any public official or there is no motivation for any vendetta but we submit this Report in order to highlight what has already happened. I would like to refer to what happened in the House of Commons recently. The Chairman, of the British Revenue and Custom,s Mr. Paul Gray has resigned from his position over an issue of a junior official sending two CD-ROMS to the National Audit Office containing some confidential information on taxpayers which if it went into wrong hands would have created a serious situation. But there has been no report of this information reaching wrong hands. Sending through a courier without registering had resulted in the CD going missing and the information going missing. This CD had been security coded and therefore there need not be so much of alarm but yet because of that failure, the Head of Her Majestys Revenue and Costoms has submitted his resignation just barely a week ago.",

He is quite harsh on the Chancellor but yet Mr. Michael Fallon, vice-Chairman of the Treasury Select Committee talks about Mr. Grays resignation and says that it was a matter of honour, it is a good example and should be followed more widely. Mr. Speaker, the resignation by the Head of the British Revenue and Customs was on the baswis that he is accepting liability for a substantial operational failure, a mere sending of a CD through courier being misplaced and since that matter has been raised as an issue of serious concern, the Head of the British Revenue and Costoms has submitted his resignation. This is an example that should be followed but then, unfortunately in this country despite the fact that serous frauds are reported, serious issues of irresponsibility and collusion are established, yet officials continue in high positions and therefore, I thought this Report should highlight these matters so that the Hon.

    "text": "ENGLISH TRANSLATION OF THE STATEMENT OF HON. MINISTER DOUGLAS DEVANANDA Hon Speaker, in the capacity of the Minister of Social Services and Social Welfare, I would like to place before this House the problems that are being faced by my people. My Ministry is active in providing with services to those sections of the society living under conditions that have not been fully addressed by the rest of the society. My Ministry has been continuously providing with services to the elderly, persons with disabilities, widows and the like, identifying their special needs for establishing them in their life through self-help programmes and providing other social and welfare measures to the needy in our society. In the meantime, a responsibility is cast upon us to first solve the day-to-day problems other than the core-issues of our people, living in the North and the East of this country. Having this in mind I have been visiting the North every now and then to meet the people in person, with a view to helping them to sort out their day-to-day problems as far as possible, despite many a threat to my life. It is not only that, amidst many threats to the lives of the Members of my Party by the Tiger terrorists. I have gone that extra mile in setting up my political party offices in these two provinces with the sole aim of sorting out the problems faced by the people of the North and East. Not confining my duties to what I have already indicated, I have also set aside every Wednesday of the week as the public day, extending an opportunity to the needy to meet me personally to solve their problems, where I could be of help as the Minister of Social Services and Social Welfare, and other problems which to do not fall under the purview of my Ministry, to the best possible extent. Hon. Speaker, The truth never dies! So are the evidence left behind it! The Dream of establishing a Fascist Kingdom in a part of the country has caused the emergence of a despicable breed of suicide bombers provoked against humanity stalking after victims in our streets human flesh and bones. Out Island nation is stuck in a quagmire, compelling to face a barbaric outfit with a psychopath at its helm having an incessant thirst for human blood, like vampires. Its in such a social atmosphere that the 2008 Budget has been taken up for debate. It has so happened that the Budget has to be passed in a war atmosphere challenging the security of the general public as well as the free movement of political leaders. It is in this realistic context I look at the Budget proposals. We first need to protect what we possess and then proceed to out next target. It is this internecine war that has been a stumbling block to our economic development and the right to live. The whole of Sri Lanka has been called upon with the responsibility of facing this destructive war that has been unfolded in the name of one ethnic group. It is in such an unfortunate atmosphere that I am taking part in this Budget Debate. First of all this existent war atmosphere needs to be got rid of. All the democratic forces in this country should join hands to bring an end to this destructive war instead of criticizing and accusing each other. The two incidents that took place yesterday amply portray to the whole world the hostility the Tiger leadership displays towards the noble public service, democracy, peace, harmony and future activities concerning the freedom for political rights of the Tamil speaking people. The Tiger leadership is dreaming that the could satisfy his insatiable desire for sole leadership of the Tamil speaking people by murdering me using a female suicide bomber and neglecting the well-being of the Tamil speaking people. The Tiger leadership is also dreaming that he could get his desired political mileage by exploding bombs in busy places in Colombo and claming lives of innocent people provoking hatred among the ethnic communities causing a back eash. These two aims, the Tiger leadership intends to achieve will never materialize. Prabhakaran sent a human bomb to kill me, and another bomb to kill innocent civilians at Nugeogoda on his birthday, indicating to the people of this island and to the international community, that he relishes human",

    "text": "flesh. I have the experience of meeting with suicide bombers. The Tiger leadership has tried to assassinate me several times earlier. I am with the idea that the Tamil National Alliance Members, the cat-paws of the Tiger leadership, touting for him are in the Parliament today. It is necessary that they need to tell Prabhakaran that I can never be deterred or startled by these cowardly acts. Death comes only once in life. I will never run away from this country fearing death like a coward, leaving my people. The TNA parliamentarians should go and tell this too to Prabhakaran their idol. We are not a group that have no aim and policies, to dispense the noble service to the people or abandon our march towards achieving the freedom for political rights of our people half way. This too, the TNA Members should place in Prabhakarans ears. Yesterday, the fascists brutally assassinated our beloved comrade Stephen Peiris, my Public Relations Officer. I pay my last respects to the late Comrade in this House who tirelessly carried out his duties on behalf of all the people of this country. I remember, in this House with heavy heart all the innocent victims of Nugegoda bomb blast including school children. I express my deep condolence to the next of kin of those whose lives were untimely snuffed out by the sadistic bomb blast. I wish quick recovery to the injured in the blasts on behalf of the Tamil speaking people and the Eelam Peoples Democratic Party. I also wish to remember in this House with sorrow the murders committed by the Tiger leadership in the North and East. I wish to share the grief with the relatives and friends of the victims. I sincerely thank the Hon. Ministers and Members of Parliament and His Excellency the President, who welcomed me with open arms when I returned to the Parliament after having escaped from the jaws of death and the Honour conferred to the democratic political leadership of the Tamil Speaking people. The Tiger leadership, claiming that he is fighting for the cause of the Tamil speaking people is engaged in a destructive war. Tigers say that they are armed because they want to protect the Tamil speaking people. If their statement is true, I wish to ask the question, why then did they kill the Tamil people who had been working for the benefit of the Tamil speaking people. By assassinating Mr. Amirthalingam, the National Leader, what beneficial results did the Tamil speaking people get? Did the Tamil speaking people get any tangible benefits by murdering Sri Sabaratnam, the TELO Leader? Our comrade Pathmanabha was assassinated. What did the Tamil speaking people get? Yogeshwaran, Sarojani Yogeshwaran, Muthu Tangathurai, the Youth Leader in the East, Kumar Ponnambalam, All Ceylon Tamil Congress Leader, Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam, an intellect, A.H.M. Ashrff, Leader of the Muslim Congress, and many other people were destroyed. What are the benefits the Tamil speaking people got? I would like to ask this Honourable House. The Tiger leadership sent me a human bomb. If Tamil speaking people get what they aspire for, from my death I would gladly accept it. But it is not the truth, when the Tiger leadership murders leaders who tirelessly work for the benefit of the benefit of the people; their freedom for political rights quickly gets pushed to the oblivion. Until the Tamil speaking people are able to lead a barrier free life and until the Tamil speaking people could live as equals on the Sri Lankan soil, Tiger leadership will not be able to kill me. Hon. Speaker, Prabhakaran in his annual speech this time, has come out with the truth. He says that the problems of the Tamil speaking people are quite different from those of the Tigers. Tamil speaking people say that November 27 is the day Prabhakarn declares the latest statistics of the dead Tiger cadres. Previously we also resorted to arms and fought for the liberation of the Tamil speaking people. We tirelessly got ourselves engaged day and night in our struggle for our rights. We did not care to shave or cut our hair and look handsome, we were not able to spend our young days with happiness and satisfaction, we led our lives as ones who had no access to them or who did not care for them. We sold our blood to get food for our comrades, as has not been heard of in any part of the world. We led our lives in the sideways, in the open air and in deep forests. Like flowers blooming in thousands, militants sacrificed their lives in war fields in liberation struggles that sprang up here and there. I would like to place before this House that it was a history that should not be subjected to disrespect. The armed struggle for liberation just continued aimlessly, without any success or end at sight, bringing only total destruction all around. As such the struggle of our people for liberation started to take a new turn.",

    "text": "Indo - Sri Lanka Peace Accord came into being at a time when we, the few left, after the Tigers cleansing campaign for single leader supremacy were contemplating of our next move. Since that day, after having availed ourselves of this golden opportunity, we have resorted to democratic mainstream politics. In the year 1987, when Indian and Sri Lankan Governments requested the Tiger leadership to accept the Indo-Lanka Pact, the number of dead cadres of the LTTE was 651, but the number of dead today is 19,887, as has been stated by Prabhakaran himself. Had the Tiger leadership accepted the Indo-Lanka Pact that day, we could have saved the lives of more than 19,000 youngsters. India in line with its system of governance, paving way for devolution of power to the Tamil speaking people formulated the Indo-Lanka Pact for Provincial Councils but the Tiger leadership instead of accepting and implementing it, kept on schematically delaying and finally rejected it totally. It is the bitter history of Tiger leadership to ask for an Interim Administration when a solution to the conflict was proposed, and when an Interim Administration was given it was their tactic to ask for a solution. Therefore when the provincial councils were proposed the Tiger leadership asked for an Interim Administration. We the Members of Eelam Peoples Democratic party on behalf of the Tamil speaking people have demanded for an Interim Administration within a democratic framework comprising of a Civil Society Counselling Board. The reasons for the Tigers to ask for an Interim Administration are quite different from those of the EPDP. The EPDP has today asked for an Interim Administration for the North-East Provincial Councils and then intend going for the final task that would be practically successful by realizing the political aspirations of the Tamil speaking people. India, our friendly neighbour, the international community and all the political parties in the South have accepted this request as a politically forward plan, which would prove to be successful. But the Tiger leadership is against our proposal. But the Tiger leadership opposing our proposal for an Interim Administration now stated that they were going to accept the Interim Administration Mechanism with a cunning motive then. It is necessary to comprehend well the basic political characters of the Interim Administration that we have been requesting for a very long period of time and those of the Interim Administration the Tigers were asking for. The Tiger Interim Administration was an antidemocratic mechanism to take forward their unilateral power over the others. On the other hand, the Interim executive council that we have been agitating for establishment over a long period of time in essence is democratic in structure and constitutional. It is in reality, a foundation to sort out the day-to-day problems of the people, leading to the realization of the political aspirations of Tamil speaking people. I earnestly appeal to the Leaders of political parties in this House to extend their profuse and prompt support for the establishment of the Interim Executive Council that we have proposed, on which people could have faith, and to bring an end to the simmering situation in the country and redeem our people from the jaws of destruction. It is sad to note that pro-tiger media have been trying to state that the Tiger leadership was the first to put forward this proposal for Interim administration, embodying these two objectives. J. R. Jayewardene government expressed its willingness to appoint Prabhakaran as the Chief administrator of the Interim Administration, Mr. K. N. Dixit, the Ambassador of India to Sri Lanka at that time, then conveyed this matter of Prabhakaran. But Prabhakaran refuse this offer having refused the offer for Interim administration first ; he refused accepting the Chief Ministers post as well. Later, J. R. Jayewardene and the Indian Government came to the conclusion that tiger leadership could name anyone of his choice to man the Interim Administration. The tiger leadership then announced names of three persons for the Chief administrator post in the Interim Administration. According to the name list, Sri Lankan and Indian Governments agreed to appoint Mr. C. V. K. Sivagnanam who worked as the Commissioner of Jaffna Municipal Council as the Chief administrator of the proposed Interim Administration. Prabhakaran expected the Sri Lankan Government to refuse offering them the Interim Administration that he was asking for. When the unexpected happened, Prabhakaran was thoroughly upset. The LTTE never expected the Sri Lankan Government to appoint a person to the post of chief Administrator from the list of names that its leadership had given, but it did happen that way. The Government agreed to appoint Mr. C. V. K. Sivagnanam. Therefore, to come out of the Net cast over him - the Peace, Prabhakaran made yet another demand. For the Tiger leadership the peace is a Net cast over him. Political solution is something that he cannot afford to bear up.",

    "text": "According to him, the war should continue to exist ; day after day people need to be murdered, because it is only on the putrefying stench of human flesh he could continue to exist. He has a consistent fear that return of democracy would lay him thin or subjugate his despotic rule. This is the reason why he took a U-turn to object to the very name he had given when the Sri Lankan government agreed to appoint Mr. C. V. K. Sivagnam as the Interim Chief administrator. He then demanded the name of N. Pathmanathan, a former government Agent of Batticaloa to be appointed as the Chief of the proposed Interim Administration Council. At this juncture, the Sri Lankan Government raised a legal point. The Government stated that it has no faith in Mr. Pathmanadan, as he had acted against it after having promised to serve the Government faithfully under Oath of allegiance. Further Mr. Pathmanadan was a person taken into custody by the State Security Forces. If the tiger leadership was so concerned about a solution to the problem he could have agreed to accept Mr. Sivagnanams appointment or could have submitted another list of names and prevented the emergence of was. But the Tiger leadership did not have any liking to take up this responsibility. Mr. Dixit who was involved in the peace process then, has said if the Sri Lankan Government agreed to appoint Mr. Pathmanthan then Tigers would have clamoured for the appointment of Mr. Sivagnanam as chief Administrator of the Council. This was the hidden motive of the tiger leadership to request for Interim administration Council. Consequent to this, the tiger leadership in accordance to his wish started fighting the I. P. K. Force. At the time the I. P. K. Force stepped on the Sri Lankan soil, the number of LTTE cadres killed was 651, since then, on every 27th of November the Tiger leadership announced the number of dead cadres. It kept on increasing and this time round; the number to be announced would be 19,887+1. Twenty years have lapsed since signing of the Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord. 20, November 27 days have come to stay. As at today, what the Tigers have, are only 19,887 tombs. This number does not include the number of armed personnel, innocent civilians and members of other organizations killed after signing the Indo Sri Lanka Pact. Since the signing of Indo Lanka Pact in 1987 the LTTE leadership has remained elusive, the LTTE leadership is elusive for any form of settlement either for peace or a political solution to the ethnic conflict. The strategies divulged by the LTTE in the discussions they had with Premadasa Government and after having pulled out from the discussions, making them complete failures and resorting to war again revealed the LTTEs hidden motive in asking for an Interim Administration to the whole world. The Tigers held discussions during the P. A. regime with chandrika Bandaranaike Government During this period in the absence of an Interim Administration and political solution, they requested for the Pooneryn checkpoint withdrawal and started war again asking for demands of self-interest. Today in every compound of the Tamil speaking peoples homes there exist a checkpoint. The EPDP submitted a proposal for an Interim Administration to Chandrika Bandaranaike government as well. Tigers, knowing that it might prove to be successful, started clamouring for a political solution through their cat paws, the Tamil Liberation front, saying that they were not interested in an Interim Administration. Chandrika Bandaranaike Government having given up to Interim Administration attempt suggested a political solution to the conflict. The Tiger leadership mobilized his stooges, the Tamil Alliance Members against this political solution and made them get involved in protest campaigns against it. In this manner, Tigers carried out 6 rounds of discussions with Ranil Wickremasinghe Government, whilst preparing themselves for war and murdering members of alternative democratic political parties in hundreds. Finally, they went to Geneva and Norway for discussions with present Mahinda Rajapaksa Government. At the discussions they called for pre-planned meaningless demands without asking for a political solution or an Interim Administration. Tiger Leadership has pushed our people into a destructive war sabotaging every attempt made for a negotiated political solution, according to pre-designed plans, without any interest in settling the conflict. What the Tiger leadership has opened by closing Mavilaru sluice gates are, gates to a total destructive war. This caused the Tigers to run away from the East completely abandoning it. When we look at what has transpired so far with an open mind, the only liking of the Tiger leadership is war. These 19,887 lives sacrificed, are the children of innocent people. These Tiger cadre who had sacrificed their lives are those who did not have the freedom to ask Parbhakaran for what purpose is his thirst for was. Prabhakaran, who makes tombs for others children,",

    "text": "does not want others children to live, he wants only his children to live and prosper. November 27th this year has vanished into thin air in a gloom, without a political solution and without an Interim Administration. Let people murder or be murdered, this is the Tiger leaderships wish. On the next November 27th too, the Tiger leadership will crawl out from his bunker hideout and declare the statistics of the dead LTTE cadres and innocent civilians. I wonder whether he would be able do so next time. Tiger leadership should take to responsibility for the death of 19,887 Tiger cadres and more than 60,000 innocent civilians, and militants of other organizations. Tiger leadership has stated many a fact in his annual speech. He has lamented that India and the international community have branded them as terrorists and that some countries, which at a certain point of time appreciated those who fought for the liberation of their people, do not accept them now. He also has alleged that the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission and Norway peace facilitators have refused to accept their views, ideas the activities. Then the question, with whom are the LTTE friendly, arises. The speech, made by Mr. Jeyakanthan, a famous writer in Tamil Nadu at the late comrade Pathmanabhas funeral comes into my mind Tigers are not friends of the Sinhalese, are not friends of the Muslims, are not friends of India, are not friends of the other countries, are not friends of the Tamils and not friends of the Tigers themselves. The Tigher leadership himself has accepted this truth was stated by Mr. Jeyakanthan and a fact well known to us, in his annual speech this time. A poet has said that all the thorns that have pricked your feet are not the ones planted by another but planted by you yourself. Accordingly, India and the international community have not alienated the Tigers but it is just that the Tigers have fallen in the pit, which they themselves dug for the other people. The Tiger organization is now reaping what they have sown. In the event the Tiger Leadership, of his own did not get involved in a war with the I.P.K. Force and did not commit the murder of the Indian Prime Minister, today he would not have had to confine himself to a bunker so pathetically, cut off from the outside world. He would have been welcomed on a red carpet. Having resorted to an anti people stance and having sabotaged all the opportunities for peace, today he is lamenting for the lack of support from India and the International communities. Prabhakaran, the Tiger leadership in his annual speech says that in the liberation struggle of the East Timor, the national liberators received the support of the international community, and lament that no help is forthcoming for establishing his hypothetical Eelam Kingdom. In East Timor, uncivilized situations of anarchic killings and destructions of their own people did not take place. The Liberators of East Timor have not denied people of their democratic rights. Instances of barbaric killings, like a father being killed in from of his own child and then asking the five year-old child to go and tell her mother that her father has been killed, have not taken place in East Timor. Therefore international support has been extended in the liberation struggle of East Timor. The Tiger leadership being unable to understand the reality is lamenting for non-availability of international support for the creation of a land of barbarians. Hon. Speaker, The Tiger leadership is taking forward a series of activities totally against humanity that never exist in this modern world. All Tamil-speaking people are against his anti human activities. On behalf of all the Tamil speaking people I appeal to all the democratic forces in this country to resort to means, as early as possible that would prove to be politically successful to bring peace, honour and harmony, and finally the realization of the political rights of the Tamil speaking people.

    "text": ", , . . . . . [ ] . . * : : Document tabled : Report on the Financial Status of research activities supported by the National Science Foundation - 2006 and 2007 In year 2006, an allocation of Rs. 150 Million was approved by the Treasury for Research and Development, (R&D) activities funded by the NSF. However, out of this approved allocation, only Rs.107.4 million (71.6 per cent) was eventually available (that again in a very irregular manner) to fund R & D due to the Treasury not releasing the approved funds. Consequently, 19 Research Grants (with a total first year allocation of Rs. 22.2 m.) approved by the Board for funding in 2006 had to be differed to 2007. In the 2007 budget, regretfully, though the Mahinda Chintana pledged to invest 1 per cent of the GDP on Research and Development (R&D), only 0.14 per cent was allocated for the entire S & T sector. Of this, only a small fraction has been received by the research institutions and those that are mandated by the Parliament to promote research in the country, like the National Science Foundation (NSF). In the year 2007, although the latter has been allocated Rs.117 million by the Treasury for R & D activities (within the budget approved by the parliament), it received only 18 per cent of the requested budgetary funds in the first five months of 2007; only Rs 45.5 million (38.9 per cent) has been released up to end of November 2007. As a result 46 new grants had to be withheld, 231 ongoing grants came to a standstill and 376 researchers were demoralized. 100 research students already funded by the NSF for their PhDs and MPhils could not be paid their monthly stipends. Moreover, recognizing the need to attract more scientists and technologists to engage in research, which is vital for development of any country, the Board of Management of the NSF decided to increase the allowances within the grant funds for Research Personnel (in line with the increase in public sector salaries) to be effective from 1st March 2007. However, due to the NSF not getting the approved allocation, this too could not be implemented. This resulted in many Research Students who were selected to work on research projects, opting to go for better paid work. This erratic funding has drastically hampered the research activities and the morale of Sri Lankan researchers. It has adversely affected the credibility of research funding bodies like the Natiional Science Foundation which could not honour the contract they sign with the researchers at the time of award of grant. This is indeed a cause for serious concern.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, it gives me great pleasure to speak on the Votes of the Ministry of Justice. In many countries of the world, this Ministry is called the Law Ministry, as in India. We, in Sri Lanka, have a wider and deeper understanding of our responsibilities. That is why we call our institution the Ministry of Justice. Justice is a moral concept. It has been of concern to all societies from the time human beings gathered together in societies. The first ever codification of laws known to man was by Hammurabi in the Babylonian time. The Greeks, particularly Socrates and Plato, had impassioned debates on virtuous laws and their capacity to make human beings moral individuals. Laws and morality are closely intertwined. Their combination form our concepts of justice. In India, the Buddha taught us the moral law, which was later elaborated by Confucius and adopted in China. Christianity developed Judaic laws, merged them with Greek concepts and made them a distinctive unit. We, today in Sri Lanka, are the proud inheritors of all these traditions, the most valuable of them being democracy. Before I discuss the instrumental aspects of ensuing justice, some discussion of democracy is required. No country in the world is a perfect democracy. All are striving for perfection with different institutional forms, practices and procedures. One component we strongly adhere to is the separation of powers to which the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara referred in the morning, where the judiciary is totally independent. We are proud of it. We will fight to the end to preserve it. I am extremely happy that the judiciary has taken an active stance in the governance of this country. It will find this Ministry a supportive agency. This is where our Ministry, not alone but with the entire Legislature, will have to see whether only safeguarding the independent judiciary is enough. We have now come to a stage where the independence of the Legislature also should be safeguarded. . . , . ,",

    "text": "( The Hon. Dew Gunasekara) . * . . * : : Rest of the speech tabled: In pursuance of the triple policy of the Ministry of Constitutional Affairs and National Integration, namely constitutional reforms, peace building and national integration, we have been able to make a significant break through in the task of implementing the provisions of the Thirteenth Amendment relating to the official language during the year 2007. Firstly, take the new policy of bilingualization of Public Service. We have increased substantially the incentives to the public officers to gain proficiency in the second language. The schemes of recruitment have been amended with effect from July, 2007 and the new recruits to the public service are required to gain a certain degree of proficiency in the second language - Sinhala for Tamil medium officers and Tamil for Sinhala medium officers. This is a big step forward. This is something which should have been introduced as early as 1947 or 1957 or least from 1987 when both Sinhala and Tamil were made official languages through the Thirteenth. Amendment. This is undoubtedly a long - term project which will bear fruit in a few years time. The newly established Nationl Institute of Language Education and Training has now taken off the ground. In this connection I must express deep appreciation to the Hon. Milroy Fernando, Minister of Public Estate Management and Development and Hon. D. M. Jayaratne, Minister of Plantation Industries who offered me a large building complex at Agalawatta for the residential training institute. We would give highest priority to the training of trainers as well as translators and interpreters. There is an acute shortage of these cadres in the judiciary, legislature and in the public administration. At the rate of 4 per cent retirement of public officers annually, we shall be left with a monolingual public service unless we rectify this situation. New methodology and technology would be introduced to make teaching more professional. In my view, we must create a highly professional cadre of translators and interpreters, with an enhanced salary scale. We must make the management grades of public officers trilingual, if we are to make that grade more people oriented, productive, and efficient with a wider horizon. I am happy to note that since the introduction of the new policy of bilingualization, over 7000 public officers have by now joined the classes conducted by the Ministry to learn Tamil language. During the last three years, we have increased the number of Tamil proficient officers in the Police Department to over 3000 after a residential training. I must thank profusely the present I. G. P. And his predecessor and all D I Gs and SSPs for the initiatives taken by them. Other heads of Departments should follow the examples set by the Police Department. I have commenced teaching of Tamil in 59 Pirivenas, including Malwatta and Asgiriya. Several programmes of national integration through the media of language, culture, religion and education are under way. The cumulative effect of all these efforts will be the creation of conducive social environment for mutual understanding, harmony and co-existence. I propose to introduce a Multi-media Distance Education Programme in 2008 with the assistance of the UNDP.",

In the North - Eastern on Province, my Ministry in co - ordination with the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs, has completed a mobile service in all the A,G,A. divisions within one month. This has benefited over 100,000 people. I propose to set up National Integration Committees or Councils district-wise in the Eastern Province as a pilot project. This is to co-ordinate our efforts of the public servants with the civil society to avert conflicts and promote harmony in the civilian life of the province.
