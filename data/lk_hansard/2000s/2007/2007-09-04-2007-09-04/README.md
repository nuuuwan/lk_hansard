: 2007 30 " " : 2007 30 " " PRIVILEGE : "THE ISLAND" REPORT OF 30TH AUGUST, 2007

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Posts and Telecommunication) Mr. Speaker, I rise to raise a matter of Privilege. Particularly, in my opinion this is a matter of Privilege concerning the entire House.

Sir, I refer to a lead article in "The Island" newspaper of Thursday, 30th August, 2007 which states, "Legislature before Judiciary shortly" carrying your photograph as well as the photograph of the Secretary-General. A mundane routine matter pertaining to the termination of service of an employee of Parliament has become lead news in The Island and the caption is so misleading. A matter of issuing notice by the Court of Appeal need not be given such prominence in a national newspaper as a lead news item creating the impression as if the judiciary is at loggerheads with Parliament. I believe this is a matter of serious breach of Privilege of the entire House. I raised this matter so that the Speaker could refer it to the Committee on Privileges and summon the Editor and warn him against publishing a misleading headline giving a totally unnecessary inference to a very mundane issue. Sometimes employees in Parliament get hold of certain journalists and give a totally different impression, a disproportionate attention for a matter which, in my opinion, does not have to receive such wide publicity in a leading newspaper as a headline. This must certainly be condemned and we should refer this to the Committee on Privileges and summon the Editor and warn him against giving unnecessary attention to matters of mundane nature.

2007 04 2013 2014

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . . . . . . , . He is responsible to Parliament. So, he has to hold the meetings in accordance with the Constitution and the Standing Orders. So, when Members of Parliament do not attend the meetings at Temple Trees they are marked as absent. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) When they are marked as absent, they lose their position in the Committee. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Dissanayake) , , . , , . 17 , , . 16 . , , 17 16 4.00. . . . . ( ) (The Hon.

( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) There are two issues involved here. One is the question of a Consultative Committee of Parliament or a Select Committee having a meeting with the President. The other is the participation by Members of the Consultative Committee and the loss of their membership. The Chief Opposition Whip has focused on

the second issue but it arises from the first issue. As far as a Consultative Committee or a Select Committee is concerned, if they want to meet with the President on any matter, there are two ways of doing it. Either you can ask the President to come here or you can go and meet him there. Some of the Consultative Committees occasionally met in Ministries also when it was necessary to get certain technical data and other things which could not be brought here. So if a Consultative Committee or a Select Committee wants to meet with the President, they can make such a request and then they meet with the President either here or at the Presidents residence. In todays circumstances we can understand the President wanting to meet them there. But that is not the full meeting of the Consultative Committee. . . . . ? . . ? 121 . 225 , . . . . , . . . . . . .

(The Hon. Navin Dissanayake - Minister of Investment Promotion) , . , . , . Hon. Deputy Speaker, the fact that you are anti - LTTE does not mean that you are anti-Tamil. That is the fact that I want to embark upon right now because right now our forces are fighting a very heroic battle to clear the North and the East. We have secured the East despite some people who may say - some people belittled our forces - that the Eastern victory is nothing. I would like to tell them that all factual evidence proves that the Eastern victory is a momentous achievement in the history of this country because it takes out the plank of the LTTE. . , .

, . . , ? So, therefore, Mr. Deputy Speaker this is the biggest problem that the anti-patriotic, anti-Sri Lankan forces have. Once you take out the main plank of the LTTE, that is Trincomalee and Jaffna, then day by day their dream becomes an illusion. So that is why about three weeks ago a certain gentleman in Singapore called Gnanakone phoned up a very prominent Member of our group, one of the most senior Members in the UNP and offered him US Dollars one million if at a particular moment of time that that Gentleman votes against the Government. . , , . . , " 20 , " . . This is a factual statement. The CID can go into it. They can get a statement from the Hon. Jayasuriya and they can also get a statement from the gentleman concerned. . Everybody talks about a political solution. Everybody wants a political solution including ourselves. There is no solution to this problem other than a political solution. Everybody accepts that. But how do you get this mystique political solution? ? 17 . 12 , 02 . 1948 . 50 . 1987 ? .. - . , interim council . This interim council was mentioned in the Indo-Lanka Accord; the interim council that had been mooted by the LTTE was mentioned in the Indo-Lanka Accord. But then what happened? We brought in the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, the provincial councils were established, but the LTTE boycotted them. Also, I would like to mention that on that occasion when the Indo-Lanka Accord was presented, the Hon. Premadasa was not for it; the Hon. Athulath Mudali was not for it; the Cabinet was divided. But, the Government of His Excellency J.R. Jayewardene had the courage to bring it to Parliament and make it the law of this land. So, political solutions had been brought, but they had not been implemented. Why had they not been implemented? They had not been implemented because the LTTE had been the main stumbling block for that. , , ? . ,

2007 04 2065 2066

, . . . . It is a one-man show. , , . . , , international net , . . . There are two theories, Sir. One is, you appease the LTTE; you give them what they want. You signed a Ceasefire Agreement, which the Cabinet had not seen and the UNP Parliamentary Group did not see. The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera is here. You were a Member of the Cabinet. Did you see the Ceasefire Agreement before it was signed? You did not see it.

( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) We discussed it.

( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake)

But it was presented only to the Cabinet after it was signed. Then, with regard to the Indo-Lanka Accord, the then President J. R. Jayewardene acted in a completely different way. He brought the Indo-Lanka Accord to the Cabinet before it was presented to Parliament. I stake it. If you can show

( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) When I was a Cabinet Minister we discussed it.

( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) You discussed it after signing it.

( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) No, before that.

( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) No, no. You discussed it after signing it. . Cabinet Minutes .

( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) We straightly approved that. We approved the Agreement after discussing it.

( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) You discussed it after signing it. It was never presented to the Parliamentary Group. . , deal , . , . .. . . [ ] . 40, 50 . , . . , . . , . . I would like to mention about the international community. , international community ? What is the international community? I went to India last month and met the political leaders there. I met the leaders of the Indian National Congress. What did they tell me? They said that the Tamil people must be given a reasonable political solution, but the Tamil people are not represented by the LTTE.

( ) (The Hon. Sivanathan Kissor) Who told you that?

( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) That is the message India gives us. That is what India and the United States tell us. The United States especially, has banned the LTTE as a terrorist organization; the European Union has banned the LTTE as a terrorist organization. What is the international community telling us? They tell us, Yes, you must have a parallel political process. But, at the same time, take the measures that you are taking against terrorism. We are a sovereign country. We are a poor country, but we have every right to take the necessary measures that we deem correct against a terrorist organization. That is what this Government is doing. So, when the political

2067 2068

environment is hot, when the political environment gets a bit heated up, the UNP and the Opposition want political solutions to destabilize the Government. We are not going to fall for that trap, very clearly. We want to get the Budget through; we want to pass the Budget. Therefore, we will hold our allies together. - [Interruption.] Hon. Kissor, please keep quiet! Who wants to listen to you? , , , . , . deal . , , . . . , , . . . .
