: Determination of the Supreme Court : IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA LOCAL AUTHORITIES (SPECIAL PROVISIONS) BILL S.C.(S.D) Application No. 02/2007 BEFORE : Sarath N. Silva - Chief Justice C. N. Jayasinghe - Judge of the Supreme Court A. M. Somawansa - Judge of the Supreme Court

COUNSEL : P.A. Ratnayake, P.C., Additional Solicitor General with Ms. Indika Demuni de Silva. D.S.G., for the Attorney General. Court assembled for hearing on 17.07.2007 at 11.00 a.m. A Bill bearing the above title has been referred to this Court for a special determination by His Excellency the President in terms of Article 122(1)(b) of the Constitution.

It bears the endorsement of the Secretary to the Cabinet that the Cabinet of Ministers is of the view that the Bill is urgent in the national interest. Addl. Solicitor General assisted Court in considering the constitutionality of the provisions of the Bill. He submitted that the purpose of the Bill is to pave the way for elections to be held for the Batticaloa Municipal Council and for the eight(8) Pradeshiya Sabhas, as specified in the Schedules 1 and 2 respectively to the Bill. Elections have not been held for these local authorities for many years, in view of terrorist activity in the area. He also submitted that the area has now been cleared by successful operations of the security forces and that the purpose of the Bill is to activate as early as possible representative government at grass root level.

The elections for these local authorities and the other local authorities of the Northern and Eastern provinces had been postponed from time to time. In June 2003, a Bill of similar content was presented and its constitutionality was challenged on behalf of the candidates who had already tendered their nomination papers.

In S. D. No. 12/2003 this Court held that the said Bill was inconsistent with the fundamental right guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the said candidates, since they had a legitimate expectation of the election being held on the basis of the nominations that had been already submitted. It is clear from the reasoning in that determination that an early election was expected on the basis of the nominations that had been received. However, that expectation did not materialize and in January 2006 another Bill was presented (Local Authorities (Special Provisions) Act No. 2 of 2006), by which the nominations that had been tendered were declared as being of no force and effect. This enactment paved the way for fresh nominations to be called for and for elections in respect of some local authorities. Although nominations were received on 6.2.2006 for the nine local authorities covered by the Bill, elections could not be held due to terrorist activity. The election has been postponed from time to time and is now fixed for February 2008.

Addl. Solicitor General submitted that if the elections are held on the nomination papers that have been tendered nearly 1 1/2 years ago, it would seriously affect the democratic rights of the people in the respective local authority areas. He submitted the following circumstances on the basis of which the determination S. D. 13/2003 could be distinguished. They are : (i) the respective local authority areas have now been fully cleared of terrorist activity and there is a better environment for a free election with an equal opportunity of tendering nominations. It is to be noted that when the determination made by was made, in S. D. 13/2003 there was an effective presence of terrorist elements; (ii) if the elections are held on the nominations that have been received in 2006, the operative electoral list is of the year 2004. On the other hand if fresh nominations are called for as envisaged in the present Bill, the electoral list that would be used would be of 2006, which reflects a total increase of 10088 electors in the nine local authority areas. If the amendment is not made 10088 electors would in effect be dis-enfranchised. We are in agreement with the submissions made by the Addl. Solicitor General. The circumstances urged by him establish sufficient grounds of difference from the situation dealt with in S. D. 13/2003.

Furthermore, the amendment the Local Authorities (Special Provisions) Act 2/2006, which is of similar content has been held by this Court not to be inconsistent with any provision of the Constitution.

Clause 4 of the Bill introduces a new section in respect of displaced voters. This provision is similar to that contained in the Parliamentary Elections Act and the Presidential Elections Act. It was submitted that such a provision is necessary since some of the displaced persons are yet in community centres in different areas. It was also submitted that a further amendment would be made to provide for any polling station to be located outside the area of a Pradesheeya Sabha, where necessary.

We are of the view that Clause 4 in effect enhances the franchise and would not be inconsistent with the Constitution. It was also submitted that in Clause 2(3) the reference to Section 30 is typographical error and that it should be corrected to Section 29.

For the reasons stated above we make a determination in terms of Article 123 of the Constitution that the provisions of the Bill are not inconsistent with the Constitution.

. ? ? . , , , ? . , , . . , , . . , . , ? . . 77,000 1,500 ; 700-800 . . " " . . , . . , . Mr. Deputy Speaker, I must say today the Tamil community feels bitterly estranged. We know in a war truth is the first casualty. This war is being fought to unite the country and this is the rhetoric we are telling everybody. But, there is a lot of gap between the precept and the practice. I do not think that the kind of ceremonies that we are holding will engender, will promote reconciliation and rapprochement. Politically motivated roller coasters will not help us. We should no doubt praise our security forces for their sacrifices and heroics. But, what is there for the politician to bask in? This is

what the entire country is asking today. Moreover, what message are we sending to our Tamil brothers? We are only adding insult to injury. They need not be given the impression that they are a conquered people and that is the impression they get by the way in which we are approaching this issue. People in those areas have to be won over. Blowing our own trumpet to a captive audience in the South is not going to help anyone in a situation such as this. I know, Mr. Deputy Speaker, this is a topic which in todays context cannot be discussed without stepping on toes. In my experience, to avoid stepping on toes would be to stand still. To idly watch and in sheer vanity applaud this absurdity would be, to be counted among the cheer leaders. The leader of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress does not want to be such a cheer leader for this sort of roller coasters. Mr. Deputy Speaker, even to pray for victory in war is tantamount to asking that horrors be visited upon the innocent or the opposing side. The duty of leadership however, is inescapable. Try to make moral choices despite the immense difficulty of doing so and at the risk of being wrong. When you have to choose between two evils you should try to mitigate the harm caused by the alternative you choose. In the process of explaining a policy to the nation, you cannot become cold-blooded and cruel. Sometimes, all of us have to plead guilty however much temporarily brain-locked we are and how terrible our choice of words is. An address to the nation should not contain unwarranted vituperation aimed at the Opposition. If they were irresponsible in saying what they said, let them suffer its consequences. Why choose a national event and use an address to the nation to score political brownie points? An address to the nation must be inspiring without containing invectives. When the underpinning purpose gets blurred and loses it capacity it would not inspire the nation. Therefore, if we are to call ourselves civilized human beings, we should celebrate not war but the end of war. This country no doubt is predominantly a Buddhist country. True value of the philosophy of the great Lord Gauthama Buddha was to build compassion and empathy for people suffering. Instead, what do we do today? We are so oblivious to the agony and pain of hundreds of thousands of Tamils who are displaced. What is the message we seek to send by showing callous disregard for their suffering? Sir, this afternoon in Kandy Mr. Herath Abeyweera, the slain Chief Secretary of the Eastern Province is given a funeral with national honours. He took over as the Chief Secretary a few months ago and I remember very vividly when he called me before he took over his duties, I cautioned him and warned him that this is going to be a very challenging and a difficult time for him. He unfortunately has now succumbed to the bullets of a cowardly assassin and we have held this ceremony when his funeral is scheduled for today. During the last Local Government Elections, I appeared before him to hand over nominations on behalf of my party in the Ampara District. At that time, I faced a

2007 19 431 432

big challenge with a court case pending over me and with an enjoining order preventing me from handing over nominations. His rejection of the nominations was challenged by me in the court and I succeeded ultimately. Having succeeded, I went on to win a majority in eight local authorities in that area. However, it is very regrettable that we have now lost him.

This is the situation that is prevailing today and what is happening? Today, Bangladesh of all nations has issued a travel advisory. It is not a western country but one of our neighbours and it has issued a travel advisory warning their citizens not to visit Sri Lanka. Such is the situation that our country is in. The defence budget has caused the prices of essential goods to go up. What is there to celebrate in a situation such as this? Sir, let me say what Ernest Hemingway said. I quote:

"The first panacea for a mismanaged nation is inflation of the currency; the second is war. Both bring a temporary prosperity; both bring a permanent ruin. But both are the refuge of political and economic opportunists. With those words, Sir, I say that if we want to have elections in the Eastern Province, in the first place the Tamil people who are displaced and living in such untold misery must want those elections. All those nine local authorities are Tamil predominant local authorities. It is the representatives of their people who should want such an election. It is those people who should be consulted. It is not for us living in ivory towers to decide their fate. Therefore, I would once again ask through this House - we must bear this in mind - are we in a position to ensure a free and fair election for those hapless people in those nine Local Authorities? Are we in a position to disarm all the armed groups masquerading under various different titles in those areas? Could we afford to sully our name which has already been sullied enough in the international arena with another election that could be rigged and where candidates lives could be in total jeopardy? But the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress stands ready to face any election at any time and to prove that it can change the destiny of the Eastern Province. We will change the destiny of the Eastern Province together with the oppressed people belonging to the Tamil community as well as the Sinhala community. But, that does not take away our right to question the wisdom in making pious pronouncements of calling for elections and then, on the other hand declaring war and perpetuating war. We should not celebrate war. We must only be prepared to celebrate the end of war and it is only then that we will have some right to hold our heads high and say that we were courageous enough. There is a saying that goes on to say, To make peace, to wage war, you have got to be brave, but to pursue peace you have got to be even more brave. Therefore, I hope that His Excellency the President and this Government would decide to put an

end to the hostilities, pursue a path of peace and also ensure that all those liberated areas in the Eastern Province are made safe for everyone to exercise their vote with no intimidation, harassment and violence. With those comments, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I conclude my speech. Thank you.
