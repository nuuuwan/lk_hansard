( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, can I assist you in this matter? Firstly, if you take the items in the Order Paper today, there is no dispute as to the contents of Item 4 as far as Parliament is concerned. I think what has come up is with regard to the procedure to be followed. In regard to Items 5, 6 and 7 - we do not agree with the contents of the Bill - the same issue arose in respect of Item 4, for which we all agreed to pass them. But we have an issue over the procedure, how it can be handled. That is what the Opposition has raised. If you remember rightly, we had the Finance (Amendment) Bill (No. 256), the Finance (Amendment) Bill (No. 257), the Regional Infrastructure Development

2007 11 1145 1146

Levy (Amendment) Bill, the Excise (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Bill and the Special Commodity Levy Bill taken up on the 6th of September this year. We decided to debate all these together and take the votes separately. These are all governed by Standing Orders 51 to 68 which deal with the Debate on Second Reading, the Committee Stage of Bills, the procedure on Bills in Committee, the Reports of Committees on Bills and the Third Reading. The issue arose when these were put to vote, as to the procedure that had to be followed. We also had the electronic voting. I would not go into those details. Column 2562 of the Hansard of 6th September, 2007 states, I quote: ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , ( ) ( 257), , . [ ] ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Ratnatilaka) . [ ] ? [ ] ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , () ( 257) . , () , . [ ] , ( ) () , . , , . [ ] , ( 1); , ( 2); , ; . . . " All this is now recorded in Hansard with you saying, "". Then subsequently, a point of Order was raised. From Standing Order 68, you must proceed to Standing Order 69 - Mr. Speakers Certificate. Then, you ruled that these four Bills had not been proceeded with according to the Standing Orders and they must go through the Committee Stage as the Second Reading Debate was over. Under Article 79 of the Constitution, you have to certify a Bill saying, " ", because that was the issue that came up. You said the Bills must go through the Committee Stage. The issue that has come up and what I think was also raised by the Leader of the JVP Parliamentary Group is that our Standing Orders do not make provision for that. In that, we make provisions only for a Bill to go through the Committee Stage. Then, when a situation like this arises, what do we do? I think for that we have to get the assistance of the Ruling made by the former Speaker, the Hon. M.H. Mohamed on 23rd March, 1990 on the Buddha Sasana Fund Bill. He said, I quote: Therefore, my Ruling is that, although the proceedings in question are in accordance with the past practice, yet they do not conform with the provisions of Standing Order 7."

He said that was his Ruling, that they were in accordance with the past practices, but they do not conform with Standing Order 7. Then, what is important is this. He further states, I quote: The Standing Orders of Parliament have not conferred on the Speaker the power to annul its proceedings. The House alone is the sole judge of the lawfulness of its own proceedings. The power to validate or invalidate any proceedings of Parliament is a power that rests with Parliament alone. The relevant proceedings run from Column 2562 to Column 2564 of the Hansard of 6th September, 2007. If we are to go ahead from this point, in accordance with your Ruling - I think all of us accept that they must be referred to a Committee of the whole Parliament - we will have to pass some resolution and annul it in some way. On the last occasion when this happened, I was the Leader of the House. Then, we had not come to the Vote on the Third Reading. So, we withdrew the Bill. But subsequently, Parliament was prorogued and the Bill was taken up again after Parliament was resummoned by President Premadasa. But in this, we have gone up to the Third Reading, where you had said, "". So, now the House has to decide as to how we get back to the Committee Stage. I think that is the issue both the Chief Opposition Whip and the Leader of the JVP Parliamentary Group have raised. It is not a question of challenging you or debating your Ruling. It is one issue on which we all have agreed; we have no differences. But on others, we have. Now the issue is, how do we get back to Committee Stage because there is no provision here? In a way, I think you also summed up the situation when you addressed the felicitation ceremony of Mr. P. C. Imbulana as to what the powers are, what Parliament can do. So, I think we have to address our minds to find a way round this rather than arguing whether you are for the Speaker or against the Speaker. About one Bill, Item No. 4, there is no problem. But, we are concerned that the proper parliamentary procedure is followed. You gave a certain Ruling. How do we enforce it because the Standing Orders do not provide for this situation? So, that is what we have to discuss now and then find a way of doing it. Once you follow it, there would not be a problem. Parliament meets tomorrow; Parliament meets again. So, there is no issue on that. But, we have to follow the proper procedure. All we are asking is that the House do so. ( ) (The Hon. Wimal Weerawansa) , . . , 6 . 7 : " 25 , "" . , . ."

Minister, if you only happen to be in Parliament without trying to fight with Mrs. Ashraff and create a problem - ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, you have dragged my name.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I was telling you the day before yesterday -

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) You are trying to absolve yourself.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am not giving in to you.

1199 1200

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) What I am saying is, you cannot absolve yourself from the onus - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, listen to what I say. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) The problem is, over a period of time several Ministers have come. Twelve times there have been different Consultative Committees. We had discussions with the Chamber of Commerce. The Chambers also brought in objections. In fact, all these things have emanated from the Treasury. You and I know and everybody knows.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You now admit that you have brought in this clause.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, I did not admit.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) What are you talking? Is this not your Bill?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) The Bill was there. But I did not introduce that clause.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, you did not. What I am saying is, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem did not bring it. The Hon. Kingsley Wickramaratne brought it.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) But then the problem is, how can you escape from the responsibility?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) But you are one who brought this Bill into Parliament.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No. But then, during your time it was passed in Parliament. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Are you saying No ? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) You passed it in Parliament. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am saying that - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) You could have removed it very well. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Now listen to what I am saying. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, you could have removed it. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Wait. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Why did you not remove it? What was the reason?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , . , Serendib Flour Mills (Pvt.) Limited . 2001 26 ? . , ? . , ? . ? ... . ? There shall be no restrictions placed on the enterprise on the selling prices of flour and its by-products.

2007 11 1201 1202

Who stipulates this condition? The Government, the Attorney-General and the BOI. That is why you have brought in this Bill. It is not at all a fault of yours. I do not say that it is the Hon. Rauff Hakeem who is the problem-maker of this. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I exonerate you. I am telling you, the Hon.Kingsley Wickramaratne- ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I think, the media must record that. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) But you brought in the Bill. You cannot exonerate yourself from that. You cannot exonerate yourself because it is you who brought in this Bill. That is the problem. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) The Bill was introduced, I am taking responsibility for that. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Ah! Now you say that. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) But I am not responsible for this particular clause. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You were just sacked from the Government when they signed a deal with the Serendib Flour Mills (Pvt.) Limited. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) That is a different matter. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is the problem you have.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) But the problem is, you did not answer my question.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am answering you. You sit and listen for a while.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Now you say that the Attorney-Generals Department gave you advice.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No. Yesterday you told me outside. Now, I do not want to quote what you said. Please do not let me be mischievous. So please, sit and listen now.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I always say.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am quoting the letter sent by the Attorney-Generals Department because I think these Ministers are suffering from amnesia or for convenience, they tell one thing when they meet us and another thing when they meet the Government Ministers. I am quoting from the letter from the Attorney-Generals Department. This letter was signed by a very senior State Counsel called Mr. Nihal Jayawardene. What is he saying? This agreement has been signed by nobody else, but by the Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga Government. On this clause, the Attorney-Generals Department says, "We are sorry, we cannot be repugnant to the Constitution. We cannot be repugnant to the Acts that we bring into Parliament. So please do not mislead Parliament. I am telling you once again it is not a problem created by the Hon. Rauff Hakeem.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am protecting him.

1203 1204

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) What I am saying is, it is not a question of misleading. You are again trampling on my toes.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You speak later. You are trying to give oxygen to a falling Government.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) What I am saying is, you were the Minister in charge and if you wanted to remove the clause, could you not have done it?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I will tell you the reason.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Please answer my question. If you wanted to remove the clause and if you were so keen still overlooking what the Attorney-General said, could you not have done it?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You were in Cabinet with us. Why did you do this with us? You were in Cabinet with us. The Hon. Bandula Gunawardane was in Cabinet with us. Why? Because you cannot do it. For God's sake do not say untruths in this Parliament. Let us be honourable in this House. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) We have a collective responsibility, we will defend. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am telling you, let us go further. Assuming that the Hon. Kingsley Wickramaratne did not bring this problem to you, assuming that you did not bring this Bill to Parliament, with this clause do you think today the flour prices will be reduced? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Can I tell you another thing?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Please, now listen to me. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Successive Governments have been slaves of Prima. That is my idea. Every Government -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You have been a slave but not Ravi Karunanayake. I have not given them even one appointment. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I am not ashamed. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You can ask Prima. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Every Government has been a slave. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I have been one Trade Minister - ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Why did you not buy it at one rupee? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) From the time they came every Government has been a virtual slave of this Prima Ceylon Limited.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I will expose further who the slaves are. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I do not agree with what Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga did to give all that.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, not I. I have not given them even one appointment.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Everybody.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You can judge others but not by my standards. Remember that. I am one person who had not given an appointment to Prima. You can ask them. That is the honour I have and that is why I say I will sue those guys who mentioned these things. I am able to say that because I had the honour not to meet those guys. If you say they are rogues; if you say, I have no problem because I have not met them; then who gave this
