( . ) (The Hon. V. Puththirasigamoney) Mr. Speaker, I rise to a point of Order. Sir, with regard to the administrative matters or other matters and the powers vested in the Provincial councils, Parliament or a Minister of the Central Government should not interfere. They cannot interfere and the provincial councils would not allow us to interfere with their affairs. The Hon. Minister of Local Government and Provincial Councils is there to help the provincial councils, but he cannot interfere with the affairs of the provincial councils.

. ( . ) (The Hon. V. Puththirasigamoney) The public Accounts Committee has a right to inquire into this, not any other body. I do not think the Hon. Minister can do anything about it and he should not interfere. That is my way of thinking. .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) "Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem" Mr. Presiding Member, we are moving this Vote of Condolence today to pay tribute to a unique and colourful personality who had adorned this House though he served only for a very, very short period in this House; towards the end of the Parliamentary term between 1989 and 1994 and thereafter from 1994 to 2000 and again from 2000 for a short term until the Parliament was dissolved in 2001.

Mr. U. L. M. Mohideen, as I told you Mr. Presiding Member, was not only a unique and colourful personality but also he had some extraordinary qualities which made him immensely suitable for public duty. His dedication to the work he undertook and his tireless and relentless pursuit on behalf of the people he represented both inside and outside this Parliament in my opinion were quite legendary. I, in my brief association with him as a Member of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress would say that he perhaps was one Parliamentarian from our ranks who used the Legislature to its full potential. He was a Member who would attend almost every Consultative Committee. Those Consultative Committees of Ministries too where he was not a Member, with the permission of the Chair, he would participate in and bring relief to a variety of problems that his constituents faced. Before going on to deal with the life and times of this unique and colourful political personality that the Muslim community has produced, I would request the Chair to follow a tradition that we have perhaps not followed in the recent past. That is, to present a bound copy of the proceedings of the Vote of Condolence of every Member to their respective families. I do not know whether this practice is being followed now. If it is not being followed, we should do it because that is the least we can do to the bereaved families for them to know the sentiments of Members from both sides of the House regarding the departed Member on whom the Vote of Condolence is passed. Having said that, Mr. Presiding Member, may I move on to speak in Tamil since that is the language which was very dear to his heart and he served the Tamil-speaking people of the Digamadulla District.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) I had the good fortune of knowing Mr. U. L. M. Mohideen even before I entered Parliament. Before 1989 when I was a lawyer practising in the Kandy Courts I had the good fortune of visiting Ampara in the Eastern Province where I met Mr. Mohideen. He had a very wide and lucrative practice and I am sure by entering Parliament, Mr. Mohideen sacrificed a great deal financially. He was associated with the SLFP, the UNP and subsequently he joined the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress. I have known him as a Parliamentarian and as stated by the Leader of the Muslim Congress, he was a very passionate politician who had a very strong personality and held very strong views on various matters. I have listened to his speeches in Parliament. I remember he served in a mission in the Middle-East for a short period. When I was in the Foreign Ministry I had the good fortune of meeting him and I know that he handled the affairs in that mission with the same vigour and interest as he did as a Member of Parliament. Therefore, I would like to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by my Colleagues. Members of Parliament in the Eastern Province have been going through very difficult times for the last 25 - 30 years due to LTTE atrocities, the Indian Army having occupied the Eastern Province and subsequently the various militant armed groups. So unlike Members of Parliament from the South, Members of Parliament from the North and East had to go through very, very difficult times. But despite all these difficulties, Mr. Mohideen always showed great commitment and courage, especially in espousing the cause of the people in the Eastern Province. So while associating myself with the sentiments expressed by my Colleagues, I would like to convey the deepest sympathies of the United National Party to the

2409 2410

members of Mr. Mohideens family. As suggested by the Leader of the Muslim Congress, I hope a bound copy of the proceedings of this Vote of Condolence would be sent to Mr. Mohideens family. Thank you.

) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie - Minister of Petroleum and Petroleum Resources Development) Sir, I rise indeed with a very heavy heart to pay tribute to my close Friend, the late Mr. U.L.M. Mohideen, whose ever-smiling face and the fez cap still lingers before my eyes. I am thankful to you for giving me this opportunity to recall the memory of a highly-cultured gentleman, a politician, Mr. U. L. M. Mohideen popularly known as Thoppi Mohideen . I had the privilege of knowing him since my younger days as he was my schoolmate at Zahira College, Colombo. He was a modest and a loveable personality and walked with men of all shades. He transcended the boundaries of race, religion, caste or creed and embraced all people alike. Out of home, he was a neatly clad man in full suit and fez cap which earned him the name "Thoppi Mohideen" and that reminded us of our one time leader, the late Sir Razik Fareed. Mr. Mohideen had been a person who was in the forefront in social, cultural and economic activities of the people of his electorate. A social worker with an objective vision, Mr. Mohideen was a quiet and unassuming person with very fine human qualities. Throughout his life he served the people without fanfare. He began his life as an English teacher and ended his career as the Deputy Minister of Social Services. As a man who fostered fellowship among the different ethnic communities in the country he was an ardent believer in the political principles of the SLFP and of the late Prime Minister, S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike. To him Bandaranaike was a socio-political emancipator and all his political speeches related to Bandaranaike policies. He began his political career by joining the SLFP as early as 1957 even before Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike.

Mr. Mohideen was a true liberal democrat who believed strongly in the right to be heard. His services to the people, particularly during the presence of the Indian Peace Keeping Force, are being still remembered by the people of the Digamadulla District. Rising to the occasion, he proved himself a practical peacemaker during the height of the Tamil-Muslim conflict in the East. He laboured restlessly day and night in providing protection to the people of his area risking his own life. Having reached great stature in life, he played a prominent role in building bridges amongst different communities of the country. Compassion and kindness were personified in him. Mr. Mohideen always looked at the problems of the people with great understanding. His approach to the various issues had been unique in respect of each case. I am reminded of his glorious life and the gentlemanly qualities. He never offended anyone. He was a very honest politician. He was extraordinarily considerate and gave priority to the welfare of others. He placed much importance to the development of the Digamadulla District. He was concerned about the transport facilities of the people and especially the farmers and wanted to have bus services on the internal roadways to the paddy fields. He did a lot to improve the transport services for his people. He also devoted his time and energy to improve health facilities of the people in those areas. He never came to me with personal requests but had always come to me with the problems of the people of his area. I had the opportunity of acceding to many of his requests in providing various infrastructure facilities to his electorate and helping a number of his constituents. I provided a hospital and I was also able to provide transport services on whatever roads he requested and helped him to develop his area on behalf of his people. As a Parliamentarian he was admired by many people as a fearless debater who spoke in accordance with his convictions. He showed high interest in the activities of various Parliamentary Consultative Committees and took an active part in them. The people of Digamadulla, particularly of Samanthurai will remember him forever because of his significant contribution towards the development of several sectors including agriculture, irrigation, public health, public road and infrastructure. Long-awaited irrigation projects such as Udanga River Reconstruction was completed due to Mr. Mohideens uncompromising commitment to the development of Samanthurai. This project which was awaited for nearly a century was the crying need of the farmers of Sammanthurai and Malwatta areas. This project alone made thousands of acres of paddy land cultivable during the two seasons. Men of his calibre are very rare. He was truly a peoples man who untiringly toiled for the welfare of his people. Mr. Presiding Member, I join the other Ministers and Members of this House in paying my highest tribute to him and convey my deepest condolences on his demise to the members of his family. Thank you.

ADJOURNMENT

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) , " " .

. . Question proposed.

" " MISUSE OF PUBLIC FUNDS IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MIHIN AIR

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees for giving me this opportunity to move the following Adjournment Motion : "It is with deep concern that this House is informed of financial indiscipline that has crept into public accounts in this country. This House is aware that three months ago Adjourned Debate was debated in this House. It was revealed through that Debate that Mihin Air Limited had not got Cabinet approval nor capital being allocated to such a company and no Board of Directors had been appointed to such a company by the Line Ministry. On the 11th of March 2007 it was reported in all the Sunday papers that Mihin Air was trying to obtain Civil Aviation Licence using a Fokker aircraft belonging to Expo Air. On the 18th of March, 2007 The Sunday Observer paper highlighted a Mihin Air aircraft with its logo. The 2007 Budget was passed in December 2006, without any allocations for a company named Mihin Air. Furthermore, there was no supplementary expenditure allocated in this House, to-date, neither has this matter been discussed at the Ports & Aviation Ministry Consultative Committee since the Debate of this matter. The only logical conclusion we could derive is that if there is such an airline or aircraft or any expenditure incurred, it would mean that there has been misuse of public funds. This leads to all public servant officials involved in the process would be held responsible individually and collectively for the charge, misuse of public funds. Therefore it is the wish of this House that the Prime Minister or the Finance Minister or the subject Minister advises this House as to how such expenditure has been made without informing this august Assembly." Sir, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella will second the Motion I moved and the Hon. Wasantha Samarasinghe will speak for five to six minutes. You are aware that on the 30th of November 2006, this House debated an Adjournment Motion on "Mihin Air". There was speculation as you know, that there was a budget airline that was going to be incorporated. What was speculated became more visible with certain very hurried actions taking place. This provoked us and we, as the Opposition - because even the Cabinet of Ministers were unaware of certain things that were going on - asked for a debate on this on the 30th of November, 2006. What the then Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Ports and Aviation, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera said is in Hansard.

2421 2422

[ ]

This country which is an island does not have a Cabinet Minister for Aviation and a Cabinet Minister for Ports and Shipping. At the last Debate on Mihin Air, we very clearly asked you to enunciate what the Aviation Policy in this country is and at the same time to give us a very clear picture as to what the future of the SriLankan Airlines and the Emirates is, the reason being that there is only another year and six days left for the agreement, for the very wishy-washy privatization, that took place in 1998 to come to an end. As you know, I was a very vocal critic of that and every single thing that we said then has come to pass today. That is the importance we attach to this Adjournment Debate today and we ask you to enlighten us as to what is going on with regard to Mihin Air.

When we have many airlines that are going bankrupt today and when we have many private airlines calling upon the Government of Sri Lanka to provide them with aircraft operating licences which takes two to three years, the express performance of Mihin Air which is a budget airline, is extremely strange. When we do not know what the future of the SriLankan Airline is, bringing in another Sri Lankan owned airline, wherever it originated and wherever it flies to, basically reduces the value in negotiating at the next attempt to either commercialize SriLankan Airlines or retain it or in ensuring that we go forward.

Hon Deputy Chairman, I table* Annex No. 1 to save time and I want it, all three pages, to be included in Hansard. This gives who the investors are.

I will read it out in extra quick time. It states, "Secretary, Ministry of Defence, Commander, Sri Lanka Air Force, Secretary, Ministry of Finance and a Sajin De Vass Gunawardena from the Presidents Office". The cost of the project is given as US Dollars 36.16 billion. I would like to make reference to this because the subsequent financial statements I will produce would show as to why this US Dollars 36 billion is significant. The project financing has been given as the share capital.

The Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, Dr. P. B. Jayasundera, very clearly enunciated the necessity to have a budget airline in this country. Whether it is good or bad is not for us to comment on because it seems to be the Government policy, but he very clearly says that the shareholders of such an airline would be the EPF, the ETF and the Foreign Employment Bureau. Three captive sources provide the money and that money seems to be controlled by the Government. Today you and I are contributors to the EPF and the ETF as workers. So, it is

necessary that we protect those Funds not just because it is an airline that is coming up haphazardly but because our own money is going to be invested in such an airline which we have not permitted. Then, Sir, also in Annex 1 the locations are given; the employment is given. As per the "Observation", paragraph 7, besides the approval of the BOI, it is necessary to obtain approval from the Civil Aviation Authority, the Ministry of Defence and the Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd. These are the three institutions from which approval has to be sought subsequently after the approval of the BOI being given. to this company. There is no company in this country, not even a barber salon, which gets a licence in 24 hours. But Mihin Air which is going to carry passengers in and out of the country and has to ensure compliance with international regulations gets a licence within 24 hours. On page 3 of Annex 1, Sir, it is stated, I quote: The above recommendation is made subject to the following conditions: (i) A minimum of US$ 100 Mn. should be invested in the project within a period of (02) years. (ii) At least 70 % income of the enterprise should be received in foreign currency. (iii) Prior to commencement of commercial operation of the enterprise approval should be obtained from the relevant authorities as stated in paragraph seven (7 ) above. Then, Sir, as you know this company was incorporated in September 2006. On the 12th of October 2006, it was presented to the BOI and on the 13th of October, it got the approval even without the Directors of the BOI knowing about it. On the 7th of November, an application had been made to the Civil Aviation Authority soliciting an AOC, Air Operator Certificate. All these have been done, Sir, without Cabinet approval. Then on the 20th of December, 2006 there had been a Cabinet Memorandum for its approval. Remember, Sir, money had been spent up to this stage. There were advertisements published; a Chief Operating Officer was recruited and the offices are located at the World Trade Centre and the BMICH. That is our hypothesis. On the monies spent by the Government, I would like a clarification by whoever Minister is going to reply on this matter.

Then, Sir, after the Cabinet Memorandum was presented to the Cabinet of Ministers on 20th December, 2006, whether it was approved or rejected is not known, suddenly on the 28th an application was sent to the Civil Aviation Authority saying that they would like to have an AOC, Air Operator Certificate. With this application made on the 28th, there were certain requirements that needed to be fulfilled. After the application was sent for an Air Operator Certificate, on the 4th of March 2007, a test flight was carried out by Mihin Air. The normal accepted procedure, internationally and locally is that we have to adhere to certain conditions which are listed down

* .

. Placed in the Library.

2007 23 2423 2424

- a checklist of specifications. This is not something followed internally but it is an international obligation. The aircraft should be less than 15 years old. The company should either have it purchased or on a dry lease. I will specify the difference between a "dry lease" and a "wet lease" while enumerating the conditions and before going on further, Sir. Then, the security of this Airline should be in the hands of the company. The fourth condition is that the international standards must be complied with and that is a bare minimum. Sir, there was on the 4th of March, a test flight carried out by Mihin Air using an aircraft which did not belong to it. It was a Fokker-27 owned by Expo Air in this country. That was the first violation that had taken place which was on the 4th of March. Then, the "Daily News" of 5th March states that a Fokker aircraft has carried out a test flight on the 4th of March, 2007 and it has been approved and passed. Even the Civil Aviation Authority did not know what was going on. The Daily News of 5th March, 2007 states, I quote: Mihin Lanka passes muster. That means the test flight has been approved. No such thing happened is what the Civil Aviation Authority told us - [Interruption.] ( )

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) ! ! Sir, all I am trying to say is that on the 4th of March this test flight was carried out with an aircraft not owned - [Interruption.] Remember this, Doctor, you may be a doctor of medicine, an ayurvedic doctor, a doctor in the dreams or whoever, but it does not matter. All I want to say is that there are international standards that need to be adhered to. Even a trishaw has to be accorting to a certain specification. On the 5th of March 2007, as I said the Daily News states that the flight passed muster. Then, Sir, on the 15th of March 2007, the Daily News states, I quote: Mihin Lankas first Airbus arrives at BIA That is, the Bandaranaike International Airport. It was a 161-seater airbus. Sir, this aircraft was manufactured on the 2nd of January 1992. So, it is 15 years old; it is not airworthy. The next one is that these are aircraft of the Balken Airlines which were stuck in Dubai and Sharjah during the last three to four years. What happened was, they had another test flight to Buddhagaya. In Buddhagaya when they flew in, there were certain mandatory checks that needed to be done, Sir. They had to fly at 6 o clock in the morning to Buddhagaya. The Civil Aviation Authority at Buddhagaya does not open until 8 o clock. So, this particular airline did not even have a knowledge of what is internationally accepted; that the Civil Aviation Authority at the airport they were going to land was closed at that time. Then, Sir, the Director-General of the Civil Aviation Authority had asked about this and he had got a negative answer. Then the - ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Mervyn Silva) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . . . trishaw -[ ] , . I am reading from the application. They had to fly at 6 o clock. They did not know, Sir, that it opens at 8 o clock. So, the pilot who carried out the first test flight of the airline which awaited international acceptance did not know that. Then the next one, Sir, is with regard to the

2007 23 2427 2428

category of the pilot. When you fly into a new territory, either he has to be a pilot who has flown into that area or seen a video recording which shows the environment and the weather in that area. Now, this particular requirement normally has to be complied with. So the Director-General of Civil Aviation had asked about this and he had been pounced upon by the Mihin Air as to why he had done so. The third matter, Sir, is that the security of the aircraft is in the hands of the company. This particular flight was ferried from Sharjah to Colombo. As a result, there were certain garbage in the aircraft. Now this shows a lack of security check. So the Civil Aviation Authority has questioned as to why the security check was not done. There was no answer given to that. Then, Sir, the most basic essence when an aircraft flies; the international norm is that a pilot is allowed to fly only 11 hours. Not only a pilot, even a normal cabin crew is allowed to fly only 11 hours. The first test flight to Buddhagaya breached this international norm. It flew for 14 hours. Now, this is a violation of international regulations. What do you say about this? Sir, because of this, the Director-General of the Civil Aviation Authority, a highly respected gentleman, Mr. Nimalasiri tendered his resignation to Mr. Lalith Weeratunga on the 20th. Why? Because he was forced to give a licence. He said, This is against my conscience. I have got to report to ICAO which is the international body which looks after the Civil Aviation in the world. Now, this particular organization carries out regular routine checks and they come and check the registers in Sri Lanka as to whether the requirements are complied with. Now, the breach of this has created a major problem in the international arena. So, as a result, Sir, he has tendered his resignation and he goes to the regional body which has its headquarters here as COSCAP. What an influence COSCAP has here? This Director-General of the Civil Aviation Authority is pressurized to give a civil aviation licence in 24 hours. Even before he thinks of a licence, the "Daily News" reports that the licence has been given. He has self respect, so he resigned.

( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) Who is the person? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Nimalasiri. You as a Cabinet Minister do not know that?

( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) From which post has he resigned?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) He has resigned from the post of Director-General, Civil Aviation Authority. He was supposed to sign and give the licence. He has tendered his resignation. I spoke to him. [Interruption.] Hon. Deputy Minister, [Interruption.] . . -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . , . . , . The Cabinet Paper was presented on the 20th of December 2006. This means that this Airline had borne a cost even before the Cabinet approval had come in. Then, the Budget did not allocate any money for Mihin Air. There have been no supplementary estimates submitted to this House to-date. There is no meeting of the Consultative Committee on Aviation to-date. Now, on this basis the EPF, the ETF and Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau were brought before the COPE and all of them said, We are not going to put a single cent into this particular Airline. I am *tabling Annex 2, Sir, the Cabinet Paper which highlights that the capital required is Rs. 1.5 billion. That is Rs. 1,500 million. This is contrary to the BOI Agreement which says that Rs. 3.6 billion is required. Now, Sir, the most important thing is that in order to get the aircraft off the ground, you have to either own it or have it on a dry lease or a wet lease. Now they have gone for a wet lease, Sir. Wet lease means that they cannot get the approval from the Civil Aviation Authority. That is why Mr. Nimalasiri resigned because it is totally against the accepted norm. Now, Sir, a normal dry lease would cost roughly about US Dollars 400,000 a month. Wages, US Dollars 40,000 and accommodation US Dollars 30,000 and the maintenance cost is roughly US Dollars 650 an hour with a minimum of 300 flying hours a month which is roughly US Dollars 195,000. The insurance is roughly US Dollars 35,000 a month which means US Dollars 700,000 for a dry lease. A Wet lease is more expensive. So, roughly you are looking at almost US Dollars 2500 - 3000 a flying hour. Now, any airline, Sir, whether it is old or new, has to fly

roughly around 10 hours a day to be economical. Flying on wet lease means a minimum of three months' advance has to be paid. At US Dollars 2,500 per hour x 10 hours is US Dollars 25,000 per day. For 30 days it is US Dollars 750,000 and for 3 months it is US Dollars 2.25 million. Then, Sir, the rest of the flying cost - fuel, aviation, office - all of them result in a cost to this company. Now, who has paid money for that to-date ? If no budget allocation has been under this Head; if this House has not got a supplementary estimate; if there has been no Consultative Committee meetings held to discuss this particular Airline, how on earth has money been spent on this Airline? We want this House to know that there is a severe lack of discipline in this country regarding public funds. This country's inflation is as high as 32 per cent. The budget deficit in this country is 9 per cent of the GDP. This country has no basic tenets of good governance. Today the Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi is being bullied and politically victimized for using a vehicle that is supposed to be on logs - that is - and he has been remanded for misuse of public property. Then as regards this matter where US Dollars five to six million of public funds has been spent which roughly amounts to Rs. 700 million, who is responsible? We want to know who the officials responsible are? They should be singularly and collectively held responsible. All what we ask is to ensure that this House be given a proper answer as to how money has been spent without Cabinet approval and without this House allocating money. All we want is public probity. If you think that tourism can come in by incorporating budget airlines, do not stop at one. Establish about 15 airlines if that is going to be a success. Today a foundation has been laid for an Airport in Weeravila without an environmental certificate which is a must. You have the Colombo South Port foundation being laid without berths being drawn up. Then you have the Moragahakanda Reservoir foundation being laid without capital being set apart for the implementation of the project. All we see is foundations and headlines to bolster the image of this Government. So on behalf of the people of Sri Lanka, we, in this House want to know who are responsible for this misuse of public property and as to how this has happened. Thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I will not take long. I think my good Friend, the Hon. Fernandopulle will be replying. I would like to ask one question. How was money allocated to this Airline? Because you will accept the fact that under Article 148 of the Constitution, Parliament shall have full control over public finance. So, if any money is to be allocated, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, Parliament has to approve it. He may say the Presidents Fund has given the money. I do not know. The President cannot allocate money even from the Presidents Fund. He has to submit the proposals to the Board of Directors and the Directors have to approve it. Be that as it may, even if money has been allocated by the Presidents Fund the Parliament has the right to know from where this money, Rs. 1500 million, was obtained. As far as we know, nothing was tabled in Parliament. [Interruption.] Yes. No information has been tabled in Parliament and we asked questions in the COPE as to how money was allocated and Mr. Karunajeewa, the Chairman of ETF denied that ETF had given any money. It is a requirement that approval be obtained from the Department of Civil Aviation. Also, if an airline is to be started they have to obtain Cabinet approval and

subsequently Parliamentary approval. So, can you start airlines without going through these procedures? I would like a clear answer because in the recent past there have been several abuses of public finance. The COPE Report revealed abuses amounting to millions. There is a VAT fraud running into billions. So, I would ask my Hon. Friend, the Jeyaraj Fernandopulle how can a go vernment start -[Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) ! .

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) We will leave it for another day. . , 1500 . , . . . , ; Auditor-General , , 5 . During the last four year period of former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the Directors of the Presidents Fund had not met and the Auditor-General has said that all the monies allocated during that period was illegal. The President does not have financial control. It is the Parliament that controls finance. Parliament , Parliament , .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. I am on my feet. The question that arises in this House, Sir, is that we have got to speak on the subject matter. Under Standing Order 84(5), we have got to speak on the subject matter. This is well outside the subject matter. We are talking of Mihin Air, Sir. We are not talking of anything else. So, I think, he has got his wires crossed. So, please correct him to get on to the right track, Sir.
