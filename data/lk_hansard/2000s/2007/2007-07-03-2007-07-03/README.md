( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, among the Members present here, I should and I know best what happened in the UNP. When this issue came up, we finally decided that we will consult all the other parties in the Opposition and act together with all of them, because it was the UNPs view that there must be a broad consensus among political parities in devising an electoral system. There were differences as to how to bring the First-past the-post system and what the break-up should be between the constituencies and the PR list. It is in accordance with that, that discussions were held. I must also say that the Chairman once wanted to know what our views were and we said, We are going to discuss with the others. As the Leader of the JVP Group in Parliament said, we had a discussion here in the lobby and I was asked to give our views. I was out and I told the Chief Opposition Whip to send a note because they wanted to know what the outcome was. So, that note was sent. If, by any chance it was made out that everyone had participated in drafting this, that is not correct. I asked the Chief Opposition Whip to send it. He sent it and he has explained that position very carefully. Since all the parties had decided that they were not participating, we, the UNP also decided not to participate. The Working Committee informed the Chief Opposition Whip and the Chief Opposition Whip informed the Members and none of them has signed it - neither the members of the JVP nor the TNA and many of the other parties concerned. That is the position of the UNP. Then, with regard to what has been said here, a Committee is a creature of the House. Because all 225 Members cannot sit here with you presiding, go into the details and get evidence of what should be done, a Committee was appointed. That is what a Select Committee is. Therefore, they have reported to the House, Sir. Now, the House is telling its creature, Take note of what we have said. The creature cannot tell the House, You tell us separately. Then, we will tell the House what to do. That is not so. This is on record. This is the official record. This must be taken cognizance of by the House later on. That applies not only to this Committee but also to any other committee of the House. Therefore, I would like to state this position and say that the UNPs position has been very clear. It has been expressed in this House and outside. That is why our Members did not sign it. We said, Do not rush this in. Not only the UNP, but also all the parties that did not agree did not sign this Report at all. Some of them have put a dissenting report. The parties in the Opposition did not even put a dissenting report because we felt that we are the majority and we cannot put a dissenting report when it is signed by a minority.

( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) . Sir, I would like to say a few words in English. There are no words to describe the plunder that is going on in this country. This Government is plundering the country to a standstill. On one side, they are taxing the people. On the other, they are distressing the workers through inflation and on another side, they are cheating the EPF. What they cannot tax, they steal by putting unknown gangs and goons and extort money through threats and kidnappings. When will this Chintana plundering stop? Today the Treasury is blundering about with the Budget, which has been forgotten. Sir, this House has been told untruths. The Budget promised a surplus on the current account. Half the year has gone. Is there a surplus? Sir, this Government cannot raise enough money to pay for its day-to-day expenses. A colossal untruth was told in this Parliament that Rs. 303 billion would be spent on public investment. How much of this has been spent? The Hon. Minister of State Revenue and Finance is not here. I would like to ask him these questions. How much of this Rs. 303 billion was spent? Has Rs. 150 billion been spent, has Rs. 140 billion been spent or has Rs. 100 billion been spent? It is time for you to answer these questions. Do not hide this from the House. Speak the truth in the House. Sir, this Government will spend what has been allocated for capital expenditure on fripperies and perks for this colossal Cabinet, on consultants from abroad and the local arena, on the thousands of jobs created for their henchmen and the advisers who have been given the power to advise this country to come to this position. We do not need the Tigers to destroy this country. At this rate, this Government is enough to destroy this country. Therefore, Sir, it is time they stop the wastage and we object to this wastage in this House. Thank you.

, "There was racial segregation and racial discrimination which you have fought and won. Now, there is peace and amity there. But in the case of Sri Lanka, in addition to racial discrimination and segregation, there is a calculated move to virtually to wipe us out. There is racial liquidation. The South African position in regard to racial segregation and racial discrimination is only skin-deep. In the case of Sri Lanka, it is soul-deep. We are virtually being wiped out . , " " . , " - U.N. Security Council - . , " . The Tamils are facing cultural genocide, physical liquidation and economic strangulation. There is a determined, calculated move by the Sri Lankan Government to totally wipe out the Tamil nation in Sri Lanka. I am therefore, appealing to the South African Government who is a member of the Security Council to come to our rescue. The UN Charter justifies third party intervention in situations of genocide. The right to revolt against oppression is also a part of the UN Charter. More than what I have mentioned, the right to self-determination is a cardinal principle in the UN Charter. It is in this context, a fervent appeal was made to the South African Government and to its people that they must come to our rescue in the hour of dire need and any undue delay and silence regarding the Sri Lankan Tamil problem would cause an adverse effect. This was echoed by me in Mauritius. Believe me, when I said it, the Foreign Minister of Mauritius said, We are with you. We cannot allow the people to suffer like this and virtually be wiped out." The South African Government, the Mauritius Government and all the other governments have come to our rescue in this hour. That is why the visit of the Hon. Douglas Devananda and Mr. Ananthasangare, to me was a fruitless venture.

'' , '' , '' , . . , , , . , . . , , . , I am all out to build up a nation; that is the life-ideal I have set for myself. The future generation is the foundation for the nation we hope to build. Therefore, I consider bringing up the future generation and molding its character and ideals as important as building up the nation. That is why I take so much interest in the future generation. My ambition is to mold a new generation of youth who will be architects of our countrys future. This new generation will be scientific-minded, patriotic, honest, decent, heroic, and possessed of a sense of honour, self-respect and dignity.

How do we preserve this? That is why our leader says, "Never can we give way to any kind of temptation for drinks. Drinks will bring ruination; not to individuals but to the nation". Once we spoke of China being victims of a kind of a drink. China was virtually sleeping and dying. China again revived when they gave up that drink. They said, China was a victim of opium. But China has now awakened and it is a power to be reckoned with. Whether my appeal will ever be heard or be cared of, I do not know. I do not believe Sri Lanka is a country. It is only an Island which consists of two clear-cut nations; the Sri Lankan nation and the Tamil nation. We can still live as co-partners and co-brothers preserving the essential unity or whatever we may speak of. But Tamil culture, Tamil language and Tamilian way of life have to be preserved and that can only be preserved if there is a total guarantee and recognition of the homeland of the Tamils. If that is not conceded, if there is going to be any device to virtually wipe us out, make us a non-entity, we cannot survive even in our own homeland. I do not know what the Government is aiming at. They must be clear in their thinking with regard to our future.

( . . ) (The Hon. M. K. Eelaventhan) Yes, Sir, with due respect to you I am winding up. I met the Hon. Prime Minister this morning. I told him, Only your conscience pricked when the Tamils were driven out from the Colombo lodges. You were the only man to apologize". What made you apologize I do not know, but you apologized. But none of the Government MPs or even the all-powerful Executive President, Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa ever apologized. His brothers conduct was still worse and the others said things which were a bundle of contradictions. But whatever we may say, the Prime Minister, whether his conscience pricked or not, said it. Therefore, if there is going to be a rethinking of that nature, there is some hope. But I doubt whether the Prime Minister can function independently against the all-powerful

I do not want to take more time than what has been allotted to me. The lesson that we learnt from South Africa, the lesson that we learnt from Mauritius or the lesson that we learnt from Singapore and Malaysia should be a classic example for Sri Lanka to rethink, reshape and reorientate its policy and allow the Tamils to live as co-partners, as co-brothers. Then there will be unity and diversity and not dull, monotonous uniformity. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Sir. I stand to speak on several Orders that have been presented today in relation to the economy of our country. But the sadness is that we only seem to be speaking here but nothing seems to be going into the deep skulls of the Members and Ministers of this Government. The Government today is desperately trying to collect more revenue in a failed State. We have Ministers such as the Hon. Fowzie and my good Friend, the Hon. Mahinda Wijesekara, whose ability is still to be tested. He is a person who has the potential but it is not being used. This Government is trying to impose taxes and trying to instil new types of revenue-gaining exercises, but all that is futile. We had a Budget that was presented seven months ago where the expenditure was roughly in the range of about Rs. 741 billion and they tried to show that there was a revenue of almost about Rs. 500 billion coming in. The revenues are way off the mark and the costs are galloping which will result in a Budget deficit of around 10 per cent. You know the cost of salaries alone is about Rs. 193 billion. Likewise, the payment on the debt apportionment is roughly around Rs. 169 billion. The interest component on the borrowed monies is around Rs. 190 billion; and the cost of pensions is roughly in the range of about Rs. 7 billion. When you add these alone, you will have about Rs. 600 billion just on five items. So, going on that basis,

Sir, we are confronted with a situation where five items of expenditure are taking almost 85 per cent of the Budget and that shows that there is no hope for this country. That is why we passionately say, please do not colourize this economy. The politicization of the economy has taken place to such an extent that there is no economy that is left. If you look at the annals of history, there has never been a period where such a lot of damage has been done during such a short time by such few people. That I think will go into history. We do not say this with relish but we tell our honourable learned Friends across the divide that the time has come to stop this nonsense, Sir. There is no point in our talking from this end and saying how bleak the future is. Every citizen in this country knows how bleak the future is. In that case, there has to be dignity and honour in the people who are governing. Those people must stand up and say, yes, this nonsense is enough and we have got to change the course. As Albert Einstein said, I quote: "Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex a n d more violent. It takes a touch of genius - and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction". That time has come, my dear Friends on the opposite side of the divide. Today, we are discussing an Order under the Finance Act, No. 11 of 2002 relating to Port and Airport Development levy, an Order under the Finance Act, No 11 of 2006 relating to motor vehicles concessionary levy, three Orders under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act, four Orders under the Excise Ordinance - one relating to excise duty on liquors that we import - an Order under the Sri Lanka Export Development Act and a Supplementary Estimate for my good Friend, the Hon. Mahinda Wijesekara. A question was asked in the morning as to what his wonderful Ministry does. If you read the Gazette poor Mahinda Wijesekara has nothing to do. I wish that he is engaged in doing something. Why are you not being used, Hon. Minister? This is a crime. [Interruption.] Time is running short. You have a couple of days left or may be a couple of hours left.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . . Is that a satisfying situation? Look at the Hon. Fowzie who is another hardworking person who works and puts things right. They remove him and put somebody else and then all that is destroyed. All the hard work he has put in goes down the drain. That is why it is better to remove the entire Government than remove one or two and ensure that an incompetent government is replaced by a competent government from the Opposition. Today every single party is there - [Interruption.] Please listen to me. You are the person who went to Janahanda and said that there is no cost of living in this country. A disgraceful act like that. Are you a Member of Parliament? Please, remember - , ? " " . . . , . . . , . Going on that basis, look at the situation that we are faced today.

You know as the Minister of Industries that you are having the biggest problem. Hayleys has to get Rs. 860 million as VAT refunds from the Inland Revenue Department. There is a company called MJF Exports, which is exporting tea that has to get Rs. 260 million from the Government. They say they cannot go in for investment unless the Government gives this money. Every month somebody comes from the Inland Revenue Department and says, pay money. So what is the purpose, Hon. Minister, in saying that we have got to increase the cess, the excise duties et cetera? What is the purpose? Please, as the Minister of Industries fight for your rights. The industries today are operating in a failed State. Now, Hon. Minister, look at the Financial Times which says Business confidence crashes in May. Then the June issue says, Business confidence dips even more than in May. Then it says, "Exports slacken, Imports soar in April." Imports increase, exports decrease. Then you are talking about the economy. "The economy is under fire." Who says this? Mr. P. B Jayasundera.

Not a single thing was done until we, the Members of the Committee on Public Enterprises brought it out. What is the meaning of this ? Why are you taxing the innocent consumers again? They are the ones who are paying taxes at the moment. You are taxing the persons who are paying taxes. The guys who do not pay taxes get off scot-free. That is the irony. That is the sin. That is why this is a failed State. I am so happy that even the JVP Members - may be not Wimal Weerawansa - like Anura Kumara, Lalkantha, Piyasiri Wijenayake, Vijitha Herath and even Somawansa say that the economy cannot progress without foreign investment. , , . . , . . . . . . . . .

Now, what is the meaning of this? This is what we have been saying right along. This is what we said during the elections. Now the situation has changed to such an extent and it has come to the very point which the United National Party said. So, Hon. Presiding Member, all what we want to say is, the hatred in politics must stop, duping the people must stop. We are passionately fond of our country. Our party, the United National Party has done most of the development work and has done a lot more in order to bring peace to this country. All what we are saying is, please ensure that this politicization process is not made a mockery. That is the reason why we, once again go on the basis of industries that are there. Look at the situation with regard to the tourism industry. It is absolutely - [Interruption.] . . The tourism industry is absolutely in the doldrums. Why do we say that? There are about a million people -

The shipping lines prefer to go to the Indian ports rather than come to Sri Lanka. This is going on and on. Look at the situation with the EU. The EU is threatening to withdraw the GSP labour which we obtained with great difficulty during the tenure of office of the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe. It is my bounden duty to mention that the two of us, the Hon.(Prof.) G.L. Peiris and I, managed to get this with the greatest difficulty. As a result the exporters from Sri Lanka are able to export at a cost of almost 20 per cent less than any other country. Now, that is in jeopardy. When we told them to ensure that this is protected, they did not even know what was going on. That is the situation. This will have an impact on the textile industry, on footwear and on ceramicware. I was made to understand by the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights that they will have to bring in 28 new legislations in order to protect this. There is only a one and a half months to do this. I do not know whether this

incompetent Government can do this in such a short time. So, ensure that we do not shoot ourselves in our own feet. If we want to develop Sri Lanka on a rapid basis and go forward, these things have got to be protected. Then, look at the cost of living. 27 . , . , .

( . . . - , ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie - Minister of Petroleum and Petroleum Resources Development) Sir, I am very happy to follow the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake who is always a person practical in looking at issues. He always took up the position that when the oil prices go up in the world market, the price of fuel must be increased. I was very sorry to listen to him today when he was criticizing the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation for increasing the prices.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, I said, Bring down the US Dollar. In the year 2000 the US Dollar which was at Rs. 112, we were able to bring it down to Rs. 90. If the US Dollar is brought down, you do not need to increase. That is what we are saying. . . .

( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) I have no status in that. The fluctuation in the world oil prices is more frequent now than ten years ago due to many reasons. This is the main reason for the fluctuations in the retail petroleum prices to the consumers in Sri Lanka at present. However, it is necessary to stabilize the retail petroleum prices to the consumers for extended periods in order to reduce the frequent variations in the prices of essential commodities and to control the inflation. Therefore, the target of the Government should be to find ways and means of stabilizing the retail consumer prices, essentially without burdening the CPC for that, as the viability of the State-owned CPC is an important factor in the countrys economic stability. Improving the productivity, efficiency and profitability of the CPC through proper management and reducing wastage, corruption, et cetera to the maximum are addressed. It is worthwhile to look at the cost structure of the petroleum products, the factors affecting the retail prices and areas where the cost can be reduced. Reducing the purchasing costs is one thing and cross-subsidizing essential fuels through profit-making subsidiaries of the CPC or using different taxation methods by the Treasury for this purpose is another method. These possible areas are discussed in detail in the following paragraphs in order to identify the most appropriate mechanism for short-term and long-term implementation by the Government together with the CPC to arrest this burning issue.

[ ]

2007 03 2033 2034

The retail prices of petroleum products are directly related to the world oil prices based on the daily published Platts Singapore prices and the prevailing exchange rate, which are the two major deciding factors of the purchasing prices of petroleum products. The world prices on CIF basis up to the Colombo Port contributes to around 85 per cent of the calculated retail cost prices for diesel and kerosene where the total taxes are around 5.5 per cent for diesel and 2.0 per cent for kerosene. This is different for petrol, where the CIF cost is around 58 per cent of its calculated cost price and the total taxes are around 33 per cent of its calculated cost price, due to the high excise duty and VAT liability. There are other charges to be paid by the CPC to outside institutions such as the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, Provincial Council Tax, the CPSTL terminal charges and the dealer margins. The CPC has to incur further costs such as commissions to be paid to the respective banks for opening LCs for the import of products and interest cost of working capital is involved in the imports. All these costs or charges are payable by the CPC to outside institutions when ordering and handling petroleum products and delivering to the end consumer through the islandwide dealer network. The above costs comprise of more than 97 per cent of the calculated retail consumer prices of these products, excluding the CPC's overhead cost, including the salaries with the allowed margin of 1.5 per cent for the CPC, if allowed to be sold at the calculated market price of each product. These are facts in the petroleum pricing by the CPC and there is very little anybody can do about it through productivity or efficiency improvements. The allocation for the total overhead cost of the CPC inclusive of its cost of salaries is only 40 cents per litre as an average of the above price calculations. However, the CPC has been able to maintain this cost per litre within the acceptable limits due to the high volume of sales, about 65 per cent to 70 per cent of the country's demand being handled by the CPC at present after the liberalization of the petroleum sector. However, this can become significant in the future if the CPC loses its market share to the LIOC and its volumes and revenue. It is obvious now that the CPC's costs at present are not significant in deciding the retail prices to the consumers in spite of the excess staff or other shortcomings in the system. The main areas of concern boil down to the purchasing prices at the world market and the exchange rate fluctuations. There are some areas in the cost structure I mentioned earlier which are controllable to a certain extent through different strategies. The key area within the purview of the CPC is cross-subsidizing the main fuels through subsidiary businesses of the CPC such as bunkering, lubricant blending and marketing, LPG marketing et cetera. Unfortunately, these profit-making subsidiaries of the CPC have been sold out from time to time by the

successive Governments, which has completely disabled the ability of the CPC of cross-subsidizing the fuels to the consumers. The CPC was gradually exposed to the world prices, which is the main reason for the present retail price fluctuations of fuel to the consumers. The CPC is presently planning to re-enter the bunkering business through a subsidiary company of the CPC, for which BOI approval has already been obtained. Then, hedging of crude oil and finished products such as diesel and petrol through a suitable hedging mechanism. It is important to hedge the total quantity of imports in order to have a significant impact on the retail price to consumers. The "Zero Cost Collar" option, which was adopted by the CPC at the first trial hedge has no cost, but the benefits are limited and therefore cannot make a significant impact on the retail price. A better option is the "Call Option" where the CPC has to pay a premium of about US Dollars 3 to 4 per barrel upfront, but the benefit is not limited or capped to the CPC if the world prices rise above the strike price. It is to be noted that hedging is not a profit-making business, but a risk management mechanism, which enables to maintain a constant retail price to consumers at a comfortable level over a longer period in spite of the world price fluctuations. But, at the same time, the consumers cannot expect retail price reductions every time when world prices come down as there is an additional cost to the CPC on every barrel of oil in assuring a stable price to the consumers. The CPC has gone through two successful hedges for 150,000 barrels of diesel per month for three months each, adopting the Zero Cost Collar option with the Standard Chartered Bank. The CPC is waiting for the next opportunity to hedge when the world prices come down again. The prices quoted through formal spot tenders to purchase petroleum products are based on an average price, monthly or five days as applicable, published by Singapore Platts with a premium over the Platts prices on a C&F basis. A better option is to negotiate with suppliers for term contracts for longer periods such as one year or more with a committed volume for purchase over the contract period, where it is possible to obtain discounts over the Platts average prices, as I mentioned earlier. The agreed discounts will be available to the CPC over the contract period irrespective of the prevailing prices in the world market, for a contracted petroleum product. The CPC has received offers to purchase auto diesel and crude oil on two term contracts with reasonable discounts over a period of one year, which are being processed now. This method is considered to be extended for petrol and furnace oil in the future. These are the only areas

( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) On international prices, we were losing Rs. 4.38 on petrol, Rs. 17.26 on kerosene, Rs. 4.86 on auto diesel, Rs. 8.69 on fuel oil 180 and Rs. 10.36 on fuel oil 380. The Committee headed by the Hon. Prime Minister discussed these matters very frequently with the Ministers concerned and decided to increase the fuel prices. It also recommended that a concession be given for three-wheelers and also a monthly allowance of Rs. 75 to the Samurdhi beneficiaries and fishermen. These recommendations have been made after careful study. The Government is spending a lot of money on this. As far as the Ceylon Electricity Board is concerned, there would not be an increase of tariff on electricity because the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation is supplying diesel to them at Rs. 55, losing Rs. 15 on every litre. We are expecting to recover this money by way of a subsidy from the Government. So, the electricity bill would not go up for the next six months. That guarantee has been given. Taking all these into consideration, I hope that the Hon. Members of this House would understand that the increase of the price of fuel is very reasonable. Thank you. : : Rest of the speech tabled : These are the only areas where the CPC can make some impact on controlling and reducing the consumer prices of petroleum products, in spite of the world price increases. Arresting frauds and minimizing wastage cannot make a significant impact on the retail prices for the

reduction of retail prices, as the petroleum retailing is a high volume, low margin business. But minimizing wastage and arresting corruption is of prime importance to CPC in view of maintaining discipline and accountability in the Corporation. The other strategies as indicated below require Government commitment and support for implementation.

It is a well known fact that the prices of most of the essential commodities go up in many fold with the slightest increase in petroleum prices. But they never come down with any reduction in the same petroleum product prices by the CPC. This has been the normal practice in the country when there are frequent fluctuations in the petroleum retail prices to consumers. It is therefore essential to stabilize the retail petroleum prices for longer periods by some way or the other, even if the world oil prices change. Malaysia, for example, adjust the texes with the fluctuations in the world price in order to maintain a constant retail price to the consumers for a longer period, realizing the above harmful impact to the economy due to frequent fuel price fluctuations. This cannot be done by the CPC alone, as the retail price revisions are very sensitive on the profitability and the viability of the Corporation.

One of the long terms strategies is the expansion of the CPC Refinery The CPC Refinery at Sapugaskanda is a valuable national asset. The Refinery is capable of producing only 50 per cent of the present country demand for petroleum products and the balance is imported as finished products at higher cost. Refineries are profitable most of the time, when the crack margins (price difference between the crude oil and the finihshed products) are more than five US Dollars a barrel or more. Therefore the expansion of the existing Refinery to produce the total countrys requirement of petroleum products helps the country in many ways. But the expansion of the Refinery to meet the total demand and the future cleaner fuel specifications need around US Dollars 700 million to be obtained through foreign sources. The only requirement to make this possible is a clean balance sheet for the CPC, with a strong pricing policy and a manageable State debt. If the Government realizes its obligations in this regard, the benefits to the country are as follows ;

* Final cost of petroleum products will come down and the retail prices could also be reduced to consumers accordingly. * Save foreign exchange on the difference of costs between the crude oil and the finished products to the country. * Supply security improves and procurement activities reduce. * Provides additional employment and allow the training of more technical hands for foreign employment who could bring in more foreign exchange to the country. * Foreign exchange exposure of the Central Bank reduces. * Congestion on the port reduces for import of many products at greater frequencies. * Strengthens the CPC in the present competition with the ability to market at lower prices to consumers. * Helps producing future specifications for better quality products meeting the environmental requirements for lower emissions.
