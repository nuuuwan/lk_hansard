. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Thank you Madam Chairperson. I am happy be. Able to say a few words in this Debate on the extension of the Emergency when you are presiding. I do not propose to reply to many of the comments that had been made by the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa on behalf of the JVP. Some of my Colleagues who will be speaking later in the day, I am sure, will make reference to some of the matters that he spoke about. I want to m Madam. Speak in particular with regard to the incident which occurred in Batticoloa on Tuesday, 27th February, 2007 and I wish to make the following statement in regard to that particular incident. The Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi the Tamil National Alliance - Strongly disapproves of the incident which occurred at Batticaloa on Tuesday the 27th of February 2007, in which several members of the International community were subjected to grave personal risk, consequent to heavy artillery fire, It is our firm view, that the said incident should never have occurred, and would never have occurred, if the necessary precautionary steps, according to accepted procedures, relating to such a visit by the International community had been taken. From all the evidence available, it is clear that such precautionary and preventive steps, according to such accepted procedures, were not taken. We wish to convey to the members of the International Community and all others present our deepest concern and wish to convey that we share the anguish caused to them. We are greatly relieved that the artillery fire terminated immediately the presence of the International Community was notified and that as a result thereof, the consequences were not as serious as they could have otherwise been. We have consistently interacted with the International Community relating to the Tamil question and the plight of the Tamil - speaking civilian population and wish to record our sincere appreciation of the concern they have always shown. We earnestly request that their efforts to alleviate the suffering of the Tamil speaking population and to evolve an acceptable resolution of the Tamil question should continue. Without in any way diminishing the gravity of this incident, it would be my duty to also record that since April 2006, Members of the International Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission and Members of International non governmental voluntary organizations have encountered artillery fire from Government controlled territory in the North-East. It is also indisputable that since April 2006, scores of Tamil-speaking civilians, largely Tamils but also Muslims, have been killed or grievously injured in the North-East as a result of heavy artillery fire from the Sri-Lankan security forces. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Sivanathan Kissor) Sir, I have been given 15 minutes. Give me two more minutes, please. , . , . , . . , , . . . ! , ! . ! ! ! . , .

( ) (The Presiding Member) , . .

( ) (The Hon. Sivanathan Kissor) Sir, give me one minute, I will wind up. . , . . . , , , , . . [3.22 P.M.]

( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa) Sir, today we are debating the extension of the state of Emergency. I was listening very carefully to the Hon.

Kissor who spoke before me. He was referring to certain incidents in the North and the East and said that his people, the people belonging to the Tamil community are not free to move even in Vavuniya. He also raised a pertinent question as to what we have achieved after going through this war for the last couple of decades. If somebody asks me whether there is any person who has achieved anything by this war, certainly my answer will be, "no" and our Governments answer will also be, "no". We, as a Government never believe in war. We believe that all the people whatever community they belong to, must have equal rights. They must have the right to move in any part of this country. Whether the Sinhalese people can move in the Jaffna Peninsula and the people in the Jaffna peninsula can move in Hambantota, Matara or Galle is an issue today. Although we do not believe that this war will give an answer to any of the questions that we are raising here or outside Parliament - but unfortunately there has been a war and whichever party is responsible for the war - I think there is a duty cast upon the Members who are present in this august Assembly to find a solution. We may not be able to find a solution in the jungle, we may not be able to find a solution in any part of the world other than in Sri Lanka, this is what I personally believe. As the Hon. Member suggested, there is only one solution. That is through a political negotiation and nothing else. We are praying for it. We are pleading with the Hon. Members of the TNA. We also concede as a Government that we believe in a political negotiation and nothing else. Now, there is no doubt that the people living in different parts of the country are facing enormous problems due to various factors; economic problems, sometimes administrative problems and sometimes political problems. To my knowledge, the people in the North and the East are suffering due to various reasons. But, at the same time you must concede the fact that the people living in other remote areas are also suffering due to the same reason. Therefore, if one community thinks that just because he belongs to a particular community he is suffering, that is wrong. But I am not flatly denying that. That kind of discrimination has been there from time to time due to various contributory factors. What I believe is that more than the administrative problems and the political issues, the reason for this misunderstanding, the reason for this problem is the loss of trust among the communities. Earlier, during our young days we lived quite happily. Traders from Jaffna were doing their business in remote areas like my village Walasmulla, and in Hambantota and Matara. But, unfortunately today we cannot see any Tamil traders in those areas. Similarly, when I visited Jaffna in 1980, about two to three decades ago, I found many Sinhalese people doing business there. I met Sinhalese people who had come from Tangalle and settled down in Kankesanthurai. I also met some people in Valvettithurai. This is an unfortunate situation. If we can sort out this problem without making allegations

1421 1422

against each other, that is good. But, it will not happen. It has never happened in any part of the world in history. This war menace is not only in Sri Lanka. With this globalization, with the powerful government sectors being set up in rich countries especially in the American and European Continents, the war exists.

Today, this whole world has been cursed by somebody, whoever the God you believe in and as a result of that everybody is suffering. We do not endorse the fact that the people should suffer, whether they belong to the LTTE, the TNA or whatever party. As a result of this ongoing conflict, it is not only they who are suffering but everybody, even a pauper on the street. We also suffer when buying a loaf of bread or a kilo of dhal or sugar. The Defence Budget is going up every year like a rocket. Why is that? That is because that we do not have trust among the communities. If the Sinhalese people can trust the Tamil people in the North-East and similarly if the Tamil people can trust the other people, this problem can be sorted out. We also must not forget one important fact. It is only 45 per cent of the Tamil community who live in the North and East. Fifty five per cent of them live in various parts of the country other than in the North and East. I do not say that they are living happily but at least, they have a right to live and they live without major problems.

How can we sort out this problem? We will have to build up confidence. We must take examples from various other countries in the world. For example, in India, today the President is from the Muslim community though when you take their country's population, the Muslim community is less than 20 per cent. Although he belongs to a minority community he has become the President of the country. Take the Prime Minister of India, Dr. Manmohan Singh. He represents the Sikh community though percentage-wise his community is less than two per cent of the country's population. Then, take the President of the Congress Party. She is not even originally a citizen of India . Why has that culture not been developed in this country? One can blame the Government or curse the Government or the other communities that due to some fault they have been neglected or discriminated but that is wrong. If we have to build up trust, confidence, it cannot be done ex parte. It has to be bilateral. If there are three communities it has to be trilateral; trilingual. Now, unfortunately in our Parliament, this system has not been encouraged up to a satisfactory level. Traditionally what has been followed in this august Assembly is to make allegations against each other without finding a solution to the problem.

( ) (The Presiding Member) , .

( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa) Finally, I thank all the parties who had supported the extension of the state of Emergency because that is a duty cast upon the Government.

( ) (The Presiding Member) , .

( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa) Sir, I will take only one more minute. When a Government is elected by the people, the main benefit that the people expect from the Government is protection. Therefore, whatever Government comes into power, the prime and fundamental duty on the part of that Government is to give protection to the people irrespective of their political differences and political ideologies because a Government is elected for that. At the same time, we hope that the Hon. Members of the TNA will contribute immensely to sort out this problem. As the Hon. Kissor stated, we need to have a political dialogue, we need to have a political discussion and we need to negotiate. The Government is willing to negotiate. We are extending our hand for peace. Please help us; we will get together and sort out this problem. Thank you very much for granting me this time. [..3.33]

. ( . ) (The Hon. T. Kanagasabai) , . . , . , .

. , . , , , , , , , . , . Cricket match runs ? ? . , , , . , , . . . I am representing the Batticaloa District. You know that there is a viharaya in the Batticaloa Town itself. There is a priest living in that and he is leading a very peaceful life. He preaches to the people. In fact, he is well looked after by everybody. So, you cannot say that there are no Sinhalese people in the North and the East. There are people, there are priests, and things are going on smoothly. You were talking about the Tamil people. They are very efficient. They are peace-loving, hard-working and honest people. There were several riots in this country in 1977 and 1983. But, they did not hit back. They only ran back to their homelands: Jaffna, Batticaloa, Trincomalee or wherever it was. You were talking about trust. We must have trust. You know what happened to the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact. It was signed about 50 years back and that was torn up due to the agitation of the Buddhist priests in this country against that. What happened to the Dudley Senanayake-Chelvanayakam Pact? The Tamils were co-operating with the majority Sinhalese people to achieve Independence for our country. So, all this time, they have been working along with the majority Sinhalese people. If you study the history of the last 100 years, it would be very clear. I need not mention their names because we have erected statues of theirs in the old Parliament premises and in many other places. Therefore, on the part of the Tamils, there has been politeness. They worked very cordially with the majority

1433 1434

and it is up to you - you are the majority - to help the Tamils. You must take them along with you. It is because of you, the majority, that we are suffering in this country. So, you cannot blame the Tamils for this present course of action. They were committed to ahimsa, fasting, staged hartals and everything but they failed and finally they took this course of action. I want to make a correction to what my Colleague, the Hon. Suresh Premachandran, said. He said that in India, Muslims are 20 per cent of its population. If I remember correct, they are 10 per cent and the Sikhs are less than 2 per cent. The question that the Hon. Suresh Premachandran asked was whether the Sri Lankans would allow a Tamil person to be the President of this country? He is also a citizen of this country, is he not? Would you allow that? Would that happen? Then only we can accept that this is a united Sri Lanka. In a united Sri Lanka, you must allow a Sri Lankan to have that opportunity, even a Tamil. Even a Sinhalese who is not a Buddhist, you would not accept. So, in this present world, we must realize that we belong to one breed - we are all human beings. We must be kind to others. Our Hon. Minister went to Australia. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Kanagasabai, I think the Hon. Sri Kantha has to speak for four minutes. . ( . ) (The Hon. T. Kanagasabai) No, no. I am very sorry, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I was allotted 15 minutes.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Then, the Hon. Sri Kantha will have no time to speak. . ( . ) (The Hon. T. Kanagasabai) No, no. I am not going to give in.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Okay. You carry on.

. ( . ) (The Hon. T. Kanagasabai) I want to say this. Hon. Minister, you went to Australia and you are -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! The Hon. Speaker will now take the Chair. , . , , . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair and MR. SPEAKER took the Chair . ( . ) (The Hon. T. Kanagasabai) Hon. Minister, you know the present situation in this country. Why do you not allow those people to go out of this country? There is no problem for you. Secondly, I will say this also in English. I want to tell the Hon. Prime Minister that the day before yesterday alone 5097 internally displaced people from 1497 families from the Western Coast came to my Electorate, Pattiruppu. What happened was, there was shelling and because of the fear of shelling old people, young people and children have come with only whatever they could carry in their hands. So I earnestly request the Hon. Prime Minister, Please stop this shelling. What is the point in resettling 200 families? My Colleague also earlier said that there is no point in doing that. What you give with your right hand, you take back from the left. You resettle 200 families and displace 1497 families in one day. What happened to the people in Sampur and Trincomalee? They have all come back to our District. Little by little you have pushed them to our districts. The burden is on our Government Agent and other people. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , ? . ( . ) (The Hon. T. Kanagasabai) Hon. Speaker, I am staying in the Madiwela quarters which has two toilets. But there I hear, for 1000 people there is only one toilet. So the people go abroad. In Australia, I am sure they are provided shelter, toilets and they are given very good food and other facilities. In our country, you may have seen on television, how these people come on their push bicycles. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . ( . ) (The Hon. T. Kanagasabai) They have lost their shelter and whatever property they had. They have no education. You know -

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) Hon. Speaker, I would like to make the maximum use of the three minutes that have been allotted to me. I would only like to issue a warning to the Government in clear-cut terms in relation to the continuing military operations in the North-East. The continuing aerial attacks on civilian targets in the guise of hitting the LTTE installations together with the military build-up in the Manalaru region, Mr. Speaker, I would like to state without any hesitation, is going to push the country into another war. The situation is very critical. I would only appeal to the Government to reconsider the military campaign and to revert back to the negotiating table. This is the message on behalf of the Tamil National Alliance I, with all due respect to the Hon. Members of the House, would like to issue to the Government today. The situation is very critical. It is easy to start a war but it would be very, very difficult to stop it. Let it be very clear. I thank you, Mr. Speaker. [.. 4.10] ( )

( - ,

) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva - Minister of Healthcare and Nutrition and Leader of the House of Parliament) , . , . . , . . . , . He sent a very alarming signal to the Government. I must tell him, Sir, that this Government is not jittered by these signals. We know what we are doing and where we are going. We have a clear vision on the peace process and a clear vision on bringing peace to this

country. Therefore, I must tell him that they must give an alarming signal to the LTTE. They must not engage in a war. We do not want war. We want to ensure that the path for peace is cleared. Therefore, I must tell that to the Hon. Members of the TNA. They have been speaking so much about violence and displacement. Who is responsible for that? ( ) (Hon. Members) You, you. ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) It is the LTTE. Because of the actions of the LTTE, they have brought misery to the people in the North and East. They have killed more Tamil people than Sinhalese people in this country. Fifty four per cent of the Tamil people live in the South. [Interruption.] We know, unless they shout like that they cannot go back to their own places. That is why they are shouting. So we are not angry with you. We know your plight, we know your situation and why you are shouting. So, we will pardon you, do not worry. [Interruption.] , . 83 . , . . 22 . , . , 30,000 40,000 ; . . . . , . , , . .
