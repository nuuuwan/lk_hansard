I have met him only once or twice. I do not know why they are making allegations here because all we know is that already two or three Members of this House from the Government side, Minis-ters, made allegations of threats on their lives and they were removed from their posts. So, do you think he is going to come and make a statement? To begin with one of the Members who said that there is a threat on his life is now being put back as a Minister without having with-drawn the allegation. So, what are you talking of?

But, there are two annexes regarding the privatization of the Insurance Corporation of Sri Lanka and the sale of 90 per cent shares of the Lanka Marine Services Limited; these two matters are still subject to investigation by a subcommittee of five Members consisting of two Members from the Government and three Members from the Opposition. The subcommittee has not yet finalized its report. Therefore, while taking responsibility for the full Report, the responsibility for the two annexes cannot be taken by us because these two have not yet been finalized by the subcommittee and even I am not sure as to what will be the recommendations of the subcommittee. I find that there is a recommendation on one of the annexes also. But, I have to put it on record that there is no such recommendation made by the subcommittee as far as the Lanka Marine Services Limited or the Insurance Corporation of Sri Lanka is",

Some newspapers or some people through the newspapers are trying to portray that these relate to current affairs. Let me just go into one or two areas. Take the Bank of Ceylon for example. We have been talking about Rs. 127 million that had been paid to a foreigner, a market consultant or a banking consultant, but the end result was the market share of deposits being 22.89 per cent in 2001 had dropped to 19.14 per cent in 2005. This is what has happened by paying Rs. 127 million to one Mr. A.R. Bernard, a foreigner to give us advice. But, when did this start? In the year 2001. I am sure that all of us are aware as to which government was in power at that time and who the Minister of Finance was at that time. Therefore, let us make it clear when we are debating this COPE Report. I am thankful to the Hon. Members, especially the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella from the UNP and the Hon. Piyasiri Wijenayake, the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti and the Hon. Anura Dissanayake from the JVP who have been playing a major role together with the Hon. Members of the Government in the COPE. There we have worked impartially and without any sort of party allegiance. We have been working impartially looking at the institutions for the greater good of the country. We have looked at it as Members of Parliament, as Members who are mandated by the people of Sri Lanka to look after their interests. That is the reason behind our submitting a report without mentioning any dates. We did not want to state in which years these were done and under whose Government. So, let us discuss this Report. Let us find ways and means to stop these sorts of things. We are not only making allegations of corruption. What we are talking of is mismanagement. There are areas where the institutions could have and should have had better management. We have found that and today also we heard how the internal audit departments were not allowed to function. We have found that some of these reports when we investigated were on recommendations made by the Department of Public Enterprises of the Ministry of Finance. That shows us that even the Ministry of Finance has been on its toes. They have been looking at things. But, unfortunately what has happened is, down the line somewhere things have not gone right. It is for us today as elected Members of Parliament to look into these things and find ways and means on how we can lessen the burden on the people by reducing the waste that is there. Certain things are continuing. For example, take the Board of Investment. That is subject to a long report here. The Board of Investment, according to our report, does not have the monitoring capacity. They have not been monitoring the imports into the country and the relevant exports. Why? The reason we found was they have only",

These are matters which we would like to put straight. Of course where there have been instances of corruption, we have shown them irrespective of whether they were by the UNP Government, PA Government, Parivasa Government or whatever. Take for instance the Merbok issue. It is one of the greatest frauds committed in this country. What is the agreement we entered into with Merbok MDF Lanka (Pvt) Ltd.? According to the agreement if India imposes any taxes or import duties, BOI is to reimburse that party. Have we ever heard of that sort of an agreement entered into with a company? BOI is an institution that is primarily responsible for looking after the interests of Sri Lanka. The other thing is, it is to a private company these concessions have been granted. According to the agreement, in case Sri Lanka increases electricity rates, the BOI is to reimburse that company. But there is no mention that if that company makes additional profits due to prices going up in India they will pay additional taxes to the Government. It does not talk of those things. We were told that this was not done by the present Chairman but by a previous Chairman and we got down that Chairman. I do not mind mentioning the name; one Mr. Thilan Wijesinghe. He came and said that he did not have access to the relevant papers and therefore he cannot reply to that. So, this is the sort of people whom we have had to work with. Let us look at this. We are bringing these up not to show that these were done during our Government or the UNP Government. What we want as Members of the COPE is to show that we work together for the betterment of the country and forget that we are sitting across the isle on two sides. At certain times we found allegations against some government servants. The Hon. Member who spoke before me spoke about declaration of assets and liabilities. I think he is not aware that all staff officers are supposed to submit their declarations of assets and liabilities. Not only that, even the union leaders are supposed to submit and they have been submitting. So, I think he may have to correct himself on that. There was an allegation that Dr. P.B. Jayasundara does not attend meetings. I think, except for one occasion when we called him he attended most of our meetings. But that Member was mainly talking about the Public Accounts Committee. I listened to him but half the time he was speaking about the Department of Inland Revenue. I would suggest to that Member, as the COPE has already submitted its first report, that they take up these matters at the Committee on Public Accounts and ensure that their report is also submitted to Parliament so that we could be aware of what is happening even in government departments. Then if we find that government",

In the morning there was a request to appoint a Select Committee because it has taken such a long time for the COPE to submit its report of 26 institutions. It should be borne in mind that this Report was submitted to Parliament seven months after the appointment of the Committee on Public Enterprises. On every Sitting day COPE has been meeting from 2 o clock to 5 o clock. On certain days we have been there the whole day because the subcommittee was sitting in the morning. Therefore, I feel it is very unfair for people to say that it has taken a very long time for 26 institutions to be investigated because sometimes there were occasions when one institution had to be called on two or three occasions. I must also refer to a matter that was raised by the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle this morning and various remarks were made about a newspaper article on our Chairman. It was implied that he has been threatened and he has had to leave the country. I can categorically state - I am a very close friend of our Chairman - that about 10 days before he left he told me that he would be going on a Parliamentary delegation. One Member from the COPE and one Member from the PAC - I think the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara from the PAC - have gone on a Parliamentary delegation. Therefore, when the Member said, Let him come and say that he had not been threatened and he did not go due to fear, it is unfair to cast any aspersions on him that he got frightened and went off. He is not a man who would get frightened of threats. If he is a person to be frightened of threats he would not have submitted this Report to Parliament nor would any Member of the COPE have subscribed to this Report if we were going to be frightened by threats. Let me tell you that he is expected tonight and most probably will be here to reply to all the people who have made various allegations in the newspapers against him and the COPE. There have been some instances where we had to be very critical of the officers. For instance, the BOI officials tried to mislead us. Of course they have subsequently apologized. The Chairman of the BOI came before this Committee and submitted a report saying that this was the Corporate Plan of the BOI. Subsequently when it was shown to them with proof that this was only a report for an internal seminar, he apologized for having misled the Committee. The Chairman was appointed by us, but we took them to task. In the same way, we also saw that the Central Bank has been mentioned very prominently in the newspapers. A good thing that has come out of this Report is that the Governor of the Central Bank has taken action to put straight most of the issues that were raised by the subcommittee. They have already started regularizing the",

    "text": "micro finance companies coming under the proposed Micro Finance Institutions Act. Out of the sum of Rs. 2.7 billion that was due as capital they have already recovered 20 per cent amounting to Rs. 413 million. For that, I must pay a tribute to the new Governor of the Central Bank for the way he came before the Committee and took responsibility. Only two officers came before the Committee and took responsibility for their institutions. One was Mr. Lalith Weeratunga when he represented the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority and the other one was the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Ajith Nivard Cabraal who said that though they were not there during the period under review, they take full responsibility and they will try to put straight if there have been any lapses on the part of their organizations. This is what I, as a Member of the COPE, would like to recommend to all the public officers. Even we, as Ministers must take responsibility for what took place in the institutions under us prior to our taking office. Before I wind up, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to state that some attention has to be paid to the staffing of the COPE and PAC office. The staffing level at the COPE and PAC office is very low. We have seen the poor staff of the PAC and COPE working from 10 oclock in the morning at the PAC meetings and then starting at 2 oclock carrying on till 5 p.m. or 5.30 p.m. at the COPE meetings. They are expected to have the verbatim reports and all the reports ready by the next day for the other committees. This is something, Hon. Deputy Speaker, you may have to look into with the assistance of the Secretary-General and the Hon. Speaker to ensure that there is better staffing so that the good work that is being done by the staff of the COPE and the PAC could be carried on in a better way. Thank you very much. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Eelaventhan, you have ten minutes.",

    "text": "( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for giving me this opportunity to speak on a very important topic, the findings of the Committee on Public Enterprises. Being a Chartered Accountant and a Member of this august Assembly for the last 13 years and being a Member of the COPE for all those 13 years, I rise with quite a lot of heartburn. I think, we are converting this Parliament into just a talk-shop. The Executive Presidency and Parliamentary system are brought almost next to nothing with the reports that have been submitted to this Parliament. Both sides tried to project that these findings relate to a particular period. I would like to arrest that at the very outset itself by saying that these are the findings from year dot, through out all the administrations. But we have focused on the last decade for practical reasons. And I must say with all",

    "text": "honesty that the Executive Presidency of this country for the last 13 years has always been held by the Peoples Alliance. I do not want to convert this for a moment into a political debate but certain facts are absolutely undeniable. We need to grapple with this situation because this country is in dire straits. The economy is dead and gone. There is no management in this country from the Executive down to the very low clerical grade and this august Assembly today is fighting for survival because there is a wilful distortion that is going on. From the time we get up to ask questions from the Ministers to the time we leave at the end of the session we find that there is deceitfulness, a lack of genuineness and concern for the countrymen. That is why, I would like to say that this is not only corruption, but also misuse, political vandalism, and a lack of foresight. The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and the Committee Members have done their very best in trying to bring this report on 26 institutions and make known to the general public. But I would also like to go back to history and ask as to what action you have taken on the Hon. John Amaratungas report that was tabled on the 19th of June 2000. Absolutely nothing has been done. Then, we go on to the period of the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama who submitted three reports on the 9th of September 2004, on the 22nd of June 2005 and then, finally on the 8th of November 2005. Absolutely nothing has been done. We basically try to catch the small fish when the mighty ocean is full of large ones. So, what is the action taken on the reports that have been presented earlier? Then finally, in the Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshes report which was presented on the 12th of January 2007, names of certain ministers have been mentioned. They were in the Opposition and then, they have become Ministers after the report has been submitted. What is going on in this country? If it starts from this House itself, where are we going to stop this? I speak with no malice but I want to be brutally frank being a Chartered Accountant. Otherwise, they are just wasting our time. The outside people are looking at us and projecting us as a bunch of idiots who are talking just for the sake of wanting to be represented here. We have got to change this culture. We have got to professionalize it. Ten or fifteen people are enough to make this country and let us take that stance. I have been subjected to much harassment for being forthright, for doing what I feel is best for the country and I need to highlight those at this particular moment. What have you done to one of the best Auditors-General that this country has produced, Mr. Mayadunne? He has come through the rank and file and produced a report that was absolutely professional; not bowing down to the pressures of the political hierarchy. It was presented to the Ministry of Finance on the 1st of June 2005 and no action has been taken. There are VAT defrauders to the tune of Rs.3.4 billion. The State has still not been able to file indictment and they languish in jail. Do you think that it is an act committed by themselves only? Is it not a coalition of many people who have got",

But we also want to see from where this stemmed. Therefore Sir, all we can say is let us get moving in this matter. The Report which presented shows very clearly - I am making an oversight before I go into each independent institution - that there is a handful of deceitful public servants who are ruining this country. For the simple reason that they are not inside this House, I do not want to mention their names because I do not think it is right to keep bashing certain officials but I have to use certain titles. I would say that when they hold those type of office it is an occupational hazard. If we do not identify them, we will also go down as just superficially arguing with a political bias. The next matter is that the Boards of Directors appointed to these institutions are highly politicized. Some members do not have the ability to act the role that they are supposed to play. They have been appointed, as political appointees, to some very important institutions and they do not even understand as to what they have been appointed for. That is a very clear message that came out through the investigation. We have gone into almost 72 institutions. The Report which has been published refers to only one-third of that, that is, 26 institutions. But they are very important institutions. Likewise, the cost benefit analysis has been ignored on all matters. That is a criminal act. Today they deal with privatization loosely and I think it is our responsibility to ensure that we take proper financial decisions on behalf of our citizens. They are languishing. They are looking for leadership. Just to sing hosannas for His Excellency the President does not help in any way. I would like to mention what His Excellency the President said - I salute him for saying so - in his Independence Day message. He said, I want the people who would tell me brutal facts rather than singing hosannas for dinner. That was His Excellency the President, Mahinda Rajapaksa telling live to the people on the 4th of February 2007. I only hope he walks the chalk. There is no point telling if he does not do it. I believe that he has the will to do so. If that is the case why is he not doing it, is one of the questions that I would like to pose. Mrs. Chandrika Kumaratunga for 11 years made a complete mess of this country. When I told this at that time that we dared that system, people tried to character assassinate us. Finally what happened? Today the very people who got up and shouted against us, now when she is not in power are shouting against her. What spineless creatures are they? We had the guts to say it then and we have the guts to say it now. But all what we want to say is, let us not politicize issues. Let us get to the basic issue.",

Of that, the recurrent revenue is Rs. 35 million, the capital grant is Rs. 48 million and the balance Rs. 18 million is recouped from savings. Then, they had the audacity at the same time to give a cost budget which shows Rs. 49 million as emoluments and Rs. 10 million as administration cost which basically means the recurrent cost is greater than the recurrent revenue. When we asked them to substantiate as to how they are going to collect the Rs. 18 million that is in deficit, the controller who came was unable to answer. That is the plight of the institutions we are talking about. So, if Parliament is wasting time in dealing with such an institution which has a capital base of about Rs. 45 million and is unable to answer this type of basic question, what are we doing, Sir? This is why I say that all the time we spent on this would be wasted and the investigations would just flow under the bridge if nothing is done.

There is no point in just bashing the officials if there is no political will displayed. That was one of the problems. We had certain Chairmen who were brilliant. Unfortunately, they said that when they consulted the Minister, there was no interaction between them and as a result major institutions were unable to have a policy direction. A couple of such institutions were the Ceylon Electricity Board and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. I am not talking of last year or the previous year. I am talking of the last seven to ten years. But, cumulatively we have a situation where in my estimation, over the last five or six years this country has lost Rs. 500 billion.

So, I call upon the President to use his powers and drastically reduce this number to about 25 to 30. You can see that with five or six Ministers you can run a country. So, what is the purpose of politicizing this? This is government money. This is not a State-paid holiday for the office-holders. All we want to say is, ensure that this is corrected. Sir, I take this opportunity to table* a Private Members Motion that I hope to move in this House, in which I state that what is best for this country is a Cabinet of around 25 Ministers. The President should not hold any ministerial portfolios. He should be supervising all the Ministries while the Prime Minister controls those. So, we must have an effective Cabinet of 25 Ministers. Due to lack of time I table this with your permission, Sir, as Annex 1. Sir, in 1948 we gained Independence and we talk of the glorious past afterwards. But, have we moved forward?

Sir, if you look at the Foreign Direct Investment, we in Sri Lanka are boastfully talking today of an FDI of US Dollars 361 million with certain capital investments running into several hundred million US Dollars on a BOT basis. Sudan is a country which has brought in US Dollars 1,511 million last year. So, what are we talking? Where is Sri Lanka?

    "text": "gone overseas - to the Middle-East. In 1999, we had a per capita debt of US Dollars 14,000 and in 2004 it has gone up to US Dollars 27,000. It is only the external debt factor. Where is this country heading? If you look at the external debt, in 1994 it was US Dollars 5,863 million and today it is US Dollars 10,886 million. So, these are the decision-making institutions on which we have given a report: the Central Bank, the Peoples Bank and the Bank of Ceylon. All of them have played a role and been part and parcel of the process in running down the economy of this country. Members come and go; governments come and go, but the people keep on paying for the sins of the bad implementors who had been there. The United National Party had been governing this country. We may have had our faults, but certainly we have done yeoman service to this country. The Governments that came to power after that, be it during President Chandrika Kumaratunga's days or today, would not have survived if not for the rock solid economy that was established then. The solidification of the economy by us was the only way to move forward. Sir, I am tabling* a chart titled \"Export Competitiveness is dropping\" as Annex 2, which shows how the export competitiveness in this country has been drastically dropping. I am not presenting documents haphazardly prepared. These are documents that have received the attention of the business circles, the Chambers of Commerce, the World Bank and the IMF, which closed down its office and went out of the country. They see that Sri Lanka has lost its future. There is no will to go forward; there is no will to govern, but simply existing; a day-to-day survival, is what they see. The export competitiveness has been significantly dropping from the year 2004. That is what is happening. Therefore, I table this document and want it to be included in Hansard because just placing it in the Library would not serve any purpose. Then, in regard to the inflation factor, today if you want to run an effective economy in this country, you have to control the major factors. That is, you have to have a low inflation rate. Today we are talking of an inflation rate of 20 to 21 per cent. You have to have a low interest regime. Otherwise, there is no other way you can compete in a world that does not have any boundaries today. In a boundaryless society, we must maintain our interest rates absolutely low, Sir. When you have the Treasury Bill rate almost at 12 per cent, when the inflation rate is at 20 per cent, how do you allow and help our investors to compete in the region? India is on the move; China is unconquerable; the Asian region is moving fast and you have countries like Taiwan that gives interest free loans. We have got to control inflation. Obviously, interest rates are used to control",

During the two-year tenure that I happened to be the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, trade expanded; the cost of living was brought down. They laughed at that time. Today they are paying for the sins, for the sarcasm they showed then. Again, I am tabling** as Annex 4 a graph which gives the cost of living during the periods the UNP controlled, which was for just two years, and the UPFA controlled. I am not talking about 1977 to 1994, but of the period thereafter, Sir. If you look at the cost of living during the periods 2002 to 2004 and 2004 to 2006, Sir, you would see that after 2004, it has been galloping, uncontrollable. That is not only for the simple reason that they had been unable to govern. There was no will to govern; there was corruption at every corner. Even though they tried to point a finger at us, today the same people are begging mercy from us for the wrong statements they made. As my leader very categorically mentioned yesterday when he addressed the Chambers of Commerce, if we want to have a semblance of growth in this country, if we are to move this country forward, we have to have durable peace and in order to have peace, you must have an economy that supports it. There is no point in having a war, which is damaging to the economy and on the other side, talking of peace while having an escalation of war. That is exactly what is going on. Peace is an important component in the country's development. If we want peace, we have to ensure that the economy is strong. If we lose the economic war, we have lost all wars. At the end of the day, a complimentary report of the Committee on Public Enterprises stems from good governance and good governance has simply eroded; it is non-existent. There was the Seventeenth Amendment that was brought before Parliament for good governance in this country. Today it is non-existent. We need foreign ambassadors to tell us that the Seventeenth Amendment should be implemented. What a shame, Sir! We talked with the American Ambassador. I appreciate his forthrightness. He, looking at Sri Lanka and seeing that it was across the board decision - the UNP, the JVP and the Peoples Alliance got together in 2000 and brought the Seventeenth Amendment thinking at least it would help to depoliticize this - said this. But, no, the Executive ran through that and completely ignored the implementation of the Seventeenth Amendment. Sir, I quote from the \"Daily Mirror\" of 9th February, 2007. The US envoy wants commissions revived",

So, there is no point saying, this was done during the UNP time or the PA time. For fourteen years, this country has been under the Presidents of the Peoples Alliance. So, this needs to be corrected. Then, Sir, the military expenditure. We have been talking of military successes. We salute it if there would be a military solution. We do not want, for a moment, to talk of this because it would be used in the same way to say that we are coming up with it at a moment when the war is being fought. We want a war that is being fought by the Generals, not an election-oriented war. That is what we want to mention basically. Two very senior Members of your Government are talking the truth today. We have been speaking of this from 1994 and they have a sense of honesty to speak up at least today. After fourteen years, they have seen the reality and spoken of that. We want that to be investigated. The Chief Opposition Whip yesterday did ask a question. The answer that came from the Hon. Prime Minister was, Go and ask the Hon. Member who said so. He did not categorically deny it. He only said that to his knowledge there is no such thing. It would be interesting to see the revelations of that during the next couple of days. I am tabling* Annex 5, Sir, to show the drastic increase in military expenditure which has led to a drastic increase in corruption. Today, a public company has been incorporated for the handling of military expenditure. That is yet to be taken up before the COPE. We need to see the people who are there and what authority it has got. Otherwise, it will be just a waste of time.

Sir, going on to the institutions, the BOI is one of the most important institutions that has to be highlighted, Sir. The BOI, in the year 2005 had an export value of US Dollars 8700 million. In 2006, it had US Dollars 10800 million. In the investigations we found that for petrol and other consumptions it had almost US Dollars 2500 million. US Dollars 700 to 800 million is earned through the export of food items. That shows that almost US Dollars 700 million is from the export trade. Of that, Sir, 50 per cent comes from the BOI. In order to control this US Dollars 3500 million, there are only 35 to 40 people. Now, that is not a problem. If the Customs has 5000 people, it is not necessary to have another 5000. But the efficacy of that needs to be looked at and there were certain anomalies that need to be corrected, Sir. Then the next one. The most disturbing trend that we have found is that the BOI which is supposed to be a one-stop shop which basically had 78 days previously to give approval to an institution now takes the longest possible time of 156 days. Today the World Bank survey shows that Sri Lanka is the country in the Asian region that takes the longest time to give approval to an institution. It has gone up to 156 days. This is according to a survey done in the last five days. Going on further, Sir, there is a huge drop between the investments coming in from estimated investments to actual investments. I am just quoting, Sir. Now, in the year 2003 in relation to the year 2002, the estimated investment was Rs. 35 billion and the actual investment was Rs. 14 billion. That was a 42 per cent gain. Then Sir, in the years 2005 and 2006 you would find a drastic drop in the actual investment compared to the estimated investment. So there is no point in saying that US Dollars 700 million",

He says in his letter, this is not what I am saying, this is what the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera says in page 7 of his letter and his conclusion is, I quote: I do not know whether the problems that your relatives and associates faced in winning the Hambantota port development project was also a factor in my dismissal. , . . , he believes that the problems he had with Sajin Vass Gunawardene - who I know cannot even run a basic labour recruitment organization; in Dubai he had a problem, he cannot run his own family entity - is also a contributory factor for his removal. This is what he feels and what he says. Going on further, Sir, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera speaks about the Cabinet of Ministers. I am referring to page 12 of his letter. He speaks of an environment where Ministers are able to freely perform their duties. This is exactly a finding by the Committee on Public Enterprises. Most of the chairmen of institutions who came before COPE said that they have no environment to work owing to the fact of political interferences. Hon. Dew Gunasekera, before you talk about peace with the LTTE you must have peace among your own party members. If this is the way we are heading, what hope is there for Sri Lanka, Sir? We are trying to take it on the public officials. There are a handful of deceitful officials. There is no question about it. But the majority of the people are excellent, very skillful and committed persons who want to go forward. But we are not giving them the leadership that is required. There is no point scolding across the Floor of this House if these types of issues are not solved. So what the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera says is that the environment where Ministers are able to freely perform their duties has been seriously affected and he has brought this to the attention of the President on a regular basis. We appreciate if this is being looked into and if action is not taken to ensure that, a debate is called for in this House so that we can see whether there is somebody doing something behind the back of the President. I table this letter, Sir, for the sake of public probity. Going on further, some Colleagues of mine spoke about the Merbok issue so I do not want to waste time on that. But all I want to say is that the BOI is the principal institution for bringing investments into this country. By having road shows they were able to get only US Dollars 700 million to this country whereas Sudan was able to get US Dollars 1,500 million in the year 2006.

Then, Sir, the EDB came before us. The Chairman of the EDB did not even know what the GDP of this country was. This was what we, as the Members of the Committee on Public Enterprises were able to find out; there was lack of vision; lack of ability; lack of knowledge and lack of transparency, Sir. When we asked whether there was a link between the Presidents Ten Year Horizon Development Framework and the EDB, he did not understand what the Ten Year Horizon Development Framework was. So, all the hard work and efforts made to present a Budget for this country have fallen by the wayside if the institutions are led by political clowns. That is what has happened. So, we need to rectify this particular situation. Then Thulhiriya Textiles was something that was spoken about. We know that the HNB and the Bank of Ceylon have to get Rs. 450 million from this institution as bad debts. This was sold to MAS, a fantastic private sector company, for US Dollars 1.5 million. Then, from where is the deficit coming in? Is the Government paying for that? If the Government is paying why was there such a devaluation of US Dollars 3 million in the sale? So, where are all these heading ? Where is this country heading, Sir? Who is held responsible for this? Can one person make the decision? The Government of Sri Lanka owes Rs. 352 billion to the Bank of Ceylon and the Peoples Bank together. Those two institutions in this country are bankrupt - technically bankrupt. Then, Sir, going on further, I mentioned about the BOI and the Mihin Air and I also mentioned about the lack of vision in the BOI. The Chairman today is doing his very best. There is no question about that. But there are certain people who do not allow it. I know that the Minister, Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama, when he was there made certain directions. But, just because it transgressed on some of the officials there was an about-turn. The Chairman wanted to do it. The Hon. Minister wanted to do it. The direction was given. But, two or three officials in the BOI did not allow it to happen, Sir. That is a finding through our collective process in the COPE. Sir, I would also like to table* Annex 11.

    "text": "may be happy. But that is not what the country wants, Sir. All we want is these matters to be looked into. We try to do our very best for the country. We got Labour GSP from the European Union. But today with the abductions that are taking place, the Government's involvement has been proven. In the case of the media personnel who were abducted, they may have connections. But take the legal process. If they are supposed to be the culprits, the easiest way is to go to courts and get them hounded instead of trying to abduct them. Now the Governments involvement has been proven beyond doubt. That is the problem. Because of that the Labour GSP that was given to Sri Lanka during our tenure of office is going to be withdrawn and if it is withdrawn the cost of exports from Sri Lanka will go up by 22 per cent, Sir. You may shake your head, Hon. Member, but we know the exporters who are unable to compete today are asking, What are you all doing? We, from the Opposition have been assisting the Minister of Enterprise Development and Investment Promotion trying to project Sri Lanka on the world map. Today they are governing and tomorrow they will be out of governance. Then onwards we will have to govern this country. But until then we need a country to be governed. That is the sorry state that we are in, Sir. The COPE has been examining the Ceylon Electricity Board since 1997, but nothing has been done for this country, Sir. We have shown that the cost of power generation is almost Rs.11.40 and the selling price is Rs.7.40. So, there is an apparent loss of Rs. 4 in terms of power generation. Forget about the capacity cost or the throughput-cost. With that, you are losing almost Rs.50 million a day. How on earth can you run an institution that is losing Rs.1.5 billion or Rs.1500 million a month and Rs.20 billion a year? . , ? , Almost 888,000 consumers or 26 per cent of the consumers use less than 30 units. So, the commercial element of that is basically subsidizing the rest of them. Owing to that fact they are the most expensive consumers from an industrial point of view, Sir. Then, Sir, the private sector power generation cost is Rs. 4 to 5, and if you look at the throughput-cost it is between Rs.11 to Rs.12. Today this is far cheaper than the cost of power generation of the Ceylon Electricity Board which is generating power at their own cost. They do not take the capital cost the Government has put in, in calculating a proper return, Sir. There is no cost benefit analysis and there is no depreciation. When the ADB, the World Bank and the IMF come, they do a real calculation. But who is being fooled, God only knows, Sir. The Chairman and the General Manager of the institution say that it is overstaffed. Then, Sir, there are people who",

We, from the COPE have been regularly questioning them but there was no proper answer given, Sir. There is no debt management team in this particular place. Also, the threat that has come from the Lanka Indian Oil Company has put the institution into great jeopardy, Sir, because the overstaffed Ceypetco has to compete with LIOC which is downsized and rightsized. And it is able to compete with Ceypetco with greater ease. So, we must ensure that that is corrected. With regard to the oil explorations, we have very categorically told the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and the people around it to please ensure that just one or two people are not selected but all eight or nine people are selected at the same time. We, as Members of the Committee on Public Enterprises can only show this, but the Government must be responsible enough to carry it forward, Sir. Then, when you take the Bank of Ceylon, today their expenditure over income is almost 70 per cent while all other private sector banks are in the range of 48 to 56 per cent. So, we could see, Sir, that the Government banks are not in a competitive position. Today, there is absolutely no discipline. The Chairman is running amok. He thinks that he has been appointed by the President and he has got a carte blanche to do anything and everything. The people are suffocated. There is no motivational factor. There are some people who are being harassed for the simple reason that he has been appointed by the President. This has been very blatantly shown in the investigations. But nothing has been done up-to-date, Sir. The Government debt as I said with the Bank of Ceylon and the Peoples Bank is Rs. 352 billion. I am tabling * Annex 12, Sir, just to show the credit mountains in these particular institutions. The State banks lending to the government in the year 2002 was Rs. 253 billion. In the year 2003, it was Rs. 255 billion and in the year 2005, it was Rs. 352 billion. We could see the galloping",

The number of staff per branch is 27 when the accepted norm is around 16 to 17. We could see that it is double the staff size. We have got to compete with the rest in the region.

Then, Sir, the Central Bank, my Colleague who spoke before exhaustively discussed this area and all I could say is that the Governor certainly seems to be knowing what he is doing but please ensure that he puts it into correct use. There is no point in saying that his officials are running amok there. There are some very competent people, I must say, committed as if they feel that the Central Bank is in their hands.

There is a recurrent expenditure of Rs. 650 million and in the year 2006, the entire institution has built only 400 houses. So, it was a unanimous decision by the committee to ask, \"Is this an institution that needs to be maintained?\" If there is a recurrent expenditure of Rs. 650 million to build 400 houses, what on earth is this institution for?Then in the same institution there was absolute corruption. I could cite one instance. A land five acres and ten perches in extent in Nawala road, in my electorate, was sold at Rs. 89,000 a perch when the value of that is around Rs. 900,000 a perch. Who is to be held responsible for this? We brought it to the attention of the Almighty but nothing has been done. This happened in the year 2005.

The staff is 1,100 people. The loss that is incurred there is almost Rs. 400 to 500 million. So who is to be held responsible? Then there is the Water Resources Board, basically supposed to be statute bound to give water to the nation. Their running security companies is what was highlighted. These are the grave financial errors that are committed but nobody is concerned or takes any interest to ensure that these are rectified. I hope today after this Debate the Secretary to the Treasury will ensure that all these institution heads are summoned within the next week or two and they are either reprimanded or sent home. If not the Secretary to the Treasury would have to be called up and asked, Why are you not taking action against them? Then, Sir, PERC, is also one of the most important institutions because of the post-privatization and the privatization that is going on now. We very openly looked into this matter. The Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation is one of them. It is an absolutely horrendous episode that has taken place. As regards the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, when the PERC called in people before them, there were professional institutions such as Pricewaterhouse Coopers that were brought in to find an investment partner. Owing to the lack of knowledge which was very openly told by the Government, PERC brought in Pricewaterhouse Coopers to give a financial estimation on the privatization. They finally found an institution but that was not properly valued. There was no proper agreement with the Government and finally you had a company that came from Indonesia and took monies and today are not responsible to the Government.",

It was very clearly told that it should get into the Stock Exchange but it did not happen. Subsequently, a monopoly had been given and there were tax holidays also given. When we called the financial consultants, the DFCC, they came and very categorically corroborated with evidence saying that they had told that these types of tax holidays should be taken away and no monopolies should be given. With all that still it had gone through and what has happened? LIOC is in the same boat, Prima is in the same boat. Agreements have been signed but subsequently changes have taken place. We can all talk till the cows come home but what action will be taken? It is the same with the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation. Some of the biggest robberies, day time robberies have taken place in this institution.

Land is being sold, there is swindling that is going on, officials are caught lying and no action is being taken.

You have boards displaying certain advertisements. But the revenue that comes into the RDA is next to nothing. These are the findings of the COPE. But no action has been taken.

Rupees 700 million worth of investments have been written off in the National Lotteries Board. I do not want to mention about any individuals, but the write-off needs to be looked into because we did mention that this type of thing would happen and it has happened now. Sir, then coming to the Tea Small Holdings Development Authority in which you were the Chairman, you gave a lot of promises to this country through the Tea Small Holdings Development Authority. Today 73 per cent of the tea production is from the smallholders. There are 400,000 owners and one million dependants. They came before the Committee on Public Enterprises and lamented that a cess of Rs. 4 is charged at the point of export. Three hundred and ten million kilos of tea is exported. So, roughly the revenue is Rs. 1.2 billion. The Treasury is supposed to be collecting the Rs. 1.2 billion, but only Rs. 200 million come to the Tea Small Holdings Development Authority. Now, what happens to the balance, Sir? The COP is Rs. 28 and they are unable to carry on the industry with the revenue they get. That is what they told us. So, what can we do? Are we to watch this industry crashing? They come before the Committee on Public Enterprises and openly lament. I must say that there were some very committed people there. But they said that the Treasury takes the money which is due to them. So, these are matters that have been highlighted. In the case of MILCO Private Limited, we have highlighted that the chairmen are at fault. Finally, the very people who complained about the irregularities are subjected to harassment in the form of retrenchment or by sending them on compulsory leave. The Agricultural Credit Insurance Company is the same, Sir. The Treasury has given Rs. 176 million. But the poor farmers affected by the Mavil Aru situation say that they have got only a fraction of what they should have got. There are 3000 farmers and they say that they have not got a single penny and they want us to look into it as to what is going on. All what we could say at this particular moment is that you can fool some people all the time, all the people some time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time. So, I call upon the Government to please be sensitive. This is the countrys economy, Sir. This is not the dowry of any one person. This has been happening perennially. If we do not correct it and stem the tide at this particular moment, we will have a country where its economy is absolutely ruined.
