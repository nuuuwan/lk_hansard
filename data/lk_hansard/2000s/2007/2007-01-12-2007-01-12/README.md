Sale of 90% Shares of Lanka Marine Services Ltd. (LMSL)

1. Cabinet on 17.8.2000 decided to liberalise the bunkering businesson the following lines:

* to liberalise the bunkering sector and to permit a limited numberof parties to operate bunkering services

* that the monopoly given to LMSL to be restricted to one year,within which period privatisation of LMSL to be completeds

* new entrants to the bunkering sector to sell bunkers within theterritorial waters of Sri Lanka, including the immediate vicinityof Port of Colombo

* PERC to seek offers through an open tender process frominvestors. PERC initiate action make recommendations to Cabineton the process to be followed

To facilitate the above, the Government enacted PetroleumProducts (Special Provisions) Act, No. 33 of 2002.

2. PERC on 28.10.2001 called for Expression of Interest (EOls) toissue Licences for bunkering and on 8.11.2002 called for EOlsfor the Sale of 90% Shares of LMSL, with a closing date of28.02.2002 giving only 3 weeks.

3. On 28.02.2002 Chairman PERC, P. B. Jayasundera causedSecretary to the Treasury, Charitha Ratwatte to appoint a TEC toevaluate both EOls and final Bids. No Cabinet Appointed TenderBoard was appointed. Since TEC was appointed after 28.02.2002,calling for EOls and the relevant Documents had not beenapproved by TEC.

4. At the Pre-Bid Conference on 30.04.2002, PERC Chairman,P. B. Jayasundera, confirmed;

* LMS will not have a monopoly on the import and sale ofbunkers subsequent to the sale of Lanka Marine Services Ltd.

* The Government cannot takeover Court Cases.

* Land - within one year of the closing date. PERC to revert by7th May 2002 regarding the terms of the transfer including anypayments that would have to be made by LMSL.

2007 12359360

5. The RFP has stated;

* The SLPA have indicated a rent of 10 $ /MT for the use of theDolphin Pier and the pipelines upto the Bloemendhal Installation.

* The SLPA proposes to develop the South Jetty as a commonuser facility and have indicated a fee of 3 $ /sq. ft. for the officespace.

* Bidders sahll conduct and are solely responsible for conductingtheir own independent research.........Bidders shall conduct andare solely responsible for conducting their own duediligence......No written or oral information provided shall beconsidered legally binding by the Bidders

6. PERC Chairman P. B. Jayasundera forwarding Chief Valuers 1993Valuation of LMSL, had called for an updated valuation of LMSLfrom the Chief Valuer, who had confirmed that the assets valuationwas completed and the business valuation is to be strarted.

7. Questionably abounding the Chief Valuers valuation, DFCC Bankhad been selected by PERC without competitive offers to do abusiness valuation of LMSL. DFCC Bank has placed the floorprice of the business valuation for bidding at Rs. 1,200,000,000/-, onthe basis that LMSL was not to have a monopoly. DFCC Banks valuationhad also been erroneous.DFCC Bank has not valued the Net Assets of LMSL particularlyBloemendhal Land of 8A 2R 21.44p, which the Chief Valuer hadconfirmed had been completed, but PERC had questionably avoided.Chief Valuer had valued this land in 1993 at Rs. 82,866,000/-

Normally the net assets valuation and the business valuation are bothtaken into reckoning in placing a valuation on an ongoing business.

8. The Minister of Power & Energy, Karu Jayasuriya has submitted CabinetMemorandum on 21.06.2002, as per the TEC recommendations forthe Sale of 90% Shares of LMSL on the basis of a floor price ofRs. 1,200,000,000/-, (The net assets valuation, partivularly the Land,had not been taken into reckoning) on a bidding process on the ColomboStock Exchange, and sought the following Cabinet Approvals :

*authorise CPC to sell 90% Shares of LMSL to successful bidder onthe process identified, and terms and conditions stipulated in theShare Sale & Purchase Agreement and the Common User FacilityAgreement, and to gift the balance 10% Shares to the employees ofLMSL.

*authorise the sale of 90% Shares of LMSL at or about the benchmark/floor price of Rs. 1,200,000,000/-, which would be introduced forbidding on the Colombo Stock Exchange

*authorise the Secretary to the Treasury, CPC and SLPA to enter intothe Share Sale & Purchase Agreement, Common User FacilityAgreement and any other ancillary agreement

*authorise SLPA, in association with the CPC, to acquire and mangethe Common User Facilities, until the formation of the proposedterminal company.

*authorise allocation of funds required for upgrading the CommonUser Facilities to be milty - user capable from the sale of 90% Sharesof LMSL, and CPC or any other party to carry out such works

Cabinet Memorandum of 21.06.2002 had not expressly disclosed theextent of Government Land of 8A 2R 21.44p at Bloemendhal Roadand its Market Value.

9. Cabinet Approval for the Cabinet Memorandum of 21.06.2002has been given only on 14.08.2002, and has been confirmed andnotified on 21.08.2002. Hence, between 21.06.2002 and21.08.2002, no action, whatsoever, could have been taken onthis matter.

10. Before conformation and notification of Cabinet Approval on21.08.2002, PERC Chairman, P. B. Jayasundera ;

(i) on 12.07.2002 on exchange to Letters with John Keells HoldingsLtd., had made the award for the Sale of 90% Shares of LMSL toJohn Keels Holdings Ltd.

(ii) The award to John Keels Holdings Ltd. had been made on the basisthat John Keells Holdings Ltd., had been the only party, who hadsubmitted a 10% Bid Bond on the floor price of Rs. 1,200,000,000/- as required by letter dated 25.06.2002 to be submitted by10.07.2002. This has been alleged by the other Bidders as foulplay.

(iii) On 2.08.2003 on exchange of letters with John KeellsHoldings, PERC Chairman, P. B. Jayasundera has agreed togrant a monopoly to LMSL after John Keells Holdingspurchases 90% Shares of LMSL. Previously the TEC hadrejected the Bid of Sri Lanka Shipping Co. Ltd., forrequesting a monopoly for 8 years for LMSL.

(iv) On 20.08.2002 PERC Chairman, P. B. Jayasundera, Secretaryto the Treasury Charitha Ratwatte and Director Legal PERC,Shamalee Gunawardene, acting in concert had signed the ShareSale & Purchase Agreement and CUF Agreement with JohnKeells Holdings Ltd. CUF Agreement included the followingnew Clause 8.2, which was not there previously:

8.2 GOSL / SLPA / CPC shall ensure that all bunkers /marine fuels handled and transport within the Port ofColombo would be handled and transported using theCUF

The above acts have been prior to confirmation andnotification of Cabinet Decision on 21.8.2002 and are thereforebad in law and invalid, null and void.

11. The Court of Appeal has held that the inclusion of the abovemonopoly clause has been ultravires Petroleum Products (SpecialProvisions) Act No. 33 of 2002.

12. Consequently, being confronted with the above monopoly clause,DFCC Bank reneged on their business valuation of LMSL of Rs.1,200,000,000/- and confirmed in writing that on the basis of amonopoly their business valuation is Rs. 2,400,000,000/-,confirming that had they been required to give a net assetsvaluation they would have engaged the services of a professionalreal estate valuer for the Land 8A 2R 21.44P.

13. Central Banks Annual Report 2004 stated;

The high cost of bunkering fuel has been discouragingthe fleet of vessels arriving at Colombo for bunkering.The privatisation of Lanka Marine Services Ltd., has notyielded the required low prices and competition, indicatingthe need for further reforms in this sector.

14. Though the RFP had disclosed the following Case and stated thatthe Government would not takeover cases of LMSL, which hadbeen confirmed by PERC Chairman, P. B. Jayasundera at the Pre-bid Conference, but in the Share Sale & Purchase Agreementsigned with John Keells Holdings Ltd., the Claim by Oxford JayInternational (Pte) Ltd., Singapore of US $ 9.2 Mn. had beentakeover by the Government. The Government has paid advancecosts of US $ 170,000/-.

15. The draft Share Sale & Purchase Agreement issued with the RFPhas stated;

The vendor (i.e. CPC) agrees to transfer freehold title ofthe premises located at No. 69, Walls Lane, Colombo 15 tothe Company (i.e. LMSL) within a period of 1 year fromthe Closing Date.

The above could not by any means have committed theGovernment to transfer the Land in extent 8A 2R 21.44P freeof valuable consideration for the unjust enrichment of abuyer of LMSL.

361362

At the Pre-Bid Conference PERC Chairman, P. B. Jayasunderahad confirmed;

Land - within one year of the closing date. PERC torevert by 7th May 2002 regarding the terms of the transferincluding any payments that would have to be made byLMSL. - (As per Item 5(b) of the Minutes)

16. Secretary, Ministry of Power & Energy, P. Weerahandi has initiatedaction on 3.11.2004 to have this Land transferred to LMSL.Consequently by Letter dated 11.1.2005, Addl. Secretary, Ministryof Lands, W. M. Jayathilake has stated that the Secretary to thePresident has informaed the Land Commissioner that the Presidenthas approved the vesting of this Land to LMSL, after recoveringthe purchase consideration of Rs. 1,199,362,500/-.

17. Though the Instrument of Grant dated 19.1.2005 has stated thatthe Government has received Rs. 1,199,362,500/- from LMSL,Director General, Department of Treasury Operations, by Letterdated 18.8.2006 has confirmed that the Government has notreceived any money for the transfer of this Land, in response toLetter dated 21.3.2006 addressed to the Secretary Treasury, P. B.Jayasundera by Chairman, PERC, W. M. Bandusena, seekingconfirmation as to whether the Government has received thepurchase consideration as stated in the Instrument of Grant.

LMSL Accounts for the Financial Year ended 31.3.2005 do notdisclose that LMSL has made a payment of Rs. 1,199,362,500/- to the Government for this Land in extent 8A 2R 21.44P.

In fact, the payment of Rs. 1,199,362,500/- is the payment madein August 2002 by John Keells Holdings Ltd., to CPC for the Saleof 90% Shares of LMSL, to be paid to the Secretary Treasury, andthis could not be interpreted or construed to be a paymentmade in January 2005 by LMSL to the Secretary to the Treasuryfor the Land.

18. Therefore, this Government Land has been purported tobe transferred to LMSL without receipt of any consideration,in January 2005, for a purported payment ofRs. 1,199,362,500/-.

Hence, the Instrument of Grant is a fraudulent document and afiction, in that, no payment had been made by LMSL and hasbeen received by the Government, as acknowledged in theInstrument of Grant for the transfer of the Government Land atBloemendal in extent 8A 2R 21.44P to LMSL. Therefore, therecould not be a legal transfer of this Land, inasmuch as thisInstrument of Grant is ex-facie fraudulent and a fiction.

19. A Valuation by the Chief Valuer and a professional private Valuerwill disclose the Market Value of this Land in August 2002 i.e.when the Share Sale & Purchase Agreement was executed.

20. The business valuation in June 2002 by DFCC Bank for LMSLon an earnings basis reckoned for the Financial Year 2002/03, ata multiple of 8 had been given as Rs. 1,405 Mn. and at a multipleof 10 had been given as Rs. 1,757 Mn.

However, LMSLs Net Profits after Tax for the following FinancialYears have been :

Rs.

Financial Year 2002/03402,733Financial Year 2003/04235,876Financial Year 2004/05574,062Financial Year 2005/061,089,393

The above Net Profits are after John Keells Holdings Ltd., havingrecovered whatever charges and costs from LMSL.

21. This transaction had been executed blatantly without CabinetApproval, with several flaws causing loss and detriment to theGovernment, and demonstrating it to be a questionable fix,and is therefore ab-initio bad in law, null and void,

Sale of 90% shares of Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation. (SLIC)

1. Steering committee to handle the sale of 90% shares of SLIC hasbeen appointed on 21.01.2002 by the Hon. Minister MilindaMoragoda without a Cabinet approval.

2. Steering committee has appointed Price Waterhouse Cooper (PWC),Indonesia in collaboration with the PWC, Sri Lanka without aCabinet approval on 10.04.2002 as consultant to the Governmentfor a fee of US$ 1.6 million (at present rate of Sri LankaRs. 172.8 million)

3. The Cabinet approval granted on 18.04.2002 to appoint a technicalevaluation Committee (TEC) - By that time PWC had already beenselected.

4. The Cabinet has approved the appointment of a TEC by theSecretary to the Treasury, but had rejected the request of theSecretary to the Treasury to appoint a Tender Board by himselfand decided that the Tender Board shall be appointed by theCabinet.

5. Disregarding the Cabinet disapproval the Secretary to the Treasuryhad caused the Deputy Secretary to the Treasury,Mr. N. Pathmanathan to appoint CATB including himself asChairman.

6. After the evaluation of bids, the TEC has recommended the saleof 90% shares to the consortium comprising of Distilleries Co.Ltd., Aitkan Spence Insurance (Pvt.) Ltd. together with TechnicalParties ING. Institutional and Government Advisory Service BV(Holland) on 25.03.2003.

7. On the same day 25.03.2003 CATB recommended the TECrecommendations.

8. The Cabinet memorandum dated 27.03.2003 had recommendedthe sale of 90% shares of SLIC to the above consortium.

9. On 11.04.2003 shares sale and purchase agreement has beensigned with Milford Holdings (Pvt) Ltd., and offshore Company,Greenfield Pacific EM Holdings (Pvt). Ltd., incorporated inGibroltar on 28.03.2003. It was not in existence when the Cabinetapproved it on 27.03.2003.

10.These two Companies were not bidders and they were strangers.

11.The said sale has been taken placed on unaudited accounts andthereby it was not possible to enter into any kind of sharetransaction. It also appeared the accounts have been surreptitiouslyand intentionally adjusted.

12.Earnest and Young auditors and PWC consultants were directlyinvolved in the said fraudulent conduct.

13.Deva Rodrigo, Senior partner of PWC has been a member of thesteering committee selecting PWC as consultants to theGovernment, and continuing thereafter as a steering committeemember supervising the work of PWC and approving paymentsto PWC.

14.Director, PERC and Secretary Steering Committee, who handledthis transaction for PERC, Aneela de Soysa joined PWC as a partnerin March 2003.

15.Ernest & Young, who had been auditors of SLIC, whilst theGovernment was 100% share holder, continued as SLIC auditorsafter the sale to the illegal buyers and had been compromised bythem not to discharge their responsibilities to the Government.

2007 12363364

16.The Ethnics Committee of Institute of Charted Accountants,coming under the purview of the Minister of Trade, after thepreliminary investigation established a prima facie case, haddecided that the Disciplinary Committee should be appointed intothe professional misconduct by PWC and Ernest & Young.

17.Chairman, PERC who handled this SLIC transaction and laterSecretary to the Treasury, Dr. P. B. Jayasundara has been a SeniorPolicy Advisor to Ernest & Young, and had failed and neglectedto act in the interest of the Government in this matter.

18.In the facts and circumstances of the said transaction is null andvoid ab initio and frustrated. Prima facia the conduct of theresponsible Officers is in violation of the provisions of PublicProperty Act and the Bribery and Corruption Laws. We await forthe recommendations of the Sub Committee.

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)Hon. Speaker, we are all thankful to the Hon. WijeyadasaRajapakshe for presenting this Report. Further to commendingon this Report, I wish to bring to the notice of this augustForum - Sir, I do not know whether the Hon. Members ofParliament know this - the activities of the implementingagencies handling the loans given by the Asian developmentBank and the World Bank. Those loans are handled by certainagencies and especially in the North-East -

( )(Mr. Speaker) .

. . . ( )(The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa)

. . I just want to give a message to the Hon. WijeyadasaRajapakshe. These loans are handled by implementing agencies, whichare not subject to audit or any investigation by the COPE. These

agencies are functioning with a representative appointed by the ADBand the World Bank and locally, these loans are handled by a director.Sir, these projects are implemented in an ad hoc basis and the PeoplesRepresentatives or the Hon. Ministers do not know anything aboutthem. But, the funniest part of this is that these proposals are broughtbefore the DDC meetings and are just approved. So, I wish to bringthis to the notice of the Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe for him to lookinto this. These are loans given to our Government and we have to payback.they think that these are grants and they are acting like NGOs.The directors are acting according to their own will Sir. So, I wish tobring this matter to the notice of the Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe andI want him to look into this , Sir.

( )( () - , )(The Hon. (Dr) Sarath Amunugama - Minister of PublicAdministration and Home Affairs)Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, it is always a verysad occasion in this House when a fellow Member withwhom we have interacted, with whom we have had manydiscussions, whom we have admired in this House hasbeen brutally cut off from his life. All too often in thisHouse we have had to speak about many of our Colleagueswho have been cut short in the best years of their livesand our late Member of Parliamtent, the Hon. NadarajahRaviraj was also such a friend and today irrespective ofdifferent political persuasions, we all grieve for that verysad death. I think, I can say with confidence that the Hon.Raviraj was perhaps the most popular Member ofParliament of this House. Unfortunately, in the last decaderelations between our parties have been strained andsometimes it has even extended to personal relations.I am happy to say that is still a minority, an aberration.A large number of us can meet, can talk, can discuss ourdifferences and behave in a very civilized manner. But,I think all will agree that the Hon. Raviraj was the bestbridge between the different communities that arerepresented in this House. He not only presented his pointof view in this House, but he was able to address a muchwider audience-because through the television, he wassuch a popular personality that he had a big followingirrespective of whether it was in Jaffna, Trincomalee,Colombo, Galle or even my electorate Galagedara. Hewas known by all. Now my good Friend Mr, Shivajilingamis the only person who can go to those meetings anddiscuss in Sinhala, have arguments but still come out asgood friends. So we are going to miss him. In this countrywe must all stand up against violence. People must havethe right to come out with their opinions. And we havethe necessity, we have an obligation to create a culture inwhich people can speak out, sometimes harshly,sometimes softly, but when they speak out we must makesure that there is not threat or violence unleashed becausethey have expressed their views. That is the bedrock ofdemocracy. We cannot expect everybody to speak outand give ideas with which only we agree. That is notdemocracy. In a democracy people have the right to speak.And even those who do not have that idea, who do notsubscribe to those ideas must stand up for the right ofthose, particularly Members of Parliament and also citizensof this country, to express their views. We cannot, inanyway, condone the use of violence and certainly theextreme form of violence where we extinguish the life ofa young man simply because he expressed a point of view.

I must say that the Hon. Raviraj was very popular inColombo among the Sinhalese so much so that I think hefelt that no protection was necessary. I used to always see

him in the canteen surrounded by his friends from ourside, Members of Parliament and I used to always hear,sometimes even in the television studio he was referredto as Ravi Machang. Often he was Ravi Machang toall the Members of this House and he also reciprocated.

I was very touched when I read in the newspapers thathe visited Bishops College where his wife was a verydistinguished teacher, where his daughter was a verybeloved student, my own daughter went to BishopsCollege and the children told me that they always lookedforward to visits by the Hon. Raviraj because he used toalways advise the children saying, You must study hard.You must not have any communal feeling. You must workas sisters in this class. He was a hero to them. Sometimeswhen the other parents did not have time, he had the timeto go to that school and attend to his duties as a parent.

So we have lost an outstanding person at a time in thiscountry when we have to build bridges, we have to dependon our goodwill, depend on the good relations that wehave.

. ( )(The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

He was a precious person.

( )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)Yes. He was a precious person, a valuable person andI would say, an exemplary person because in our own mindswe must be able to have this dialogue. We cannot havereservations when we talk to each other. We cannot havereservations when we allow another person to speak. Toomuch in this country has there been a culture of violence.The Sinhalese people, the Tamil people, the Muslim peopleof this country have a very good heritage of discussion anddebate. We can have very heated arguments but once we goout that will not spill over to our personal relationships. Sothat is something that is very important. I come from aKandyan electorate where some of my voters, a fair amountof my voters are tamil speakers, a fair amount of my voters aremuslim by religion. We have to talk to them. They have totalk to us. We have to work together to develop our electoratesand I must say that I am very thankful to His Excellency thePresident who took very quick action. he was appalled, hewas disgusted by this murder and I think you will agree thatwe have done everything possible. Scotland yard wascontacted. They are already here. We have done our very bestin a simple way, in a humble way to compensate the family,not that anybody can ever compensate for the loss of ahusband. I must say that as people who are committed todemocracy for whom these racial, religious and communalideas do not appear to be something that we can use to bringthis country forward, we have to open up a dialogue. I thinkthe outpouring of sympathy at the Hon. Ravirajs death; when

437438

I visited the Barney Raymonds funeral house, it was chock-a-block with Sinhalese friends; chock-a-block of smallpeople. Many of them told me, Sir, as a lawyer he nevercharged us. Whenever we had problems, when we went toMr. Raviraj, he gave us a hearing and he appeared in thecourts. Very often, if we did not have the money he appearedfree. He never said, I am going to appeare only for Tamillitigants. He never said, I am going to appear only forSinhala litigants. He never asked whether you are a Muslimor a Sinhalese or a Tamil. If he was a litigant who had aproblem before court he appeared.

My good Friend, the Hon. Sampanthan, I can recall peoplein Anuradhapura, everybody saying, We need to represent us because he is a first class lawyer.They are not interested in communal matters, they want towin their case.

Mr. G. G. Ponnambalam I think my good Friend the Hon.Sampanthan will agree hardly appeared in a case to representa Tamil. May be they did not kill somany at that time. But, 99per cent of the criminal cases of Mr. G. G. Ponnambalam werethat of Sinhalese clients and they were more than satisfiedwith his services. I was a good friend of MR. Ganeshalingamwho died recently. He was the nephew of Mr. G. G.Ponnambalam and I used to go occasionally to see him. Hewas always closeted in his study. he thoroughly studied hisbrief and he did his very best. So, I think on a sad occasionlike this we must reaffirm our common humanity. What isthis nonsense that we are going through in this country? Weare representing two wonderful civilizations, two greatcivilizations. People who have been friends for centuries aretrying to kill each other. The late Mr. Raviraj was a veryyoung man who had a tremendous future in this country. Hewas one person who could appeal to anybody with his filmstar looks, with his quick ability to respond. He respondedvery well. I can remember once the whole country wasenthralled when somebody said, You are a . Hesaid , . He was quick to respondlike that. He had that ability. A friend of mine told me thatthough he appeared to be very light-hearted when heappeared on television he spent days on his brief before hewent into the studio.

So, I think, the sentiments expressed on this side of theHouse are genuine sentiments; sentiments of friends and wewish to record our great sadness, our great sense of loss at thedeath of our Friend, the Hon. Raviraj. May I take thisopportunity on this sad occasion to express our sentimentsto Mrs. Raviraj and the children. Such a beautiful family!Everybodys heart was touched I can even tell you throughpersonal experience at the sight of that little girl who wasdeprived of her father. So, on this sad occasion I want to sharewith all of you in this House our great admiration for thisyoung man and though it is by no way sufficient to say thatour hearts and our thoughts are with Mrs. Raviraj and thechildren, according to the religion that we profess we hopethat he will achieve Nirvana and we will have oppurtunity ofassociating with him may be in future lives.

Thank you very much, Sir.

. ( )(The Hon. V. Puththirasigamoney)I second the Adjournment Motion presented by the Hon.Mahinda Ratnatilaka.

Actually, retirement benefits are one of the most importantfactors when we consider the immense service rendered bythe senior citizens of our country to the public when they

were in service. Today with the rising cost of living and otherissues, I think it is appropriate that the Hon. Minister takesproper action with regard to the proposals put forward by theHon. Mahinda Ratnatilake.

While saying so, as a trade unionist, I am worried about thesituation that is prevailing in the country today. Especially,there are moves to curtail the trade union rights, to curtail thefreedom of expression and to curtail free movement. All of usspeak about peace. How can we bring peace to this country ifall of us do not work towards bringing peace? Today we arenot only worried about the retired people but are also worriedabout the people who are employed. Everyday there is aprotest over wage increases. Even in the plantation sector,recently we had a strike for about 14 days over wage increases.I think, the Hon. Minister will accept most of these problemsand the fact that with the rising cost of living and without areasonable wage, people cannot live. The only way to bringdown the cost of living is to bring peace to this country. I asa trade unionist and also as a person who belongs to a minoritycommunity was very happy to see His Excellency thePresident from the SLFP and the Hon. Leader of theOpposition from the UNP signing the MoU to bring peace tothis country. We were very happy to see it and we still supportit. Our trade union movement and also all our politicalmovements suport that move because that is the only waythrough which we can bring down the cost of living, paymore wages to the workers and make this country flourish.

But can that be done in the way that we think? Even thatMoU has been given different interpretations today. Hon.Minister, you know that when you sign a marriageregistration, you do not enumerate facts to say that aftermarriage we will be sleeping together , we will have sextogether or we will have children. We do not say things likethat. We do not say that we will send the Children to school,we will build a house for them and we will give them inmarriage. Such things we do not say. Also, I must say thateven after getting married

( )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)Hon. Member, do you want the two parties

. ( )(The Hon. V. Puththirasigamoney)No. I do not want that to happen. That is what I am tryingto say. Even after signing a marriage agreement, you cannothave sex by force. You can go to courts against it. You cannoteven snore and distrub one another. That is it. But here, theinterpretation that is given to the MoU is quite different.They say that the MoU

( )(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)You must give that advice to the two party Leaders.

[ ]

2007 12451452

. ( )(The Hon. V. Puththirasigamoney)That is why I am saying this. I am also a Member of theGovernment Party, though I am seated on this side. It shouldbe conveyed to His Excellency the President and also to theHon. Leader of the Opposition. But the interpretation givento the MoU that they have signed is, Yes, we signed theMoU. But, that does not mean that we cannot take MPs fromthe UNP to the SLFP and SLFP to the UNP. We do not wantall that. We are not worried about who is coming from theUNP to the SLFP or who is going from the SLFP to the UNP.That is not the problem. As trade unions what we look forwardto is to bring peace to this country. Nobody should jeopardizethat MoU. They must not try to break the foundation and thestructure of the MoU but they must work together and bringpeace. If you do not bring peace, we will not be in a positionto speak about retired people. We will have to speak aboutthe children who will be born in this country. Today childrencannot go to school on time because of the traffic jams. Youmight say that this is because of the trade unionists comingto the Colombo Fort Railway Station and to the Lipton Circus.That is not the only reason. We are only talking about bringingthe UNPers into the SLFP and bringing the SLFPers into theUNP. We are only worriod about that.

Then, we are talking about the war. I am worried as a personwho belongs to a minority community because at thebeginning of the year the war has started in this country. So,how are we going to solve the problems of the retired people? How are we going to solve the problems of the workers ifthis country is going to curtail the trade union rights, freedomof expression, freedom of movement and when abductionsare taking place everyday ? Therefore, I appeal to all theleaders, the President, the Leader of the Opposition and allthe Leaders seated on both sides of this House and also thetrade union leaders outside not to think of short-cuts orpolitical gains but bring this MoU into operation and respectthe MoU signed by both parties and bring peace to thiscountry. We must try to help not only the re workers butbe the workers who are there today and the future workersas well.

Sir, thank you evry much for giving me time to speak.
