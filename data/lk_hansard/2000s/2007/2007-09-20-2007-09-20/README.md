( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Mr. Speaker, I associate myself with what has been said by the other Members in the Opposition benches on these two Items and in support of what the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated now, I would like read this out from "Parliamentary Practice" by Erskine May. Sir, I quote: Where it is sought to supersede a question, by leaving out the words after That and adding other words, the proposed amendment should not be confined to a mere negation of the terms of the motion, as the proper method of expressing a contrary opinion is by voting against a motion without seeking to amend it. The question that arises here and which has to be gone into is, do you seek to negate it? If it is to be negated, then they have to vote against it. I was quoting from "Parliamentary Practice" by Erskine May, which is relevant to this in defining what the nature of the Motion is. I also want to bring up another point. When this amendment came up, not only the Hon. Member, but I think even the Hon. Leader of the House asked me yesterday what our position was. So, while we were discussing this, another event also took place. The Chief Opposition Whip raised certain issues with you, Mr Speaker, as to what should be done about it. You still have to give a ruling on the matter. It is only after you give a ruling on the matter, if at all, that they should have moved Item 1 in the Order Paper under Notice of Motions. Because by this, what they are trying to do is to take away your power to give an order. That is illegal. So, now we have to throw this Motion out. You have to give an order and then we have to go on from Item 2 onwards. That is your power. I do not think you can do it by this. The Chief Opposition Whip has referred this to the Speaker. Pending that, we want to take this decision. That is not correct. All they are tying to do is to take away your power to say what has to be done under Standing Order

No. 23. It cannot be done by this type of a motion. I do not know, we have not gone into it. If it has to be done, it has to be through a separate motion. If a normal motion was brought in and before a point of Order was raised, the Government brought an amendment - I would not go to argue on that point. But there was a point raised as to the validity of this Motion and you, Mr. Speaker, have to give an order on that. Now, what the Government is trying to do by moving Item 1 under Notice of Motions is to prevent you from giving an order. The general authority of the Speaker is there. Even if this Motion is passed, it does not in any way affect the question raised. This, we can bring under Item 2. But I am not talking about that. What I am saying is, Item No. 1 under Notice of Motions cannot stand because it is trying to negate your power to give an order. If you had given an order yesterday and they have brought in the Motion today, it does not matter; that is a different matter. But you had not given an order; you are due to give an order. We are going to discuss, after the order, what we are going to do with the amendment. Now, instead of waiting for your order, they have brought this in. At least, they should have had the courtesy of asking you to give the order before they moved this Item. Now that they have moved this Item, I do not think you can give an order either. You can give the order only when this is taken out. So, that is the point I have to raise. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ? . . , . , . . . . , . , , , . . ? . - - 1989 , , , , , . , . . . .

Now, we have suspended Standing Order 23, which enables Item No. 2 to be taken up without waiting for the requisite days of notice. Now, what we are coming to is the general practice of the House. You can only take one item at a time, but if the Party Leaders agree, you can debate two or three items together.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) That is right.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe ) Now, what is before us is, the Orders of the Day. So, Item No. 1 under Orders of the Day is the Motion by the Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi. Item No. 2 is the Motion by the Hon. Leader of the House. If the Party Leaders agree to take both together, that is a different matter. Otherwise, it has to be one by one. But, remember this. That is, the first one is a Motion that comes under Private Members Business. Item No. 2 comes under Government Business. So, to debate both these together, did the Party Leaders agree or not?

( ) (An Hon. Member) No, no.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe ) If they have not agreed, then we - [Interruption.] They can say what they want.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Thank you very much, Hon. Member.

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Sir, can I ask a question from the Hon. Premachandran? Hon. Premachandran, you said that since you did not know what happened and do not have the know-how as to whether the allegation that is being levelled by the Hon. Sooriyaarachchi is correct, you cannot comment about it. I am just asking a general question. Do you believe that an organization like the LTTE, by accepting money will take political decisions? Do you believe that the LTTE is an organization which will take money and auction the votes of the Tamil people?

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) The point is this. A Member of Parliament has levelled some allegations regarding the matter you referred now and he is requesting for a Select Committee. So, it is up to you to decide on that. We do not know what has happened.

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) I am asking a general question. Does the TNA - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) I do not want to comment on that matter. If you want to get it clarified, you had better appoint a Select Committee. - [Interruption.] I do not want to comment on that.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Minister -

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Does the TNA believe that the LTTE is an organization which accepts money and takes political decisions?

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) This is not our problem. That is what I said. Actually the problem is with you. There are allegations that your people have given money to some organization. So, please inquire into it and decide on it. This is not our problem.

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Does the TNA believe that the LTTE gets money and takes political decisions?

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) This is not necessary here.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Dilan Perera, now we will allow the Hon. Hemakumara Nanayakkara to start his speech.

( - )

( The Hon. Navin Dissanayake - Minister of Investment Promotion) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I thank you for giving me some time to speak in this very timely and important Debate. First of all, I would like to reply my Colleague, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella on some of the issues that he raised during his speech.

[ ]

2007 20 545 546

Firstly, I would like to reply in regard to the so-called Cabinet Paper that you referred to. , . . Cabinet Paper , through a legal transaction it went to the Cabinet and it was approved. So, you cannot tie up what the Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi said with this transaction. They are two separate transactions and of course this programme has been approved by the people because it is in the "Mahinda Chintana." " , ' ' " . Cabinet Paper Cabinet Paper approval , . So, if the money has been misappropriated, if the money has not been spent properly, if the houses were not built, that is a different transaction; a different deal. You cannot tie up this deal with that deal. They are two different things. So, I would like to highlight that to you because you say that this transaction took place during the Presidential Election. The Cabinet Paper that you are referring to went through the Cabinet after the Presidential Election and it is a valid tender. It was a procurement that went through the Cabinet - [Interruption.] No, I am not giving way - [Interruption.] No, I am completely disputing that because they are two different transactions. The second point is - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) .

( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) . As a lawyer - you are also a lawyer - I can talk -[Interruption.] 2000 . . . They are two different transactions. You cannot tie the two transactions together. The second point is, you said that the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe was denied the opportunity to become the President of this country because six lakhs of votes did not come to him. I can testify honestly as a person who was in the UNP at that time and who was concerned, that if the votes of the North-East do not come to the Hon. Ranil Wicremasinghe, he would lose. I told this to Mr. Malik Samarawickrema. He told me, Navin, do not worry, the LTTE votes are in the bag. These are the words that he used. Soon after the Presidential Election, the United National Party, particularly, the leadership of the United National Party - when I talk of the leadership, I talk about three people, Mr. Ranil Wickremasinghe, Mr. Lasantha Wickramatunga and Mr. Malik Samarawickrema, the three people who are running the

party today - made an allegation that 200,000 names were cut off from the electoral register. If these 200,000 names were cut off from the electoral register, you could have filed an election petition. Why did you not do that? Whatever you say about the LTTE votes, you had a valid ground to go to the Supreme Court and challenge the validity of the election of the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa. You did not do that. Why did you not do that? I am telling you today that that was a valid ground. After you had filed the petition, you could have amended it to bring in the other allegation as well. You did not do that. You had a valid ground. You did not use that valid ground. Now it being sour grapes, you talk utter nonsense here. Therefore, I would like to now elaborate on my argument as far as this Debate is concerned. This is a very serious charge. Anybody who makes serious charges such as these have to have some evidence. Any illegal dealing with the LTTE has to be very severely condemned. We do not want our leaders to betray this country by having any secret dealings with the LTTE. Any secret dealings with the LTTE must be condoned by all patriotic forces and people in this country. Any dealings with the LTTE have to be transparent, honest and open. It has to go through the Cabinet. It has to go through the group meetings and it has to go through all the representatives who represent their political parties. Who are the leaders, what are the political parties that have done this? Now, that is why this Select Committee has been appointed. If we have anything to hide, we would not appoint this Select Committee. Because we are honest and open you can represent the facts. The Select Committee can come to whatever decision it can. Therefore, there were two instances where such dealings with the LTTE have been brought forward. One is the 1990 to1991 period when President Premadasa had discussions with the LTTE. Now, in this House there are people like the Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne who were associated with my late father and Mr. Lalith Athulath Mudali. They were the ones who brought forward this allegation before the country. They said when they were in the DUNF that there were secret dealings and arms and ammunition were given to the LTTE. What happened after that? They did not level baseless allegations like what the Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi is doing now. What did they do? They brought forward a person. Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne, can you remember that? This person was Wathiyage, who drove the truck load of ammunitions that were to be given to the LTTE. What happened to Wathiyage? What did Mr. Lalith Athulath Mudali and Mr. Gamini Dissanayake do? They had plastic surgery done on Wathiyage and they took him abroad. That is the history of this country, that is the history of great people. There they honestly felt that that illegal transaction that President Premadasa did was wrong for the country and they rose up against that and they left the

547 548

Cabinet and they fought President Premadasa on that issue. That is the history. Then also we have the 2002 Ceasefire Agreement. Now I am also party to this, because I was in the UNP at that time. During the UNPs time I like to ask my Colleagues specially the Cabinet Ministers, was this Ceasefire Agreement put to the Cabinet? No. It was not. I say that with responsibility. I ask the Secretary to the Cabinet during that time as to whether this Ceasefire Agreement was put to the Cabinet? No. It was not. After the Ceasefire Agreement was signed in January it was put to the Cabinet and discussed for a very short time. The Parliamentary Group of the United National Party did not know about the Ceasefire Agreement. We were not told. Certainly if we were told, those patriotic MPs would have spoken out against it. We did not know about the terms of the Ceasefire Agreement. What was discussed, who were the people who negotiated this, we did not know. Now with hindsight, after two to three years later, we know that this Ceasefire Agreement was discussed and negotiated with Anton Balasingham and Eric Solheim. These are the facts. So what has the UNP leadership got to say about this? I am saying the words UNP Leadership because I know these UNP MPs also love their country. They are also patriotic. They also know within their hearts that certain things that happened during that time were wrong and against the interests of our country.

So, what have you got to say about that, my Hon. Colleagues? ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, I think you will have to conclude. ( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) Sir, please give me just two more minutes. Then, I would like to refer to this Agreement. Now, this so-called allegation is made by the Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi. In the Divaina newspaper of 8th of November, 2005, that is about one week before the Presidential Election, he states, I quote: 25 .

Now, my point is this. If the Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi is making this allegation now, certainly during that time also he knew about it. So, he is also party to this and as all the Lawyers in this House know, there is a thing called aiding and abetting. If there is a crime , . .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, may be the Leader of the House can clarify this for me. Now we have amended Motions and the English one is different from the Sinhala one. With regard to a Bill in case of inconsistency, the Sinhala version prevails. I wonder which of the two prevails in this case. Let me just point it out to you. The Sinhala one is very clear. First, you have the heading and after the heading you insert the amendment by the Leader of the House. "1989 .... 01 ," Then you come back to the main part, "2005 (....) ..." The English one reads differently because you want the amendment by the Leader of the House to be inserted after the words, in 2005. That comes at the end of that paragraph. Then it reads, Whereas questions have been raised both in Parliament and outside regarding a secret pact alleged to have been entered into between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and some other persons during the Presidential Election held.. Then you have to insert it according to the English amendment, alleged pacts entered into by the Presidents and the Prime Ministers of the Republic of Sri Lanka with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and financial, material and other forms of assistance granted from the 1st January 1989 upto date 'in 2005'.. I think, we should go by the Sinhala amendment and not the English one because it does not make sense.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) The Sinhala one will prevail. Even in legislation - ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . , . . Question put, and agreed to. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) .
