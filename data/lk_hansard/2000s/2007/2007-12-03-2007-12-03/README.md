QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE SECURITY OF TAMIL CIVILIANS AND PERSONNEL OF HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS . ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) Hon. Speaker, under the provisions of the Standing Orders, I wish to bring the following matters of urgent public importance to the notice of the House:

On the morning of 25th November, 2007, a Sunday, consequent to an aerial bombardment indiscriminately carried out by Sri Lankan war planes -Kfirs and MiGs - in Kilinochchi, Tharmapuram area, in the North of Sri Lanka, members of one family, namely S. Varnakulasingam, aged 50 years, his wife Saraswathy, aged 45 years and daughter Sumitha, aged 25 years, died on the spot, their bodies blown to pieces. Another aerial bomb attack took place in the same area on the same day in which Murugesu Subashini, aged 16, a student of Tharmapuram Maha Vidyalayam, Murugesu Nadanavathy, aged 58 years, the Vice-Principal of the same school, Kamalaraj, aged 29 years, his wife Thanayogam, aged 19 years, were seriously injured and admitted to hospital for treatment. On the Odduchudan-Puthukudiyiruppu Road, as a result of a claymore explosion perpetrated by a penetration group at about 8.45 a.m. on 25.11.2007, Sathanantharajah Kiritharan, a student of Puthukudiyiruppu Sivasubramaniyam Vidyalayam, Peryasamy Vijitharan of Kachilaimadu, Kerumadu and S. Thavaseelan, an ambulance driver, were severely injured and the ambulance was also badly damaged. On 26.11.2007, at Murunkan Malavarayar Kaddai Adampan area in the Mannar District, eight persons including five students and two teachers of Murunkan RCTM School were seriously injured due to a rocket attack and admitted to the intensive care unit for treatment. On 27.11.2007, at 9.45 a.m., eleven civilians including nine students of Thunukkai, Ayankulam School were killed in a claymore explosion and in the evening ten civilians in Kilinochchi were killed in an aerial bombardment. In spite of such glaring and indiscriminate killings, it is appalling and horrifying to find that the defence spokesman has gleefully boasted that on 25.11.2007 they had successfully destroyed the radio station of the LTTE. But the correct position is that as a result of such indiscriminate and wanton aerial attacks carried over the Tamil residential areas innocent Tamil civilians have been killed; their shelters and the belongings been destroyed. Consequent to such continuous aerial attacks, shell explosions and acute military operations, mass displacements of civilians are taking place in the Vanni area. For instance, 83,364 civilians have already got displaced in the Kilinochchi and the Mullaitivu districts, their shelters and the belongings been destroyed. Similarly, 5,965 and 10,302 persons are displaced in the Mannar and the Vavuniya districts respectively. The situation of the displaced is deteriorating owing to the onset of the rainy season as essential requirements such as drinking water, medicine and other types of assistance could not be sent to them; the closure of the Mannar-Uylankulam Road, further worsens this chaotic situation. The UNHCR, WFP, ICRC and such other humanitarian organizations are seriously handicapped from rendering their services at this hour of great need. It

is also pertinent to point out that this fact is reiterated by the UN Standing Committee. The employees of the humanitarian organizations are under fear. They are frightened to report to work and to service the people. While highlighting the fact that even in spite of the extreme chaotic situation prevailing at present in the Tamil residential areas of the country, with ulterior motives some politicians are levelling charges against humanitarian organizations including the UNICEF. Such deliberate actions of sinister motive have caused serious retardation in the rendition of humanitarian services in the Tamil residential areas, conflict areas which are already in utter turmoil. It is, therefore, strongly urged with much haste that such activities of uncivilized nature have to be vehemently condemned by this House. Within the Jaffna Peninsula which comes under the control of the armed forces, it could be observed with much concern and dismay that two to three youngsters, students, traders, employees et cetera are being abducted, getting disappeared and being killed daily. Approximately, six lakhs of people are presently in the Jaffna Peninsula. But thousands are getting displaced internally. Presently more than 60,000 security personnel are stationed in the peninsula which tantamounts to a ratio of one army soldier to every ten civilians. Moreover, the enforcement of curfew in the nights is still in force; check-points are installed in every nook and corner, round-up and search operations are a regular feature and about 50 civilians are being killed monthly. So, such atrocities, killings and calamities should not continue unlimitedly. We therefore, exhort this House to put an end to this tyranny forthwith. Also we want to urge that the safety and security of the personnel of the Non-Governmental Organizations be ensured. Mr. Speaker, I regret that I was unable to mention the killings of the bomb blast at Nugegoda on the 28th because this statement was prepared in the evening of the 27th. We also earnestly appeal to the United Nations Human Rights Commission and the international community, particularly, the Government of India to come forward immediately to stop this inhumane catastrophic situation in this country thus saving the human race from the wanton genocidal activities prolonging in this country. Mr. Speaker, this is the real situation in this country. It is another matter of national importance today to look into the routine work of the police and the armed forces between 01std to 02nd particularly, until yesterday. This report says that thousands of Tamil civilians have been arrested despite proving their identity through whatever police reports and residential permits. Even yesterday, we received information saying that more than 1000 Tamil civilians were arrested indiscriminately just because they

are Tamils, and particularly, out of them 419 civilians including women and girls have been sent to the Boossa Camp in Galle and they are languishing in the Boossa Camp without any amenities. They do not even have any alternate clothes to change their dressed ones in the Boossa Camp. I therefore, appeal in this House to please intervene into these matters immediately, particularly with regard to the arrest of the innocent Tamil civilians in Colombo and suburbs including other areas and take immediate action to release them. We are prepared to co-operate with the Government. If necessary, the police can check the people. But even the people who can prove their identification with Passports, National Identity Cards, Grama Sevaka certificates and working permits have been arrested and sent to the Boossa Camp. Therefore, I urge the Hon. Speaker and the Hon. Ministers present here to please intervene in this matter immediately and take appropriate steps to release these Tamil people forthwith. This is a fervent request that I am making from this House today. Thank you very much, Sir. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . [ ] . . ( ) (The Hon.

( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Mr. Speaker, I think, we should verify the accusation on the basis of what the Hon. Shivajilingam has said. It is one of the rights of the Members to come and take part in the Proceedings of the House. No one can stop them. And the most serious question is, how can a 300-gram or whatever, claymore mine be found in a high security zone? It is just like how people came to the other high security zone and burned The Sunday Leader printing press. I think you have to go into this matter and it is necessary for the Party Leaders to discuss it because it is not only the TNA Members who live in the area, but also, there are other Members. It is a very, very serious question as to who could have planted the bomb there. Mr. Speaker, I think you and the party Leaders, have to go into this because some other Members also live in that area. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon.

Tabled English translation of the speech : Hon. Chairman, My Ministry, the Ministry of Urban Development and Sacred Area Development and the agencies under the Ministry play a key role in achieving the Governments Medium - term Expenditure Framework for 2007-2010, which was developed on a sectoral approach. Sri Lanka is experiencing a rapid urbanization, which is in par with the global trend, and it is estimated that 50 per cent of the total population will live in urban cities by the year 2015. Therefore, a well planned path towards sustainable urban development has become a national priority. Within this scenario, the approach of my ministry is to develop the Uraban sector with in the Homework of uran settlement development while ensuring access to basic urban services to the urban dwellers. Hon. Chairman, in this context, the implementation strategies of my Ministry are to formulate and implement national policies on urban development Physical planning and to promote sustainable national level growth centres, townships, cultural centres in order to improve quality of life of the urban population - Furthermore, encouraging and facilitating community participation to implement urban development plans, upgrading of underserved settlements and water supply services are the other strategies to eradicate poverty. Sir, my Ministry has initiated a number of important policy initiatives in the year 2007. The Ministry has taken initiatives to establish a dedicated Authority for the development of urban under-served settlement in the country. The Authority is to provide the institutional framework to address the emerging issues in the under-served settlements by facilitating to provide better housing, upgrading housing units and ensuring that urban dwellers have adequate urban, basic services. We were able to amend the Urban Development Authority Act, introducing a fee on property developers in order to address the issues in the under-severed settlements in cities to ensure sustainable urban development in the year 2006. Accordingly, a policy initiative was taken to upgrade housing units in under-served settlements in cities throughout the island with community participation. Similarly, the Urban Development Authority Act was amended to formulate a scheme for rainwater harvesting to be included in the development plan prepared in terms of Section A keeping in line with the National Rainwater Policy and Strategies to order to promote rainwater harvesting as a strategy for localized flood mitigation, infiltration facilitation and improved sanitation.

1885 1886

In order to mitigate the flood conditions and to protect environmentally sensitive urban areas, we have taken steps to declare wetlands, marshy lands, water bodies and waterways as retention areas in the Western Province. My Ministry, with the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation, has initiated the preparation of a comprehensive plan, legislation and procedures for management of wetlands, marshy lands, paddy fields, abandoned paddy fields, water bodies and waterways in Colombo, Gampaha and Kalutara Districts of the Western Province of Sri Lanka. We have already declared canal banks as retention areas in five local authority areas with the concurrence of the respective local authorities. My Ministry is in the process of completing the work on a comprehensive revision of the planning and Building Regulations relating to the City of Colombo Development Plan gazetted in July, 1999 under Section 8f of the Urban Development Authority Law , No. 41 1978. During the visit of His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksha to China, I singed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ministy of Construction of the Peoples Republic of China to promote co-operation in the filed of urban housing. This MoU will provide a basic framework for co-operation programmes and exchange of urban housing policies, building codes and technologies between the two countries. One of the main tasks of the National Physical Planning Department under the purview of any Ministry is to prepare the National Physical Planning Policy and the National Physical Plan in order to promote sustainable development through the creation of strong Metro Regional Cities, reducing regional disparities while protecting fragile areas and reducing vulnerability to natural disasters. These plans have been prepared and approved by the National Physical Planning Council chaired by His Excellency the President on 03rd July, 2007. Sir, another important task of the National Physical Planning Department is to prepare Regional Plans for the provinces, Accordingly, considering the National Physical Plan and the Policy, the Eastern Province Regional Physical Plan and the Sabaragamuwa Province Regional Physical Plan have been prepared, and selected projects of these plans will be implemented in the year 2008. We have already commenced the preparation of Town Development Plans for all major service centres. As an accelerated project, the Kuruwita Town Development Plan has been prepared and town development work will be commenced in next year. This Town Development Project is implemented to facilitate the pilgrims and tourists who travel through the Karuwita Town visit the Sri Pada. Similarly, it is expected to prepare Regional Physical Plans for other provices. Sir, the Urban Development Authority embarked on several mega projects in order to increase the contribution to he national economy from the urban areas in the country. Ensuring equitable distribution of development opportunities towards areas hitherto underprivileged was the focus of these projects. Sir, the urban planners strongly believe that the Ruhunupura Greater Hambantota area will be a major economic generator of the country, which is planned to be the second gateway to the international linkages by means of ports and airports. This development will also conform to the Government policy of encouraging urban centres to achieve the goal of balanced regional development. Under the Greater Hambantota development, programmes, my Ministry, with the Urban Development Authority, has already commenced two mega urban infrastructure development projects. One is the Administrative Complex with the assistance of the Economic Development Co-operation Fund of Korea investing US Dollars 28.3 million. The administrative Complex consists of a main secretariat building, a library, an office building for the local authority residential quarters for officials. The other is the state of the art International Convention Centre with a seating capacity of 1,500, which will be a landmark urban infrastructure in the region. The construction has already commenced and it is partly funded by KOIKA as a grant with Gosl funding totaling the investment to US Dollars 10.5 million. The Hambantota Port and Airport projects involve us in integrated planning with the relevant Ministries and agencies.

Sir, in addition to these two mega projects the Urban Development Authority has prepared an urban design for beautifying the city centre of Hambantota. Under the first stage, the bus stand and the market were constructed. In the second state, the beach park will be developed accommodating the fish market with facilities for fishermen, public amenities and a landscaped park. The construction has already commences. Furthermore, we have initiated urban development activities in secondary towns in the Hambantota area, namely Beliatta, Tangalle, Weeraketiya, Walasmulla and Angunukolapelessa. Sir, the Greater Dambulla Development Programme is one of the major projects identified under the urban sector development in the Governments mid-term investment programme. This is implemented as an integrated regional urban development programme with a lager stakeholder participation. My Ministry has already launched a number of priority projects under the Greater Dambulla Development Programme, which will render a favourable impact on the national economy as well as regional development and employment generation. The construction of an Administrative Complex, which will make available 100,000 square feet of floor area in six storeys, to centralize the administrative functions has already commenced this year. The construction of Multipurpose Hall at Galewela Town centre has already been commenced under the Greater Dambulla Development Programme. This will increase the service delivery capacity of the Galewela Pradeshiya Sabha. We have lunched a new innovative programme - The Gammedda - to create an urban - rural connectivity with the objective of uplifting the living standard of the community. The rural communities, which are serving the city centres with their commodities and services, would be provided with urban facilities in their villages. In this programme the communities have become the centre of development in terms of planning, constructing and operating urban facilities such as warehouses, community halls, roads et cetera. Upgrading of houses of the community is the other initiative under this programme and the Ministry has already commenced work and more than 100 houses have been upgraded through community participation. My Ministry has already started work with other Ministries to implement a number of projects such as the construction of a cereal marketing centre at Galewella, road development, new rail link to Dambulla to create Greater Dambulla as a national growth centre. Sir, the Urban Development Authority is committed to continue the programme of shifting administrative functions of the Government from Colombo to the Sir Jayewardenipura - Kotte Administrative Capital City. Under this programme, the expansion of the Sethsiripaya Administrative Complex has been planned and constructions under Stage II of the Project have already commenced at the cost of Rs. 2,000 million. It will add 350,000 square feet of office space. Sir, it is important to create the City of Colombo as a vibrant commercial capital and my Ministry has initiated a number of programmes and projects. The Panchikawatte Triangle re-development programme will be the largest urban regeneration project. The Urban Development Authority has already commenced an urban housing programme to relocate families in Pradeepa Mawatha as a part of the Panchikawatta Triangle Re-development programme. The other projects my Ministry has commenced with the Urban Development Authority are Development of Independence Square & Its Surrounding Green Development Project, Beira Lake Restoration Project-Development of East Beira Lake and the urban housing programme. Sir, the Development of Greater Trincomalee Area is important to create peace, harmony and integrity through economic development in the Trincomalee erea. The UDA has initiated action to implement some of the identified priority projects such as the construction of a vegetable market with an investment of Rs. 135 million, the Trincomalee District Secretariat Building creating 60,000 square meters of office space with a project cost of Rs. 400 million and the re-development of the fish market in Trincomalee with a cost of Rs. 140 million. My Ministry contyributes to the Nagenahira Navodaya Programme by developing city development plans based on the regional development plans and has identified for redevelopment town centers such as Kantale, Vakarai, Kalmunai, Tirukkovil. In those towns, the UDA has already taken action to establish Market buildings, bus stands as priority projects.

Sir, Post - Tsunami Reconstruction in the Galle Town was greatly hampered due to unavailability of land suitable for resettlement of displaced families and urban activities. The UDA has prepared a development plan for the Greater Galle Area and facilitate other infrastructure development agencies to develop infrastructure. Building a complex for housing regional administrative offices of 30 public institutions near Beligaha Junction and development of a fully - fledged regional sports complex at Dadalla in Galle will be implemented on a priority basis. Similarly, the Urban Development Authority initiates a number of urban infrastructure projects under the Matara Development Programme and facilitate to develop the new hospital complex as a priority project. Sir, the present peradeniya Town centre has been declared as prone to landslides and the Government has decided to relocate the town at Eriyagama. The UDA has already identified lands and in the 2008 Budget, funds have been allocated to commence the work. Sir, the secondary town centres play a major role creating new economic opportunities for local entrepreneurs. Many of the small towns posses enormous resources underutilized due to lack of basic infrastructure facilities, poor access to service networks and technology, Furthermore, small towns provide participatory space for communities to involve in economic activities, innovative local actions, and city management, giving the feeling that they are partners of economic development. In that context, my Ministry, with the agencies, has initiated important urban infrastructure development projects in a number of towns, namely Balangoda, Ratnapura, Nawalapitiya, Thalawekela, Horana, Paddukka, Mahara-Kadawatha, Avissawella, Gampaha, Maharagama, Homagama, Seethawaka and Diyagama. Sir the urban development Autority has commenced the Spatial Information Infrastructure for Reconstruction Monitoring Project which is a very important project that would be started this year with assistance of Euro 6.0 million from the French Government. The project aims at providing complete cartographic and GIS solutions from High Resolution satellite image serving as the infrastructure basis for the implementation of reconstruction oriented GIS applications, development plans on priority townships alonge the coastal belt from Trincomalee to Galle. Geographic Information System GIS technology can be used for Urban planning, scientiffc investigations, resource management, asset management, Environmental Impact Assessment, cartography, criminology, history, sales, markeing, logistrics and tourism. Example, GIS might allow emergency planners to easily calculate emergency response times in the event of a natural disaster, GIS might be used to find wetlands that need protection from pollution or GIS can be used by a company to site a new business to take advantage of a previously underserved market. Developments will result in a much wider use of technology throughout science, government, business and industry, with applications including real estate, public health, crime mapping (*national defense), sustainable development, natural resources, landscape architecture, archaeology, regional and community planning, transportation and logistics and even tourism. Sir, preparation and gazetting of development plans will ensure planned and sustainable urban development in the cities and the Urban Development Authority has already gazetted 16 local authorities and development plans for nine local authorities are to be gazetted this year. In the year 2008, the UDA has planned to gazette urban development plans for another 41 local authorities. Sir, besides the gazetting of development plans, the Urban Development Authority also facilitates the local authorities to develop city development plans and promote infrastructure and environment management projects in terms of project preparation, project implementation and management.

Sir, my Ministry contributes to investment promotion in the country, mainly in the urban sector and works closely with the Board of Investment to create a conducive environment for investors to invest in the urban sector. Sir, I am pleased to mention that we have initiated a pilot project for Demonstrative Zero Emission Electric Vehicles in urban transport with the Lanka Electric Vehicle Association LEVA an award winning, local, non-profit making organization which has pioneered in Sri Lanka the conversion of standard petrol and diesel vehicles to run on electric batteries. This will certainly reduce urban air pollution and conserve energy. Sir, the Sri Lanka land Reclamation & Development Corporation - SLLRDC - under the guidance of my Ministry, embarked on the Colombo Canal System Improvement Project with an investment of Rs.1,086 million received as a loan under Danish Mixed Credits and Rs.62 million as the contribution of the Government of Sri Lanka to improve the water quality. In addition to this, SLLRDC implements a number of very important projects to create a sustainable urban environment in the country. Maintaining the main canal systems and minor canals, Rehabilitation of Colombo Puttalam Canal and - Hamilton Canal, development of lands in Mudun Ela area and Ragama, Dredging / Surface Clearing of the Lake at Wedamulla are some of them. Sir, indiscriminate mining and extraction of river sand has caused severe environmental concerns in the country. The Ministry has initiated studies with the University of Moratuwa and the Lanka Hydraulic Institute to determine alternative ways of obtaining sand. Accordingly, the Corporation commenced a project of mining off-shore sea sand and releasing it to the market for construction purposes. The Reclamation of Lands at Wedamulla, Kelaniya (Stage 1) was completed earlier. As a part of the same project - Stage II - dredging and surface clearing of the lake at Wedamulla were completed in August, 2007. The Project cost was Rs.1.26 million. Sir, Real Estate Exchange (Pvt.) Limited - REEL which is operating under my Ministry, has embarked on the implementation of urban housing programme as stipulated in the Mahinda Chintana. Under this programme, we have commenced the Palen Mandira programme to provide urban housing for underserved settlements. Sir, The Governments development policy framework, Mahinda Chintana : Vision for a New Sri Lanka, A Ten Year Horizon Development Framework 2006-2016 , steers the propoor initiatives in urban areas over the next ten years. The Ministry has embarked on multi-faceted approach to improve the urban under-served settlements. Providing assistance in the development of bankable projects and financial instruments to attract domestic capital for communities in the urban underserved settlements is an innovateive approach. The Ministry with the assistance of UN-HABITAT has established a new venture to provide credit enhancement for the urban poor for their housing loans. Sir, my Ministry has initiated support to implement the Sri Lanka Urbanization Framework under the auspices of UNDP and UN-HABITAT. This programme supports the Governments ambitious Ten - Year Urban Development framework and promtes urban good Governance to ensure sustainable urban development. Sri Lanka is one of the 191 signatories to the Millennium Declaration which emerged out of the Millennium Summit of September, 2000. Localizing Millennium Goals - MDGs - was one of the first attempts in Sri Lanka to disaggregate national data for measuring regional distortions in MDS performance. The Project profiled the MDG status of ten selected cities based on the findings of MDG performance survey undertaken in each city; The objective was to create awareness on MDGs amongst key city stakeholders to from the basis for a local development framework, which targeted improved delivery of basis services for the poor. My Ministry has planned to expand the preparation of MDG profiles for other cities in the year 2008. In our multifaceted approach to urban Development, my Ministry implements a number of projects to improve the urban environment. Lunawa Environment Improvement & Community Development Project funded by the Japan Bank for International Co-operation is an important

1889 1890

project to improve the environment and to uplift the quality of life of people in Lunawa area by alleviating flood, through improvement of storm water drainage systems, including the rehabilitation of existing canals and streams and creating a hygienic and pleasant environment. Upgrading living conditions includes around 855 Households identified for resettlement, Under-served communities in the inundated area and communities living along new canal and Lake Front. One of the key challenges in the urban sector is the increasin population in the underserved settlements. The Urban Settlements Improvement Programme is a key programme functioning under my Ministry, which is designed to address the ever growing problems and issues in the field of underserved urban settlements, especially, in the Colombo Metropolitan Region. This programme facilitates the communities in the urban underserved settlements to improve their social and environmental infrastructure including housing on a participatory and partnership basis with the support of agencies, such as Urban Local Authorities, Government and Non - Government Orgainzations. Sir, the experience gained from the Urban Settlement Improvement Programme has already proved that the qualitative aspects of the community such as positive attitudes, community spirit, commitment of the leaders, willingness to participate and contribute in cash or labour towards settlement improvement work are more important for providing an integrated infrastructure package with the direct participation of the communities in urban underserved settlements. The programme has already served more than 18,000 families in the urban sector. My Ministry has paid special attention to housing programmes that gives priority to the poor community living in urban areas without facilities in terms of the concept of the Mahinda Chintana Policy Framework of the present Government that every family should have a house of their own. Accordingly the Participatory Urban Housing Development Programme Arunodaya Housing Programme - for urban poor has been commenced this year. This programme is carried out through a community based consultative and participatory process from the stage of planning, initiation, identification of beneficiaries, design and construction involving Jana Sabhas and other local community based organizations, community leaders and local level elected leaders. Under this programme, a grant of Rs. 125,000 has been given to a benificiary family expecting a contribution from the beneficiary to construct the house. We have already commenced work in this programme with 1,000 families to construct housing units which will be completed within the next 90 days. Colombo has been expanding its area of direct influence intensively during the past three decades with the Metropolitan Area of Colombo intensifying its activities in trade and commerce and increasing in population. These trends have rapidly multiplied road traffic in the area resulting in the accelerated spread of traffic congestion in the area. My Ministry is implementing a town development project for Kottawa-Kaduwela and Kadawatha townships along with the Outer Circular Highway, which is a new access controlled circular highway linking the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway and the Southern Transport Development Project. Sir combining township development with the development of a major highway is a pioneering approach in Sri Lanka. Some of the salient features of the project are application of new technology utilizing satellite imagery applications in place of traditional methods and creating investment opportunities. We contribute to the efforts of the Government on reducing poverty of underprivileged communities in the country. The Community water supply and sanitation programme, which operates two large projects through World Bank funding and Government funding is operating in 13 districts of the country. These two projects are desigened to achieve the set objectives by intergrating safe drinking water, basic sanitation, hygiene education, environmental programmes and diversifying community activities to socioeconomic and cultural fields. The World Bank funded project is being implemented in selected Pradeshiya Sabhas in the North Western, Central and Eastern Provinces. The total estimated cost of the project is Rs. 5,644 million which includes a World Bank grant of Rs. 3,757 million, a GSL contribution of Rs. 715 million and community contributions worth Rs. 1,172 million. The project targets to provide water supply facilities to approximately one million people

living in 804 GNDs. The project is being implemented in 15 estate divisions in the Nuwara Eliya District on a pilot basis. The Project targets to provide assistance to construct 66,000 latrines under the sanitation programme. The ongoing community water and sanitation project funded by the Government is presently being implemented in seven districts and targets to provide benefits to approximately one million people in 609 GNDs. The project implementing districts are Hambantota, Matara, Badulla, Ratnapura, Anuradhapura, Gampaha and Colombo. The total estimated cost of the project is Rs. 4,025 million, which includes a JBIC contribution of Rs. 550 million, a GSL Contribution of Rs. 2,934 million and community contributions worth Rs. 541 million. The project targets to provide assistance to construct 45,000 latrines under the sanitation programme. Sir I strongly believe that with the resources allocated to my Ministry by the 2008 Budget and with the skills, the knowledge and the commitment of the agencies under the Ministry, we will create a greater impact on the countrys socio-economic development.
