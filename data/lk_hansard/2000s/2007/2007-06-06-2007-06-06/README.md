( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Thank you, Venerable Chairperson. The Hon. Susil Premajayantha, finishing his speech wanted the wholehearted support of the Members for the extension of the state of Emergency. I do not think, Sir, that there is any other country with a democratic system that is ruled under an Emergency for as long as Sri Lanka. In India, the state of Emergency is viewed with opprobrium. It would be strongly resisted. Recently, General Musharraf, the Pakistani ruler, was asked whether he would declare Emergency in the situation of unrest prevalent in that country. He categorically stated that he would not. Even though he was not democratically elected as a leader, he seemed to acknowledge that there was something repugnant about the declaration of an Emergency. On the contrary, it would appear that in Sri Lanka we need an Emergency to be able to govern and we seem to perpetually require a state of Emergency. I want to really state, Sir, that irrespective of whoever is in power, we should realize that Emergency rule erodes civilian authority and when prolonged can lead to very harmful consequences. Having said that, Sir, in regard to the proclamation of the Emergency, I would now like to address my mind to some of the burning issues that are confronting this country. I have thus far, Sir, refrained from making any comment about the APRC process, even when questioned by the media. The Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi was not invited to the APRC process, and we have not been a part of the process. The long awaited SLFP proposals have now been made public. The SLFP is the main party in Government. It is the ruling party. Consequently, its proposals assume much importance. The significant features of the SLFP proposals are: I. that the district is the unit. II. The present unitary strcture of the Constitution shall be preserved.

These proposals, in my respectful view, are intended to appease majoritarian nationalism and do not provide the basis for a dialogue to resolve the conflict. The JVP is currently not a participant in the APRC process. The JHU wants the Sinhala nation and Buddhism given absolute supremacy. The JHU says that there is no ethnic conflict nor a national question. They demand the recognition that the Sinhalese only are the nationality of this country. It is my duty, Venerable Presiding Member, to point out that the SLFP proposals contain lesser powers than what the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact of 1957 had and the Dudley Senanayake-Chelvanayakam Pact of 1965 had, in respect of matters dealt with under the said Pacts; less than what the Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987 contemplated, less than what the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and the Provincial Councils Act of 1987 provided; less than what the Mangala Moonasinghe Select Committee proposals of 1992 provided; very much less than what the Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga led SLFP proposals of 3rd August, 1995 had and even less than the much diluted constitutional proposals which the Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga led SLFP Government presented to Parliament on 3rd August, 2000. The current proposals presented by the SLFP are also a far cry from the Oslo Communiqu of 5th December, 2002 and the Tokyo Declaration of 21st March, 2003. I think it is necessary, Sir, to place on record the contents of those two documents. This is what the Oslo Communiqu stated. I quote: Responding to a proposal by the leadership of the LTTE, the parties agreed to explore a solution founded on the principle internal self-determination in areas of historical habitation of the Tamil-speaking peoples, based on a federal structure within a united Sri Lanka. The parties acknowledged that the solution has to be acceptable to all communities. The Tokyo Declaration stated as follows. I quote: In their political discussion the parties reiterated their commitment to develop a federal system based on internal self-determination within a united Sri Lanka The Parties further agreed to go into issues such as geographical regions, the division of powers between the centre and the regions and other issues later. It is abundantly clear, Venerable Presiding Member, from the current SLFP proposals that race and religion are sought to be given primacy in the governance of this country. The essence of a unitary structure of government, Venerable Presiding Member, is that all legislative and executive power is vested with central authorities, the Parliament in regard to legislative power, the President or the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers in regard to executive power. The central authorities retain the power at their will to grant, to withdraw, to alter or to annul any power that it may share with a subsidiary

2007 06 891 892

body. The existing majoritarian hegemony would be preserved and perpetuated even if power is shared to whatever extent under a unitary structure of governance. That clearly is what is meant by the current SLFP proposal, Preserve the present unitary character of the Constitution. The concept of power sharing even if it is introduced under such an arrangement would be a Trojan horse. It needs to be pointed out that whatever the grievances which existed prior to the 1972 Constitution there was no demand for separation. The Soulbury Constitution framed at independence did not postulate a unitary structure of government. It was the enactment of the 1972 Constitution enshrining the unitary structure of government that led to the demand for separation and total sovereignty. The unitary concept, Venerable Sir, denies equality to distinct peoples, to distinct nationalities and reinforces exclusive majoritarian supremacy. The proposal for the district to be the unit clearly suits the objective of majoritarian hegemony. Sinhala colonization in crucial districts in the Eastern Province in violation of domestic law and the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam and Dudley Senanayake-Chelvanayakam Pacts resulting in demographic changes beneficial to the Sinhala majority together with the unitary structure of governance will ensure Sinhala dominance in such districts. The ulterior objective is to deny distinct peoples, distinct nationalities who constitute a majority in linguistically contiguous territories which they have historically inhabited, a meaningful space in governance in such territory. This is being deliberately done so as to ensure Sinhala majoritarian rule in every part of the country as desired by hard-line Sinhala elements. To achieve such unjust Sinhala dominance, democratic verdicts of the Tamil people in electoral processes in such territories over the past five decades are being totally disregarded. The Tamil people are being denied the freedom to collectively have a meaningful say in matters pertaining to their lives. This is an assault on their self-respect and dignity. The denial of such freedoms is tantamount to the imposition of majoritarian tyranny; the odd Tamil quisling is sought to be projected as representative of the Tamil people in blatant violation of the overwhelming democratic verdicts of the Tamil people. Venerable Presiding Member, this is in violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International covenants on economic, social and cultural rights and civil and political rights. The Tamil people in violation of their democratic electoral verdicts are being consistently denied the right to internal self-determination within a united country in linguistically contiguous territories which they have historically inhabited. The Tamil people are thus subjected to arbitrary and authoritarian Sinhala majoritarian rule. Venerable, Sir, may I, at this stage and in this context refer to the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in the case relating to the Secession of Quebec. I would read

certain paragraphs from the judgment of that Court which I think are relevant in the Sri Lankan context particularly in the context of the Tamil people being denied the right to internal self-determination. It states, I quote: Democracy is not simply concerned with the process of government. On the contrary, Democracy is fundamentally connected to substantive goals, most importantly, the promotion of self-government. Democracy accommodates cultural and group identities. I will read another paragraph: The Court must be guided by the values and principles essential to a free and democratic society which I believe to embody, to name but a few, respect for the inherent dignity of the human person, commitment to social justice and equality, accommodation of a wide variety of beliefs, respect for cultural and group identity, and faith in social and political institutions which enhance the participation of individuals and groups in society. Democracy does not mean merely running a country or governing a country in accordance with the wishes of the majority, it means something very much more. May I proceed further to read certain paragraphs of the judgment in regard to this concept of internal self-determination. I think it is very important that the people in this country should understand what this concept means if they desire to keep this country as a united country and as an undivided country. It further states, quote: International law grants the right to self-determination to 'peoples'." "It is clear that a people may include only a portion of the population of an existing state. The right to self-determination has developed largely as a human right, and is generally used in documents that simultaneously contain references to nation and state. The juxtaposition of these terms is indicative that the reference to people does not necessarily mean the entirety of a states population. It means that distinct people in a country, like the Tamil people, why for that matter even the Muslim people should be entitled to exercise the right to internal self-determination. I go on further Sir, and read; dealing with a denial of the right to self-determination and the context in which the right to external self-determination would be available, the court has further stated; 1. The right of colonial peoples to exercise their right to self-determination by breaking away from the imperial power is now undisputed. In other words if you are under colonial rule you are entitled to break away. 2. The other clear case where a right to external selfdetermination accrues is where a people is subject to alien subjugation, domination or exploitation, outside the colonial context.

[ . ]

Like what happened, Sir, in East Timor recently. East Timor was a colony under the Portuguese. But somehow the Indonesians at some point of time attempted to bring East Timor under their control, militarily and East Timor resented it and exercised the right to secede on the basis that they were subjected to alien subjugation.

The third situation would be, Sir, a number of commentators have further asserted that the right to self- determination may ground a right to unilateral secession in a third circumstance, although this third circumstance has been described in several ways, the underlying proposition is that when people is blocked from the meaning exercise of its right to self-determination internally, it is entitled as a last resort to exercise it by secession. When the people are denied the right to self-determination internally. I want to say that the Tamil people in this country have been denied the right to self-determination internally in keeping with their democratic verdicts for about the past five decades in this country. In such circumstances those people who have been denied the right to internal self-determination are entitled to choose the right to external self-determination. This is something Sir, which I think all my good Friends in Government, everybody in this country needs to bear in mind. The Tamil people are a distinct people, that we are a distinct nationality who have historically inhabited certain contiguous territories in this country is an incontrovertible fact. We have democratically through electoral verdicts over the past half a century demanded the right to internal self-determination, a federal form of government, which we have been denied. And in those circumstances, it is my respectful submission that such people are being compelled, are being forced to seek external self-determination because of the denial of the right to internal self-determination. The Supreme Court of Canada further stated that the consent of the governed is a value that is basic to its understanding of a free and democratic society. Consent of the governed is a value that is basic in a free and democratic society.

The Sri Lankan State has persistently rejected this value for a period of over 50 years insofar as the Tamil people are concerned. Any political solution, Venerable Sir, must be consistent with the longstanding legitimate political aspirations of the Tamil people. Substantial self-rule in the linguistically contiguous territories which they have historically inhabited has been their legitimate political goal. We recognize that the concerns of our Tamil speaking Muslim brethren in such territories must be addressed to their satisfaction. Any solution must be commensurate with the suffering and sacrifices the Tamil people have endured for the past 50 years. The North-East has been devastated. The lives of our people have been shattered. Only a collective effort by the Tamil people can accomplish the immense task of rebuilding our territories and restoring the lives of our people.

The Sri Lankan State endeavours to blame the LTTE for this catastrophe. This position of the Sri Lankan State, in my respectful submission, needs to be examined. For well-nigh three decades, since Independence the Tamil people never engaged in violence. The Tamil people only were the victims of violence in repeated anti-Tamil pogroms. No other people were victims of such violence. The political struggle of the Tamil people during this period was peaceful, non-violent and democratic. We followed the Gandhiyan way of Sathyagraha. We were subject to physical violence when we engaged in Sathyagraha. These facts are indisputable. From the time the country gained Independence for well-nigh three decades this was the position. It was after the abrogation of the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam and Dudley Senanayake-Chelvanayakam Pacts the rejection of the demand for a federal system of Government overwhelmingly supported by our people at successive General Elections, repeated racial pogroms against the Tamil people, the failure of the State to protect them when such pogroms occurred, denial of equal opportunity in education, in employment - even today, the Tamil-speaking people and when I say, Tamil-speaking people I refer to the Sri Lankan Tamils, to the Muslims and to the Indian Tamils who are over 26 per cent of the countrys population and have only 8.31 per cent employment in the public service, the 8.31 per cent includes the teachers but for the teachers, it will be even less - denial of equal opportunities in development, and the enactment of the 1972 and 1978 Constitutions in the face of Tamil opposition and without the consent of the Tamil people, enshrining the unitary character of the Constitution against our democratic verdicts, that the Tamil youth driven against the wall, took to arms. There have been excrescences which cannot be denied and are unacceptable, but it would be dishonest, Venerable Sir, to attribute the failure to resolve the Tamil question in an acceptable manner to this phenomenon. The truth is that the Sinhala political leadership have lacked the will and the determination to evolve an acceptable political solution and the capacity through a bipartisan consensus at least amongst the two major parties to carry forward successfully such a process. This is the stark truth which cannot be denied. You have never been able to offer the Tamil people an acceptable political solution supported by a bipartisan consensus that could have ensured its success. That is the challenge which you should have thrown at the LTTE. That would have been the litmus test. This you were never able to do. To conceal your failure on this count, you seek refuge behind the international stand on Terrorism. All your failures are swept under the carpet. Sir, there were two opportunities in the recent past that could have provided the initial breakthrough which the Tamil people earnestly wished would become a reality. The first was an interim arrangement for the North-East. Frankly Sir, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe,

2007 06 895 896

in my view, erred when he dilly-dallied on setting up an interim arrangement. He had a mandate from the electorate to do that. His 2001 Election Manifesto sought a mandate from the country to do that. He still did not do it. He was worried about President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and her advisers. If he set up the interim administration in terms of the mandate that the country gave him, a new environment conducive to a peaceful resolution would have been created. He would also have been elected the President of the Country. He lost that opportunity. If we examine, Sir, the position a little more closely in regard to this particular matter, the LTTE submitted its proposals for an Interim Self Governing Authority on 31st October, 2003. Four days later former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga took over some key Ministries including Defence, on the 4th of November 2003. The Ranil Wickremasinghe Government continued till early 2004 when Parliament was dissolved. I would like to refer to what the LTTE Leader, Mr. Velupillai Prabhakaran stated in his Martyr's Day Speech in November 2003. I am not a Member of the LTTE and I do not stand up in this House on behalf of the LTTE. But there are certain facts which must be stated and which must be put on record. What did he state in his Martyr's Day speech in November 2003. This is what he said. It states, I quote: Our organization, as well as our people do not want war. We want peace and we want to resolve our problems through peaceful means. We are deeply committed to the peace process. In another paragraph, Sir, in the course of the same speech he said, It states, I quote: The allegations levelled against our draft proposals that they aim to create an independent Tamil state or that they contain stepping stones for separation are not true. Our proposals do not constitute a framework for a permanent final solution. Our draft proposals deal with an interim arrangement. He goes on to state in another paragraph: We have presented our ideas for an interim Administrative authority, as a counter programme to the governments proposals and as a basis for negotiations. Why did not the Sri Lankan State negotiate with the LTTE when the Leader of the LTTE was saying this quite specifically and quite openly? They could not do so because the Sinhala political leadership was at each others throat. Former President Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga took away three Ministries from Ranil Wickremasinghe Government. There was the Sinhala struggle for power. Chandrika did not want Ranil to succeed. Individuals aspiring to high political office were adding to the conflict, promoting the conflict and in this environment it was not possible to start talks on the ISGA. That was the reality Venerable, Sir. President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga dissolved

Parliament and held elections in early 2004. In order to win the election, she had to form an Alliance with the JVP and with that Alliance she won. After she won the elections, the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi had a long meeting with her on the 10th of June, 2004. That meeting went on till past midnight. It went on till almost 1.00 oclock in the morning. We pressed her to start talks on the ISGA and she gave us the assurance that she would soon commence talks on the ISGA though she had strong reservations on some proposals. She did not do so in fact she could not do so because she was in alliance with the JVP and the JVP would not allow her to do so. This is a fact which all of you know, which the whole country knows. In this context Venerable Sir, let us look at what Mr. Velupillai Prabhakaran, Leader of the LTTE had to say in his Martyrs Day speech in 2004. I quoted to you earlier the Martyrs Day speech of 2003. I am now going to quote the Martyrs Day 2004 speech. This is what he said. It states, I quote: If some elements of our proposals are deemed problematic or controversial, these issues can be resolved through discussions at the negotiating table. Once the Interim Administrative Authority is institutionalized and becomes functional, we are prepared to engage in negotiations for a permanent settlement to the ethnic problem. The talks still did not start. Why was no effort made to hold Velupillai Prabhakaran, the LTTE Leader to the commitment that he made publicly to the whole world in his 2004 Martyrs Day speech? Who was to blame? These are the questions, Venerable Sir, that have to be answered. I will give you the reason. Most unfortunately, the forces who want the present unitary structure of government and majoritarian hegemony to continue were opposed to an ISGA because these forces knew very well that the ISGA will sound the death-knell of the unitary structure of government and majoritarian hegemony. These forces are blindly committed to the preservation of majoritarian hegemony for selfish and anachronistic reasons. This is the reality, Venerable Sir. Prabhakaran made his speech in November 2004 and tsunami struck in December, 2004. Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga has recently admitted in an interview that both the alliance with the JVP and the dissolution of Parliament were fatal flaws. She has publicly admitted that. What is the use? Of course, she herself found much to her surprise that her term of office, contrary to her expectations, was cut short by one year. I will not go into that question, Venerable Sir. That is not something I am interested in. She was in no position, however, to reverse the mistakes she had made. From what I have stated, Venerable Sir, you will see that these are the games that are consistently played within the Sinhala political setup purely to capture power, to retain power or to defeat somebody else in power.

897 898

They keep shifting the goal-posts, do what they like. There was no level playing field and the ever-burning Tamil question in these circumstances is treated as a political football.

Venerable Sir, different views have been taken in regard to the ISGA proposals. I will not go very much into that in detail. In my view, some of the provisions have been grossly misinterpreted by learned gentlemen on the other side. I wish to, however, point out that there are four features in the ISGA, the first relating to human rights, the second relating to secularism, the third relating to prohibition against discrimination and the fourth relating to protection of all communities which, in my view, are exemplary by international standards and are not contained in your Sri Lankan Constitutions. And, if the SLFP had taken a cue from those four matters I referred to in formulating your current proposals, your proposals could have indeed achieved a much greater deal of respectability.

The second opportunity that we have missed in recent times, Venerable Sir, which I have been referring to was the Post-Tsunami Operational Management Structure which was to deal with tsunami-affected areas in the North-East. This was scuttled by judicial intervention at the behest of the JVP and the JHU. The two major parties would do well to remember that no problem in this country can be solved on the basis of policies enunciated by the JVP or the JHU. The acrimony between the two main parties encourages these two parties to play a role on crucial issues such as the Tamil question, disproportionate to their political standing in the country. This is the real fact which cannot be denied.

Let us talk about the recent past Sir. I talked about 2003, 2004 and all that. But let us look at the recent past. There was a Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Government and the main opposition party, the primary objective of which was to reach a consensus on the national question. Recently, a couple of months ago, the MoU provided an opportunity for the two main parties to work together on the national question and all right thinking people in this country including myself heaved a sigh of relief. It was not long, before the usual political skulduggery took over and today the prospect of the two main parties working together is in shambles. Consequent to this, the JVP and the JHU are taking increasingly strident positions, totally disproportionate to their political standing in this country. It is in the background, Sir, of such unscrupulous political behaviour, that the mindset of the LTTE must be considered. The LTTE knows that the Tamil moderates even prior to independence were always betrayed. They publicly state that they would rather die fighting for a cause they hold sacred, rather than being betrayed. Does

the existing political environment in the country offer the LTTE any reasonable hope that they will not be betrayed the same way that moderate Tamils were betrayed? This is the crux of the matter. Reference has been made, Sir, at times at the highest political level to us and to our role. After the Ceasefire Agreement in February 2002, when dialogue commenced for a peaceful political resolution with international facilitation between the Sri Lankan State and the LTTE with the total support of the international community, there was a need for us to work together to help the process succeed. It was the moderate Tamil political leadership which as per the democratic wishes of the Tamil people had defined their political goals. We have not wavered from this path. We have not been enamoured by any blandishments. We are committed to the achievement of the legitimate political goals of the Tamil-speaking people, the Tamil people and the Muslim people of this country. It is our conviction that the Tamil-speaking people cannot be denied their legitimate political rights through any form of political manipulation. The Tamil people are sufficiently resilient as they have demonstrated in the past over half a century to resist any such endeavour. We would appeal to the Sri Lankan State to be honest in its approach to the Tamil question. That is the first thing you require. Honesty in your approach to the Tamil question. We would appeal to the international community to bear these realities in mind. We know that the international community is deeply disappointed with the current SLFP proposals and that these proposals can never be a basis for fruitful talks or for an acceptable final solution. The view is increasingly gaining strength that the Government is focused on its military agenda and that the APRC process is a charade awaiting the successful conclusion of the Governments military agenda. It is your fervent hope that the SLFP and the JHU proposals can be thrust on the Tamil people on the successful completion of your military agenda. I do not wish that you should continue to live in such hope. It is not a good thing. You now want India to give you weapons. You make this request while you are dishonouring an international treaty signed with India. When President Mahinda Rajapaksa met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at the Non-aligned Conference at Havana, Cuba in September 2006, the assurance was given that the North-East merger as per the Indo- Lanka Accord would continue.

( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The Supreme Court in October 2006 on the basis of a procedural flaw held that the merger effected by President J.R. Jayewardene, 18 years earlier, in 1988 and endorsed by three successive Presidents thereafter, was irregular. The Tamil intervenients of the Eastern Province, vital stakeholders, were not permitted to intervene and be fully heard in the proceedings before the court. There is no appeal from the decision of the court. The Tamil people are convinced that justice was not meted out to them. In November 2006 on the invitation of President Mahinda Rajapaksa we met with him and urged him to take corrective steps to constitute Northern and Eastern provinces as one unit so as to remove the defect pointed out in the judgement of the court. I subsequently wrote to him confirming our discussion. The UNP had offered support for such corrective steps. Stalwart members of the SLFP have subsequently supported the merger. We had no response from the President. We met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in December 2006 when he reiterated Indias commitment to the restoration of the status quo ante of the merged North-East as per the Indo- Lanka Accord. Sir, I have dealt with all these matters in detail in my speech delivered in Parliament on 10th January, 2007 in Hansard Volume 167 - No.2, from columns 185 to 205. The Foreign Secretary of India Shiv Shankar Menon and the Foreign Minister of India Pranab Mukherjee have subsequently visited Sri Lanka and this issue was taken up with the President. The President of India, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam in the course of his recent Government Policy Statement in the Indian Parliament stated, We have conveyed at high political levels to Sri Lankan leaders, the need for a negotiated political settlement to the ethnic issue that is acceptable to all sections of Sri Lankan society. The denial of the most fundamental achievement of the Tamil people under the Indo-Lanka Accord relating to the merger of the Northern and Eastern provinces, on the basis of the incontrovertible fact that the said provinces

were the areas of historical habitation of the Tamil-speaking people, upon an alleged procedural flaw in judicial proceedings where the Tamil historical inhabitants, vital stake holders, were denied the right to be heard, can and will never be acceptable to the Tamil people. The Sri Lankan State is bound to comply with the provisions of an International Treaty. There is no way in which the Sri Lankan State can escape from this obligation.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Sampanthan, you have taken 60 minutes. .

( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I will take my time, Sir, because there is time that my party has. Mr. N. Sathiya Moorthy, Sir, Director, Chennai Chapter of the Observer Research Foundation, an Indian policy think-tank, headquartered in New Delhi, made the following pertinent comments in an article written in the "Daily Mirror" on 2nd January, 2007. If civil laws and practices of Sri Lanka could upturn one clause in the Accord, they could also upturn other clauses among which one addressed Indian concerns over the Trincomalee harbour. We call upon President Mahinda Rajapaksa to take corrective action to restore the status quo ante relating to the North-East merger as per the Indo-Lanka Accord. Such corrective action would receive overwhelming support in this House, if he is prepared to take that courageous decision. In our view, he is morally bound to take this step before requesting any assistance from India. Sir, we wish to make it abundantly clear that any solution to be acceptable must be just and durable. The international community has called for dramatic political changes, radical political changes to bring about a new system of governance. The international community has stated that the Tamil community has a very legitimate desire as anybody would, to be able to control their own lives to rule their own destinies and to govern themselves in their homeland, in the areas they have traditionally inhabited. Much progress needs to be made if these objectives are to be achieved. It may be relevant, Sir, in this context, to refer to a few other conflict situations and examine how Sri Lanka is faring in comparison. The Belfast Agreement more popularly called the "Good Friday Agreement" of 1998 brought peace to Northern Ireland. The Agreement was endorsed by the voters of Northern Ireland and also the Republic of Ireland in separate referenda in May 1998. The agreement was based on the principle of self-determination. It was a comprehensive agreement where substantial progress was made on all fronts. There have been hiccups but there has been no return to violence, no recurrence of violence. The power sharing arrangement

[ . ]

was restored recently, just a few weeks ago with Rev. Ian Paisley, the Democratic Unionist Party Leader as First Minister and Martin McGuiness - Sinn Feins Chief Negotiator as Deputy First Minister. Rev. Ian Paisley, the Democratic Unionist Party Leader opposed the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. He opposed it. He campaigned against it in the Referendum. He is today the First Minister. Martin Mcguiness - the Sinn Fein Chief Negotiator - has come to Sri Lanka more than once recently. The Helsinki Agreement has brought about peace in Aceh - Indonesia. Aceh was in a situation of grave conflict when the tsunami struck in December 2004 causing immense damage. That opportunity was used to forge peace. Today Indonesian Troops are withdrawing from Aceh. I will read to you Sir, a report in regard to that matter : The rebel Free Aceh Movement and government signed a historic peace pact in Helsinki in August which has so far exceeded expectations. The pullout of non-local troops as well as police is a key requirement under the deal, hammered out in the wake of the December 2004 tsunami catastrophe, which killed some 168,000 Acehnese............Indonesian troops have withdrawn their non-local troops from Aceh, said a spokeswoman from the foreign mission monitoring a peace agreement . That is the position in Aceh. Tsunami also hit Sri Lanka at the same time. The North-East was amongst the worst affected areas. The P-TOMS Agreement could not be implemented. The President was behind it, the Cabinet of Ministers was behind it, the Government was behind it, the main Opposition Party was behind it, all Tamil and Muslim Parties were behind it but it could not be implemented. The consequence is, that while troops are pulling out of Aceh, in our case you are sending more troops to the North-East. More troops are dying, more LTTE cadres are dying and the situation is only getting worse. The implementation of the P-TOMS Agreement could have turned things around. But in Sri Lanka that was not to be. There surely Sir, is something radically wrong in this country. Then there is the dispute in the Philippines in the Southern Mindanao Islands. A promise of self-determination has raised a hope of peace. It is interesting to know what happened in the Mindanao Islands in the Philippines. I will read to you from a report which says, I quote: From the time of political independence in 1946, some central governments in the Philippines have seen the need to dilute the ethnic composition of the Southern islands. Accordingly, populations whose religious identity is Catholic have been increasingly settled among the Muslims in the Southern islands, who have been natives of the region for centuries. What has been coveted by successive central administrations are the valuable natural resources of the islands. The aim in settling Catholics in the islands in increasing numbers by the centre has been the blurring of the identity of the region as a Muslim majority territory.

It is the same thing that is happening in the North-East in regard to the Tamil-speaking people, both the Tamils and the Muslims. I quote again : A promise of self-determination for the Muslim minority of the Southern Mindanao Islands of the Philippines, by the archipelagos centre, has raised the prospect of the long-running bloody Southern insurgency in the South East Asian state coming to an end. I thought it necessary, Sir, to refer to some of these instances because you cannot bring about peace by tinkering with an anachronistic and outdated Constitution. You need radical changes in your constitutional system, in your structure of governance and that is the challenge that you face. The LTTE is not the cause of your failure to deliver. Please remember that. You did not deliver to the Tamil moderates. When there was no LTTE, you did not deliver to the Tamil moderates for more than 30 years. Your failure to deliver, inability to deliver is a continuing feature that has existed for over 50 years. The LTTE is a manifestation of your failure and your repeated racial pogroms against the Tamil people condoned and subsequently sponsored by the State. You must stop making the LTTE an excuse and demonstrate your will and determination to deliver. Sir, though lack of political bipartisanship on the Tamil question and political skulduggery has been a serious impediment to successful political progress, it would still be relevant particularly in the context of the current SLFP proposals to examine the thinking of some of the countrys leaders. I will start Sir, with President J.R. Jayewardene who was the first Executive President of this country. I was in the old Parliament when he one day made a declaration in Parliament directing Brigadier Bull Weeratunga - I think he was his nephew - to go to Jaffna and bring an end to the insurgency and report back to him within six months, that the insurgency in Jaffna had been brought under control. I was there in Parliament and I watched him. He tried very hard. He fought very hard. I am now going to read from an interview he gave "The Sunday Times" on the 1st of January, 1995. This is an interview given by President J.R. Jayewardene who drafted the 1978 Constitution and not merely enshrined the unitary character contained in the 1972 Constitution, but entrenched it in the 1978 Constitution. This is what he said in his interview to the Sunday Times on the 1st of January, 1995. I quote: Q: At this stage what would you feel is the best solution to the N-E conflict? A: The federal system. The man who tried to crush the Tamil insurgency, the man who enshrined the unitary character of the Constitution, several decades later had to concede that the Federal system was the best opportunity, the best way to resolve the North - East conflict.

2007 06 903 904

I will now come to President Premadasa. President Premadasa used to say, I am prepared to give Ellam, but not Eelam. That was his catchphrase, I will give Ellam, everything but not Eelam. The Mangala Moonasinghe Select Committee proposals, which my party did not accept, were framed during President Premadasas presidency. He proposed a Federal or at least a Quasi Federal System of Government. The former President, Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranike Kumaratungas proposals in August, 1995 were clearly Federal in content. Even the much diluted 2000 proposals submitted by the former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga to Parliament, did not seriously dilute this element of the Federal content. Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was prepared to support Federalism. Mr. Ranil Wickremasinghe in the course of the recent elections campaigned on the basis of Federalism. That was consistent with the Oslo and Tokyo Declarations. Where do the current SLFP proposals fit into this scenario from the point of view of being a basis to evolve an acceptable solution to the Tamil question? This is a matter which must engage the attention of everyone who is committed to a negotiated solution to the Tamil question. Before I conclude Sir, I want to just read one little quotation from a statement made by Mr. Amartya Sen, the reputed Nobel Laureate from India. It says, I quote: Indias Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen said Sri Lanka was in crisis today because it did not realize the richness of plurality. Delivering a lecture on Monday at the Nobel Institute in Oslo on the theme Poverty, War and Peace the Cambridge and Harvard professor said Sri Lanka had successfully implemented a number of welfare programmes such as free education and free health to its people. 'This should have contributed to peace in that country. But, by taking a position of upholding exclusive status to Buddhism and Sinhalese, it isolated other sections of the society from having a sense of national identity. Now there was no likelihood that the Sri Lankan state would go back from that position. Sri Lanka did not realize the richness in plurality.' Are you prepared to recognize your mistakes and change your attitudes and be more sensible? If not where do you go? Before I conclude, Sir, I want to just make a brief reference to the current situation of the Tamil people particularly in the North-East, particularly our rural people, who have been facing violence from 1983. Our people started fleeing in 1983. Their homes were attacked, their villages were attacked, they had to flee. The war went on continuously. They were hit by tsunami in 2004 and now the war has commenced again and they are once again being hit. I must say this on behalf of the rural Tamil people of the North-East. They never lived on your doles, they never lived on any support you gave them. They were farmers, they were fishermen, they had

their livestock, they were hard working people, they earned their livelihood. It was entirely their wealth. Today many villages in the Eastern Province and now in the Northern Province are being devastated, crops have been destroyed, plantations have been destroyed, coconut trees, palmyrah trees have been destroyed, our cattle have been destroyed, our houses have been destroyed. We have lost our livelihood. That is our position and still you want the war to continue.What are you up to? You talk of resettlement and all that type of thing consequent to the recent attacks that took place in the South of Trincomalee District and the North of Batticaloa District and in all those villages. I have got with me particulars that I have been collecting, but I will not table them in Parliament until I have rechecked them and I am absolutely certain that they are correct. Over 300 people - civilians - have been killed as a result of your aerial bombing and heavy artillery shelling. That is really an international crime. You had no business to shell, to bomb civilian populated areas in that way and kill people, but about 300 people have been killed. Have you paid anyone any compensation? I saw the Minister of Resettlement and Disaster Relief Services here a little while ago. I find that you are paying compensation to the other people in other areas. Why have these poor Tamil people who have been killed in the South of Trincomalee and in the North of Batticaloa not been paid compensation? They must be paid compensation. They are entitled to compensation. The Government Agent, the Divisional Secretary of the area can give you all the particulars in regard to the persons who were killed. That is their fundamental right because that is what you are giving to the other people in other areas. Why have you not taken any action so far? We had requested the UN to be involved in the resettlement programme because we felt that the UN umbrella would inspire the people's confidence and that the resettlement programme would take place in a very steady and acceptable way. Unfortunately, the UN is not coming in, probably you are not happy about it. But, the people must be resettled in the places, in the areas, in the villages from which they were displaced. That is their fundamental right. They are entitled to go back to those very areas and they must be resettled in those areas. We have appealed to the Government. I make a strong appeal to the President. I talk to him whenever it is necessary to do so on behalf of our people particularly those who are suffering. I want to make a strong appeal to the President that they must be resettled in the areas from which they were displaced. People are being killed, Sir, as if human life is so cheap. I have here with me, I cannot read the names as I have no time, a list of persons who have been killed in the last two-three weeks in the Mutur area, south of Trincomalee. At least 15-20 people have been killed. I have another list of persons. Fourteen persons who have been killed in the north of Trincomalee, all Tamil

905 906

civilians in recent times. I contacted Commander Seneviratne, who is in charge of the Navy camp in Nilaveli. I spoke to him. He responded very well. I mean, I am not saying that all persons in the military are bad. When I spoke to him he responded, Sir, I am very sorry. I did not know this. But, I will go and check on this and see what can be done. But, people are being killed. That is the point. I have got with me a list of persons who have been abducted published in The Nation newspaper recently. A list of 117 persons! Ninety nine per cent of those who have been abducted or have gone missing are Tamils. Look at those two children, those ICRC workers who were killed in Colombo recently. What crime did they commit? They had come for a workshop in Colombo and were going back to Batticaloa. They were taken away and killed. I have got a list of persons who have been killed in Trincomalee. Over 100 people have been killed in the past few months. In Jaffna people have been killed every day; in Vavuniya people have been killed every day, in Batticaloa people have been killed. Every day it is happening all over the North-East. This is why we wanted a United Nations monitoring mechanism to monitor and observe human rights in Sri Lanka. It is not our intention to embarrass your Government. But, what we feel is that when there is a United Nations monitoring mechanism in the country then everybody will realize that whoever is doing it, it can be the Government, it can be the Government forces, it can be the LTTE or it can be the other paramilitary forces - they all will realize that they are answerable. There will be no impunity; there will be no confidence that the arm of the law will not reach you. The President has recently said, You are talking of abductions, but I am informed that some of the people who have been abducted have gone to Europe. I am not saying he is lying. I do not know. He has got some information. But that is not something he found out himself, but what somebody told him. In regard to the two ICRC persons killed, he has said that it is being done to bring disrepute to the Government. If you have an International UN Monitoring Mechanism in Sri Lanka, the President can entrust it to them and they will find out. So why are you not doing that? You are talking of a Commission you have appointed to investigate certain crimes and an international group of eminent personalities who are said to be assisting them. That is with regard to certain crimes. Even they are unable to function. No witnesses were coming forward. Two Members of the Commission have resigned. They cannot function because witnesses are not coming forward. Proper investigations have not been carried out at the correct time in regard to those matters. Yesterday the Secretary-General of the UN issued a statement condemning the two ICRC killings and also referring to the killing of the 17 aid workers in Mutur sometime ago. Why do you not appoint a United Nations Monitoring Mechanism - I mean, surely if the President thinks that Arunachalam and Sathasivam who are supposed to be missing have gone to Europe, he can

entrust it to them and they can investigate and issue a report. It will be good for the Government. It will be good for everybody. The truth will come out. Everybody will know the truth. Why are you shirking your responsibility ? Is it because you have got something to hide ? These are the questions we want to pose. We do not want to confront the Government. But we want to appeal to the Government. I want to appeal to the Government. Our people cannot be killed in this way . This must stop. It cannot go on. If it goes on this way it will become a gradual slow genocide of the Tamil people. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) You will have to be answerable one day. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Please, I beg of you. Kindly take some action to bring these things to an end. Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for all the courtesy you have given me. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne) Do you believe that?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, His Excellency the President took upon himself voluntarily the responsibility of asking us - ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne) For him to say that he is not aware of it -

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Member, let me say what I have to say. His complaint was that none of the Ministers in Government brought this to his direct notice. We did say some of the

facts - not all the facts that you were referring to this morning - about the abduction of one foreign employment agent who had been abducted from Kandy. All the facts relating to that I personally told His Excellency the President. I told him that these were the facts that were brought to our notice and since I myself had spoken to some of the relatives of the person abducted, immediately the President summoned the IGP and the Director, CID and gave them instructions. Then, we also mentioned about certain telephone numbers that were given to us. Those telephone numbers were given to the CID and they have begun an investigation. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne) This happened on the 16th of May.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes, but the fact was none of these family members dared to make a complaint to the police. When this was brought to the notice of His Excellency the President, in fact I mentioned to him that there is a reluctance on the part of the affected, aggrieved parties to bring this to the notice of the police as there appears to be a fear psychosis. Something is wrong somewhere. Some action must be taken. The President directly told the CID that even without a complaint, if Members of Parliament and Ministers bring such incidents to the notice of the Criminal Investigation Department, they must begin investigation and go into the matter. While we were discussing, the Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie got a telephone call from another individual, a Muslim businessman alleging that some people in uniform had come to a shop and asked for blue sapphires and they had been behaving in a very suspicious and threatening manner. There again His Excellency the President immediately instructed the police to begin an investigation even without a formal complaint being made. This is indeed a very serious situation. But I must say, with this type of intervention by His Excellency the President himself, we could definitely see some decline. I hope this will happen. In fact we brought to notice of His Excellency the President that the situation has come to such a position that some are even thinking of migrating because of this issue. There is a rumour that has gone around. Some incidents may have happened and there are rumours also largely circulating. In this regard the Hon. Mano Ganesan has been in the forefront of the protest against various Tamil people being abducted. The Hon. P Radhakrishnan had brought many aggrieved family members of those abducted. Wherever facts have been brought to the notice of the police, matters have been gone into and I am sure some decline could be seen in the coming months.

That being the case, I would like to refer to some of the issues relating to resettlement, Venerable Sir. In regard to resettlemnt in the past, when I was in the Opposition, we were totally opposed to involuntary resettlement of people. It must be a voluntary resettlement. The Hon. R. Sampanthan in the morning brought another issue to the notice of the House relating to people having to be resettled in their original areas, that they should not be resettled in other areas. I am bringing this earnestly to the notice of the House since the Hon. Leader of the House is also present. Now, a resettlement programme is going on in the Batticaloa District. I did speak to the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen who is involved in the resettlement process that there are attempts to resettle unfortunate victims of this war who had come to the Government-controlled areas in the Batticaloa District and temporary shelters have been erected in many areas. The Government security forces and the police must take full control of these temporary shelters and areas of resettlement. There have been complaints from various Muslims that there had been unnecessary intervention by armed groups coming to create disturbance, interfering with the resettlement process, wanting the unfortunate victims of war to be permanently settled in areas where they are unwilling to settle. These issues must be taken into account. There is also a tendency to create ethnic tension in the process. The Government and the security forces are making a genuine attempt to give relief to these unfortunate victims of war and are taking great pains to see that all these people who have been displaced are resettled in their original areas. But then for some security reasons, in certain areas the Government has decided that resettlement process may have to be delayed. One such area is the Sampur area in the west of Mutur. Today we have a Gazette notification declaring that area as a high security zone and a competent authority has been appointed to oversee the activities in that area.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) People can be resettled in high security zones.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) That is up to the Government to consider it. This has happened as a result of artillery positions that the LTTE has been building up in the Sampur area. In fact, the entire Mutur population had to be displaced because of the irresponsible action of the LTTE, totally putting in jeopardy the security of innocent civilians in that area. Thousands of Muslims had to be housed in camps in Kantalai and other adjoining Sinhala areas. I know the type of conflict and disturbances that would take place, if Muslims were to be living there beyond the welcome that was accorded to them by the Sinhalese in the Kantalai area. The Government whether rightly or wrongly attempted, to an extent, involuntary resettlement since some of the Muslims were not willing to go back as normalcy had not returned fully to

those areas. However, with sufficient security measures being established, that area has now come under the total control of the security forces and normalcy has somewhat come about. But it is my position that for the Muslims in that area, normalcy will never come until all the Tamils are resettled. That is the position that I, as the leader of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress would take in this House. I said it when I was in the Opposition. I will say it today while I am a Minister in this Government because we believe that our lives and the livelihood are interdependent. If the entire Tamil population in Mutur does not resettle, that will have a serious impact on the livelihood of the Muslims in Mutur. They live on the business opportunities that arise - [Interruption.] That is so. But that being the case, there is a new development that has come about with the declaration of the new security zone. The plight of the fishermen has worsened. This issue comes up all the time. We have taken it up with the navel authorities in Trincomalee. We have spoken to the Governor of the Eastern Province with the intervention of the Secretary, Ministry of Defence, Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and certain measures were taken to permit fishing during daytime. With the declaration of the new security zone, even that type of fishing may be restricted. And therefore, I would like to appeal to the Minister of Defence to relax the restrictions that have been imposed on fishing in those areas so that people could resume their normal life and livelihood. , . , . , . , , , . , , . .1980 1990 . ,

, , " , " . , . , , , . . . ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak at a time when the country is in absolute dire straits and not only the people in the country but even the governors themselves are losing hope day by day. What has happened to our Mother Lanka? We know that the extension of the state of Emergency is debated every month and it has become a ritual now to come here and confess as to what has gone on, what is going on and what would happen. Unfortunately, day by day we seem to be going more into a darker reign. Sir, when you get up in the morning and read the newspapers or listen to the news you will see that there are abductions, killings, rapes, suicides, attacks et cetera that have taken place. These are the headlines and the deadlines. This is becoming a panacea for many problems that are being created by an incompetent Government. But that is not the problem-solving exercise. Today, we are at a crossroads at the most decisive moment in this country. Three years and six months ago this country got a new Government. One year and seven months ago this country got a new President and what a lot of euphoria there was. Three years and six months ago the Government was not only the SLFP. It was the JVP and the Jathika Hela Urumaya. Today, the JVP pretends as if they are not a part of it. So firstly, we must ensure that they are put together because they cannot be absolved from responsibility. Likewise, the Presidential Election gave rise to a heated debate. The people expressed their desire even though there were many aberrations that took place. There were 500,000 votes that were cut off and the North and the East was not allowed to vote but the democratic process went on. Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, what I am trying to say here is that there was a mandate given and what an euphoria there was when President Rajapaksa was elected to govern this country on the 17th of

2007 06 979 980

7 PL 002186 (2007/06)

November. All of us had expectations despite belonging to different parties but today what has happened? At the time when the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government came into power, the Sinhala Southern vote had basically consolidated itself with this Government. The main countries that support us have proscribed the LTTE. There was continuing hope that the Ceasefire Agreement would be torn and thrown around and there would be honourable peace. - India, the United States of America and the European Union gave their full blessings to the Government. Every action of the Government was supported, there was military assistance and there were experts coming here. Furthermore, you had the Co-Chairs coming here and saying that this is a new Government, a new President, a new direction; so let us take it forward. Going on further, you had the APRC coming into existence. Then you had a Memorandum of Understanding, which is something that rarely happens in this country, with the Leader of the Opposition. When they realized that they cannot govern the way that they promised, they called upon the Leader of the Opposition and we gave our unstinted support. The Hon. Prime Minister was there at that discussion. I was also a Member of that and it was finalized on the 4th of October. Further to all this, Australia and Canada proscribed the LTTE. What more could a Government expect to govern this country? Furthermore the same Government, when we being a responsible Opposition giving the Government the opportunity to rule, they said that we are incompetent, not nationalistic and today what has happened? Hon. Prime Minister, it is your Government that is governing. We are the Opposition. We have expressed our complete solidarity and support in governing on many issues. Unfortunately it is taken from one hand, bitten and thrown from the other. That is the reality today.

Look at the support that we have given to the Chairman of the APRC, the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana. I am happy that he is here. On his right, his biggest supporter the Minister, Hon. Dew Gunasekara is there. They have been championing the cause that this country cannot have a solution unless it is a political settlement. We are not at any given moment saying that the military should be abandoned. We were the prime movers for Mr. Lalith Athulathmudali taking over Vadamarachchi, bringing the IPKF and taking the LTTE on. Thereafter great leaders in the Army such as Denzil Kobbekaduwa, then Mr. Anuruddha Ratwatte, all led and I am sure they did the best in their own pursuit. But what has happened today? The country has been going on a senseless war and they are covering their incompetencies in other areas. The cost of living is

unbearable, corruption is high as Piduruthalagala. There is no rhyme or reason for the murders that are taking place. There are human rights aberrations but this is a humane Government, they say. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . . . [ ] , . . 14 . , . . . . . . . . , . . . , . [ ] , . [ ] . . [ ] . All what we are saying is that there must be some sense of responsibility, some decorum and some meaning in running this Government. We have been mentioning that the cost of the war is something which any country can afford. But if the war is being conducted properly full support would be there. But is it happening? I am tabling* a document in order to save time and I would like it to be included in Hansard. In 1983, Rs. 1.7 billion had been spent on the war, in 1986 it had gone up to Rs. 6 billion, in 1995 it was Rs. 25 billion, likewise in 2004 it was Rs. 56 billion; in 2005 it was 56.3 billion; in 2006 it was Rs. 69.5 billion and in the year 2007 it is Rs. 140 billion. I am informed that this is still insufficient for this year. Now after almost Rs. 450 billion being spent, where is this country heading to? We heard the new President when elected saying, " ". ; ; . . . , , "" . . .

Then, human rights are being flagrantly violated. There is no rhyme or reason for lifting of people. Today, look at the Muslims. The businessmen are being suffocated. As I was coming here I just heard from a senior Parliamentarian, the Hon. Abdul Cader that for the sixth time he had got a call threatening him. There are calls coming from Gampola and calls coming from

Kandy saying that if he does not respond to them he will also be lifted in a white van. [Interruption.] The Gampola call does not necessarily have to come from the Hon. Kiriella. ( ) (An hon. Member) He is in Senkadagala. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) He is in Senkadagala. [Interruption.]. There is no contest between the Hon. Kiriella and the Hon. Cader. He is in Senkadagala now. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , ; ; ; [ ]. . . . [Interruption.] Then, look at the media freedom which is absolutely stifled at every corner. Our Leader, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe and I just went to see the "Lakbima" journalist who has been assaulted. The Media Minister himself has given the pass and that has been disrespected by the forces for no apparent reason. Now, it has been reported but no action is being taken. Then, look at corruption which is as high as the Piduruthalagala. Nobody knows what is going on. So, that is why we say that there should be a sense of alarm in this country. Nobody knows who is governing. Nobody has full control of what is going on. Hon. Prime Minister, it is our humble opinion that this is the worst of the times of this country. You took over Government saying that you will bring in prosperity and peace within three months. What has happened? Four thousand seven hundred and eighty eight people have been killed. ? ? Look at the stock exchange. I am talking of the impact that has been created because everything is put on the war. The incompetence of the Government is put on the war. If that is not put on the war, then they put it on the oil. We must remember that oil prices have been going up from 1972, Sir. The war situation has been prevailing from 1976. So, please stop this nonsensical excuse that is put forward. You are a responsible Prime Minister with an irresponsible Government in your hand. But, we want the responsible Prime Minister to listen to the responsible Opposition and

get us out of this mess. If you cannot do it in the name of God please leave. We will ensure that we bring in the peace that is required for this country. Hon. Prime Minister look at the stock exchange. Look at the tourist hotel occupancy that was 70 to 80 per cent. Now it is 2 to 3 per cent. Some hotels have 20 to 30 per cent occupancy. Look at the inflation. Look at the Dollar appreciation as if the Dollar has taken a Viagra. Look at the Indian, the British and the European Union relationship with the country. We are at an absolutely low level. Today, the European Union is still debating the Sri Lankan situation. The President, Mr. Borrell just a little while ago expressed in his own words thus: " Sri Lanka has lost a golden opportunity and the European union looking at this has to step in and help this country. Otherwise, Sri Lanka would be another Zimbabwe of Asia". That is what he had to say about Sri Lanka. The British Parliament did the same just three weeks ago.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . ! . [ ] . . Look at this situation. The airports are closed. Today, the Central Bank cannot go and take statistics from the North-East. The war risk premium has come back to this country. Who is held responsible for this? You stated mentioned that everything will be delivered no sooner you come in. You have lost the ability to govern and today you are not only antagonizing the Sri Lankans but you are also antagonizing the foreign countries that are helping this country. I am saying this with sorrow and a heavy heart. We, our Leader, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella and I have been trying to galvanize support.

But the foreign countries have been saying one very categorical statement and that is This Government does not seem to be requiring any of our assistance. I am saying with a sense of responsibility that the Government is mishandling this situation. Please ensure that we catch more bees with honey than vinegar. We must ensure that we take the international community into our confidence. If they turn a blind eye to us our survival will be in great jeopardy. Look at the Indian situation.

I admire the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva for giving the JVP bellyful yesterday. He told them that irresponsible Members of the Government must step aside to ensure the Government to really govern. What did they say? They came to abrogate the Ceasefire Agreement Then they say - ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Then they want the Government to abrogate the ACSA that they have signed with the American Government. * : : Document tabled : Who Gains by War in Sri Lanka ?

Sri Lanka s defence expenditure as a percentage of its GDP is the largest not only in the South Asian region, but overall in the world. Reports indicate that

2007 06 987 988

defence expenditure has gone up to Rs. 100 billion a year and is set to increase further, given the new dimension the war has taken in the recent weeks. In the last decade, Sri Lanka has spent almost Rs. 400 billion on defence as a result of the conflict. The citizens of Sri Lanka have a role to play. They cannot be bystanders, for it is they who pay for the war and it is their children who will have to bear the burden of the massive investment in arms. The citizens must hold both the parties accountable and build a movement which would be an alternative to war.
