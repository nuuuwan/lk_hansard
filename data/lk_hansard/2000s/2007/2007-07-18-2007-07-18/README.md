ANNEX 4

Background Information

1. The National Savings Bank commenced its NRFC/RFC operations two years ago with the objective of obtaining foreign remittances to the Bank. Since our Bank did not have branches/agents in foreign countries it was necessary for the Bank to have discussions/negotiations with the foreign Banks/Institutions to sign agreements for the purpose of obtaining foreign remittances through those Institutions/Banks.Therefore, it was essential for the Chairman and the higher officials of the Bank to visit those countries for the above purpose. The Bank has already signed 24 agreements with foreign Banks/Institutions in this regard.

2. The National Savings Bank was selected as a Board Members of the World Savings Banks Institute (WSBI) in 2006. There are more than 100 Savings Banks / Institutions around the world as members of Institute. Being a Board Member of the WSBI it was compulsory for the National Savings Bank to attend its meetings. The Board Membership has enabled the bank to obtain the assistance of the WSBI in establishing relationship with foreign Banks / Institutions for the purpose of signing agreements in order to obtain foreign remittances.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, I would also like to bring to the notice of this House the Powers of Parliament which is given in the Ninth Schedule Reserved List II of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Under Foreign Affairs ( e) it says, I quote: Entering into treaties and agreements with foreign countries and implementing treaties, agreements and conventions with foreign countries If this cannot be tabled in Parliament, you cannot implement it. And the 13th Amendment came after the 1978 Constitution was passed. So, this Parliament has the power under the Ninth Schedule Reserved List II, (e) to enter into treaties and agreements with foreign countries. So this has to be approved by Parliament. If the President is of the view that this should not be disclosed to the public then he must send the message to Parliament. [Interruption.] Yes, a letter, in which case we can debate and decide whether we should accept that letter or not. But this treaty then cannot go ahead unless it is brought to Parliament. This must be placed before Parliament for debate. Thereafter, the Government can decide whether there is a majority for this or not. You need not take a vote. But you can indicate and go ahead. If the Government is not willing to bring it then how can you implement it? In 1987 we had very specifically said that this is a function that must come under Parliament.

( . . ) (The Hon. M. K. Eelaventhan) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. - [Interruption.] Guard your tongue! Sir, we want you to make it very clear. We are not worried about Sinhala parties entering into confrontations. That is your job. But we, as Tamil Members of Parliament representing the interests of the

Tamils, want to know what the agreement that has been reached between America and Sri Lanka is. Is it sacred or secret or sacred and secret? - [Interruption.] But, anything done in secrecy is going to be dangerous because that is a hidden agenda.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) Hon. Member, why do you not use that earphone?

. .

( . . ) (The Hon. M. K. Eelaventhan) America speaks of peace and so on and goes on providing arms. So, we want to know what the problem is. America speaks of peace, but pays lip-service and goes on providing arms. Sir, we want to know what the truth is. Anything done in secrecy is dangerous. We do not know where we are. The saying goes, "Fore Warned is Fore Armed." We are extremely careful of whatever agreement they reach. Anything done without consulting the Tamil leadership can be very injurious to our very survival, our existence. That is all I want to say. Thank you.

Deputy Speaker, this Government came to power claiming that a government exists to ensure the welfare of all its citizens. That was their main claim. That was the criticism levelled at the United National Party Government which brought down the rate of inflation to zero per cent and also brought down the prices of essential commodities. But the present Government which was then in the Opposition criticized us saying that the main responsibility of a government must be to reduce prices. I am happy that the Hon. Minister of State Revenue and Finance is here. But the Minister of Trade, Marketing Development, Co-operatives and Consumer Services is not here. These are the responsibilities that lie with these Ministers. Mr. Deputy Speaker, according to the Department of Census and Statistics, the cost of living index for June 2007 was 5344.3. 5344 . That is an increase over May 2007. On a monthly basis it has been increasing. Despite the inflation index coming down, month on month the cost of living index has been going up and it has reached 5344.3. The Department of Census and Statistics claims that the expenditure value of the market basket went up by Rs. 340 from May to June only. The main reason for this increase is the increase in prices of essential commodities such as rice, bread, milk food, pepper, lime, coconut oil,

fish, dry fish and vegetables. The price of vegetables cannot be related to the price of oil because every time we talk about the prices, the Hon. Minister of State Revenue and Finance would say, . That has nothing to do with the local goods that are going up in price. Sir, the inflation rate of June this year was 17 per cent higher than that of the same period last year. If you compare the prices of essential commodities in the month of June this year with that of last year, it is 17 per cent higher. That is the current situation. When the price of milk food went up, the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane who is not here in the House, said that it is good if the price of milk food goes up because it creates diabetes. The Hon. Minister must understand that the people of this country cannot sometimes afford to feed their children. In the alternate, the Government asks the mothers to give to their children. But even for a mother to give to her children, she must be strong enough. The mothers must first be strong. The "Mahinda Chintana" speaks of a poshana malla to be given to every mother who is pregnant. In my electorate, Mawanella, when a mother went to the Health Clinic - -, they weighed her and said that she was overweight. She, by birth was big-made. But she had no nutrition. She was supposed to be overweight. In the "Mahinda Chintana" there is no talk about weighing the mother and giving the poshana malla based on weight. So, this has been a gross cheating of the people of this country. Today, while the rupee is weakening and prices of essential commodities are escalating, the groups that are suffering are the fixed wage-earners and the self-employed people. The fixed wage-earners, whether they are Government employees or private sector employees, cannot keep up with the rising cost of living. The reason is that the cost of food has gone up; the cost of shoes has gone up; the cost of books and stationery has gone up; the cost of transport has gone up; the cost of electricity has gone up. Basically the cost of every item that any family needs has gone up, not by a few rupees, but by a huge sum. So, a family having two children is finding it difficult to provide the basic education for their children.

Thank you. * : : Document tabled : The MIG 27 Deal Who Profited from this Military Procurement? Introduction On 26th July 2006, the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) signed an agreement with Ukrinmash (a Ukranian company) for the supply of four MIG 27 aircraft as well as the overhauling of four existing SLAF MIG 27 aircraft. Soon after, the Government announced that the MIG 27 s met with the specifications required for Ground Attack Fighters. Yet, close screutiny of the agreement and the statements / events relating to this procurement reveal blatant irregularities and the manipulation of facts to conceal fraud and corruption. The objectives of this Report, prepared in the national interest for the United National Party Research Unit are as follows: * To analyse the urgent military requirements of the country given the current war developments * To investigate the highly questionable circumstances, irregularities and manipulation of facts pwrtaining to the procurement of MIG 27s. * To analyse the extent to which the Defence Ministry of Sri Lanka is mismanaging the war with dire consequences to the Sri Lankan people. MIG 27s To begin with, it was revealed in the front page report of the Sunday Times dated 03/12/2006 that the four MIG 27s purchased in 2006 had been on the market for several years. They had lain in disuse since 1991 and were repaired by the Lviv State Aircraft Repair Plant before being sold off to Sri Lanka. In fact, in 2000, three of these planes had been rejected by SLAF on two different occasions. (a) Firstly, on the 25th of May 2000, when the SLAF purchased four MIG 27 aircraft at US$ 1.5 million each, (b) And next on 24th October 2000 when two more MIG 27 aircraft were purchased for US$ 1.6 million each.

* . . Produced at end of speech.

2007 18 255 256

Thus, it appears that these very same MIG 27 aircraft that had earlier been rejected by the SLAF in 2000 were purchased in 2006 at a cost of US$ 2.462 million each. Further, in October 2000, a MIG 23 UB Trainer was procured at US$900,000. By 2006, this Trainer required overhauling. According to the current agreement (of 2006), the cost of overhauling this Trainer is US$1.1million. The overall cost thus exceeds the purchase price paid in 2000. On the basis of the Sunday Times news report, on the 11th of March 2007, former Ministers Mangala Samaraweera and Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi made a complaint to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery & Corruption against Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, Secretary to the Ministry of Defence. They alleged corrupt practies on the part of the Defence Secretary in the procurement of the four MIG 27 aircraft. The complaint of the two MPs raised the following crucial issues in regard to the procurement. (i) Why the SLAF purchased four aircraft which had been rejected twice before by the SLAF; (ii) Why the cost of overhauling the MIG 23 UB Trainer (MIG 27) is higher than the purchase price of the aircraft. (iii) Why the SLAF paid a higher price for MIG 27s purchased in 2006, which are older than the MIG 27 s purchased earlier. In reply, the Ministry of Defence issued a statement on 22nd March 2007, titled MIG 27 Inside Story which is carried on the website www.defence,lk. This statement is silent on the first two questions raised by the Mps, though it attempts to respond to the thired question. Yet, instead of refuting the above charges, it strengthens the case for an inquiry into this purchase. Many of the facts contained in this statement are false. Referring to the MIG 27 it states as follows: The aircraft is flown as one of the main aerial weapons in India and former Soviet countries. The MIG 27 Flogger M, named Bahadur (Valiant) is built in India and is still being manufactured today. The primary mission of the aircraft is the destruction of fixed and mobile ground targets including hardened targets. The second sentence of this posting is taken from the website htip://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/mig-27.htm which states: The MIG 27 Flogger M named Bahadur (Valiant) was built in India. This sentence has been altered with the word was being replaced by the word is and the words and is still being manufactured today added at the end of that sentence. The third sentence has been taken from the web http://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/mig 27. The alterations have been made to conceal the fact that the MIG 27 aircraft have ceased to be produced in India. In actuality, the MIG 27 Flogger was originally manufactured in the former USSR. However, its production stopped in the 1980s. While this plane was also produced under licence by Hindustan Aircreft Limited, Bangalore, today, this factory too has stopped manufacturing MIG 27 s. In fact, MIG 27s are no longer manufactured anywhere in the world today. The MIG 27 aircraft was designed as a Ground Attack fighter to be used for conventional land warfare. It was one of the aircraft used by the Soviet Air Force against the Afghan forces. Even then the Soviet Military campaign proved to be a failure, and today, the Russian Air Force keeps its MIG 27 in reserve. By the 2000s many Air Forces in the world had phased out this model. Only Kazakhstan, India and Sri Lanka still use the MIG 27, However, it is no longer the main aerial weapon of the Indian Air Force, and the Indians will phase out the MIG 27 once locally designed combat aircraft are introduced. According to the Sri Lanka Defence Ministry statement, a Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) was appointed to find out the best option to meet the developing LTTE threat in February 2006, The TEC, after

analyzing the countrys security situation submitted their proposals to the Ministry of Defence to buy four additional MIG 27 fighters and to overhaul the exsting ones. The TEC stated that the threat situation in the country required an aircraft specifically designed for ground attacks which can operate in low altitudes at both lower and higher speeds. The UNP Government of 2001 - 2004 obtained the help of the US Government to assess the military capabilities of the Sri Lankan Armed Forces. A Report prepared by a mission from the US Pacific Command recommended against the purchase of any more MIG 27s. It concluded that the purchase of these types of aircraft were not related to Sri Lankas military needs and thus diverted logistical support from the existing SLAF fleet. The acquistition of MIG 27 s drained resources that could have been used to maintain, arm and upgrade Kfirs. The Report recommended that the SLAF: (a) develop its ability to fly at night, and (b) upgrade its equipment including guided (not dumb) bombs, rather than add new inappropriate and expensive aircraft. The Defence Ministry Statement is silent as to why MIG 27s were purchased in 2006 contary to the US Pacific Command recommendations whereas the more appropriate choice would have been the Kfir. The Kfir is a multi-role fighter aircraft equipped with Air to Ground missiles, cluster bombs and guided weapons much more suited to engage with the LTTE. (At the time of purchase, the SLAF had a fleet of eleven Kfirs, four MIG 27s and one F7). However, these salient facts have not been considered in the Defence Ministry Statement. Two successive Sri Lankan Govermnents had identified LTTE air power as the main threat to be faced by the Air Force in future warfare. The UNP Government of 2001 - 2004 discussed the possible threat from LTTE aircraft with the Indian Government. The late Lakshman Kadirgamar the Foreign Minister of the succeeding UPFA Government also gave the highest priority to this threat and discussed this issue both with the US and the Indian Governments. Subsequently, President Kumaratunga approved the installation of the INDRA ii air Surveillance System together with other Air Defence armaments. However, in 2006, the Rajapaksa Government abandoned the need to protect the air space from the LTTE, and gave priority to attacking the LTTE ground forces. This was done despite successive reports of organizations such as the Institute of Stategic Studies confirming that the LTTE possessed Light planes, Micro-Light planes and armed helicopters. This crucial deviation in war strategy (of focusing only on the LTTE ground forces) directly exposed Sri Lanka to the current air attacks from the LTTE Given the government's access to intelligence on the LTTE capabilities, it is highly questionable whether such a deviation was bona fide or for purposes of making profit. It is the standard practice of the Defence Ministry to carry out threat assessments under the guidance of senior Military officers utilizing intelligence reports. The current threat assessment was done in 2006 by a TEC consisting of: Air Marshal Roshan Goonetilleke (Chairman) Air Commodore E G J P de Silva (Director Aeronautical Engineering SLAF) Dr D P T Nanayakkara (Senior Lecturer - University of Moratuwa) Mr H D Weerasiri (Accountant - Ministry of Defence) Mr V J Premaratne (Deputy Director Airworthiness - Civil Aviation Authority) Mrs K D R Olga (Accountat - Department of National Budget) The TEC consisted of four civilians and two Air Force officers. The Air Force officers who served in the TEC are not Fighter Pilots one is an Engineer and the other a Helicopter Pilot. The others are civiliand who had no knowledge of the security requirements of the Air Force. It is on record that a number of Air Force Fighter pilots repeatedly requested the Governmtne to purchase multi - role combat aircraft. However. These requests were overruled by the TEC According to the MIG 27 Inside Story 5 PL 002322 (2007/08)

257 258

the newer variations of MIG such as MIG 29 and MIG 35 are also priced at very high costs and such technology is not required to meet the present enemy. Yet when the TEC made this evaluation the final export version of the MIG 35 had not been unveiled or priced, even though a prototype had been shown in Moscow a few months earlier (It was unveiled for the first time at the Bangalore Air Show in February 2007). Thus, these events took place after the TEC made its recommendations. It would seem then that the MIG 29 and similar models were rejected on the basis that the countrys air defence did not require multi-role combat fighters contray to established opinion within the SLAF. Reviewing and analyzing the threat assessment to the countrys security is not a function of a Technical Evaluation Committee. It is the critical function of the Commaders of the Armed Forces who after consulting their staff must inform the National Security Council. The role of a TECis laid down in the Procurement Guidelines of 2006. The TEC is only responsible for the technical and financial evaluation of the formal offers received by the Procuring Entity of the Government. Under the Guidelines, the responsibility for all actions in the furtherance of the procurement of goods, services or works is vested with the Secretary of the Line Ministry in this case, the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence. In this instance, the TEC has acted outside its powers and functions in analyzing the countrys security situation and proposing the purchase of MIG 27s . Furthermore, this TEC has not been properly constituted in accordane with the Procurement Guidelines. Article 2.8 .1 (b) of the Guidelines states that the TEC should consist of subject specialists. In this instance, critical members of the TEC should have been Fighter Pilots, but they were left out. One Helicopter Pilot, one Aeronautical Engineer, one senior Lecture, one deputy Director and two Government Accountants backed by one retired Lieutenant Colonel rejected the threat analysis of a number of senior experienced Security Officials which had been accepted by the UNP and UPFA Governments as well as the Governments of India and USA. The SLAF is the only Air Force to purchase MIG 27 in the 21st Century. In 2000 the then Government had already ordered twelve Kfir Fighter Aircraft from IAISubject to a long delivery period. At the time, the purchase of the MIG 27s was a stop gap measure to meet the immediate need of the military for Ground Attack Fighters due to setbacks in Jaffna. Therefore, the Government accepted an offer by D S Alliance Limited, a campany recommended by the Ukrainian Ambassador, to supply, maintain and operate MIG 27 aircraft. These aircraft had not exceeded their mileage and did not require overhauling till 2003, The purchase was short term measure until the arrival of the Kfirs which were to form the backbone of the SLAF The MIG 27 is a Third Generation Jet Fighter Aircraft whereas today, Fifth Generation Jet Figher aircraft are being introduced worldwide. Third Generation Jet Fighters are being systematically phased out of Air Force inventories. Consequently, there is no demand for second-hand MIG 27s which is why there are still a number of MIG 27s in Ukraine which will have to be scrapped shortly, if not sold.

The first deal in 2000 was made at a time of crisis when Sri Lankas options were limited and the seller could name the price. The second deal in 2006 was made when the buyer had a number of options and when there was no market for old MIG 27s. In fact, it was a buyers market. Surprisingly, the price paid by the buyer in these circumstances was far excessive than when it was a sellers market.

According to the Ministry of Defence Statement, the MIG 27 aircraft purchased in 2000 had only two years of remaining life at the time of purchase, while the MIG 27s purchased in 2006 are supposed to be guaranteed an operational life time of 8 years. The Ministry of Defence states that, as result, the SLAF will not be faced with the problem of overhauling or extending the life time of these aircraft, or having to bear additional cost - unlike in the year 2000 deal. This rationale too is designed to mislead the Sri Lankan public, along with references to the overall life spain of an aircraft as the life span of its engines.

This is because the engine life of Fighter aircraft like the MIG 27 is not determined according to years as referred to above. This aircraft engine life span between overhauls is determined by the assigned hours. Since the number of operational fights made by each MIG 27 varies depending on the requirement of each country, it is not possible to specify a number of Flying hours for a year. A fighter aircraft operating in an environment of internal or external conflict will undertake more operational flights per year than an aircraft operating in an environment of peace. The Statement is silent on the critical issue of the flying hours still available for the MIG 27 aircraft purchased in 2006. Instead, the Ministry of Defence has deliberately attempted to mislead the public by referring to the operational lifetime of the aircraft in years instead of flying hours. The overall life span of every fighter aircraft is assessed after taking into account its air frame system, engine, operational control system etc. At the end of its overall lifespan of 25 years the MIG 27 aircraft becomes obsolete or a dead aircraft. A futher extension of its life span (up to 30 years) is possible only if done under the supervision and certification of the Engineers of the Mikoyan Design Bureau. Furthermore, this extension must be done before the end of the normal life span of 25 years. The year of manufacture and the age of the MIG 27s purchased in 2000 are as follows : Table I Aircraft Year of Age at time Year of Serial Nos. Manufacture of purchase Purchase (Yrs) 83712531385 1982 18 2000 83712534657 1983 17 2000 83712534709 1983 17 2000 8371253877 1984 16 2000 83712520013 1981 19 2000 83712545237 1984 16 2000 MIG 23 trainer SN 49065315 1984 16 2000 Contrary to the statement by the Ministry of Defence, the aircraft purchased in 2000 had a life span of between 6 - 9 years. Table II Aircraft Year of Age at time Year of Serial Nos. Manufacture of purchase Purchase (Yrs) 93712534688 1983 23 2006 83712518044 1981 25 2006 83712518022 1980 26 2000 83712518009 1980 26 2000 These aircraft were 25 years old, and have thus been purchased at the end of their normal life span. No reference is made to an extension of their life span (to 30 years) under supervision and certification by the Mikoyan Design Bureau. It is this clear that these MIG 27s are obsolete. They have exceeded their life span. Ukraine is well known for selling weapons without international certification. According to the magazine the Ukrainian Obsolete material is mostly in demand in underdeveloped countries. Even now Ukrainian weapons are being crowded out by competitors complying with international certification standards. Futhermore, as stated earlier, the same four planes were examined by the SLAF and rejected in 2000 during the first purchase. It is no wonder then that two of these aircraft were grounded after being purchased in 2006 and were unserviceable during the warranty period. Thus the Government has paid USS 10.78 million for four MIG 27s that were dead and grounded, with zero value except as scrap metal. The Ministry of Defence statement has not evaluated the aircraft according to the market value or any other valuation scheme this is utilized for government procurement. Instead, the deal is evaluated for its value addition, cost benefits and the cost against the increased

fighting capability of the SLAF. Form this statement it is apparent then that the Defence Ministry has invented a valuation system to cover up a fraud. Consequently, the Cabinet appointed Standing Committee on Procurement too is in criminal breach of safety and efficiency for having purchased life-expired aircraft for operation in the war zones. The Ministry of Defence Statement refers to this procurement as a deal between the producer Government (Ukraine) and the Government of Sri Lanka. This statement is also false for the following reasons. Ukrinmash from which the SLAF purchased these aircraft is the self-supporting Foreign Trade & Investment Subsidiary of UKRASPETSEXPORT the State Company responsible for the export of military products. Such an organization does not fail within the parameters of a government to government contract. Threrfore, this deal cannot be exempt from the normal procurement procedures a argued by the Defence Ministry. The Defence Ministry statement seeks to justify this exemption under Article 3.5 of the Government Procurement Guidelines 2006. Article 3.5 states as follows : 3.5.1 (a) Direct contracting is means of Procurement of Goods or Services or Works from a single supplier source. (b) .. (c) This methods is appropriate under the following circumstances : (i) When the prices or rates are fixed pursuant to legislation by regulatory bodies ; (ii) Standardization of equipment, for compatibility with existing equipment, may justify additional purchases of the same type of Goods ; In such purchases * The number of such items in the new Procurement shall generally be less than 50% of the existing number. * The price shall be reasonable, and * The advantages of another make or Source of equipment shall have been considered ; (iii) The required equipment is proprietary and obtainable only from one source as proprietary software, text books spare parts, defence items ; and (d) . No government agency will qualify for automatic direct contract award unless the above requirements are satisfied. The 2006 procurement violates many of the provisions of Article 3.5. The Air Force had in its inventory four MIG 27s purchased in 2000 and under this deal they purchased an equal number of MIGs. The Guidelines restrict the purchase to 50% of the existing number. Furthermore, the price paid for these older MIGs (which averaged 25 years) exceed the price paid for the MIG 27s purchased in 2000, (which averaged 12 years) Therefore, the price is not reasonable. The Ukrainian Government is not the producer government since it does not manufacture MIG 27 aircraft. (At the present time, the Ukraine manufactures An-22, An-72, AN-74, An-124 and AN-225 Mrija. These are exported by UKRSPETSEXPORT). The MIG 27s were produced at the Moscow Aircraft Production Organisation MIG plant and the Irkutsk Aircraft Production Joint Stock Company plant both of which are located in Russia. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 all Soviet Armed Force Military assets (including a number of MIG 27 aircraft) were taken over by the new Ukraine Republic in accordance with a Resolution of the Ukraine Parliament dated 24.08.1991. The MIG 27s were not utilized by the newly formed Ukraine Air Force as the planes were considered to be obsolete. They used MIG 29s, while the MIG 27s were kept as military surplus stock and disposed form time to time. Other countries also have surplus MIG 27s for sale. Therefore, the Ministry of Defence has violated Article 3.5.1 (c) (iii) as the equipment must be proprietary and obtainable only from one source. Under a Government to Government deal, monies must be paid to the relevant bank account of the Government or a Governmental Institution. The MIG 27 purchase monies were not paid to bank account

of Ukrinmash in Ukraine. Instead payments were made to the account of a UK Company named Bellimissa Holdings. According to the Defence Ministry. Neither the GoSL nor any other government can decide on the bank of which a company may have its accounts and where it may get credit facilities. Ukrinmash has indicated a financial institution based in England, where the payments are to be made by the GoSL as per the contract. The Contract for the purchase of MIG 27 aircraft does not name Bellimissa Holdings as the Agent of Ukrinmash entitled to receive payments on behalf of the Ukrainian. Bellimissa Holdings Limited is referred in the contract as a Designated Party. According to Clause 23.1, the Buyer and the Seller are aware that a third Party Bellimissa Holdings Limited (in this Contract (Part 1) referred to as the Designated Party shall be involved to provide the finance needed in executing this project. All payments under this Contract shall be irrevocably assigned and paid to the Designated Party in consideration for obtaining the finance package. Bellimissa Holdings Limited is a party to the Contract. The Ministry of Defence Statement has deliberately lied to the public to cover up this fraud. This is not a normal financial package (as per the Procurement Guidelines) such as : (i) a commercial loan to the Government to pay the Seller OR (ii) an agreement between the Government and any multi-lateral or bi-lateral funding agency to provide funds for the procurement which are permissible under the Guidelines. Furthermore, Articles 2.5.1 and 8.7.1 (a) require the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee and the Ministry of Defence to ensure that budgetary provisions were available to provide the funds for this purchase. These provisions ensure accountability of Government to Parliament in the utilization of public funds or funds obtained by way of laons. Under this Contract, Bellimmissa Holdings Limited, the Designated Third Party is obliged to pay Ukrinmash - the Seller, for the delivery of the four planes to Ministry of Defence the Buyer. Thus, there are, in fact, two separate and district obligations. One is, for the Third Party to pay the Seller. Under this obligation : (i) the seller can sue the Third Party if no payment is made OR (ii) the Third Party can sue the Seller if the planes are not delivered. The second obligation is for the Ministry of Defence (the Buyer) on delivery of planes by Ukrinmash (the Seller) to pay Bellimissa Holdings Limited (the Designated Third Party). Under this second obligation, the Third Party can sue the Buyer if payment is not made to the Third Party. This is different from a normal contract of sale where the two parties, the Buyer and the Seller, may institute legal action against each other for breach of contract. This is a tripartite contract which seeks to avoid making budgetary provisions required by the Guidelines thereby escaping accountability to and scrutiny by Parliament. The Contract document defines the Buyer as the Ministry of Defence represented by the Commander of the SLAF and states his address. The Seller is designated as Ukrinmash represented by a Director and the address is given as 36, Degtinrivska Str, Kiev, 04119, Ukraine. However, the designation of the person representing Bellimissa Holdings Limited is not defined in the Contract. Neither is the country of incorporation or its registered address stated in the Contract. Bellimissa Holdings Limited has an office in London but is not registered in the UK. Bellimissa Holdings is an off-shore Company. The relevant details of the company such as its shareholders, capital and accounts are kept confidential.

While it is the usual practice for payments for military equipment to be made direct to the Ukrinmash bank accounts in Kiev, it has come to light that Ukrinmash also utilizes front companies for financial transactions when requested by the buyers. In fact, Ukrinmash has a reputation for accommodating the wishes of the buyers. This flexibility has made Ukrinmash popular with corrupt Presidents, Ministers and government officials. For instance, Ukrinmash and UKRSPETSEXPORT were involved in the sale of weapons to Serbia, utilising front companies to bypass international sanctions on the sale of weapons. This was revealed during the trial of the former President Slobodan Milosevic - the Serbian Dictator responsible for ethnic cleansing in Yugoslavia. The details of these transactions are contained in the Report of the Investigator from the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia Morten Torkildsen. It is also interesting to note that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the Secretary to the Buyer (the Ministry of Defence) and the Officer vested with responsibility for the procurement of MIG27s, is closely related to Udayanga Weeratunga, Sri Lanka Ambassador in Ukraine. Mr. Weeratunga who is a political appointee carried on business in Ukraine prior to taking up this appointment and has many connections in Ukraine. Conclusions It is clear that the appropriateness of MIG 27s as Ground Attack Fighters for the current war effort is highly dubious ; more so given its questionable history, capacity and life-span. The purchase of MIG 27s in 2006 has contravened the established standards and procedures of government procurement. The Government of Sri Lanka has lost US$ 10.078 million by purchasing four MIG 27s whose life span has expired. The Defense Ministry has through criminal negligence endangered the lives of SLAF pilots and countless others while jeopardizing the war effort. Many of the facts given in the Ministry of Defence statement MIG 27 Inside story are completely false and designed to cover up a corrupt deal. They have been fabricated on the basis that the people of Sri Lanka are ignorant of military affairs and will accept anything stated by the Defence Ministry. MIG 29s Another Corrupt Deal ? Introduction Subsequent to the Tiger attacks on the Katunayake Airport on the 21st March and 25th April 2007, the Media reported that the Government was planning to purchase MIG 29 aircraft to deal with LTTE air power. Given the scandal surrounding the procurement of MIG 27s in 2006, the United National Party Research Unit commissioned an investigation into the current MIG 29 acquisition in the national interest. This Report will look at the SLAFs military requirements to repulse LTTE bombings and the Ministry of Defences rationale in selecting MIG 29s for this purpose. MIG 29s A statement from the Presidential Secretariat dated 16th May 2007 declared that the acquisition of MIG 29s was part of the planned development of the SLAF : The decision to purchase MIG 29 Fighter Jets for the Sri Lanka Air Force is a part of the plans to modernize the Air Force and have a good Air Defence System (ADS). It was not a knee-jerk reaction to the LTTEs recent air attacks. President Mahinda Rajapaksa told Editors and Media Heads at Temple Trees today.. That only after the present government was elected that new radar equipment was obtained and work began on establishing a proper ADS. We are now continuing with the work of improving and strengthening the ADS, he said.

The President said that countrary to many reports the addition of the MIG 29 Figther Jets was not thought of after the LTTE attacks. It was a part of the planned development of the ADS which envisaged a phased shift from MIG 21 to MIG 29. The reference to MIG 21 in the Statement from the Presidents Office is completely erroneous since the SLAF has never had any MIG 2 in its inventory. The Sunday Times of 20th May 2007 pointed out that this was a reference to MIG 27s and it has not been contradicted by the Government. Furthermore, the new radar equipment referred to was not obtained after the election of President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The radar equipment was obtained by the former President Chandrika Kumaratunga and her Foreign Minister the late Lakshman Kadirgamar, subsequent to Intelligence Reports on the establishment of an LTTE air strip and acquisition of aircraft. When the SLAF proposed the purchase of radar equipment, the Indian Government offered assistance in establishing an air defence system. The then President Chandrika Kumaratunga accepted this offer. Thus, it appears that the Presidential Secretariat is claiming false credit for President Rajapakse in order to cover up the military and political unpreparedness and lapses of the Rajapakse regime. According to the Presidents Office statement, the addition of the MIG 29 Fighter Jets was apart of the plan to improve and strengthen the Air Defence System. The Air Defence System consists of : i. INDRA II (a modern specialized low-level detection radar) ii. The Fire Control Radar (this tracks the target identified by INDRA II and directs the Air Defence Guns to take on the target) iii. The Air Defence Guns iv. Shoulder-fired surface to air missiles v. Interceptor aircraft. A successful Air Defence System requires integration between the two radars, effective communication and information flows as well as the successful coordination of the weapons and carriers in place. Yet no effort was made by the SLAF to integrate these different components of the system as evinced by the inability of the ADS to detect and destroy LTTE aircraft in March and April 2007. This was because in mid-2006 the Defence Ministry had determined that there was no threat from Tiger aircraft, and had therefore purchased Ground Attack aircraft intead of Multi Role Combat Figthers (The Ministry of Defence MIG 27 - Inside Story). The Government, as a policy decision, refused to accept the need for Interceptor Aircraft, and therefore, did not put in place the requisite firth component of ADS - interceptor aircraft. Contary to the Presidents Office statements, the Government did not maximize on the opportunity of fully activating the ADS. One of the aircraft considered by the Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) mandated by the Defence Ministry to purchase military equipment in 2006 was the MIG 29. The paper recommending the MIG 29 stated : With the acquisition of aircraft by LTTE, it is deem necessary for SLAF to maintain the readiness to counter any such threat posed by the enemy during any eventuality. The intelligence gathered reveals that Radar guided weapons are also gone into the hands of the enemy. In this context SLAF is in an urgent need of changing its weapon platform. Having considering to gain air superiority it has been identified that the best suitable air arm to cater for the existing threat is the Russian made MIG 29 which has been highlighted in many forums. The paper also highlighted that the MIG 29 as a multi-role combat aircraft had an Air to Air role, an Air to Sea role and an Air to Ground role. Yet, having examined the specifications, the TEC then goes on to reject the MIG 29 on the grounds that it was priced at a very high cost and that such technology was not required to meed the present enemy. The Presidents Office statement that the addition of the MIG 29 fighter jets was a part of the planned development of the ADS is contradicted by the Ministry of Defence own Statement MIG 27 Inside Story. By mid 2006, the Ministry of Defence has rejected the MIG 29, and it was thus not a part of the planned development of the Air Force.

2007 18 263 264

The MIG 29 is a fourth generation Fighter Aircraft in a market where aircraft of ever-increasing sophistication are produced. These aircraft are information technology-driven operational flying weapons. The MIG 291 which entered service in 1983 has a maximum speed of 2400 kph at high altitude and 1,500 kph near ground. The service ceiling is 18,000 meters. On the other hand, the ZLIN Z 143L of the Tiger Air Force is a propeller driven plane with a maximum speed of 267 kph. The service ceiling is 5700m. The LTTE has utilized this military training aircraft for : * Ground observation * Night flying * Low visibility and * Aerobatics The low technology of a propeller driven aircraft can easily avoid the SLAF fighter planes. Therefore, many observers have questioned whether the MIG 29 (which is technologically far more advanced than the ZLIN Z143L) is the best option to counter the tiger aircraft. For instance, the speed of the MIG 29 at near ground is 5 times that of the ZLIN Z143L. The Economist of 7th June 2007 has questioned the need to buy MIG 29 aircraft. Iqbal Athas writing on the purchase of the MIG 29 in the Situation Report commented that it was like buying a brand new Mercedes-benz to knock down a bullock cart. Iqbal Athas questioned the suitability of the MIG 29 to respond to the type of air attacks posed by the LTTE. Quite predictably, the statement by the Presidents Office avoided answering the question raised by Athas. Instead, it states that : The Defence Authorities had worked out the means of responding to the LTTEs present air capability. Such statements offer no reassurance given that the same Defence Authorities one year ago assured the country that the LTTE had no offensive air capability and rule out the purchase of MIG 29 Interceptor Jets. Furthermore, if the MIG 29 purchase was a part of the planned development to modernize the Air Force, then the Government should have followed the requisite procurement procedure and called for offers. For instance, the Indian Government has put out a tender procedure for the supply of fifth Generation Fighters to the IAF. Sri Lanka should have followed the same type of procedure. Given that the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee accepted the recommendations that the MIG 29 was for too expensive, and that such technology was not required for the present threat, there is no justification for now selecting MIG 29s. Once a determination is made by the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement committee that transaction is over. The bids/officers that have been rejected cannot be revived subsequently. If MIG 29s are required as a part of the planned process of the Military Modernisation Programme, the President should have taken action against the officers who constituted the TEC which stated that the MIG 29s were too expensive and that such technology was not required at the time. It was as a result of these recommendations, that the Government purchased four obsolete MIG 27 aircraft (see MIG 27 Deal who Profited from this Military Procurement? By the UNP Research Unit). It is also interesting to note that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the Secretary to the Buyer (Ministry of Defence) is closely related to Udayanga Weeratunga, Sri Lankas Ambassador in Russia. Mr. Weeratunga played a prominent role in this transaction. Conclusions The threats posed by the LTTE air attacks require appropriate counter measures that need to take into consideration the type of aircraft, weapons and modes of attack utilized.

There is no governmental explanation as to why the MIG 29 were selected over other more appropriate options (other than the fact that it was a decision made by the Defence authorities and implied that it is therefore to be trusted). The requisite procurement procedures have not been followed vis--vis this transaction. Furthermore, there is a lack of transparency which has a bearing on the purchase price of the aircraft which is on the high side. Due to the highly questionable war strategy undertaken by the government, Sri Lanka was in a complete state of unpreparedness when the LTTE air attack took place in March 2007. Even the air defence system that was put in place by the previous regime had not been fully activated to function. It is apparent that the statement issued by the Presidents Office contains blatant lies designed to camouflage the dubious procurements of the Defence authorities. They contradict the statement made by the Ministry of Defence. 1. The Soviet Air Force developed the MIG 29 by 1983 as an answer to the US F15 Eagle. The F15 Eagle entered service in with the USA in 1976. It has a speed of 2655 kph at altitude with a service ceiling of 19.810 meters.

We regret having to inform you that it will unfortunately not be possible to arrange a time for you to meet with Mr. Mandela as he will be out of the country during the time of your visit. As you know, Mr. Mandela is now in retirement and does not spend a lot of time in Johannesburg. He spends most of his time in Maputo, enjoying a well deserved retirement by the side of his family.
