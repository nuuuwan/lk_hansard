( ) (Mr. Speaker) The exact number? .

( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) This is a case of mass arrest. We know the sympathy of His Excellency the President for that matter any other President. We are not concerned about it. We would like to have a categorical statement from the Hon. Minister as to the number of people who have been detained on detention orders and the period of detention involved.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) ? [ ] , . . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) The Hon. Minister has not answered my question. I expect an answer from the Hon. Minister. I have posed a question in relation to the number of people who are being detained on detention orders issued by the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and the period of detention involved. Even the Minister is unaware of that - [Interruption] ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) I cannot tell you offhand. But up to now about 2000 people have been released.

. ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) How many have been detained? ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) Not detained. They are still questioning about 300 odd people. As soon as they are satisfied that there is no evidence against them they will be released. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) Under the law you cannot be keep people in police stations and prisons and say or rather allege that there is no detention. This is virtually detention and if you are keeping them without detention orders it is totally illegal.

( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) The Hon. Sri Kantha, we can release all these people. Can you give a guarantee to say that they are not involved in nefarious activities? . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) I can give the guarantee. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) For each and every person? [Interruption]. What are you talking? For each and every person, how can you give the guarantee? [Interruption] What are you talking? [Interruption] . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) I can give a personal guarantee. All of them are innocent. Just because they bear Tamil names you have arrested them. Now, it appears that the Hon. Minister is saying that they have got to prove that they are not Tigers. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) Not only Tamil people. In Negombo there were Sinhalese and Muslim people taken into custody. Do not put the blame on the Government. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) Even the Government Media said all those who have been arrested are Tamils.

2045 2046

( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) No! No! [Interruption] The Hon. Sri Kantha, the Hon. Maheswaran himself admitted that the Muslims were taken into custody, that Sinhalese were taken into custody. He himself admitted that they are in remand custody. What are you talking? [Interruption]

( The Hon. Hasen Ali -Deputy Minister of Supplementary Plantation Crops Development) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem Hon. Presiding Member, let me express my grateful thanks to you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to speak a few words as the Deputy Minister of Supplementary Plantation Crops Development. I also wish to convey my thanks to all the Hon. Members for expressing their views relating to our Ministry and the suggestions made for the development and advancement of supplementary plantation crops in our country which I have carefully made note of for future reference. As you are all aware ours is a new ministry established early this year under the "Mahinda Chintana" for intensive development of supplementary plantation crops in our country. Due to numerous reasons, we were able to commence work properly only from June this year. However, with the unstinted co-operation and assistance received from His Excellency the President the Hon. Minister and the Secretary to the Ministry within this short period we were able to do much development work especially in the East under the Dawn of the East programme. Under phase I of our programme, we met the divisional secretaries and other senior officials working in the coastal belt of the Ampara District at a days seminar held at the additional GAs office, Ampara in co-ordination with the Sri Lanka Cashew Corporation. It was really a massive awareness programme that we launched relating to cultivation of cashew and its expansion to enhance the economy of the community, the people in particular and the country in general by way of exports to earn the much needed foreign exchange since there is an ever increasing demand for Sri Lanka cashew in the developed countries and it is internationally accepted that Sri Lanka produces the tastiest cashew in the world perhaps due to our conducive climate conditions and wonderful soil. In fact, last week, we distributed 30,000 cashew seed plants to the people living in the coastal belt of Ampara District to grow in their home plots with the objective of eradicating poverty and two months ago, we distributed 2500 budded plants which were planted in one stretch of land extending around 50 acres involving the private sector. Under phase II of our programme, we propose to have a similar exercise in the other areas too, very soon.

2133 2134

The East which has been famous for paddy for decades and referred to as the granary of the East and its prolific fishing industry now would be famous for cashew too in the next few years due to unprecedented enthusiasm shown by our people as they believe growing cashew is less cumbersome, more lucrative and also planting along the seacoast would act as a deterrent preventive barrier for tsunami tidal waves which devastated the East exactly three years ago. Our concept is, Plant cashew for a better tomorrow. Moreover, in the next year we propose to distribute 200,000 budded cashew plants among the people. The Divisional Secretaries Divisions benefited so far in the coastal belt of Ampara District are Navithanveli DS Division, Nintavur DS Division, Addalaichenai DS Division, Erakkamam DS Division, Kalmunai DS Division, Samanthurai DS Division, Akkaraipattu DS Division, Alayadiveumbu DS Division, Thirukovil DS Division and Pottuvil DS Division. Development of the palmyrah industry is also another area, which comes under the Ministry of Supplementary Plantation Crops Development. There are thousands of palmyrah trees in the East bearing edible and non-edible nuts, which we have to tap to develop this sector and to make a significant contribution to the Gross Domestic Product. We have written to the Divisional Secretaries through the Government Agents to inform us the number of palmyrah trees available in their divisions and the information is flowing to us now. Like cashew, we propose to embark on a massive programme to expand the cultivation of palmyrah too because we have the ideal soil and the climate for easy propagation. I wish to offer a special word of thanks to the print and the electronic media for all the publicity they have given and ensured the success of our programmes. While we are engaged in these development activities with the active participation of the people for the greater good of the country, I am reluctantly compelled to make use of this opportunity to inform this august Assembly, that I am extremely sorry, that some invisible hands have come from outside, and are creating communal tensions by way of threats and intimidations to poor Muslim farmers to stop cultivation of paddy which they have been engaged for decades, stating that they are forest lands or lands of archaeological value. In fact we have had lengthy deliberations on these unpleasant developments at the District Co-ordinating Committee Meetings and had unanimously resolved that the farmers who have been doing their paddy cultivation for decades should be allowed to continue to do so, and that the status quo should be maintained. Furthermore, in accordance with the Mahinda Chintana, it is the District Co-ordinating Committee which is the sole authority in each district, where peoples representatives participate to decide on all issues cropping up in their districts.

In fact, I have brought this disturbing development to the notice of His Excellency the President requesting him to nip it in the bud, and as the Secretary-General of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, I appeal to the invisible hands to leave East in peace since that area is gradually recovering from the man-made and the natural disaster. Thank you. , . . , , .

. They try to convince the people that this Government is racist. That is what is happening today. The Government is doing everything possible in the development of tea, rubber and coconut plantations but some people who have their own agendas try to convince the people that this Government is racist. So, what we have to do is, we have to put all our efforts together to stop this nonsense and racism should be wiped out of this country for ever. His Excellency the President is trying his best to eradicate racism, to see that all communities live together in harmony because, otherwise there will be no development in the country whatever policies you adopt. What I really want to say Mr. Deputy Chairman is, we have to see whether the plans and policies adopted are profitable and useful in the development of the country. But racism should not be allowed to raise its head. It should be totally wiped out because the minorities in every part of Sri Lanka live in fear. In conclusion, I would say that our Ministry in the future, in about three or four years time, will be able to make all government institutions under it profitable and earn more foreign exchange for the development of the country. Thank you very much. [. . 3.36] ( )

Hon. Member, now you see that a Government corporation, the Cashew Corporation, is doing research hand in hand with the Wayamba University. This is why I said all you said was not correct. Probably, a part of it may be correct. Sir, I wish to say a few more things. During the past - [Interruption.] I did not disturb you, Hon. Jayawickrama Perera. We respect you as a senior Member of Parliament. I did not disturb you. So, please let me finish speaking. This document further states, I quote: "During the past ten years the faculty has; (a) Released six promising cashew varieties for general cultivation.

12. ISNAR (International Service for National Agriculture research) (thro CARP) The human resource developments, technology transfer achieved thro such collaborations are given below. Please note that this only a few among many. 1. Training of PH D, Masters degrees-split programs with international universities. 2. Technology development in fisheries, tissue culture technology, multi purpose tress species, food technology.

3. The above developed technology have been transferred to local industries, i.e. fisheries, Floriculture industry etc which has brought millions of US Dolloars in the past decade (i.e. prawn culture, fish imports, orchids, indor plants, banana etc.)

4. The above technology also has been transferred to the rural agriculture,, i.e. tissue culture technology, Farmers will very soon get the opportunity to gain knowledge while been involved in their cultivations, through certificate courses, Diplomas and even Degrees from local university. They only have to spend 1-2 days on their learning and the other days in their cultivations and obtain both knowledge and qualifications. This will lead to both socio-economy up-grade of rural farmers. Researches conducted by the Faculty of Agriculture, Eastern University, Sri Lanka 1.

CABINET MEMORANDUM FORMALIZING LINKAGES AMONG THE UNIVERSITY FACULTIES AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS Agricultural sector plays an important role in Sri Lankas economy, hence agricultural research and extension is vital for its sustainable development. The Faculties of Agriculture and Science and the related Postgraduate Institutes of the universities and the public sector research institutions are involved in agricultural research and extension activities in the country. It is proposed that formal links be established among these institutions to mobilize and maximize the resources to strengthen the R&D capacities, while mutually benefiting each other, to fostering agricultural development in the country. National University System: The national university system constitutes 13 universities located in various parts of the country. Within the university system there are several Faculties of Agriculture and Science and one faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science attached to the University of Peradeniya. Besides, there are two Postgraduate Institutes, in Agriculture and Science, which offers postgraduate degree programme at M. Sc. M. Phil and Ph. D. Levels. These institutions are the apex institutions contributing to the national agricultural knowledge system. They are the main repositories of knowledge and the conduit to the national knowledge that exists locally for use by the agricultural scientists and the agribusiness sector. These institutions provide the trained human resources to the public sector agricultural research institutions and the private industry. Three university faculties have a large number of highly qualified staff with postgraduate qualifications. They also have a higher share of staff trained at postgraduate leve than the public sector research institutions. The laboratories of the university faculties are also well equipped with modern laboratory equipment and computer facilities, supported by qualified technical staff. Beside, the Biotechnology Center affiliated to the Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Peradeniya caters to the research and development in plant and animal biotechnology. Public sector Research Institutes: There are a multitude of departments and institutions involved a agricultural research and development placed under the ministries of Agricultural Development, Estate Infrastructure and Livestock, Coconut Development, Irrigation and Mahaweli Development, Plantation Industries, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and Environment. Similar to the university faculties, these institutes are located in various parts of the country. These institutions also conduct agricultural research and extension activities in various fields. Proposal for formalizing links The foregoing information clearly indicates that the university faculties/institutes are endowed with highly qualified staff and research facilities. Although their primary function is training of undergraduates and postgraduates, the staff also undertake considerable volume of agricultural research, However, their research agendas are not directly aligned with the national priorities due to the compartmentalized nature of the national agricultural research system. Therefore, linking them with the public sector agricultural research institutions will greatly strengthen the national rescarch, education and extension programmes undertaken by public sector R & D institutions. In this multi-ministerial Cabinet Memorandum, it is proposed of formalize the links with the universities, and provide opportunities for two-way exchanges of scientists/academics among these institutions for selected research/, education and extension programmes under special provisions through sabbatical leave, special leave etc. This will promote better understanding and closer interaction among the scientists/academics in the relevant faculties/postgraduate insitute of the of the national agricultural research system (NARS) to strengthen national agricultural research, education and extension. It will also enable to utilize the qualified scientists of the universities and the NARS in the implementing collaborative and inter institutional research programmes, to share laboratory and field fecilities for the conduct of research education and extension programmes. I no proposed llinkage will enable to fully utilize the wild experience of the NARS scientists in undergraduate and postgraduate teaching and rescarch and other skills development programmes and compensate as may be required.

Furthermore, the proposed linkages could be used as a vehicle to improve competence and quality of NARS scientists by providing postgraduate education in the Universities/institutes, while strengthenting the local capacity for postgraduate education. Approval of the Cabinet of Ministers is sought to establish and implement linkages among the university faculties and the public sector agricultural research/extension institutions. Dr. I. S. B.

Project Title: Comparative Studies on in Vitro Responses Among Indica Rice Varieties in Sri Lanka and Improvement of their In Vitro Regeneration Efficiencies Objectives: The major objectives of this research project are to. - identify wild, indigenous, improved and exotic rice germplasms or varieties available in Sri Lanka. - compare in vitro responses among selected indica rice varieties available in Sri Lanka and to compare these responses with Taipei 309, a model rice variety (japonica). - improve in vitro responses using various in vitro techniques and altered media components to obtained higher regeneration efficiencies reducing the rate of regenerating albino plants. - conserve these varieties at their wild or domestic state. The research study is composed of 3 major phases as follow. 1. Reconnaissance survey 2. In vitro studies with the selected rice varieties in Sri Lanka 3. Identification of conservation methods for existing and improved rice varieties. Collaborative Institutes. - Faculty of Agricultural Sciences of Sabaragumuwa University of Sri Lanka - Regional Agricultural Research Institute, Kahagolla.

(B) Approved projects (to be commenced) 1. Project Title: Establishment of Indigenous Tree Species in Dieback Areas in Horton Plain National Park. Is the cause for dieback nutrient imbalance or decline in natural montane mycorrhizae? Objectives: The main objective of the whole study is the successful establishement of natural indigenous tree species in the back in Horton Plains National Park The study will also investigate the following: Is the nutrient stress/variation of soil chemistry (i.e. Macro/Micro nutrients imbalance, variation of soil pll, the major cause for forest dieback? Will the treatment of soil with compost right before the tree establishment help sustained establishment of new trees by eliminating any kind of nutrient imbalance found in the soil? Is the inhibition of local montane mycorrhizae the major cause for the problem? So, will the introduction of indigenous montane mycorrhizae during the tree establishment lead to sustainable development of trees in the dieback areas? There are three hypothesis to test in the study. They are: (i) Stress caused on trees by a plant nutrient imbalance will result dieback and continued failure in reestablishment of trees in the dieback areas. And, the inhibition of reestablishment of trees in dieback areas will be eliminated by the addition of compost into the soils of affected areas because, standard compost has the ability to balance soil chemical, biological and physical conditions in a way that the average plants find optimum growing conditions. (ii) Dramatic decline in local montane mycorrhizae will result dieback and continued failure in reestablishment of trees in the dieback areas. And, the inhibition of reestablishement of trees in dieback areas could be overcome by introduction of local montane mycorrhizae to seedlings before replanting. (iii) The reason for forest dieback is the result of both soil nutrient imbalance and the decline of local mycorrhizae in the tree roots. Anticipated benefits Identification of the causes for forest dieback and their remedial measures will be of great importance in preventing dieback and successful reestablishment of the dieback areas in Horton Plain National Park. The experience and the knowledge gathered could also be transferred to the other affected areas as well. Four members of the researchers (including the principle investigator) out of four are based at the Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka Belihuloya, Horton Plain National Park where the permanent plots are going to be established is only about 65km away from the University. The Condition will facilitate frequent visit and close monitoring of the project while minimizing the cost and the time involved with traveling. The project provides funding for one year though there will be great opportunities for the undergraduate and postgraduate students of the university to continue the study thereafter in collaboration with the Department of Wildlife Conservation. It is obvious that the project of this nature should be continued to a much longer time scale than only one year. Under this situation, there are many doors open at Sabaragamuwa University to extend the study for a much longer period of time. Every year, we have final year undergraduates who look for research work to fulfill the requirement of the research component of the degree. Also, we are going to start a postgraduate degree program in Natural Resources Management next year (2008) in collaboration with Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand. The availability of researchers to continue the project will therefore be a reality. The University itself will be ready to allocate some funding for the research work to be done by the undergraduates.
