REUTER REPORT ON SRI LANKAN AID WORKERS : STATEMENT BY THE HON. PRIME MINISTER

(, , , )

( - , , ) (The Hon. Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka - Prime Minister, Minister of Internal Administration and Deputy Minister of Defence, Public Security, Law and Order) Mr. Speaker, the Government of Sri Lanka is surprised by the unexpected comments attributed to Sir John Holmes, United Nations Under Secretar-General for the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in an interview given to Reuters prior to attending a joint press conference with the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights yesterday evening. Though the interview which was published under the title "Sri Lanka a top danger spot for aid workers - UN" was evidently given earlier, it had been embargoed for release after the press conference. The Government of Sri Lanka which had facilitated the visit of Sir John with a view to developing an effective relationship with the UN regrets very much the implication of the statement attributed to Sir John Holmes. In this interview Sir John Holmes has stated, I quote: There is a concern about the safety of humanitarian workers themselves and the record here is one of the worst in the world from that point of view. The entire weight of his assertions is now being placed on Sri Lanka. The United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, in its release issued yesterday on the visit of Sir John Holmes did not describe Sri Lanka as a "dangerous place for humanitarian workers". Hence, the

1299 1300

[ ]

Government of Sri Lanka is deeply concerned with John Holmes statement to Reuters, which was in marked contradiction to the UN statement as well as his comments made at the joint press conference. The Government of Sri Lanka, in no uncertain terms, rejects John Holmes assertion that Sri Lanka is not safe for humanitarian workers. His Excellency the President has categorically emphasized the Governments total commitment to the safety of humanitarian workers during his talks with Sir John Holmes and the latter acknowledged and expressed appreciation for the steps taken by the Government with regard to the security of humanitarian workers engaged in the North and the East. The Defence Secretary, in his meeting with John Holmes welcomed genuine humanitarian workers to the East. Furthermore, John Holmes visited the North and the East and saw for himself the prevailing conditions therein and the steps taken for the safety of the people in that area. The Government has also explained to John Holmes the current position with regard to the investigations on the killing of the 17 aid workers of the French NGO, ACF. The Government is confident of the progress, with the investigations and some of the facts correctly emerging may come as an uncomfortable surprise to those who are using this dastardly incidents to discredit Sri Lanka.

Under these circumstances, Mr. Speaker, the Government cannot but feel that Sir John has contributed to those who seek to discredit the Government and tarnish its international image. While the Government wishes to take cognizance of the UNOCHA statement and the comments made by Sir John Holmes at the press conference, it cannot but utterly reject the remarks made by him in his interview with the Reuters. It is precisely because of past experience with journalists who seek sensationalism at the expense of the truth that Sir John was advised by government authorities to be cautious with the media during his visit. Unfortunately a visit that was designed to build up confidence has been seriously affected by his interview with a media outlet that has traditionally sacrificed the truth in the pursuit of sensational headline news.

While the Government reiterates its sincere desire to work with the United Nations and its institutions, it is with the greatest reluctance that it wishes to point out that intemporate comments and such assertions could question the impartiality of the institution that he is representing. I thank you.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) . COLOMBO SOUTH PORT EXPANSION PROJECT

[.. 10.42] ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I move that, Sri Lanka, from time immemorial, has been well known for its ports and shipping from all parts of the world calling at Colombo, Trincomalee and Galle. The ports played a significant role in the development of Sri Lanka. Our Colombo Habour now urgently needs further development and expansion to keep abreast with the new third generation container ships. Recently, the Asian Development Bank having studied Sri Lankas needs, had agreed to grant a loan for the Colombo South Port Expansion Project. This project was initiated as far back as year 2002. It has been unduly delayed for reasons unknown. The Sri Lanka Ports Authority has now called for tenders to make an award for the Colombo South Port Expansion Project. If the award of this tender is not done forthwith, it will be delayed by another year, and the ADB offer for assistance may perhaps be withdrawn. Therefore, this House resolves that immediate action be taken to make the award for the South Port Expansion Project to a tenderer who will bring best possible income and business to Sri Lanka.

This Adjournment Motion will be seconded by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake. The proposed Colombo South Port Terminal Project and the new Breakwater are long felt needs of the Colombo Port as it is not in a position to handle the larger vessels that are being introduced now. These modern vessels can carry 10,000 to 12,000 containers in each vessel which are called the Third Generation vessels.

At the request of the Sri Lankan Government the Asian Development Bank has been kind enough to provide a loan to fund the project that will expand the Port of Colombo by building breakwaters, terminals and channels within the Colombo Port limits.

The bids for the tender were closed on 11th June 2007, and it is expected to announce the shortlist after the technical evaluation on 11th August, 2007. Five parties have submitted their bids namely, Hutchison Port Holdings, Hong Kong, Hanjin Shipping Limited, Korea, Aitken Spence with Port of Singapore Authority, Hayleys-Carsons combined with a unit of French carrier CMA-CGM and John Keels Holdings with SAGT and another foreign party.

The expectations of the ADB are that the company that constructs the Colombo South Port Terminal should be able to bring in the highest income to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority - SLPA - so that the Government could use that money to repay the loan that is being granted for this purpose. It has been established by international shipping experts that any country could build a mega port like the South Port which is envisaged with a deep draft. However, getting customers to use and patronize this port is the crucial aspect to be considered. Some companies in the list can bring in high revenue by introducing additional ships to call at Colombo while some other companies do not have the capacity to do this. The companies that could divert their ships to Colombo are the ones that could generate the highest income to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority.

However, local newspapers have recently highlighted that some fraudulent and corrupt practices are taking place in the evaluation stage to accommodate a "favoured tenderer" without taking into due consideration the core requirement of generating adequate income to repay the loan. So much so, a complaint has also been lodged with the Chairman of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption against the Chairman of SLPA, Saliya Wickramasuriya. It is alleged that the SLPA Chairman had acted in a suspicious manner and had violated his mandated authority to facilitate the award of the South Terminal of the Colombo South harbour to a bidder of his preference. The ADB is watching this situation because they have made an assessment of the tenderers and are aware who is the best party to handle this project in the interest of Sri Lanka.

Therefore, we urge the Government to reconsider whatever evaluations done thus far and take into consideration the concerns of the ADB and award the tender to the company which can bring in the highest revenue to the country after building the south terminal.

1305 1306

1307 1308

[ ]

I would also like to remind the House that a monumental blunder was made by the Government in awarding the tender to expand the Queen Elizabeth Container Terminal - QCT - to South Asia Gateway Terminal - SAGT - which was not able to generate sufficient income to repay its loan and maintain the terminal and its equipment to international standards. What the SAGT actually did was to grab a portion of the business of the Government owned Jaye Container Terminal - JCT - and deprive a colossal amount of foreign exchange to the country. Since they did not have the capacity to bring in new business, they were depending only on becoming a competitor to the JCT by undercutting tariff and reducing the JCTs share of business. Therefore, the throughput of the Colombo Harbour remains more or less the same even after expanding the QCT to SAGT. Having learnt a lesson from the SAGT experience, the Government should not make the same mistake again. It is in fact the Governments responsibility to consider the following criteria to be met by the right bidder before the tender for the South Port Terminal Expansion Project is awarded: (a) Whether the bidding company has the capacity to divert a substantial number of containers to the new South Port in order to generate substantial revenue to repay the ADB loan. (b) If the bidding company is a terminal operator operating in India, the Gulf and Asia, whether it is going to promote Sri Lanka or whether it is going to control Sri Lankan traffic and maintain its current hub status and divert Colombo containers to its existing terminals; and (c) if the bidding company is a shipping line, which is also operating a terminal or terminals elsewhere, whether it is willing to divert its traffic and make the Colombo South Port their regional hub. While bidders have to satisfy the technical specifications laid down by the Government, it is also important to ensure their ability to increase the volume of traffic into Sri Lanka rather than diverting the current traffic into the new terminal. It is important to ensure that the bidding companies have sufficient financial strength to face any future price escalations due to inflation and also whether they are financially backed by financial institutions or governments. We urge the Government to ensure total transparency in the entire evaluation process of this tender so that the company that can best fulfil the requirements of both the ADB and the Sri Lankan Government will be awarded the tender. The United National Party is seriously concerned about the widespread allegations in a number of newspapers against the Chairman of the SLPA,, who it

is alleged had changed the Request for Proposal document from time to time to accommodate his preferred bidder. It is also alleged that the markings in the tender process were twisted and manipulated by the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. In view of these serious fraudulent and corrupt happenings in the tender process, we, the United National Party of the Opposition, have unanimously decided at its Parliamentary Group and Working Committee meetings that if any corrupt or unlawful practice is observed in the tender process, a future UNP Government will cease to honour the ADB loan or any other loan raised by the Ports Authority or the Government of Sri Lanka for this purpose. We also have reliable information that large sums of money have been demanded for the award of this tender irrespective of qualifications or suitability. So much so, some of the companies have said that their governments do not approve of paying money under the table, but they will seriously consider doing whatever development project that the Government will propose. Very unfortunately, even that has been rejected. If the award of this tender is delayed for whatever reasons, the commencement of construction will be delayed by a further year due to the expected monsoon weather.

[.. 10.54]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for permitting me to speak. I second the Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. John Amaratunga. But, prior to that I would like, with your permission, to cover a matter that was cleared this morning and refer to the irresponsible acts of the Chief Government Whip in this House. As you know, this Government has a reputation of having dubious Ministers telling untruths to this House. The Supreme Court has named the Hon. Minister in charge of the UDA as telling untruths to the Cabinet. We have a Chief Government Whip telling untruths to the House and we have a Government that is telling untruths to the people. Sir, I would like to table* the Answer to Question No. 1010/07, which I asked yesterday morning and which the Chief Government Whip, the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, refused to answer.

It is a matter that does not come within his purview. I do not know whether he has the ability or the knowledge to say that it is not a complete answer. To my reckoning, being a former Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, it is one of the best Answers that have come up. But, the Government was trying to hide the fact that it was making money out of the consumer. That is what they wanted to hide. When you take a realistic picture of the pricing, they say that costing has been done at US Dollars 76, but here it has been done at only US Dollars 62. So, I would like with your permission, to table this Answer and please ensure that it is printed in HANSARD. The other matter is, the Mid Year Fiscal Position Report, which contains the actual financial position and which the Government is compelled to present under the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act every three months, was tabled in this House. Here is the Report that was tabled and in perusing it in the last couple of hours, the first thing that we noticed was - every three months or quarterly the Government has to present the report, which has not been done - the contradiction between the Central Bank reports and the periodical reports, which makes the Government ashamed. In other reports they say it is a 10 to 12 per cent growth rate while the Report presented under the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, shows that the situation is completely different, proving that what the Opposition has been saying is the actual state of the play. So, I thank you for giving me this opportunity to digress from the issue under discussion. I would like to thank the former Minister, the Hon. John Amaratunga for bringing a very timely Motion before this House. As you know, a component of 57 per cent of the GDP - the Gross Domestic Product - is from the service industry and in that, the shipping industry plays a pivotal role. I am made to understand that in the recent past there was a chartered ship brokers meeting in Sri Lanka and there were very eminent people. I have also been told that Mr. Richards from the UK, who is a very eminent person in the shipping field, is here in this House. I think it is time, when foreign people are focusing on Sri Lanka, that we look at as to how we could salvage ourselves from the problem. What is happening is, external forces are taking over the most important geographical locations in Sri Lanka and are trying to create problems to minimize the advantages that Sri Lanka can get out of those. That is why, I think the Hon. John Amaratunga is quite concerned about the genuineness and the way this tender is moving forward because it is seen as corrupt. It certainly looks as if they are trying to give it to one or two people at the expense of the country. Now, Sir, there are two matters that are being discussed here. First is the breakwater, which is necessary to construct the Colombo South Harbour Port. I would like, as the Hon. Amaratunga touched upon the Colombo South Harbour Port, to take up the breakwater, which is a necessary tool for the harbour to be

constructed. Both projects seem to be having the same problem and both, at the end of the day, would put the Sri Lankan shipping industry into great jeopardy. We are geographically well located. We rely on big India in the operation of containers to Colombo with those being ferried from India to Colombo. The reality is such with the Sethusamudram Project coming up and ports in every corner in India developing, that we have got to be absolutely efficient, cost-effective and acquire state-of-the-art systems. Otherwise, we will get sucked into India.

That was the thrust of the Hon. John Amaratunga's speech, of what he was trying to say. Because if we, by chance miss the opportunity now, we will be at the mercy of India and the hub status of Sri Lanka will get converted into more or less a relay station. That is what we are concerned about. Today in the region, as you all know - I am happy to see the former Minister of Port Development and Shipping, who has a lot of knowledge and the present Minister of Ports and Aviation, who is obviously doing his very best with the bad brief that has been given by the officials - there is a 17 per cent growth rate and for the first time, last month the Port of Colombo recorded a 1 per cent negative growth. There has been almost 3.5 million containers going through the Port and now the JCT is losing its share to the SAGT, which is within the Port, but a private consortium has taken over 50 per cent of container handling in this country. Hon. Minister, I would appreciate if you look at why the SAGT is handling only domestic containers as opposed to containers that normally come for transshipment. The country earns around US Dollars 140 for a domestic container while for transshipment we get only US Dollars 27 per container. While the JCT handles only transshipment, the majority, almost 55 to 60 per cent of the domestic containers go to the SAGT. As the Government of Sri Lanka is a major shareholder of the JCT, please ensure that a reverse cycle takes place because money is being given by your own scheduling officers to somebody who is external and not our own. So, I am sure the Hon. Minister would take cognizance of that fact.

I would also like to take up infrastructure. Now we have decided to go forward. We have to go forward, there is no question about it. When I was the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, I was hell-bent on getting the Indians to team up with the Sri Lankan Government or with Sri Lankan entrepreneurs to develop a SAARC regional port because India is developing too many ports. At the end of the day, there will be over-emphasis, over expenditure of capital on ports and at one particular time, all these ports would get a negative return. So, it was our intention to invite India to join Sri Lanka as she is the main supplier of containers to our country. If they come and take a share, I guess such excessive investment in the area of port development would not take place. I am sure you would take this up. You may be governing today, but in the next couple of months we will

be taking over and your sins too will have to be taken over by us. That is what we are concerned about. - [Interruption.] It could be even a couple of weeks the way it is going. So, on that score, Hon. Minister, I am only telling you - we are all Sri Lankans and at the end of the day, we have to fly the Sri Lankan flag - that your sins and the ill-timed advice you follow would put Sri Lanka into jeopardy. Also when it was privatized and given to the SAGT, I from this side got up and pointed out the negative aspects of it. We also showed the positive aspects of it. We said that at the end of the day, they will only rob the containers from the Port of Colombo rather than bring in new containers. As we said then - Hon. Minister, you were there and you have to defend once again the bad brief of the Government - today 55 per cent of the domestic containers go to the SAGT. That is what we said. Where are the new containers that they have brought in? No, there are no new containers. The same competitor is having a port in India under the P&O. So, this is the problem we have been highlighting. At this moment, we must not colourize the economy. At the end of the day, if we lose the economic war, we would lose all wars. From that standpoint, shipping, which plays a pivotal role, needs to be protected, fostered and we must ensure that the regional threat is taken out and that opportunity is used to strengthen Sri Lanka's economy. Then, I would like to say that the Request for Proposal has been forwarded and four or five companies have tendered for it. I am confining myself to the breakwater as the Hon. John Amaratunga covered extensively the area of development of the Colombo South Port. The breakwater would be constructed with the assistance of the ADB. The ADB has come forward to give us US Dollars 400 million on the basis that there is a viable entity that would take the port development forward because they have no intention of putting money into infrastructure which the Government has to invest in and at the end of the day find that there is nobody to take up the port development work. So from that point of view, the Request for Proposal very categorically states that you must find one, two, three or four players who are able to activate the Colombo South Harbour Development Project. All of us without any hesitation, say that the Colombo South Harbour must be developed. But first of all, is the infrastructure sufficient enough to take that project forward? The ADB says, "We will develop the port". But are the roads and other related infrastructure able to take on the demand that would come up? At the moment the Port of Colombo is congested and the vicinity is overcrowded with containers going around. So, without developing

( ) (The Presiding Member) .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Presiding Member, what I was trying to say is that there is the necessity to take the Combo South Port Development Project forward. The ADB which has come forward with a grant in their Request for Proposal and vetted by them states, "We are putting US Dollars 400 million". Has the Government got the capacity to pay the capital cost, the amortization cost and the interest as well? Because, US Dollars 400 million in commercial terms would basically mean that you have got to pay at least US Dollars 4 to 5 billion on this particular transaction. So, can the Government earn this amount through the process that is going to take place? This has to be considered prior to the bids being awarded. The cost benefit analysis obviously has not taken certain very important matters into consideration. That, again, I leave it to the Government. I am sure their sagacity will prove that they have looked into this matter. But it is our bounden duty to tell them that these matters need to be looked into. Hon. Minister, US Dollars 400 million is no mean amount of money. On one side the Government is trying to get a loan of US Dollars 500 million on commercial terms through the HSBC, Bank of Ceylon, Morgan Stanley and Barclays Bank in the next couple of days for infrastructure development. We, from the United National Party are very categorically clear on this. The Government which is taking every single cent in this

country and making it bankrupt is now trying to go to external areas seeking money thereby putting this country into a debt trap. Therefore, we come forward and say unless and otherwise monies taken on infrastructure development is paid back by this Government itself, that when we, the United National Party come to office, will not honour those ill-gotten loans that are taken. We are emphasizing this fact. The Government is putting this country into a debt trap. Thailand came out of this; Malaysia came out of this. But you are leading to this in order to stay alive for the day. We are a party that has taken this country forward from the day of Independence by developing it. But the Alliance led by the SLFP has always retarded the growth of this country and we cannot just wait and see what is going on. It is our bounden duty to point this out. When we took office, we had to take over your sins, Hon. Minister. We were paying for the sins that had been committed by the former Government. We could not create job opportunities; we could not develop infrastructure because of the fiscal mismanagement of the former Government. So, we - ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem-Minister of Posts and Telecommunication) You employed enough people in the CWE.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) That is not in issue.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, you were there in the Cabinet. You did not have the guts to get up and say it at that time. You yourself endorsed it. We were able to save Rs. 2 billion owing to that commercial act. The Hon.(Dr.) Sarath Amunugama including His Excellency President thanked the United National Party and myself for saving Rs. 2 billion for the Ministry of Finance and Planning. His Excellency the President in his Independence Day speech said, "I want Ministers not to sing hosannas for their dinner. Tell me if I am wrong". Hon. Minister, I think you have the guts and the audacity to say so and I guess you do not need to sing hosannas for you dinner. Sir, we are looking at this from a Sri Lankan perspective, for the benefit of Sri Lanka. Please ensure that the monies that come from the ADB are used for the correct purpose. The cost of the breakwaters should be in the range of US Dollars 250 to 350 million. I just mentioned and digressed from the issue of the HSBC

1315 1316

[ ]

loan of US Dollars 500 million that is being taken, which we from the United National Party are opposing and writing to all the institutions. Because, when you take it at LIBOR plus 150 basic points, with the inflation factor and interest charges, you are going to have for an average period of a ten-year loan, almost a 12 per cent cost. Any infrastructure to gain 12 per cent is humanly impossible. No government, in a situation where the monopoly is given away to the competition today, would ever be able to ensure that you get a return of 12 per cent on infrastructure development. This is why we, from the United National Party, very timely and very correctly are saying this. If your return of capital is higher than what you are borrowing, we have no problem. But do not let the country to go into a debt trap. We are pre-warning you. Sir, earlier I tabled document No. I and I wanted it to be included in the Hansard. Now I am tabling* document No. II which is a comparison of bidders of the Colombo South Harbour Expansion Project in the area of the breakwaters and want it too to be included in the Hansard. There are four bidders. Bid No. 1 comes from the Chinese consortium, Bid No. 2 is from Hanjin, Bid No. 3 is from Hyundai. These three are single entity competitors while the fourth is an amalgamation of three competitors, Hindustan Construction Company, Boskalis, and MTH. It is very clear and transparent, Hon. Minister, that they are trying to eradicate the best of proposals in the Technical Evaluation Committee Report and trying to give it to one or two other players. I would table this; but I do not want to debate the Technical Evaluation Committee Report because - ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Are you referring to the breakwaters?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, breakwaters. Because the Hon. John Amaratunga touched upon the Colombo South Harbour Development Project and I am touching upon the breakwaters, because the harbour cannot come if the breakwater is not done. The breakwater will be given only after a proper evaluation is done and a suitable competitor or competitors are selected. So it is mutually an exclusive situation. So on this particular basis, I would like to extract the seven basic points that they considered at the evaluation. And if any of the bidders do not get more than 50 per

cent in each area, that particular competitor stands to be rejected. On that basis, Bid No. 3 of Hyundai has got less than 50 per cent in one area but they are still being pursued. But on the other hand, the bidder who has got the highest marks, the most complied bid is being rejected for the simple reason that he does not seem to be having -

( ) (The Hon. Sunil Handunnetti) Combination ?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, combination . The Hon. Sunil Handunnetti questioned me whether it was the combined venture which I refer to in the Technical Evaluation Committee Report and I said, Yes, it is the combination". The only disadvantage they seem to be having is, they are the biggest and are too big to be handle this particular project. They have been asked whether they have handled ports before and they have said that they have not handled ports but have handled very similar projects which are bigger than what they have been asked for. So on that particular area there is transparent and clear proof that the best is being eradicated and there is a necessity to take in somebody else. Hon. Minister, I would like you to look into this. I am looking at the Technical Evaluation Committee Report which shows that they are trying to eradicate the best and give it to the second which has a Chinese connection. Hon. Minister, we must realize that we are in a geographically sensitive area. Sri Lanka is a small nut in the big SAARC machinery. Eighty per cent of the containers from India come to Colombo. We have offended the Indians who have been our best friends and friends-in-need by telling them that we have given the Hambantota Port Development Project to the Chinese. Still the evaluation has got to go across but the Indians are very perturbed. The second point is, when there is a joint venture of which Hindustan, an Indian company is a partner, you are telling them, "You go out. We do not want the Indian Company coming in even though they are the most responsive and best bidder". So, Hon. Minister, if we are politically savvy, we need to look at it favourably instead of offending India because she is our friend. It is India that brings in all the production and it is their containers that come in. You must really invite them to please come in and do this with us. Now I will move on to the other areas. If I may take the offer of the China consortium, they are ones who are doing the Norochcholai Thermal Power Project and they

were supposed to do the Katunayake Expressway. It was once stated in Parliament that they were excessively high in their cost components. At that time they were defended by the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle saying that US Dollars 400 million was cheap. Now it is proven that the French have come in at US Dollars 200 million and still they are expensive. So what we said then is true and it is the same thing as of now, Hon. Minister. It shows that the TEC have basically gone into five areas where the China Harbour Engineering Company has been rejected. They were rejected first due to lack of proficiency in English which is a necessity in the bid process. The next one is the labour content. That is, 27 per cent of it needs to have Chinese labour coming into this country. This is a country which has an unemployment rate of almost 8 per cent officially and about 20 per cent unofficially. So does it require Chinese labour to come into this country? That is one of the requirements and the highest point has been given by the Technical Evaluation Committee to such a thing. Unless the Technical Evaluation Committee who are Sri Lankans who seem to be of Chinese origin, no person who has an iota of brains will basically give such an advantage to a company which is bringing in labour input from outside. Twenty seven per cent of labour content in real terms means 527 labour grade officers. Sir, I table* document III which shows that the installation method of the oil pipeline is risky and requires more information to be acceptable. This has been mentioned by the Technical Evaluation Committee but they still want to bring them at the expense of the best bidder. I am only giving the point. Finally, you will find what seems to be the best out of your own Technical Evaluation Committee. Then the next one is the asset value. This is something which is very important. I table* document IV to be included in the Hansard because otherwise it makes no relevance at all to my speech. The asset value of the company is the most important factor. This company has an asset value of US Dollars 3084 million in 2001. It has come down to US Dollars 473 million in 2005. So you could see that it is either absolutely stripping the assets or losing money. The actual profit of this company before taxes in 2001 was US Dollars 40 million. It had come down to US Dollars 16 million in 2005. Likewise, the net asset value of the

company is down from US Dollars 766 to 120 million. Obviously, this is a company that is having severe financial strains, and by the time you convert and finish the breakwater work, you might find that this company is already bankrupt. So, you will be dealing with a company which is unable to give a bank guarantee to this. I tabled document IV in order to save time. The next point that I would like to take up is that the Technical Evaluation Committee not having the ability in assessing the bids, has got the service of Scott Wilson, a professional consultancy company and in their process they have found out that the Bid No. 1 of the Chinese company has not been properly authorized by the notaries. So it is a half-baked bid that is there and the pre-qualification set out in the Request for Proposal has been extracted and interpolated without paying attention as to how those are going to be implemented. So it is just a very superficial acceptance of the Request for Proposal which is confirmed by the consultants appointed by the Technical Evaluation Committee. You could see that I am still very much in the frame of what the Technical Evaluation Committee is telling us and I am just pointing those out to the Hon. Minister. Sir I am tabling* documents V and VI for the simple reason of saving time. Then the next one is, Hanjin which is Bid No. 2. Under item 5.2, Construction Schedule/programme, the Technical Evaluation Committee quite rightly have found out and reported that they have not taken into consideration the adverse weather conditions of the country. You have the monsoons that come in two seasons. They have disregarded this and the construction period is obviously impractical according to the Technical Evaluation Committee. They have been rated as the lowest but still they are in the running as opposed to the highest which is being eradicated or being rejected and as to how they still survive to fight for the financial tender seems to be a mystery. Then when it comes to the third bid which is Hyundai, the Technical Evaluation Committee has gone on the basis of seven categories at the evaluation as I said before and if a bidder gets less than 50 per cent in one area they should be rejected; they have got less than 50 per cent in two areas, but they still exist. The next point is, the Technical Evaluation Committee has quite rightly pointed out that the rock-bed filling that is required to be done in this particular instance comes from one particular source; and they do not seem to be able to maximize and obtain the service of another supplier because the requirement of rock will be far greater. So it would not be financially feasible to get it from one place. I must salute the Technical Evaluation Committee for being able to go into this type of thing in such a professional manner.

The litigation rate of the company is 8.6 per cent. It is a very high rate in international bids. But still they are kept on and marks are being given. Of course they are the lowest. But my concern is, when there are four bidders and when they are the lowest, why is the highest, the most responsive bidder being eradicated or being rejected and the lowest still existing in the system? So as the Hon. John Amaratunga said, whether it is the Colombo South Harbour Development Project or whether it is the breakwaters being built, in every instance obviously there seems to be some corrupt element. When it comes to the joint venture of Hindustan, Boskalis and MTH, the most important issue that comes up is the open sea marine conditions. The Technical Evaluation Committee stating the reason for rejection has said that this company has not carried out similar types of activities. But they have showed that while similar activities are not being done, there are better and bigger projects that have been done in those areas, quoting Denmark and Sweden, where the biggest single span bridges in the world were constructed by them. Hon. Minister, they say that such a contractor is not competent to do the breakwaters when they have done far bigger work. So what is this ulterior motive in trying to reject a big company? Is it because they are too big that they want to reject this? Or is it because this is a joint venture as opposed to a single company? See the strength of this. It has an Indian input; it has a Dutch input and it also has a Danish input. So, it has a multinational impact which helps us because you have Mercs Line of Denmark coming in, you have Indian containers which are coming in, and obviously Dutch exports and Sri Lanka exports too. So when you really look at it, you would be able to get them and say, "Okay. You must commit your exports, your involvements and your inputs as opposed to the Chinese we have been basically threatened at this particular moment". So the biggest disadvantage that seems to be for this fourth company which is a combination or a joint venture, according to the Technical Evaluation Committee, is that they seem to be too big. So, Hon. Minister, I am tabling all these documents in order to give you a picture as to how this has moved forward. Sir, there is another issue. I am tabling* document VII in which the Technical Evaluation Committee very specifically states that their labour input, language and professionalism are at question. Now we must look as to why the first bid had not been rejected or even questioned by the consultancy firm as well as the Technical Evaluation Committee. So, Hon. Minister, I have put forward facts which are stunning coming from the Technical Evaluation Committee. Being in the trade, being in the country of

service industry where shipping plays a pivotal role, a lot of jobs rely on it, whether it is the hotel industry or otherwise, all of them rely on shipping. So, please ensure that we do not once again throw away a very important industry. India is very competitively and enviously looking at Sri Lanka. But owing to the fact that they feel Sri Lanka still is a small economy and have to depend upon India, they do not seem to be taking us as a threat. But the problem the Government is trying to open up is, we are trying to bring the Chinese into the Sri Lankan ports and then trying to create a competition between the Chinese and the Indians. Why should we get involved in this geopolitical situation? Hon. Minister, you have past records of dealing with such people. The sensitivities cannot be disregarded. If we disregard those, you will suddenly have a problem like what we had from 1977 to 1978. We have got to look at it with a completely international, geographical reality check. The financial aspects show that Bid No. 4 is the most responsive. I am only talking of the Technical Evaluation Committee Report. The Hon. John Amaratunga mentioned the corrupt activities that are taking place in the harbour development. I know for a fact that there were two blue-chip company chairmen. They spoke to me and said, This is a hell of a situation. We bid". Five days thereafter they come and tell us, "Your bid is very good. But you need to get things expedited. Why do you not work along with us? This is a fact, Hon. Minister. I will tell you who those people are because they very openly said so. They said that this is the way it was heading. We definitely say that the Government is corrupt. There is no question about it. But the players can be named rather than sit in the blind. When it can be done, why are we not doing so? If an efficient, clean Government exists you will be able to find who these corrupt people are and get them down. When there is a blue-chip company that has offered a responsive bid - there are four companies and two of them have got the same response - obviously, they are sitting in the blind thinking the best will come forward and at end of the day the people who were trying to do corrupt activities are the winners. Hon. Minister, we, at this particular moment are in absolute economic ruination. We are unable to live because the cost of living is so high. Today, we are being isolated in the world. The Hon. Prime Minister made a statement today in this House. We invite foreigners to this country and when they come and give the actual situation which is expected of them, then we say, "What the hell are you saying?" Obviously that means that there is a departure between the accepted International Community and the Government of Sri Lanka. Please ensure that we have the International Community in our hands. You can catch more bees with honey than with vinegar. Why antagonize them? That is what the Government, especially the JVP who think that the world is inside Sri Lanka, is doing. That is the problem they

* . . Placed in the Library.

2007 10 1321 1322

have. That is why they are unable to remove these plugs, Hon. Minister. So, on that score, please ensure that such asinine statements do not put your Government into jeopardy. Furthermore, when they put your Government into jeopardy we, the- Government-in-waiting, would be the inheritors of such stupid asinine statements that are coming forward. They are the people who are oxygenizing you for the simple reason of bringing hatred into the system. They always find a problem, dance around it, but do not solve it. That is the problem we have. So on that particular score, all we want you to do is ensure that we take the international economy into strength. That is where we survive. If we lose the economic war, we lose all wars. All we can say is, ensure that the shipping industry which was a thriving industry moves forward. My political guru, the late Hon. Lalith Athulath Mudali who revamped the shipping industry ensured it came from the 126th to the 25th position in the world. The Hon. Rauff Hakeem also made an input and brought it to the 12th position in the world. I do not think we need to get back into the old ages. But as regards shipping, we are in between Singapore and Jebel Ali in Dubai, which is competing aggressively. Meanwhile the hub port status, with containers coming from India to Sri Lanka, is being threatened with self-development of their own ports. So, on that score we have to very prudently and judiciously handle this particular situation. All I say is, please ensure

that we invite the Indians into this country; ensure that they become partners in progress and ensure that we reduce the competition with India and protect the shipping industry of Sri Lanka by working with India rather than invite the Chinese and create competition among the Chinese and the Indians and we, small fries getting caught in a whirlwind war that is going on between them.

So, Hon. Minister, while the corruption seems to be evident, self-explanatory and there does not seem to be any corrective action being taken, we have brought this Debate before you to ensure that you provide the answer which is required. If you do not, as the Hon. John Amaratunga said, we will not be bound to hold on to such corrupt decisions that have been taken. We are saying this because we love our Mother Lanka. We have seen many corrupt activities going on. Take Mihin Air, Hon. Minister. You must look into what is going on. You have started a noble deed which we can see but it is the corrupt officers who are running it. They are absolutely corrupt. They are ruining you and we will name them before too long. But see that you correct these things and move forward. Ensure that at the next Debate we thank you for realizing that what we said is correct; you have corrected those things and given it to the correct people.

Thank you.

( ) (The Presiding Member) .

[.. 11.29] ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem-Minister of Posts and Telecommunication) Mr. Presiding Member, the Hon. John Amaratunga has proposed to have this Adjournment Debate and in proposing the Adjournment Debate this morning he was not specific as to the issues that the so-called bidders have taken objection to. I too noticed only this morning when I came to the House that the normal Business which was in the Order Paper was, by agreement, to be put off and instead this Adjournment Debate was to be taken up to debate this particular issue. Hon. Presiding Member, I would at the very outset like to raise a procedural issue which I believe I shared with the Hon. Minister himself. He too is not quite sure as to what happened. In fact he has instructed his officials to come. None of the SLPA officials are in the Officials' Box. That has certainly - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Presiding Member, the Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. John Amaratunga was to be taken up at 12 o'clock. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I know. But the Hon. Minister is not to be faulted. The officials have not come. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You are only bringing forward - ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) This hampers us, the Government speakers, because we have to be advised by them as to the current position. In any event, since I have been a former Minister of the subject I would be able to throw some light on certain issues that the Hon. Members have brought up. Particularly in relation to the complaint by the Hon. John Amaratunga of twisting the tender requirements and favouring particular parties, if I remember correct, what I

saw in the newspapers was that in the original Request for Proposal, with regard to the turnover of the companies involved, there were no stipulations that the turnover should be from port and shipping business. However, at present, there is an attempt to exclude some of the bidders on the basis that the turnover should be from port and shipping business. This is an issue, I am sure the Hon. Minister would be able to clarify but however, be that as it may, what is important for us to realize is that the Colombo South Port Development Project is a project which we cannot delay. Whatever happens this project has to start in the immediate future. A lot of valuable work has been put into this. There had been considerable time spent on getting a multilateral agency, a funding agency to come in and invest in the breakwater. Of course that comes as a loan. The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake tried to make out that the Asian Development Bank which has come forward to fund the breakwater should be convinced that the Sri Lanka Ports Authority would have the capacity to pay this massive loan. I can tell you, Sir, as a former Minister in charge of the subject that the Sri Lanka Ports Authority is certainly in a position to pay back whatever investment that would be made in building the Colombo South Port. In my opinion, what needs to be done is to increase the efficiency to do proper marketing and if all that is done, our capacity to generate the type of income that would be required to pay back any large loan will certainly not be a problem.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The present loans obtained hitherto by the SLPA are commercial loans at the rate of 1 to 1 1/2 per cent interest. Now you are going on the basis that these loans are on 4 to 5 per cent interest. So on that basis, will you be able to pay back ? You are unable to pay at the moment with the port charges being the highest in this region.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Even our Government was negotiating with the ADB. You cannot find fault with this Government for having gone to the ADB because the ADB was particularly interested - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, we are in no way saying that this port should not be built. What we are saying is that it should be built, but corruption need not be built in the process. That is all we are saying. The UNP is not opposing to it at all.

1327 1328

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I believe, in building the Colombo South Port there must be a bipartisan agreement between the two major parties in this country because this is something - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Without corruption - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Regarding the issue of corruption, some of the parties have gone before the Bribery Commission and now you have raised this issue in the House to see that you bring - ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) The public has gone before the Bribery Commission. They can see the corruption that is taking place. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) That is a different issue - [Interruption.] Hon. Member, at least you were good enough to concede that the Hon. Minister is innocent -[Interruption.] He has taken over the job. He is trying to do a good job. I am sure he will look into the allegations that you have brought about. But I am on a much bigger issue. That is the issue of the need for the Colombo South Port.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) That is common ground. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes. That is common ground. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) But the ADB has laid down a condition that if this is going to be a corrupt deal they will not be responsible for the loan itself. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No. I am not aware whether the ADB has said so. Naturally any multilateral agency which puts in money into such a big infrastructure project such as the

breakwater for the Colombo South Port would be concerned if there are allegations. But the UNP must also be responsible and should not just throw punches in the dark - [Interruption.] No, throwing your challenges saying that we will not pay back these loans -[Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Definitely - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) These are futile attempts. Several governments in the past have said so, but none of those things have ever materialized. When the Government enters into an agreement, that agreement has to be honoured. This is a democratically elected Government. Of course the issues of corruption and all that you can discuss. You can shout from the rooftops till the cows come home. That certainly we agree. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Are you condoning now? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No. I am not condoning. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) We are trying to put the record straight. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) But here the issue is, you are threatening multilateral agencies, bilateral governments and saying, "Do not fund this, do not lend money"-[Interruption.] These are empty punches. This will never happen. What I am saying is, you are trying to discourage this Government going ahead with development projects. Do you agree that the Colombo South Port has to be built ? ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) So, if we do not build the Colombo South Port within the next few years we are going to be overtaken by other ports in the region and our main income is going to be by

2007 10 1329 1330

5 PL 002410 (2007/08)

way of transshipment of cargo. All of us know that. We do not have enough domestic cargo to keep the port running and of course we have to pay back large loans. We have heavy commitments. We have a very heavy commitment towards the JBIC which has to be paid back.

In the meantime, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake spoke about the SAGT and the JCT competition. As Ministers, we have to look at it from a holistic point of view. It is the Port of Colombo. There is a privately-run terminal and there is a Government-run terminal. When I was the Minister in charge of the subject, I saw to it that the SAGT did not try and take away volume from us by adopting proper market policies where we enter into competition. We enhanced our capacity to do proper marketing with the shipping lines. What we did was we started going into - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) There were allegations of corruption even in that deal - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) In what? - [Interruption.] In which deal ?

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) The SAGT deal.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) The SAGT deal is a different issue. You had a massive debate where a former Minister, the late Hon. Ashraff was concerned. He was the Minister in charge of the subject during that time. I think you went to the extent of bringing a No-Confidence Motion against him on the Galle Port issue .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The Galle Port had nothing to do with the SAGT.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) That is right. Later, on the SAGT you had a massive controversy that came about. But then what I am trying to say is -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) If you look at Hansard, every single thing that was quoted about the SAGT then, was told by us. What we told has come to pass. If you look at those and todays accusations they are absolutely the same. All we are saying is, do not come back in five years and say that we told this was corrupt.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) The Hon. Minister will look into those issues. Your concerns will be addressed in his reply. What I am trying to say here is that as an alternate government, the United National Party has to look at it with a view to see that in any event this project must be done in the closest possible time frame so that we will not be lagging behind. ( ) (An Hon. Member) We are late. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) We are already late and part of the blame has to be accepted by every previous administration because they knew that this was coming, this has to be done on time and we have been delaying it. There have been many debates on the issue. But on coming to the issue relating to the SAGT and the JCT, I would urge the Minister to work towards in getting the JCT to be more efficient. Right now the turn-around time for vessels has to be increased. Our handling capacity is still there. We anticipated that our capacity in the entire port of Colombo should be increased to about 3.5 million TEU's for a year before 2008. But we are already knocking on the doors of 2008. Next year would be 2008. But then in the meantime several delays have occurred. We have been hampered by difficulties in persuading parties to come in and build the breakwater. Finally a commitment has been made by the Asian Development Bank to build the breakwater and that is certainly an issue regarding which the Government must be complimented. There again the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake has brought about some allegations on certain misgivings about the way in which those tenders are to be awarded. I believe the Hon. Minister has not been given sufficient notice of that matter being taken up. The matter that has been taken up is this. But however, the Minister within the limited time available should be able to reply to that. On top of it, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake also dragged in the issue of the Hambantota Port Project being handed over to a Chinese Consortium and bringing in political issues said that the Indians are going to be offended and wanted to know why we are awarding the Hambantota

1331 1332

[ ]

Port Project to a Chinese Consortium. In my opinion, the Hambantota Port Project is a promise that the United National Party also gave every time but never did. After all, this has to be done to satisfy the people of not only that district but all the districts adjoining Hambantota which certainly could benefit from a transshipment port, if it could be built. When I was the Minister in charge of the subject, there had been several requests from the Members of Parliament from the South who wanted both Galle and Hambantota ports to be built. There were differences of opinion among the shipping experts as to whether we could have a second transshipment port in a small country such as ours with lack of infrastructure facilities. For the Hambantota Port to be successful, we have to improve the infrastructure in the hinterland that would facilitate a future transshipment port. In any event, Colombo has already been built and has the capacity and certainly has the other industries spread around the Western Province. As you all know, all our industries are concentrated in the Western Province, all the service providers and all the logistics-related companies are centred in and around Colombo and its suburbs. That being the case, for us to try and develop Hambantota into a container port within a short time frame would be a difficult exercise and that is the realization that everybody has. I think we must go step by step, initially start an industrial port and perhaps graduate into a final transshipment port. In any event, the fact that the Hambantota Port project is finally to be built is something that all of us must welcome since it is going to help the entire area. It is in that context that the Minister, the late Hon. Ashraff thought about the Oluvil Port. I must thank the Hon. Minister for having listened to some of our concerns about the delay in building the Oluvil Port and certain issues relating to compensation for fishermen and the landowners. He summoned a meeting yesterday and was good enough to resolve some of the outstanding issues. I must thank the Hon. Minister for having agreed to arrange that meeting, bring all the officials here and listen to the complaints by the fishermen as well as the landowners and taking speedy action to resolve them. In the meantime, what we must bear in mind is that in the region there is heavy competition coming about. India is developing transshipment ports in a variety of different locations and particularly the Navashiva Port is being developed at a hectic pace. The biggest advantage we have is that the Indian subcontinent with a large amount of export cargo has still not grown up to containerize them sufficiently. Most of their cargo is not properly containerized and therefore we have an advantage. That advantage has to be exploited. The Port of Colombo has been carefully planning its expansion programmes and every successive Government has been somewhat inhibited by difficulties in persuading donor agencies to come in and look at the feasibility of the Colombo South

Port, particularly the issue relating to the breakwater. The breakwater issue has now been settled and now it is this issue relating to bids being called for building the terminal which has become another controversy. In my opinion, what we must be proud about is that several blue- chip companies in Sri Lanka have come forward to team up with internationally reputed shipping companies as well as terminal operators to bid for building these terminals in the Colombo South Port which is an indication of the confidence that our business community has in the port expansion project in the Colombo South Port.

Therefore, that is a factor that we must always bear in mind. But certainly the issue pertaining to the Request for Proposal and the conditions being interpreted in a particular way to favour any group is something that we should not support. In my opinion, it must be a level playing field for anybody to be seen and they must be assessed for their strength. If the original Request for Proposal did not stipulate that the turnover of the bidders should be indicated from the shipping and port business alone and now trying to say that they cannot bring in their entire group turnover but only the port and shipping business turnover, that I believe is a very unfair way of evaluating the proposals that have been put forward. That I would say any fair-minded person should be concerned about. Even during the time that I was the Minister in charge of the subject, there had been several such issues where interested parties had tried to purposely manipulate the evaluation process by getting hold of officials. That was something I had always been very careful about and had been preventing.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Is it correct for the Chairman to be a Member of the Technical Evaluation Committee?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I do not think there is anything wrong in a person who is knowledgeable on the subject being there. In TECs there must be experts who should be involved. But when evaluating the original Request for Proposal, there is nothing wrong for the Chairman of the entity to be involved. But then the basis of the selection process should be a very transparent one. It should abide by the original conditions that have been stipulated in the Request for Proposal. That is something I would certainly say that any fair-minded person should be concerned about.

Be that as it may, we must also look at another critical issue since the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake spoke about the concerns of India and China. Certainly, as a nation we must be concerned about the Sethusamudram Project.

2007 10 1333 1334

This is something that I have not previously spoken in this House, but the Minister in charge of shipping - the Hon. Foreign Minister is here - and his Ministry is certainly studying the issue. I saw an Interim Report that has been tabled. We have got a copy of that. In any event, I believe the Indian Government is keen to go ahead with that and there is immense pressure from the Southern States, particularly Tamil Nadu because the Minister at the Central Government in charge of the subject of shipping is from Tamil Nadu, Mr. T. R. Balu. He is a good friend of mine. I have met him several times in Delhi. For the DMK, it is a pet project. Like how the Hambantota Project is a pet project for His Excellency the President, this has been a pet project of Mr. Karunanidhi. However it may be, issues of environmental concerns for our country is immense and this is an issue that we just cannot allow to pass. We must look at it with our nations interest in view and these issues have to be discussed with the Indian parties. There has been a variety of allegations, a variety of articles in our newspapers regarding the issue where some of these concerns are not being addressed in a proper manner. The environmental impact assessment of the project is being done in a fashion so as to totally overlook some salient factors which should be taken into account. I am sure the Hon. Minister and his Ministry officials are very keenly following up the progress on this issue. I must say, the late Minister, the Hon. Kadirgamar was a keen advocate of this concept of discussing with the Indians our concerns and to see that this joint committee is appointed to go into this issue and I am sure the Foreign Ministry must be co-opting the necessary expertise from the SLPA to look ainto our concerns relating to the shipping industry here. The fact is that the -

( )

( - ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama - Minister of Foreign Affairs) If I may intervene with the permission of the Hon. Minister, currently the Foreign Ministry - [Interruption] - Committee and other line ministries are also trying to look into the environmental impact, as correctly stated by the Hon. Minister and also other issues connected therewith including the Palk Strait, marine deposits, the marine life and all other connected and incidental areas of concern. So, we have gone into this in a very exhaustive and comprehensive manner. That is what I wish to state to the House.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Thank you, Hon. Minister. The issue for the shipping industry is the draught that is to be dug in the Palk Strait to enable the vessels to pass through the Palk Strait from the West to the East and East to the West.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) They are already digging. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) They have started but the problem is - ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . .

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) A consultation process and there are so many interim discussions that are going on.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . ? . . ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I do not think we should blame the Government. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . . , . They are already digging. So, do not mislead us. We are not fools. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I am not misleading anybody. I only raised the issue.

1335 1336

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . . . It was over a year ago that they started digging. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) . . - [ ] . . . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) - consultation, committee, dialogue. - [ ] ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) I thought by now our honourable Member is mature enough to understand the Parliamentary language. In that context, may I advise the Hon. Member that we have been having regular consultations with the Indian authorities and with due respect, the Indian authorities are also mindful of certain concerns that have been expressed by Sri Lanka and that of the environmental and green groups in the world. At the same time, they also have started the project and they have also stalled the project - [Interruption.] . . . environment . . . [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Presiding Member, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella has got very excited about the digging aspect of it. As the Hon. Minister explained the issue pertaining to ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) They come and say untruths to this House. We cannot just wait - ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Unfortunately, we did not see the United National Party administration during this period. I do not think even if the UNP was in power they could have prevented the Indians from digging.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . . ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, no. They are digging in their maritime boundary. What can we do? It is their maritime boundary. In their continental shelf and maritime boundary if they did anything what can this Government do? ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . . ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Are you suggesting that we must go before an international court? ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , territorial waters . .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Tell us. Where do we go, then? Are you suggesting that we must go before an international court?

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , . . . . . ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) I wonder whether the Hon. Member is aware when this project was initiated by the - [Interruption.] Let us have a discussion on this in an exhaustive manner rather than coming with bits and pieces here and there. Knowing little is dangerous.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I think we will put this issue to rest with that.

2007 10 1337 1338

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) You cannot resist because the Sethusamudram is a live project.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) We will put this issue to rest with that assurance by the Hon. Minister that he is prepared to discuss this if at all rather than exchanging brickbats and bouquets across the isle here on a very sensitive issue such as this. As you know India is our largest neighbour and our relations have been very good. We do not have to jeopardize our relations by saying things off the cuff in the House. I think this is a matter that we must discuss in a responsible forum with the Members of the Opposition and the Ministry officials. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) , .

( ) (The Presiding Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) , . The shipping concerns as a result of the Sethusamudram Project is about the feeder vessels that come to the Port of Colombo. There is a fear that feeder vessels that now come to Colombo from the East coast of India would be easily diverted to the West coast of India and that we will lose all the container cargo we right now have from the Indian sub continent. That is a very serious issue since Indian economy is growing at such a rate that the immense potential of that growth could be exploited by the Port of Colombo to increase its turnover and this is the concern regarding the construction of the Sethusamudram Project. But the environment issue is an entirely different matter. I believe that there is also some minor, or quite an opposition from the Bharathiya Janata Party and some politicians bringing the Ramar Bridge issue into focus and blaming the Indian Central Government for having permitted that project. That is altogether a different issue where we agreed that we put it to rest and discuss it at a much more responsible forum since it is a very sensitive issue. But apart from that, let me also emphasize here the need for the Sri Lanka Ports

Authoritys premier container terminal, the Jaye Container Terminal, to be managed properly to give proper competition to South Asian Gateway Terminal. That being a privately managed terminal, we believe that the efficiency at the JCT will have to be carefully monitored so that we could give proper competition as we did in the recent past. There were certain attempts, as in the past, to grab our own container volumes by resorting to various methods in which they would be able to do aggressive marketing in order to divert the vessels that should normally call at the Port of Colombo. There was an attempt by the SLPA during the time I was in charge of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority to enter into exclusive Terminal Service Agreements with various shipping lines which enabled us to give some attractive packages to various carriers to exclusively use the Jaye Container Terminal. This must be aggressively pursued and a proper marketing team must be established to cater to the approaching shipping agencies in order to see that our volumes are not grabbed by the South Asia Gateway Terminals. I am glad that a variety of premier blue-chip companies have come forward to team up with various shipping companies as well as terminal operators to bid for the building of the new terminal in the Colombo South Port. That being the case, there is an endorsement by our own business community in the way in which the Colombo Port is being run and its potential to increase its value in the coming years. Our status as a hub port is something that we have been very zealously guarding and during the previous administrations we were able to bring about a shipping policy, a policy document which spells out the way in which we should develop the ports in Sri Lanka. There had been a variety of suggestions by important experts. That policy document must be taken as a guideline to develop a coherent and cohesive shipping policy for our country. With those words, Hon. Presiding Member, let me once again thank the Hon. Minister for agreeing to expedite the construction of the Oluvil Port, which is a long-felt need and for which a lot of work has gone into. The Hon. Minister was good enough to listen to all our grievances, agree to resolve them in the speediest possible time frame and see that that project becomes a reality at least by the end of this year. Thank you very much, Mr. Presiding Member.
