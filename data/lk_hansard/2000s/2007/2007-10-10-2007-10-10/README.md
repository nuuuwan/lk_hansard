Deleting Section 81 in its entirety would certainly have some adverse international repercussions. However, the ambiguity as to the possibility of extending of such agreements after the Act coming into force could be avoided in two different ways.

Then he says how it could be done. 1.1 By making it clear in the same provision that the type of agreements could remain in force only until the period of validity of the applicable agreement on the day on which the Act comes into force.

1.2 The Minister may by Order published in the Gazette specify the agreements to which the Act would not apply, the period of validity of such agreements and also the day from which the Act should begin to apply in respect of such agreements as well , . . . . , , , - [ ] . . [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) No, it cannot be taken up for discussion now.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I am on a point of Order.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) We have presented the Appropriation Bill.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I will refer to the Constitution of Sri Lanka. Article 4 of the Constitution states, I quote: 4. The Sovereignty of the People shall be exercised and enjoyed in the following manner:- (a) the legislative power of the People shall be exercised by Parliament, .

Article 148 of the Constitution states that Parliament shall have full control over public finance. I will quote Article 148 which states:

148. Parliament shall have full control over public finance. No tax, rate or any other levy shall be imposed by any local authority or any other public authority, except by or under the authority of a law passed by Parliament or of any existing law.

Sir, as you know, Article 149 states about the Consolidated Fund and Article 151 states about the Contingencies Fund. According to Article 149 all funds must be routed through the Consolidated Fund. Therefore, introduction of such a clause takes the entire control of public finance away from Parliament and bestows it on the Secretary to the Treasury who has no right to interfere in the Business of Parliament. This goes against the grain of Article 84(1) of the the Constitution. If I may quote Article 84(1), it states:

84. (1) A Bill which is not for the amendment of any provision of the Constitution or for the repeal and replacement of the Constitution, but which is inconsistent with any provision of the Constitution may be placed on the Order Paper of Parliament without complying with the requirements of paragraph (1) or paragraph (2) of Article 82.

So, here, Sir, without amendments being made the Hon. Minister has subtly brought the same provision under Clause 6 which is basically repugnant to the Constitution.

Madam, the Government of Sri Lanka attaches the highest priority to the promotion, protection and preservation of human rights of all its citizens. While at

the domestic level, constitutional safeguards and enforcement procedures ensure the due observance of the fundamental rights of citizens, at the international level, Sri Lanka has voluntarily undertaken a range of international legal obligations as a State Party to the key international human rights instruments, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ICCPR, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, ICESCR and the UN Convention against Torture. As His Excellency the President highlighted during his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, human rights have been an essential part of our great cultural tradition for millennia. It is therefore nothing new for us to protect Human Rights. Guided by the principles of Buddhism we have long respected the rights of our fellow human beings. Therefore, it had not been necessary for us to experience global wars or the deaths of millions to learn to recognize their values. Most of the obligations undertaken by virtue of subscribing to these international legal instruments have, by and large, been given legislative recognition in the Constitution of Sri Lanka, as well as in certain other legislation enacted by Parliament from time to time by successive Governments. Madam, let me also state that the present Government continues to implement a policy of open and constructive engagement with UN human rights bodies. By virtue of our international commitments, we have granted access to UN and other recognized international human rights bodies, as well as other UN human rights experts to visit Sri Lanka, in the pursuit of a policy of transparency and open engagement with the United Nations and its relevant bodies. The Government is also pursuing every possibility to ensure the strengthening of national institutions and mechanisms for the promotion and protection of human rights, so that they carry out the tasks imposed on these institutions more effectively and efficiently. In this connection it must be mentioned that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has taken the initiative and constituted an Inter-Ministerial Co-ordinating Committee, which meets weekly, to review the status of inquiries into alleged complaints relating to human rights violations and the progress made through this mechanism has helped in making more transparent to the public and the international community, Sri Lankas proactive stand taken to address alleged violations of human rights. What must be appreciated is that the Government is continuing to take these measures in an extremely difficult environment, in the background of a terrorist campaign unleashed by the LTTE. However, the Government will not abdicate its responsibilities as a responsible democratically elected Government, in discharging its obligations towards its citizens in the promotion and protection of human rights.

987 988

[ ] Madam, let me remind the House at this moment that Sri Lanka subscribed to the ICCPR on 11th June, 1980. However, no comprehensive legislation had been presented at that time to incorporate the obligations under the Covenant into the domestic law of Sri Lanka, although a substantial part of the civil and political rights referred to in the Covenant have been given legislative recognition in the Constitution, as well as in certain other legislations enacted by Parliament. It was not long ago that the Supreme Court observed in its judgment in the "Singarasa Case", Supreme Court Case No. 182/99 that I cited earlier, which states, I quote: The accession to the Covenant binds the Republic qua state, but no legislative or other measures have been taken to give effect to the rights recognized in the Covenant as envisaged in Article 2. Hence the Covenant does not have internal effect and the rights under the Covenant are not rights under the law of Sri Lanka. In these circumstances, the Government considered it vital to enact appropriate legislation to give effect to those civil and political rights referred to in the Covenant for which no adequate legislative recognition has yet been granted, which would give full effect to our obligations as a State Party to the ICCPR and would be in compliance with the Supreme Court judgment. Madam, let me explain to this House very directly the salient provisions of the Bill which I am presenting today. As mentioned a while ago, the Bill sets out the substantive rights in the ICCPR which require legislative recognition in Clauses 2 to 6 of the Bill. Clause 2 deals with the right to be recognized as a person before the law. Clause 3 deals with non-propagation of war or advocating national, racial or religious hatred. Clause 4 covers entitlement of an alleged offender charged of a criminal offence. Clause 5 deals with the rights of a child. Clause 6 deals with the right of access to benefits provided by the State. Clause 7 deals with High Court jurisdiction over the enforcement of the human rights which a person is entitled to under Sections 2, 4, 5 and 6 of the Act. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) We get all these in the Covenant. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) No, no. I will give you the Covenant. Do you want it? Can I finish my speech? Why do you not listen to my speech? ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Okay.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Thank you. In this regard in terms of the Supreme Court Determination we are also moving certain amendments to Clause 6 and also to Clause 7 which I will propose at the appropriate time in relation to the effectiveness of the legislation that we are now discussing. ( ) (The Presiding Member) .

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) 10 . 30 . This Section also spells out the procedure by which a person who alleges that any of the rights set out under the Bill are infringed or is about to be infringed, could invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court. Such jurisdiction could be invoked by the aggrieved person himself or through any other person on his behalf within three months of the alleged infringement or imminent infringement. The High Court is also granted the power where it considers appropriate, at any stage of the proceedings, to refer such matters to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka for inquiry, report and request the Commission to submit its report to the High Court within such time as shall be stipulated by the Court. Madam Chairperson, when the matter was referred to the Supreme Court under Article 122 of the Constitution as an urgent Bill in the national interest, the Supreme Court proposed certain amendments in order to avoid any inconsistency with the Constitution. These amendments will be moved at the Committee Stage of the Bill. These include the term public affairs in Clause 6 (a) in the proposed Bill, to be given a specific interpretation to ensure that there would be no interference into the conduct of statutory functionaries; Then the other amendment is as proposed by the determination of the Supreme Court. That is Clause 7 of the Bill to be amended to provide an aggrieved person with a right of appeal against any order of the High Court with regard to the exercise of its jurisdiction under the Act; The next amendment is an amendment to clarify that the jurisdiction of the High Court is limited to adjudicate residual rights that are not within the limit of Chapter III and IV of the Constitution, in respect of which the sole and exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Supreme Court under Article 126 of the Constitution.

2007 10 989 990

Thereby, Madam Chairperson, you will see that we are bringing in this comprehensive piece of legislation to address both the lacuna in our legal provisions in relation to the human rights jurisdiction of the country and to empower a more effective and more positive regime to prevail in human rights doctrine in Sri Lanka. That is the fundamental and foremost responsibility of any Government. Our Government has taken the initiative. That is what is interesting. After 1980, though the United National Party Government quite rightly at that time subscribed to this Convention, there was not enough teeth within the legislative system and the laws to address the fundamental core issues that have been affecting the people of our country. That is why we have brought this piece of legislation. If I may respond to my learned good Friend, the Hon. John Amaratunga who raised the question as to whether we had covered the entirety of the Convention and in terms of that whether this legislation is exhaustive vis-a-vis to that of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights, the answer to that is very simple. We have covered every aspect that is absolutely essential to the needs of our society through this proposed Bill that I am presenting to the House. We have also - [Interruption.] Let me finish. We have also addressed the current legislative provisions that are available both in the Constitution of our country which cover a major area of the fundamental rights of our people and also the other safeguards of our society in every respect where our personal laws are not giving effect to certain areas and also, where the Covenant is not in conflict with the existing personal laws in our country. Thereby, we have kept certain provisions out of the Bill. If I may give a detailed account so that we do not have to labour on this, in terms of the Covenant, Article 1 we have left out because it is not relevant in todays context. It is a right of self-determination and is a matter that concerns countries which are colonized States and not independent countries. We have left that provision out because it is irrelevant in terms of today's needs of Sri Lanka. We are no longer a Colonial State and thereby it does not apply. We have covered Article 2 by the Constitution of Sri Lanka. Articles 3 to 5 have been covered by this provision. Article 6 (1) has been left out because it is a judicial interpretation and thereby Article 6(1) and 6 (4) have been separately addressed. Those are matters covering the Geneva Convention and covers the crime of genocide and various other provisions which have been already built into the Constitution in terms of Article 13 (4) of the Constitution. Article 7 is covered by Article 11 of the Constitution. Article 8 is not relevant. Article 9 is covered by Article 11 of the Constitution. Article 10 is covered by Clause 2 of this very Bill. Article 11 comes into conflict with Section 278 of the Civil Procedure Code and therefore we have left it. We have not covered that.

In regard to Article 12, most of it is covered under Articles 13 and 14 of the Constitution. Article 13 is not applicable. Article 14 is covered by Article 12 of the Constitution. Article 15 is covered by Article 13 (6) of the Constitution. Article 16 is covered by Clause 2 of the Bill. Article 17 is not covered as it would exceed the restrictions permitted by Article 15 (7) of the Constitution. Article 18 is covered by Article 10 of the Constitution. Article 19 is covered by Article 14 of the Constitution. Article 20 is covered by the Bill. Article 21 is covered by Article 14 of the Constitution. Article 22 is covered by Article 14 of the Constitution. Article 23 is not covered because personal laws of Sri Lanka are in conflict, which we have addressed very carefully. Article 24 is covered by Clause 5 of the very Bill that I am presenting to the House. Article 25 and the rest are covered by local legislation and the Constitution of our country. So thereby as I stated before we have addressed in a very comprehensive manner, matters that were not covered sufficiently, bringing us in line and synchronizing Sri Lankas legal framework in the protection and upholding of human rights of our people with that of the Covenant and also with the international regimes that are more acceptable for a greater degree of empowerment of our civil society. Thereby, I take the privilege of commending this Bill to the House and I thank Madam Chairperson for the opportunity I had to present a Bill that was much needed to strengthen our legislative framework in addressing the human rights regime of our country. , . . 27 , , 2007 , , . ,- [ ]

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) What is this great hurry - ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) That is also very important. If I trace the history of this, there was a Supreme Court decision - virtually the Sinharasa Case was in 1999, eight years ago. We have been silent on this for eight years. This is the need for the hurry. I proposed this in June this year in consultation with my Colleagues who are responsible to promote trade in Sri Lanka, who are now trying to fit into the regimes

9991 992

[ ] that are governing the trade policies of the world like the GSP Plus schemes that are benefiting Sri Lanka immensely both in the European Union and the rest of the world. My Colleague and Minister, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris will articulate on some of the effects that we are going to generate out of this because now we are going to get synchronized with the international regime associated with the human rights governance in the world and of Sri Lanka. And therefore, - ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) We can refer this to a Standing Committee. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) What is the need for a Standing Committee ? Now you can submit yourself to this. This is something that your own Government brought in. In 1980 we all subscribed to it. So what is the big need for us to go further into it? This is a very simple area, the rights of our people. Are we going to restrict the rights of our people, the human rights of our people? The major clamour today is to address the human rights of the people. So I am commending this Bill to the House and let us have an interesting debate.

( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Madam Chairperson, we are debating today a Bill which purports to give effect to certain Articles in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights relating to human rights which have not been given recognition through legislative measures and to provide for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. I might commence my submissions by stating that we acceded to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on the 11th of June, 1980 which was more than 27 years ago and we seem to have awakened from a deep slumber and we are today for the first time introducing domestic legislation which recognizes our accession to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in order to give effect to such accession. The Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs in the course of his speech referred to the Singarasa Case and stated that the Supreme Court had held in the Singarasa Case that there was no domestic legislation which enabled the recognition of Sri Lankas accession to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. If I remember correctly, to the best of my memory, the Singarasa Case was determined one year ago. I think it was in September or October, 2006 and one year has - . . ( ) ( .. - , ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of Export Development and International Trade) It was on 15th of September, 2006. .

( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris says it was on 15th of September, 2006. I am thankful to him. My memory was not far too wrong when I said September or October, 2006. That was one year ago and you are now bringing a Bill as a Bill of urgent public importance in October, 2007 and coincidentally and quite strangely this Bill comes up in Parliament on the very day that the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is present in this country which I think says quite a lot beyond that. I get the impression when I read the Bill that recognition is not granted under this law to the totality of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I would have thought that if you were wanting to give recognition to your accession to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, you would say that very frankly, unambiguously without being vague in regard to that matter. But what you are doing is, instead of being unambiguous, very clear and definite in regard to the legislation you are enacting to give effect to the accession by you to the

Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, one gets the impression that the Government is beating around the bush and is playing hide and seek by stating that already some parts of the Covenant to which you have acceded have been given recognition to and given effect to by certain provisions in the Constitution, and by other legislations which have not been specified in your Bill, you are therefore confining your present Bill to certain aspects of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. What are these aspects that you are talking about? Clause 2 states, I quote: Every person shall have the right to recognition as a person before the law. Then Clause 3(1), states, I quote: No person shall propagate war or advocate national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence. I will speak about that a little more in detail as I go on. Then, the rest of the clauses deal with the offences pertaining to that offence. Then, you talk about the childs rights in Clause 5 and you talk about the right of access to benefits provided to a citizen in Clause 6. These are the only three matters that have been referred to in this Bill. Nothing else. The Optional Protocol is not referred to in this Bill; and in this Bill if you are not playing hide and seek, not beating around the bush, you should have unreservedly stated that you are passing a law to recognize your accession to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and give effect to that accession. I am sorry to state that instead of being upfront, instead of being patently honest and instead of being quite candid about what you want to do, you are being very oblivious, you are being very deceptive, you are being quite duplicitous and leaving this whole question again in a state of suspense. I am not very sure that when the Supreme Court is called upon to interpret this law which you are passing today, the Supreme Court will conclude that by virtue of this law the Sri Lankan State has given adequate recognition and created the opportunity for your accession to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to be given effect to. I am inclined to the view that the Supreme Court may well take the view that the law has been so badly drafted; that the law is so dubious in its content, that the law lacks candour, that the law lacks an honest commitment on the part of the Sri Lankan State to an unquestioned acceptance of your obligations under your accession to the International Covenant and the Court may still strike down the provisions of this Bill or refuse relief to someone who seeks relief under this Bill. That seems to be the position. One gets the impression, Sir, that what the Sri Lankan State is trying to do is to claim the benefits of having acceded to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and at the same time avoids the responsibilities that must inevitably flow from such accession. That is why I said, Sir, you are playing hide and seek, you are beating around the bush, you are not coming upfront with an honest,

2007 10 1001 1002

unambiguous commitment in regard to your accession to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. That is why your Bill is very poorly drafted. That is why your Bill does not contain in an unambiguous way a clear commitment to accession to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Having said that, Sir, in regard to the Bill itself, I wish to refer to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I refer to Part I, Article 1(1) of that Covenant which states, I quote: All people have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development. Sir, Part I, Article 1(2) states, I quote: All people may, for their own ends, freely dispose of their natural wealth and resources without prejudice to any obligations arising out of international economic co-operation, based upon the principle of mutual benefit, and international law. In no case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence. Part I, Article 1(3) states, I quote: The States Parties to the present Covenant, including those having responsibility for the administration of on-Self-Governing and Trust Territories, shall promote the realization of the right of self-determination, and shall respect that right,

( ) (The Presiding Member) . . . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I propose that the Hon. Jinadasa Kitulagoda do take the Chair. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . . Seconded. , . . Question put, and agreed to. .

, () . Whereupon THE HON. (MRS.) AMARA PIYASEELI RATNAYAKE left the Chair, and THE HON. JINADASA KITULAGODA took the Chair.

( ) (The Presiding Member) . . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member. I will read from Part I, Article 1(3) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, again. The States Parties to the present Covenant, including those having responsibility for the administration of Non-Self-Governing and Trust Territories, shall promote the realization of the right of self-determination, and shall respect that right, in conformity with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations. Sir, as a matter of fact, I might even say that Part I, Article 1(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights once again refers to the right of self-determination. It states, I quote: All people have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development. The right of self-determination, Sir, in the course of time, over the past several decades has been seriously addressed by the United Nations and the international community. And, there has been a body of international opinion which has centred around and grown around this concept of the right of self-determination and today we have come to recognize that the right of self-determination encompasses both the right to internal self-determination and the right to external self-determination. The right to internal self-determination would mean that the people with the distinct identity within a country are entitled within the framework of that united country to exercise the right to internal self-determination. They have a right to make a determination in regard to their political destiny, their political status within the framework of a united undivided country. The right to external self-determination would mean that a distinct people would in certain circumstances have the right to secession; not to be a part of that State but to exercise their own sovereignty. This is the current international thinking on this question. The Hon. (Prof). G.L. Peirs is here.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) If you can hear me, I will give you a small clarification which is vital on the lines in which you are trying to pursue your arguments. Otherwise it will be misread in terms of the context in which we are bringing in this legislation and what the UN Convention governs in terms of the right of self-determination because that is something that we have to read in line with what we have presented in the House along with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that we are now

1003 1004

[ ] addressing, and the right of self-determination that you are speaking of is not covered under Article 1. This is something that we provided for at that time in relation to decolonization process. That was addressed by the UN for a lot of States that were colonized at that time. I may bring it to your kind notice. The UN Resolution states, I quote: It is a right which was recognized in the context of decolonization. No group could exercise the right of self determination in a way that would dismember or impair, totally or in part, the territorial integrity or political unity of sovereign and independent states (GA Resolution 2625 (XXV), Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the UN 1970). Also, no human rights body entertains communication regarding this right. So that is the position of the United Nations. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I think, Sir, if the Hon. Minister had followed my submissions, he would have realized that when I made my submissions, I developed on the concept of self-determination and said that the concept of self-determination had grown over a period of several decades and today in the international context there was a right to internal self-determination which meant that people within a country with a distinct identity could have exercised the right to internal self-determination and there was also the right to external self-determination which meant secession, [Interruption.] - please let me finish - which as the Minister quite rightly pointed out, is available according to the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in the case pertaining to Quebec in three distinct situations. Firstly, in regard to colonies, in regard to colonial rule where the people are under colonial subjugation. Secondly, where the people are subjected to alien military rule, where an alien military force has captured a country or a territory and is controlling those people under such alien military rule. Thirdly, where the people have consistently and persistently demanded the right to internal self-determination within a united country and where the people have been denied that right consistently. Then the question arises as to whether in that context those people by virtue of such denial would not be entitled to the right to external self-determination. Sir, I am not for a moment saying that what is stated in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is applicable and means internal self-determination that would mean external self-determination. But, I am saying definitely that the concept has grown, the concept has developed and today in international fora the right to internal self-determination is recognized as an invaluable, inalienable and most fundamental human right of a people

with a distinct identity and that is the point I want to make. That if the people within a country have a distinct identity and they have clamoured for internal self-determination over several decades through their democratic verdicts, then there is the responsibility cast upon the State to recognize that right for which the people have clamoured and which has been supported by the democratic verdicts of such people at several democratic elections. This is the point I want to make, Sir, and I want to ask this Government, now that you are committing yourself or you claim to commit yourself subject to whatever reservations I may have expressed at the commencement of my speech, to your accession to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, what is the policy of the Government in regard to the right to internal self-determination of the Tamil people of this country who have for over four decades since 1956 at all democratic elections supported overwhelmingly the right to internal self-determination which you have persistently and consistently denied? That is a matter to which you must provide an answer. Sir, I want to also raise the question on Article 1(2) of Part I of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which states, I quote: ......In no case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence. When you go and declare a high security zone in the Mutur area, in the Sampur area and you keep out thousands of people from those areas which they have inhabited for generations and centuries; where they have lived with their families; where they have carried on their occupation, carried on their livelihood and led their social, economic and cultural rights, are you not depriving a people of their own means of subsistence? This is a question to which the Sri Lankan State must provide an answer and if you are acceding to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, I want to raise the question as to whether there is no obligation cast upon you to immediately disband the high security zone which you have created in the Sampur, Mutur area. Sir, I think, there is an obligation on the part of both the human family of humanity in the world over and of States which are responsible for the governance of people in certain defined territories. To conform to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenants on Human Rights including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, no one is exempt from these obligations. But, the recent trends that we have witnessed in this country unfortunately in the recent past appear to suggest that Sri Lanka seems to think that international obligations are observable and need to be observed by the Sri Lankan State only when it is suitable to them or only when they think it is acceptable to them. Otherwise, they are entitled to say, "We are not concerned about the

2007 10 1005 1006

international norms or standards or international universal declarations. We have our own standards. We have our own criteria on the basis of which we determine these matters and we are not going to be concerned." I do not think it can be the mouth of a civilized State to say that. I think, when you accept international obligations you have to comply with international norms and international standards and you cannot claim to be exempt from such obligations and what we see is that the manner in which the Sri Lankan State attempts to find an escape route or get away from its obligations is by invoking sovereignty and saying we are a sovereign State and we are not going to be dictated to by anybody else. I will not go into unpleasant details but we all know how international authorities who have come here have been treated, what they have been called, how they have been referred to, even people from the United Nations by persons holding responsible positions in government, not the ordinary people and all this is done in the name of the sovereignty of the Sri Lankan State, which they think is something that is untouchable. Sovereignty is very sacred. There should be no question about it. One does not dispute that. Sovereignty incorporates the powers of governance; it incorporates human rights; it incorporates democracy. But, this is our complaint. While sovereignty incorporates the powers of governance it also incorporates democracy; it also incorporates human rights and if there is a violation of either democracy or of human rights, there is a subversion of democracy or there is a denial of human rights, a blatant and flagrant violation of human rights, then that sovereignty is sought to be subverted not by the persons who are victims but by persons who are the aggressors. This is why I say, Sir, that if the Sri Lankan State is really, honestly and unambiguously committed to its accession to the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights and if the purpose of this legislation is to give effect to such accession, then there is an obligation on your part not merely to observe and respect the human rights of all people who inhabit this country but also to respect the democratic verdicts of particularly, the Tamil people which have been delivered in the North-East in an overwhelming manner in the course of the past several decades.

I thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Presiding Member) .. . [.. 1.28]

. . ( ) ( .. - , ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of Export Development and International Trade) Mr. Presiding Member, I am delighted to have the opportunity of participating in this Debate on a topic of undoubted practical importance.

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in December 1966, and Sri Lanka acceded to the Covenant in June, 1980. The effect of that accession, Mr. Presiding Member, was comprehensively dealt with by a five-judge Bench of the Supreme Court in the Nallaratriam Singarasa judgment which was pronounced on the 15th of September, 2006. That judgment clarifies the existing law on the subject, and the Singarasa judgment constitutes the backdrop against which this legislation is being introduced by the Government. In the Singarasa case, Mr. Presiding Member, the Hon. Sarath N. Silva, Chief Justice of Sri Lanka, explained very clearly what the legal position is arising from the action taken by the Republic of Sri Lanka to accede to the Covenant in 1980. The Supreme Court held that the instrument of accession binds the executive branch of the Republic. However, it is not possible for an aggrieved citizen to go before the courts and to seek a remedy for an infringement or an imminent infringement of fundamental rights in the absence of legislation enacted by the Parliament of Sri Lanka. In other words, what was done by the Sri Lankan State, in 1980, had relevance only in the domain of the conduct of international relations, the relationship between the State of Sri Lanka and foreign States. But it was not a document from which the people of our own country could derive rights which are enforceable by the courts of the Republic. I think it is very necessary for that point to be understood and, with all respect, many of the observations that were made by my Friend, the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera, the Chief Opposition Whip, were based on a misconception of the legal position which was so clearly enunciated in the judgment of the Supreme Court. The Court held that the 1980 accession is valid. There is nothing illegal about it. It is in no way inconsistent or incompatible with the Constitution and the laws of Sri Lanka. It is, however, incomplete if the object is to give citizens of this country justiciable and enforceable legal rights. If you want to make it possible for a citizen complaining of a grievance to invoke the jurisdiction of the courts of Sri Lanka, then the instrument of accession in 1980 per se is inadequate to accomplish that objective. His Lordship Justice Sarath N. Silva said that there is one further step to be taken. It is not something that cannot be done. It can be done, it should be done, but the Government of the day has to take the initiative in bringing legislation before Parliament to bring to fruition, to complete a process that has been initiated in 1980. This is abundantly clear from the judgment of the Supreme Court. I would like to emphasize this because the Hon. Sampanthan said that the Government had woken up from a long slumber. That is an unfair remark because the Chief Justice, in his judgment, specifically says that up to

1007 1008

1980 no legislation was brought before the House because of the assumption that the instrument of accession was sufficient to achieve the purposes that were contemplated. However, the court says that is not so; it is not sufficient, and something remains to be done. So that was pointed out on the 15th of September, 2006. [Interruption.] Yes, but I will explain to you what was happening in the course of that year. So it is not as though there was a deep slumber, it is not as though there was indifference or lethargy, the law had been interpreted in a certain way up to the time when the Supreme Court intervened in the Singarasa judgment to set out certain principles of law which constituted a departure from the assumptions which had been made up to the time of that judgment. That is the reason for this legislation. That is the raison detre underpinning the legislation that is being debated in this august Assembly today. There were also some other unfair charges levelled against the Government. The Hon. Joseph Michael Perera asked, Why is this incomplete? Why are you bringing bits and pieces? This appears to be ad hoc. The Hon. John Amaratunga also asked the question, "Why does this not cover the entire field?". The Hon. Sampanthan went a little further and imputed a duplicitous motive to the Government of Sri Lanka. I think that is unfair. The Hon. Sampanthan said that we are trying to achieve for ourselves the benefits of accession to an international legal instrument which encapsulates the basic values of human rights jurisprudence in international law, while actually not subscribing to those principles, making an appearance of doing so, and deceiving the international community. He laid at the door of the Government a grave charge. I would submit, Sir, with all respect, that that charge is entirely without foundation. When the Supreme Court delivered its judgment one year ago, the Government clearly had a certain task to perform. Now we need, all the time, to keep in mind the contours of that judgment and that is why the speech, with all respect, of the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera entirely missed the point. What the court said was this. If there is legislation giving effect to those principles, then remedies are available. But if there is no legislation, no remedy can be granted. In that situation it would be futile and counterproductive, it would be an entire waste of time and energy for the Government to bring before this House in the form of legislation the entire gamut of principles which are reflected in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. That is a superfluous exercise. It is an exercise that has no practical value for this reason, Sir. Today, in Sri Lanka we have a plethora of laws which give expression in a practical form to the norms, the values and the principles that are encapsulated in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. These laws, Sir, operate at three levels. Much of it is embodied in the paramount law of the Republic, namely

the Constitution of Sri Lanka. Some other principles contained in the Covenant receive expression in statutory provisions such as the Bail Act, the Penal Code Act, the Criminal Procedure Code, the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration Act, the Prevention of Social Disabilities Act, the Protection of Children and Young Persons Act, and other legislation. All these statutes give expression to some of the principles that are contained in the Covenant. In keeping with the criterion postulated by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka in the Nallaratriam Singarasa case, no further action is necessary, Sir, with regard to that whole range of matters because there is no lacuna, there is no gap. Those matters are already provided for. Legislative intervention by the Parliament of Sri Lanka is required only in respect of those matters where legislation has not been enacted up to this time. That is my reply to the Chief Opposition Whip. He asked, Why are you not bringing in their entirety, the provisions contained in the International Covenant in the form of enacting or empowering legislation to this House? That is totally unnecessary. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Can I ask for a clarification? . . ( .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) No, please. [Interruption.] Please let me speak. [Interruption.] I did not disturb. [Interruption.] I have no reluctance to answer any question that you wish to put to me. but I do not wish my line of argument to be disturbed by you because I did not disturb any of your Speakers. Now, what I wish to say, Sir, is that it is not necessary to cover the whole ground. Nobody who knows the law or even the basics of the law would attempt to do that. You have to read the judgement in the Singarasa case. You have to understand that judgement. You have to find out what action is required, and you have to respond in a practical and meaningful way. That is what we have done. The law officers of the Republic have been consulted. They have been working on this matter for many months, and I wish to pay a tribute to the dedication, the perseverance and the hard work that has been put in by the honourable Attorney-General and his staff and the Legal Draftsman and her staff. It is not an easy matter. It cannot be done overnight. It has occupied their attention for several months. I will answer the Hon. Lakshman Kiriellas question in due course. We have discovered what the gaps are. Those are the gaps that we have now resolved to fill by means of the legislation that is now receiving the attention of this Parliament.

[ . . ]

2007 10 1009 1010

The Hon. Joseph Michael Perera completely misunderstood the law; he said that he was not a lawyer, he was talking about other things. But you cannot divorce this from the law. This is a legal matter. Now, Sir, he said that there is nothing new in this. He used the word "" which means impotent. It has no practical value, he maintained. I will show you, Sir, how much practical value it has. It breaks new ground. It caters for things for which there is no provision at all in the existing laws of the Republic. For example, substantive offences have been created; substantive offences which have to do with very important objectives in which I am certain that my learned Friend, the Hon. R. Sampanthan would be deeply interested. There are offences which have to do with the prevention of actions directed towards creating racial or religious hatred that would constitute incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence. These are substantive provisions. Then, there are procedural provisions which go to the very heart of human freedom. Sir, this law gives expression to the principle against compulsory self incrimination. Clause 4 (1) (f) enshrines the principle that no person can be compelled to testify against himself or to confess guilt. These are not trivial matters. There are not matters of detail. These are seminal principles. These are core values which touch the heart of human liberty. So when my Friend, the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera, says this is , with all respect, he has completely misdirected himself on the content and the scope of the legislation that is being debated in this House today. These are principles that are not found in the statute law of this country in an explicit form and these are of practical value particularly to socially disadvantaged sections of the Sri Lankan community. There is provision here for legal assistance for which no money has to be paid by persons in adverse financial circumstances. Earlier that was a matter of discretion. Now it becomes a matter of mandatory legal obligation, and that is a new principle. It breaks new ground. It is a principle which has undisputed social value. There is provision here for compulsorily making available the services of an interpreter. Often there are miscarriages of justice because of problems connected with language. Now, the services of an interpreter have to be provided in certain circumstances as a matter not of discretion but as a matter of compulsory duty. The Hon. Joseph Michael Perera cannot dismiss all of these with the cavalier use of the word "". They are far from . These are things that the country needs and the Government is responding to an urgent social need by formulating and presenting this legislation in the House today. With regard to the rights of the child which are provided for in Clause 5, again we have made compulsory provision for legal assistance to be provided. Then, Sir, I would with respect draw your attention to Clause 6 which contains a principle that is of fundamental importance particularly in the current social context. Every citizen is given an essential right by this law. It is set out in black

and white and not "" as my Friend says. It is here. It is effective. It has vigour and vitality and the pith and substance of Clause 6 is that every citizen of this country shall have the right and the opportunity to take part in the conduct of public affairs, either directly or through any representative and have access to services provided to the public by the State. This enshrines rudimentary democratic values. These are the characteristics of a vibrant and functioning democracy, and it is to the credit of this Government that it has had the courage, it has done the work that is required to put all of these into a law which finds no parallel in the entire corpus of laws which exist in this country at this moment. Sir, this is why the entire speech of the Chief Opposition Whip was misconceived, it was erroneous, derived from a lack of understanding of the principles on which this law is based. I now proceed, Sir, to respond to the question that was put to me by my Friend, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella. He thought that I was in some way dodging this matter of the First Optional Protocol. There is no need for me to dodge anything. I do not know whether my learned Friend who is a lawyer, of course, has taken the trouble to read the Singarasa judgment. I rather suspect that he has not done so. In that case I am very surprised that you should ask me this question. I would refer you with all respect, Hon. Kiriella ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Are you talking about the Constitutional amendment? . . ( .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) No, no. I am not talking about the Constitutional amendment. I am talking of a very plain paragraph which cannot possibly be construed in any way other than the obvious way. This is what the five-judge bench has to say. I quote: ..the accession to the Optional Protocol in 1997 by the then President That is His Excellency J. R. Jayewardene. and Declaration made under Article 1, is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution specified above and is in excess of the power of the President as contained in Article 33 (f) of the Constitution. The accession and declaration does not bind the Republic qua State and has no legal effect within the Republic. [Interruption.] One moment. No, no. I cannot enter into an argument with you. I must develop my own thoughts. Now, Sir, what the court says is that in Sri Lanka the Executive derives its power from the Constitution. It is the Constitution that is sovereign. All bodies therefore unlike in British practice, Parliament, the President, the courts, all these functionaries have to

1011 1012

[ . . ]

perform within the limits of vires or jurisdiction conferred by the Constitution of Sri Lanka. The court goes on to say very clearly that the Constitution of Sri Lanka brings about an exclusive entrenchment of the judicial power of the Republic in the courts of this country. The court goes on to say that there is consequently no warrant or justification in law for the judicial power of the Republic in any shape or form to be vested in a body other than the duly established courts of the Republic of Sri Lanka. On that basis, the court held that the Act of the late President of Sri Lanka, His Excellency J.R. Jayewardene, in acceding to the First Optional Protocol in 1997, that is 17 years after the instrument of accession to the international Covenant, was ultra vires the Constitution; it was devoid of legal effect; it is a nullity from the beginning and it cannot be recognized by the court as a valid Act. In those circumstances, this Government is not dodging anything; it is not concealing anything; it is not guilty of duplicity, of disingenuous action in any manner whatsoever. We have to operate within the framework of the law as laid down by the most exalted judicial tribunal in this country, namely the Supreme Court of the Republic. The court has clearly held that the First Optional Protocol is incompatible with basic values that are enshrined in the Constitution, and that is the criterion which we must necessarily adopt in formulating and bringing before this august Assembly legislation for the purpose of enactment. There is nothing new in that principle, Mr. Presiding Member; there is nothing that should shock the conscience of the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella. Tony Blair in one of his last speeches made as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom placed very considerable stress on the principle of national sovereignty in its application to the judicature. He said he will not agree to any decision that is made in Brussels or elsewhere which takes away the right of the courts of the United Kingdom to interpret seminal provisions of British Criminal Law. He said that must be done by British courts. I do not know whether my Friend, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella is aware that about one-third of the States which have subscribed to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights have not acceded to the First Optional Protocol. He must not assume that. I am sure he does not assume that because I think he is reasonably well-informed about these matters. It does not follow that a State which accedes to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights will necessarily accept the First Optional Protocol. There are many self-respecting nations on this earth who have had no difficulty in adopting in toto the principles contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but who have insisted that that jurisdiction must be exercised by their own courts, the courts operating within the shores of their own country. They have not been happy about giving that jurisdiction to foreign tribunals. We must grow out of that mentality. The Hon.

Lakshman Kiriella is aware that at one time the highest judicial body in this country was the Privy Council, which was called the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The Law Lords advised Her Majesty the Queen who signed the final order. Is that compatible with the dignity, the self-esteem, the pride of a sovereign nation? It is because the answer to that question is unequivocally in the negative that Sri Lanka took action to abolish appeals to the Privy Council. It is that same compelling sentiment, rooted in basic notions of national pride, that have impelled many countries which have accepted the ICCPR, but which have rejected the basic principle contained in the First Optional Protocol. All this, I am sure, will convince my learned Friend that there is no need for us to hide anything. Here is the judgment; the judgment is explicit on that point. This Parliament, this country, this Government must accept that judgment. It is a judgment of the Supreme Court and the judgment presents us with the parameters within which we must necessarily operate in formulating this legislation. It is on that basis that I would argue - I hope cogently - against the submissions of the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera and the Hon. R. Sampanthan that the Government has been duplicitous. It has not been duplicitous; it has done the best it can; it has brought this legislation before this House to give the people of our country the benefit of the principles contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. According to the Supreme Court in the Nallaratriam Singarasa judgment, up to this time whoever benefits from this, it is not the people of Sri Lanka; whoever benefits, that benefit does not accrue to the people of this nation. It is the bounden duty of this Government, Sir, to ensure that before anybody else can claim any benefit or advantage from the principles contained in the ICCPR, it is the people of the sovereign Republic of Sri Lanka who should be beneficiaries of these principles that receive expression in this international instrument. It is, therefore, a laudable task to which we have addressed ourselves. We have set about it methodically, in a painstaking and systematic way. We have identified the gaps that exist in the present law and we have formulated legislation to fill those gaps, not to cover ground which has already been covered by constitutional provisions and other legislation already in force in this country. So much, Mr. Presiding Member, for the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It is also my duty, Mr. Presiding Member, to tell the House something about the scope, the content and the rationale of the two other Bills which are before this House. The second piece of legislation, which is introduced by the Hon. Prime Minister on behalf of the Ministry of Defence, Public Security, Law and Order, is legislation to give effect to the Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. Here again, the charge made by the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera that this is is palpably and

2007 10 1013 1014

demonstrably false. I say that it is palpably and demonstrably false because in this legislation, in Clause 2, there is a whole range of offences which have been created in respect of international trafficking in drugs. Sir, international trafficking constitutes a global threat today. It is also something which is now affecting the physical, the emotional and the mental wellbeing of the people of Sri Lanka, particularly the younger sections of the community. So, here again there are gaps in the law. The international conventions recognize various offences which do not have a parallel in the established laws of the Republic. It is therefore our duty to fill those gaps. We have created these new offences, not . These have the force of law, and they serve a very urgent public purpose.

We have given jurisdiction to the High Court of the country to enforce the law relating to these offences. We have changed the principles of extradition in order to enable persons who are guilty of these offences to be extradited. This law, again far from being , contains provisions relating to the rendering of mutual assistance, the taking of evidence, the serving of process and the conduct of searches, all of which are procedural provisions which are absolutely essential to give effect to the objectives contained in this law.

The third piece of legislation serves a humanitarian purpose. Sir, Sri Lanka is a caring society. Every country has its own cultural heritage and one of the hallmarks of our cultural heritage is our commitment to certain humanitarian values: concern for the poor, the sick, the old and the infirm. Gauthama the Buddha in his last sermon, the Parinibbana Suthra, said the moral quality of any society can be judged by the manner in which the more vulnerable sections of the community are treated. Here is a legislative response to that issue. This law contains provisions for the systematic treatment and rehabilitation of drug offenders and, what is very important in the cultural context of a society like Sri Lanka, to prevent the stigmatization of drug offenders. That is, the imputing of a stigma to persons who have a history of taking drugs. These are all very desirable, very essential pieces of legislation and that is why the Government has taken action to have these certified as urgent Bills for consideration by the House today. Sir, I would like to conclude by referring to one other matter. We have done what is right and proper. ( ) (The Presiding Member) .

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) , . . Sir, there is one other matter that I would like to refer to. We have done what is right for the right reason. The right reason is to give the people of our country the benefit of these rights which are available to them in public international law. That alone is sufficient reason for the action taken by this Government to formulate and present this legislation. But I would like to refer also to a very considerable social benefit that accrues to the people of our country as a result of the legislation which is now under consideration in this House. I refer to the GSP Plus arrangements. These are concessions that we have had from the European Union during the period 2005 to 2008. The GSP Plus arrangements are absolutely vital for the economy of Sri Lanka. I would describe it as a lifeline of our economy. Sir, the garment factories that are functioning up and down the country, particularly in the rural areas provide employment for thousands of girls. Those girls who come to the garment factories are given breakfast; there are co-operative societies which sell soap, tins of salmon, toothpaste at subsidized prices; they are given medical facilities; they are given training, all these things are possible because of the GSP Plus arrangements. The true value of the GSP Plus arrangements is that we enjoy very considerable concessions and privileges with regard to tariffs and duties imposed by the European Union. Whereas other countries exporting goods to the European Union are required to pay tariffs, Sri Lanka enjoys exemption in certain circumstances from those tariffs. That is of particular value in relation to the apparel sector in Sri Lanka. Sir, you are aware that apparel constitutes the principal export product of Sri Lanka. Today, we earn US Dollars three billion or 3,000 million from the export of our apparel products out of Sri Lanka. The main buyer is still the United States of America, but we export into the European Union apparel products worth approximately US Dollars 1.2 billion. That is US Dollars 1,200 million. To give you some perspective of the importance of this industry, I would like to tell you that although tea is our traditional agricultural export, this year tea is expected to bring us about US Dollars 900 million. Rubber products will bring us about US Dollars 750 million. Gems and jewellery will earn about US Dollars 450 million. The remittances from Sri Lankans working abroad coming into this country will be in the region of US Dollars 2.9 billion or 2,900 million. In comparison with all of that, the foreign exchange that we earn from the export of our apparel products is about US Dollars 3,000 million. If these girls who are now basing their entire livelihood,

1015 1016

supporting their families, building their futures with entirely new vistas of opportunity opening up in respect of their lives and their careers are to continue in their employment, it is absolutely necessary that the GSP Plus arrangements should continue. The Government of Sri Lanka will shortly negotiate for the extension of this GSP Plus concessions for a further three years from 2008 to 2011. That again is a very considerable benefit that we would be entitled to if we comply with certain criteria. That is not the reason for doing this. The reason for doing this is to serve the people of our country and to give them the benefit of remedies in terms of the enforcement of these provisions as an integral part of the domestic laws of the country. But while doing that, for that reason, we also need to be conscious of the fact that there is this very considerable benefit that will come to us as a result of this action which is being taken by the Government of Sri Lanka. The last comment I would like to make, Sir, is this. I would earnestly appeal to everybody - all political parties and all groups in the country - to treat this matter above the level of partisan politics. We may disagree about many matters. Politics is about power. There is no doubt about that. But there are certain things which should be beyond the field of adversarial, confrontational politics. If we do anything to deprive the people of our country of these very substantial benefits, if these innocent girls working in these factories are to be thrown out on the roads because GSP Plus is not available, it is not the Government that is going to be hurt. A government is a government. A government is not going to fall because GSP Plus is withheld, but the persons who will suffer very grievously in consequence of such action will be the less privileged sections of the Sri Lankan community, particularly in the rural hinterland of Sri Lanka. So, I think we need to be perennially conscious of that reality and whatever we do, whatever political actions or initiatives we embark upon, we need to remember that GSP Plus is a matter that goes to the very root of Sri Lankas economic and social wellbeing. With those words, Mr. Presiding Member, I would like to thank you for your indulgence and I thank the House for a very patient hearing. I hope that I have placed before you compelling arguments in support of this legislation and I exhort you with all the vehemence at my command to support this legislation to ensure that it is enacted into law in order to give the people of our country the full benefit of these international instruments. What is the use of having a very impressive body of international law which is beyond their reach? It is there, a glimmering, attractive presence in the sky, but it is not for them. We are bringing these remedies within the reach of our people. It requires legislation and this is the law that is required for that purpose. We are now making it possible for our people to benefit in the fullest possible measure from these rights available in international law which will now be

enforced by the courts of Sri Lanka and for that reason, I have no doubt that all sections of this House will have no hesitation in supporting the legislation which has been presented to this House by my distinguished Colleague, the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs. Thank you, Sir. [.. 2.03] ( ) (The Hon. Vijitha Herath) , , . , . . .. . , , . , , . , . , , civil and political rights . , . , , , , , , , . , . . . , . , . . .

[.. 2.13] . . ( ) ( . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W. A. Wiswa Warnapala - Minister of Higher Education) Mr. Presiding Member, three important Bills have been placed before this House as urgent Bills.

Firstly, I would like to draw the attention of this House to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ( I CCPR) Bill. Sir, once a country enters into an international covenant of this nature, that particular country has to pass a legislation in order to make it a part of the compendium of laws in that given country. In my view, this is a very important piece of legislation - my learned Friend, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris too stated that this is a very important piece of legislation - really because of the fact that it deals with political and civil rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was proclaimed in 1948 and it was the first step in the formulation of an International Bill of Human Rights. It was only in 1976 that this International Bill of Human Rights became a reality and it included three significant instruments. The first two are of great significance. The first is the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The second is the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Today we are trying to give legislative recognition to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. All of us are interested in political and civil rights and no political society can function without political and civil rights and we want them to be protected in order to see that the individuals make use of them to realize their best personality in society. The most important fact is that these covenants protect a wide range of human rights. It is here in this context, Sir, that I would like to draw the attention of this House to one important question: What are rights? All individuals living within an organized political society enjoy rights. Therefore we need to ask the question, what are rights? Harold Laski in his celebrated work G rammar of Politics states that every State is known by the rights that it maintains. Rights, according to Harold Laski, are those conditions which an individual needs to realize his best personality. Rights are necessary for an individual to realize his best personality in a given society. A society or a State builds rights upon the individual personality and the welfare of the community is also built on the happiness of the individual. In other words, Sir, happiness of an individual is acquired through rights. Therefore, rights are conditions provided by the State for the individual to realize his best personality. This aspect has been recognized by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which has 53 Articles and they cover a wide variety of rights which fall within the category of political and civil rights. A right could be categorized into four divisions. The first, a right is a liberty. The second, a right is a claim. The third, a right is a power. The fourth, a right is an immunity; it is the absence of liability. This is how the rights have been defined into four categories. All these conditions have been created by the State. The State is a political community. The State has created all these conditions to help the individual realize his personality; his best personality in that given political community. Both political and civil rights, Mr. Presiding

Member, create such conditions. Therefore, they need to be given recognition. Any State which gives constitutional protection to its citizens confers both political and civil rights. Both the American and French Declarations of 1775 and 1789, the American Declaration of 1775 and the French Declaration of 1789 guaranteed certain freedoms of the individual but the citizens did not enjoy civil rights in the United States till the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. American citizens did not enjoy civil rights in the United States till the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Covenant which we are discussing today, which the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris discussed in detail refers to all political and civil rights. It refers to such things as Freedom of Expression, Right of Peaceful Assembly, Right to Freedom of Association, Right to Freedom of Thought, Right to Life, Right to Liberty et cetera. In other words, all political and civil rights which an individual enjoys in a given political community are incorporated in this Covenant. There is one difference. They are different from fundamental rights. The Constitution of 1978 to which my learned Friend the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris referred, the current operating Constitution, guarantees certain basic human rights and freedoms. Certain fundamental rights in the Constitution have been protected by certain entrenched provisions in the Constitution and this has been done to prevent their violation by the Executive. One has to look at Article 17 and Article 126 which provide certain guarantee. It was the Constitution of 1972 which brought in fundamental rights and freedom and the Constitution of 1978 expanded them to cover new areas as well. Therefore, what I am trying to say is that, Mr. Presiding Member, we have a comprehensive, compendium of fundamental rights in this country. By giving legislative recognition to the Covenant of the United Nations, Sri Lanka is strengthening its structure of funda mental human rights and freedoms. It is true that Sri Lanka has a comprehensive statement of fundamental rights but with the recognition given to the Covenant, its basis is further expanded. We have given recognition to political and civil rights of the Covenant of the United Nations. This means, Sir, that Sri Lanka is now a part of the international system and the country is expected to according to international obligations. In other words, the Covenant includes human rights which have not been given recognition through legislative measures. Today, there is the charge that human rights are being violated by various groups and organizations. Our Government taking this fact into consideration has taken steps to give legislative recognition to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in order to strengthen our commitment. My good Friend, the Hon. Sampanthan said that, I mean the Government is not committed but we have given recognition in order to strengthen our commitment to the protection of political and civil rights. It could not be denied that the rights and freedoms of individual get curbed or curtailed when the State is engaged in combating organized terrorism which today is an international phenomenon. All of us are aware of it. In such a context, safeguards are necessary to protect the rights of the individual. The Sri Lankan State, after nearly two decades, has postulated that these rights are essential and it is up to the Sri Lankan State to protect them and ensure their realization so that the individual can realize his best personality. I also would like to refer to the Bill which was presented by the Hon. Prime Minister. I need to congratulate the Hon. Prime Minister for introducing two more useful pieces of legislation. Illicit drug trafficking, as Prof. G.L. Peiris mentioned, is an international menace; it is a global menace

2007 10 1021 1022

and safeguards are necessary to prevent illicit trafficking in narcotics. It has now become a very lucrative trade among those forces associated with international terrorism. Narcotics are used by international terrorist organizations to earn money. The Government, through this piece of legislation is given recognition to two important conventions through which international obligations are to be fulfilled in respect of combating illicit trafficking in narcotics. The next piece of legislation is to make provision for the treatment and rehabilitation of drug addiction. The drug addicts have rights. They too need to be protected. They need to be given the opportunity to enjoy their rights. Now this piece of legislation is to make provision for both treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicts. This is yet another menace in the country. The purpose of this Bill is to create provision for the establishment of treatment centres including the licensing of private treatment centres. There is provision for compulsory admissions to a treatment centre and this is one important aspect of this piece of legislation. It is through treatment and rehabilitation that the number of drug addicts could be reduced. Today, many of them are criminals and the crime rate in the country has gone up purely because of this menace; the growth in the number of drug addicts. Therefore, this piece of legislation though limited in its objectives still do something to control the drug addiction in this country. Thank you. [.. 2.26] ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, we have been listening to the speeches made by the Members on the Government side. They were very eloquent speeches and theories that have been expoused. But unfortunately that is not going to satisfy the aspirations of the people of Sri Lanka to safeguard their human rights. It is very unfortunate that you have brought forth a half-baked bill or trying to enact a piece of legislation which is hollow. It should have been much more comprehensive. One objection that we had was, why did you not give us an opportunity to bring this Bill before the Consultative Committee and give all the parties an opportunity of discussing the pros and cons and whatever deficiencies we may see which probaby you may not have observed? That is one and the other matter is, why did you make it an urgent Bill? What was the great hurry? Why were you rushing through this? So that leaves us a certain amount of doubt about the sincerity and genuineness of the Government in rushing through this Bill. But, it is better to have something than nothing. There is no debate on that. At least there is something now. But our objection is that we had no opportunity from the Opposition of making any contribution or criticism of what is there in the form of a Consultative Committee and your rushing through this Bill. Now, from the arguments put forward by the Opposition, it appears that it coincides with the visit of the Commissioner of Human Rights who is in Sri Lanka.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) I explained it. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I know that you explained it but it was well-timed. I mean, we must congratulate you for that. You are trying to satisfy the Commission that Sri Lanka is very conscious about conserving the human rights and you are making every effort in order to ensure that there are no violations and the legal framework is in place. It is obvious. It is obvious because there were threats of resolutions that were to come before the UN, the EU and various other forums. I mean, as far back as April - ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Are you opposing this? ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) No. I am only making certain observations of your rushing through this. Why you did not give the opportunity for a Consultative Committee discussion? Why you made it an urgent Bill? These are some of the reasons. Then, the second reason, it is far more important. I think the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris quite rightly touched on it. That is the GSP. That is the key factor and that would have had very serious repercussions if you had not complied. Now the announcement is regarding the Governments intention to enact legislation to ostensibly give effect to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Those are the commentaries that are coming and it says according to reports, the Government seeks to enact the ICCPR so as to comply with the requirements stipulated by the European Union to qualify as a beneficiary country to its general system of preference schemes and description of that is special incentive arrangements for sustainable development and good governance. That is a major issue. I fully agree with you when you say the amount of people who are living out of it, the benefits. All that, I think is okay. That is correct. But you are hurriedly bringing this in order to get over that difficulty. It is not only bringing and formulating the legislation, the complaint we have is that it is incomplete; whether you will reap the benefits of that in view of the nature of the legislation you have brought in. Now, the press release on the draft Bill purporting to enact the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) says, I quote: One of the requirements to qualify for the relevant EU scheme is that the beneficiary country is placed under a general obligation to ratify and fully implement...

1023 1024

These are very important. Ratify and fully implement. I quote further: ...the international conventions listed in Annex III of the European Council Regulation (EC) No. 980/2005 of 27th June 2005, which sets out the scheme of generalized tariff preferences. One of the key human rights instruments listed under Part A Annex III of the Regulation is the ICCPR. So the simple question is, have you brought everything under that Convention into this piece of legislation? If you have not done it, I am so sorry, not only you, we ourselves will also feel sorry that we have not complied with the requirements of the EU. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) I explained it one by one. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) No. That is not the thing. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) I am sure that you will understand. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) This is what is envisaged in this. These commentaries also go on to say that the selective nature of the rights have been included in the Governments Bill. For example, this draft Bill does not contain some of the more important rights that have been enumerated in the Convention. They are listed here. One is the right to life. Then, right of self-determination, freedom from negative discrimination on the basis of national or social origin, freedom from forced or compulsory labour, security and liberty of persons deprived of liberty. Then, right to require free consent to medical and scientific experimentation, right to leave the country, rights of minorities, including in respect of religion, language and culture and the right to privacy. These are some of the commentaries and observations made by human rights activists in Sri Lanka. They feel that this Bill does not cover the whole gamut of the Convention that is being laid down for the EU. I am only talking of the requirements of the EU for the moment. The problem here is that the enactment of the ordinary legislation specially in its present form will not address any of the human rights issues that the ICCPR and its First Optional Protocol are designed to address in a meaningful way. This raises a serious question as to the sincerity of the Government in respect of human rights protection in Sri Lanka, in a manner that suggests that the primary motive is to qualify to EUs preferential trade regime through the adoption of superficial measures.

So the point is, if you have not complied and come fully in line with the EU circulars over the conditions that they have laid down, you will not get the benefit of the GSP as you referred to. So that is a very serious situation. You will have to take notice of that. And if it goes wrong the Government will be held responsible for all those people who will lose employment and for all those factories that will have to be closed down as a result of your failure to comply with the EU regulations. This is the indictment that we are making from the Floor of this House, the responsibility that you have to shoulder. So please be careful and do not think that just because you hurriedly put something on a piece of paper and present it to this House, and you have a majority to go through it, that will satisfy the needs of the EU and finally, the country will lose that benefit. That is all as regards that and I will not go to enumerate it because we had a very comprehensive discussion with regard to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Bill that is before this House. Then, I must also thank the Government for bringing in the Drug Dependant Persons (Treatment and Rehabilitation) Bill. Now this is something that was overdue. This should have come into this country about ten years ago. During my period also I tried to implement this but it was not successful. But this question of treatment, we did it in various indirect ways. Now a drug addict is a destruction for himself and no other. That is number one. The second thing is, fining him or putting him in jail is not going to rectify the situation. That is why I say this is very important and very valuable because once he comes back from jail even after paying the fine he will get back to drugs. So this treatment centre principle is quite appropriate and very good. There are thousands of people who are indulging in drugs in Sri Lanka. This is a very serious situation and they estimate that about Rs. 50 million worth of drugs are in circulation for a day. I do not know from where it is coming and how much of it is being consumed by various people. At the moment the prisons are burdened with about 26,000 inmates and 40 per cent of them are drug-oriented people who are imprisoned for drugs, convicted or in remand and another 20 per cent for drug-oriented offences like thefts, robberies, murder, rape and so on and so forth. ( )

( - , ) (The Hon. Dew Gunasekara -Minister of Constitutional Affairs and National Integration) That means it is globalized. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I do not know about the globalization. Let us look after our own selves. We are worried about our own selves now. The other important thing is, these treatment

[ ]

2007 10 1025 1026

centres. At the moment there are some treatment centres, one by Venerable Bodhananda. He is a Buddhist monk. We must salute him for the great service he is doing. He is having a rehabilitation centre. Then there is another Catholic Priest also who is running it by the name of Reverend Father Jude Bernard. They adopt a system which is an American-oriented system called Therapeutic Community. That is, they have a particular way of rehabilitation but very unfortunately the end result is that there are only about 10 per cent of recoveries. Now, there is a new experiment being done by also another Catholic Priest. I would name him as Reverend Father Alexus Benedict who has now started a rehabilitation centre by meditation. And he feels that it is very successful. Of the addicts he has been trying to encourage for meditation, 75 per cent of them have recovered. So, the more important thing is these directors who are in charge of these drug centres should expand them. For one thing they should have more centres, otherwise you cannot house all the 10,000 or 12,000 drug addicts who are now in the prisons and start the treatment centres and the Government should give a grant to the centres and not depend solely on the voluntary organizations. At the moment Venerable Bodhananda and I think Father Jude, they charge an admission fee plus a monthly payment for the day-to-day expenses. Some of these people who are involved in drugs do not have a cent. It is the parents or the next of kin who have to bear the expenses. So the Government, since it will be relieved of the imprisoning expenditure, if ten or fifteen thousand people who are imprisoned are being taken out and put into these centres, then I think it is nothing but fair that these centres which are run presently by the Buddhist monks and the Christian clergy be given a grant and encouraged to go on with the rehabilitation process. Also, the National Dangerous Drugs Control Board must have a system of supervision and follow-up and not just forget about it by putting up the centres. They should have a very efficient course of following-up what is happening; whether there is true rehabilitation or whether they are going back to the old situation. Sir, another important matter is that we should have legislation in order to impose very stringent penalties for the drug traffickers. That is the group of people who should be severely punished. Of course, we know there are certain important personalities who are involved in this business. Allegations are even levelled at Members of Parliament. I am not too sure about that but there is this allegation. There are other very big businessmen, very big people living in plush houses in Colombo 7 who are involved in this business. Now they are the people who should be tracked down. If you are going to cut down on the drug addicts in Sri Lanka, trafficking is the biggest problem. Most of the drugs that come they say come from the Western Province, from the fishing sector. The fishing boats are generally used for transporting drugs into the country, not cannabis but others like heroin, hashish and so on. So, I think this is something we have to address our minds on and make sure you give very severe

punishment. I think the law is there. It is up to the judiciary to take note of it and ensure that very severe punishment is meted out to these people.

Looking at the figures, it is very interesting to see that the male population who are involved in narcotics is 10,214 and a very large number are now in prison. They are imprisoned. Then the females are about 170. A total of about 10,500 are presently languishing in the prisons for narcotic offences. That is something that is very important and we should take immediate steps to set up these centres. I would like to know whether the present prisoners who are convicted also will be referred to these centres. Can the Minister enlighten us on that because it only says that people who are found indulging in narcotics would be produced by the police before a magistrate and then thereafter be referred to a centre. But what about the large numbers that are convicted and are now in jails? [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) That is the yardstick from which we have to approach this entire exercise. Even a convict should be referred and that is the spirit of this Bill. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) If that is the case there should be very strict supervision as to what is happening in the centres. . . ( .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) If you give me one minute, I think the statistics indicate that about 30 per cent of inmates in Sri Lankan prisons today indulge in taking drugs. So there is, I think a very dire need to provide for them as well and the law establishes an adequate framework for that. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) You are right. I hear about 75,000 worth of drugs daily come into the Welikada prison. That is very interesting statistics. So we have to make sure that these ccntres will not have the same problem because ultimately we will go back to square one. So therefore, I would commend the Minister for bringing in this legislation, particularly for treatment to drug dependent persons. This is a very useful piece of legislation and I hope the implementation will be successful. Thank you. [.. 2.44] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera - Minister of Justice) ,

[.. 4.08] ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila - Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member. I am privileged today to wind up this Debate when three important Bills have been presented. They are very important not only in the national sense but also in the international sense. But before I proceed to the Bills I would like to answer some of the matters raised by the Hon. Members of the Opposition. Most of the UNP Members not having anything to say against the Bills in question only resorted to talking about the urgency to bring these Bills. Now that was the way each one of the Members spoke but in different ways and ultimately coming down as to what was the great urgency. I wish to ask them, is it not urgent? Is it not absolutely necessary to bring in any sort of law which will safeguard and further strengthen the rights of the citizens of this country, the human rights and the way they can approach the courts? Is this what they want us to stay away from? . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) Why now, Hon. Minister ? - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila ) Yes, even now. Are you against bringing in laws to protect human rights so that you can have more human rights violations in the areas where you control -[Interruption] I do not have time. I did not disturb you. Please do not disturb me. Now, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella brought up a matter where he said the Supreme Court has held in the Singarasa case, as we are all aware, that the Constitution does not provide for matters to be taken to the Human Rights Commission. Now what was his answer. He said, Why, if you had asked us we would have given you a two-thirds majority. I think he does not know that amendments like this do not need a two-thirds majority. Either he is not aware of it or he is trying to act as if he is not aware. His favourite words are, . I think this is what he tried to do here. He is trying to tell us that they will give the two-thirds majority. But he hides the fact, referendum . When the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris wanted to get up and answer him on that basis, he did not allow him to speak. This is what the Hon. Member did. But I must ask them when we go for the referendum, what is it that we are going to tell the people? Are we going to tell the people that we want to take our problems, Sri Lankan

problems away from the Supreme Court and go to some western country so that they can decide our fate. That can be done by the UNP as they did with the Ceasefire Agreement but not this Government of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, I must tell you. The Hon. (Mrs.) Renuka Herath started speaking again about urgency asked, why it was not brought before the Consultative Committee. I would like to ask her how many urgent bills have been brought before the Consultative Committees by the UNP during their time. Has every bill that has been presented during that period been brought before a Consultative Committee? Do not try to take just political advantage when matters of great importance to the people of this country, the people who have elected all of us, are being debated. Now to go back to the Bills in question, now what are the three Bills? Let me first take the Drug Dependant Persons (Treatment and Rehabilitation) Bill on which the Hon. Dilan Perera made a very valuable contribution and I think all of us agreed that this is the need of the day. I must also agree with the Hon. (Mrs.) Renuka Herath. Yes, there should be deterrent punishment to those who are trafficking drugs. But at the same time here again they were trying to be sarcastic and gain political advantage. About the conventions against illicit trafficking, a valuable contribution was made by the Hon. Member from the JVP and I am sure the Minister of Healthcare and Nutrition and the Prime Minister will give due consideration to that. Coming back to the ICCPR, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, that is one piece of Legislation that needed immediate attention, not because as somebody tried to insinuate that we wanted to please some foreign people, but because this is the need of the hour. This should have been done a long time ago. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! The Hon. Speaker will now take the Chair. , .

, , . Whereupon THE HON. DIMUTHU BANDARA ABAYAKOON left the Chair, and MR. SPEAKER took the Chair. ( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila ) Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This Covenant was signed in 1980 during the time the UNP was in power. Since then, the UNP as well as the subsequent governments felt that we had enough legislation within the Constitution and other legislation which would be amply covering the ICCPR. But what

happened was, after the Singarasa case of 1999, the judgment of which was delivered last year, the honourable judges of the Supreme Court held that while other areas were covered, certain areas had not been covered by amending legislations. That was the reason why the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs brought this to the Cabinet in May, 2007 and got the approval of the Cabinet in June, 2007 to submit it to the Legal Draftsman and having got this, it has taken us three months to get the Bill in the form it is today and therefore this talk about there being an inordinate hurry to cater to foreign people is, I would say, an absolute falsehood. People are just trying, for the sake of speaking in Parliament, not having been able - [Interruption.] Okay. We are running out of time. So, at this moment let me commend to you the three Bills that have been presented today, the Drug Dependant Persons (Treatment and Rehabilitation) Bill, the Conventions against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Bill and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Bill. Thank you very much. , . .
