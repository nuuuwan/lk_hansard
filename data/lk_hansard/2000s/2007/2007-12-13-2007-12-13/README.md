Similarly, I see nothing illegitimate in some crackpot demanding that Yorkshire or some other English country should become an independent state. What is crucial, however, is what methods are used by the SNP or the LTTE to achieve their goals. And the LTTEs methods are simply unacceptable. , . . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , .

.. ( ) ( . . - ) (The Hon. M. H. Mohamed - Minister of Parliamentary Affairs)

Madam Presiding Member, there were some references made by many speakers this morning. Actually some of these matters do not come under my purview. However, I will look into them carefully and if there is any assistance that I can give them on matters within my purview, I will certainly do so and see that those problems are resolved at least to some extent. I am always ready to consult the Members of Parliament when there are problems. I know there are a lot of difficulties that the Members undergo because they are not allocated sufficient funds. However, this matter will be gone into. I hope and pray that next year will be a better year. Now I would like to say a few words about my Ministry. Our aim is to provide equality of service to all Members of the Parliament regardless of their background of their political philosophy, religious background, ethnicity and other differences. It is our duty to provide all necessary facilities to the Members of he Parliament to assist them in their untiring effort to bring peace and prosperity in this country. I, as a very senior Member of

3551 3552

the Parliament, hope to go beyond the traditions and take an active part in helping the countrys development and following are the main functions we carried out to fulfill the above mission. * Appointing the personal staff of the Members and terminating their services. * Paying monthly salary to the staff of the Members. * Payment of gratuity to those staff of Members who have completed their tenure. * Providing office equipment and vehicles for Members of Parliament. * Payment of compensation to Members and their families who are not entitled for pension. * Provide insurance coverage for Members of Parliament. * Providing trainings for the personal staff of Members We had regular seminars in different parts of the country. I invited all the staff of the Members of Parliament to attend to these two - day or three - day seminars so that they could be briefed properly in order that their services could be better utilized by the Members of Parliament for the development of their projects and other matters. According to the Mission and Vision of my Ministry some activities presently carried out by the Parliament should come under the purview of my Ministry as providing facilities for Members of Parliament is the main objective of my Ministry. That is a very important matter. I have already brought this to the notice of His Excellency the President, I hope in the new year it will be possible, when we compare the situation with countries such as India, Pakistan and some of the western countries, all the activities that concern the Members of Parliament are handled by the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs and not by Parliament itself because Parliament has to attend to other functions such as organizing various Committees, Parliamentary Sessions et cetera. Therefore, I have made a request ti His Excellency the President to assign the functions which are presently handled by Parliament such aw payment of salaries to Members; provision of official quarters to Members; allocation of circuit bungalows in Nuwara Eliya and other places; payment of telephone bills of Members; handling of overseas travel of Members; co-ordination of foreign delegates and donor agencies, to my Ministry. I hope His Excellency the President will consider my request. I have consulted the Ministers responsible for Parliamentary affairs in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and by request is in conformity with the practice of Parliaments in those countries. My

secretary and other officials of the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs will be able to handle the workload and I have a good team that works with commitment and dedication. I take this opportunity to congratulate the President and thank the Hon. Speaker for giving me this opportunity. I have made a very short speech. This is the first time I spoke in Parliament on these matters after being appointed as the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs. I also want to bring to the notice of the Members that we conduct seminars for the staff of the Members where a proper training is given to them on their relevant activities. We had two or three such seminars after I became the Minister and I found that it was very useful and helpful to the staff of the Members of parliament; that it could be a guidance for them to carry out their work in a very effective manner to the advantage of the Members of Parliament. Some Members made references to certain matters which do not come within the purview of any Ministry but however, I will ask my secretary who is a very efficient lady, to go through the speeches made by the Members of parliament and those which are relevant to my Ministry will be taken into consideration and we will communicate with you. If further clarification is necessary, I will ask her to contact the Members concerned. I do not think it is necessary for me to make a very long speech. I am happy about my Ministry because the Members are making full use of it. They come, meet me and my secretary and we provide them with whatever assistance they require. There are certain shortcomings that were mentioned, like the supplying of diesel. I will ask my Secretary to look into it and see that it is rectified. That is all I have got to say. Let me thank everybody for the support they have given me. May the new year bring happiness to the entire country. Thank you. [. . 12. 00] . . ( . . ) (The Hon. M. K. Eelaventhan) . . ; , ,

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! Hon. Member, your time is up. . . ( . . ) (The Hon. M. K. Eelaventhan) I will conclude in two minutes. I was allotted ten minutes. Do not adopt a stepmotherly attitude whenever I start speaking. Whether it is unpalatable for you to swallow, what I say, I do not know. We were allotted twenty minutes with ten minutes for Hon. Kissor but he spoke for only seven or eight minutes. I am pleading with you, I am not demanding as a right. I will conclude, Madam. Nobody wants a dictatorship or tyranny of the majority, said Bandaranaike. We say, with due respect to Bandaranaike, he was the first person to envisage that Sri Lanka is not a country, it is an island consisting of conflicting nations.

3555 3556

For thousands of years the Kandyan Sinhalese, the Low Country Sinhalese and Tamils have occupied clearly demarcated areas of their own preserving their language, culture and way of life intact. It is only a rash who will envisage a merger of these communities. It is not Chelvanayakam who said it, it is not Sunderalingam who said it, it is not G. G. Ponnambalam who said it, it is Bandaranaike who said it. Political compulsions stood in our way of achieving it and the country is now facing a disaster even by his own descendants, descending low in their political acumen as such. I will conclude stating some important statements. I have pleaded, pleaded and pleaded with the Canadian Prime Minister and he said, I will do what I can. Though we stand for an independent

It is in this context the Canadian Prime Minister said that he will do what he can and I said, if by chance - ( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! . . ( . . ) (The Hon. M. K. Eelaventhan) I will conclude, only one more sentence. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is up. . . ( . . ) (The Hon. M. K. Eelaventhan) Only one more sentence, Madam. The Canadian Government should now exert its political and moral pressure to make the Sri Lanka Government agree to it but the Sri Lanka Government is adamant not to yield to them. They have to recognize the de facto Government of the Tamils and make a de jure recognition. Thank you, Madam, for your liberality.

[. . 2.59] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Chairman, I am happy to take part in the Discussion of the Votes of the Ministries being taken up this afternoon and I proposed to confine myself to the Votes of the Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils. I want to raise, with the Hon. Minister and with the Government, a very important question in regard to the present state of the North-Eastern Provincial Council. As everybody know, Sir, the North-Eastern region in this country, is a predominantly Tamil linguistic region. All the districts in the Northern Province and the Eastern Province are predominantly Tamil speaking even today. They are contiguous and formed a contiguous Tamil speaking territory. This has been so historically. It has been so for centuries and even today that is unquestionably the real position. It was for this reason Sir, that when the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement was signed on the 29th of July 1987, the Accord stated, inter alia that Sri Lanka is a multi ethnic, multi-lingual plural society consisting, inter alia of Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims and Burghers that each ethnic group has a distinct cultural and linguistic identity which has to be carefully nurtured; that the Northern and Eastern Provinces have been areas of historical habitations of the Sri Lankan Tamil speaking people who have at all times hither to lived together in this territory with other ethnic groups. That was what the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord of the 29th July 1987 stated. In fact Sir, I might mention you honour, that ever since the inception of the Federal Party, in the

late 1940s and ever since the Tamil speaking people, particularly the Tamil people began accepting the policies of the Federal Party which unfortunately were not accepted by all, Otherwise, this country may not be embroiled in the present crisis that we are facing today. From 1956, the Tamil people, in fact, the Tamil speaking people initially have supported the position in regard to a North-Eastern region. A Tamil linguistic North-Eastern region had been the entire foundation on which the political demands, the political aspirations of the Tamil people in particular and the Tamil speaking people were in fact constructed. This position was even accepted in the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact of 1957 because Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact of 1957 contemplated that regions in the Northern Province and the Eastern Province could amalgamate beyond provincial boundaries. I might mention to your honour, that consequent to the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord and the acceptance by UNP of that position, this position has been accepted by successive SLFP Governments. The UNP has accepted it. The SLFP has accepted it. In fact, President Mahinda Rajapaksa when he was a Minister and Prime Minster in the Governments of Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike Kuamratunga - when she was the President - had accepted this position. It is irrefutable that both major political parties in this country, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the United National Party have accepted this position as contained in the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord. That is beyond question. In fact Sir, I might mention to you that the Tamil linguistic regions in the North- Eastern parts of this country constitute the cornerstone of the peace process. And it is our submission that if this cornerstone is removed the peace process would be irretrievably damaged. In fact the peace process would crumble because even the Tamil moderates would find it difficult to be supportive of a peace process which does not contemplate a North-Eastern region. I must mention that even prior to the presidential election, President Mahinda Rajapaksa did not in any part of his manifesto refer to the dismantling of the North-Eastern region. He had no mandate from the country to dismantle the North-Eastern region. Before the elections he had signed certain pacts with the JHU and the JVP and not even in those pacts was there any reference to the dismantling of the North-Eastern region. Therefore, it must be assumed that even as President Rajapaka went that was not a policy position that he enunciated before the people prior to the last Presidential election. Sir, it is very strange that after President Mahinda Rajapaksa was elected President and after 18 years the JVP went to the Supreme Court and challenged the merger of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces on certain grounds and the challenge was in fact launched by persons who were not historical inhabitants of the Eastern Province. The Northern and the Eastern Provinces were merged on the basis that the Northern and the Eastern Provinces constituted areas which have been historically inhabited by the Tamil speaking people. But

3607 3608

the persons who launched the challenge in the court were not historical inhabitants of the Northern Province or the Eastern Province. Subsequent to the judgement of the court which I shall refer to in a short while the President invited us for a meeting and we had a meeting with the President and in the course of that meeting we requested the President to bring to Parliament the necessary legislation to deal with this question so as to rectify the so called irregularity which had been pointed out in the judgement of the Supreme Court. Subsequent to our meeting with the President, in fact I have written to the President inviting his attention to the request we made to him and reminding him of the need to bring to Parliament the necessary legislation to cure the so called irregularity that the Supreme Court had referred to in the course of that judgement. We have had no response from the President. In fact the Prime Minister in the course of the statement that he made in Parliament in regard to this judgement of the court on the 7th of November, 2006 amongst other proposals, also mentioned the possibility of bringing to Parliament the necessary legislation so as to rectify the so called error referred to by the Supreme Court and to restore the merger of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. But unfortunately such legislation has not been brought to Parliament. I referred to all these matters, Sir, in great detail in the course of earlier speeches I have made on the floor of this House which are available in the Hansards and therefore it is not my intention to speak at length on this matter today. But I do want to mention that now we see an attempt to dismantle this merger and institutionalize the so called demerger in a very devious way. I want to caution all concerned that this is the only achievement that the Tamil people were able to register through the Indo - Sri Lanka Accord and it was achieved because it was recognized both by the Sri Lankan Government and by the Indian Government that this was the legitimate aspiration of the Tamil-speaking people, the Tamil people in particular and that for over 50 years the people had struggled to bring about this situation. The people in the course of successive democratic verdicts at successive elections have supported this position and therefore this was the legitimate demand which have to be recognized. It would be my serious submission, Sir, that any effort -

( ) (The Chairman)

Hon. Sampanthan, you may bring your speech to a conclusion.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

I have got 25 minutes, Sir.

( ) (The Chairman)

The twenty three minutes that was allocated is now over.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Twenty three? ( ) (The Chairman) Yes. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Sir, I have got more time. I started at 3 oclock, you have got it wrong. I started at 3 oclock. ( ) (The Chairman) Okay, you continue. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I will finish soon, Sir. I would very earnestly appeal to the Government to kindly bear in mind - ( ) (The Chairman) My apologies, you have started at 2.59 p.m. You can continue. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) That is all right, Sir. I would very strongly appeal to the Government to bear this in mind and to realize that this is not a matter which can be treated in any light or flippant way because that would destroy completely the entire foundation of the peace process. The President told us, In fact, I am not for the demerger. I want the merger to continue. But this judgement has been unfortunately delivered by the court. The President had told the Prime Minister of India when he met the Prime Minister in Cuba in Havana in September, 2006 that he had instructed the Attorney-General to go to the judgement of the Supreme Court and ensure that the merger was not dismantled and to ensure that the merger would continue, when the Prime Minister of India impressed upon the President that the merger of Northern and Eastern Provinces must not be dismantled unless it be done in terms of the Indo - Sri Lanka Accord. The Co-Chairs have, in the course of several statements that they have made on different occasions which I have referred to verbatim, in the course of my earlier speeches, referred to the fact that the merger of the North-Eastern

[ . ]

2007 13 3609 3610

region was fundamental to the peace process and there must not be any disturbance of that arrangement until peace is finally brought about. This has been the view of the international community. This has been the view of the regional power. This has been the view of the superpower. Even the United States of America, in the course of statements they have made, very clearly referred to the fact and stated that the merger must be sustained, that the merger is very relevant and forms the entire framework within which peace can be achieved in this country and that the Tamil linguistic North-Eastern region is the foundation upon which the peace process can be structured. Therefore, Sir, if disregarding the advice of all these countries, international community, India, the United States of America, the Co-Chairs, and in defiance of the legitimate aspirations of the Tamil speaking people, Tamil people in particular, anything was to be done to institutionalize the so-called demerger, it will be my duty to point out, that would be a tragedy and that would be a tremendous setback to the pursuance of the peace process in this country in a meaningful way. I want to raise a question, Sir, if the whole of Sri Lanka can be one country and if all of us can be together in the whole of Sri Lanka and look upon the whole of Sri Lanka as our country, why can that the Tamil linguistic region in this country - the North-Eastern region which has been historically and traditionally, incontrovertibly and indisputably a majority Tamil speaking territory - not be looked upon as one unit of governance within the framework of a united country? This is the question that we have to pose. We have to caution the Government that if the Tamil speaking people in this country are going to be denied of that legitimate fundamental right, then, you are really, I think, stating that you have no problems with the dismemberment of this country. That would be the ultimate position. We are concerned about the rights of the Muslims who live in the North-Eastern region. We must necessarily come to very satisfactory arrangements acceptable to the Muslim people in regards to their rights of the North-Eastern region. We are concerned about the rights of the Sinhalese people who live in the North-Eastern region. There can be no question about it that the rights of the Sinhalese people will also have to be protected. We do not want to do to the Sinhalese people what has been done to us in the whole country. Certainly not. We will never be a party to any such step. They must be given their legitimate position. They must be given absolute equality in the North-Eastern region. But the North-Eastern region, a majority Tamil linguistic region comprising of districts in everyone of which the majority people are the Tamil speaking people, is, in my view, something on which there can be no compromise, there will be no compromise. I would therefore appeal to the Government to be extremely cautious in regard to this matter and not to take any step to institutionalize the so-called demerger.

I would like to state one word about a judgement of the Supreme Court, Sir. It was a judgement delivered by an old Sinhala Court, I am sorry to say, the judges comprised of only Sinhalese. This was a very sensitive question dealing with the rights of different people. As I told you before, the persons who went and challenged the constitution of the merger on the basis that there had been some irregularity in regard to the manner of the merger, were not historical inhabitants. That merger was brought about on the basis that the North and the East were the area of historical habitation of the Tamil speaking people. The persons, who went and challenged the merger, were not historical inhabitants and three historical inhabitants went to court at the moment to intervene and to be heard in regard to the application of the petitioners. But unfortunately they were not given the right to be heard; they were not fully heard. A judgement was delivered against the historical inhabitants without their case being heard and as far as the Tamil speaking people are concerned and as far as the Tamil people are concerned we do not think that justice was done to us in that case. Justice was not really done, justice did not even seem to be done and it is our contention that justice was not done in this case. Unfortunately there should be no appeal against that judgment because that is a judgment of the Supreme Court. But I would certainly call upon the Government to look upon this matter as a political question dealing with the fundamental rights of historical inhabitants of this country. We, who have a distinct linguistic and cultural identity, want to preserve, protect, nurture and foster that linguistic and cultural identity and I would, in that context, very strongly and earnestly submit that if you want to preserve the unity and territorial integrity of this country. You are under a bounden duty to recognize, to accept and to protect and preserve that linguistic and cultural identity of the Tamil speaking people in the North Eastern region. Well, if you violate that you are violating the basic premise upon which the unity and territorial integrity of this whole country can be built. I want to make that point, Sir, very clearly and very firmly on the Floor of this House and want convey to the Government and would earnestly request the Hon. Minister to kindly bear this in mind, not to take any steps that will result in the peace process being reduced to naught. I am sorry to also observe, Sir, that some very ugly methods are being adopted to push through some policies of the Government particularly in the Eastern Province as of now. I have spoken on some of the matters at great length when the Votes on the Ministry of Human Rights were taken up yesterday. We are persons who believe in democracy; we are persons who believe in pluralism; we are persons who believe that the rule of law must be sustained and that rule of law is supreme and that is the sovereign right of all the people in this country. But very unfortunately some of the methods that are being resorted to - I saw the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella, the Military

3611 3612

Spokesman of the Government on TV last evening giving an interview in regard to the plight of some of the relations of the Members of Parliament who have been abducted and who have been held hostage and those Members of Parliament have been compelled to vote in a certain way. I thought the Minister was being very nonchalant, very irresponsible and, I am sorry to say, very flippant in the way he dealt with that question. It is a very serious matter affecting the rights of Colleagues in this House who were to be elected as Members of Parliament. I do not think, Sir, the Government should think that the problems of the Tamil speaking people can be dealt with in that way. ( ) (The Chairman) Thank you, hon. Member . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I am finishing up, Sir. Only yesterday the Leader of the Ceylon Muslim Congress and his colleagues crossed the Floor of this House on account of the way in which they are being treated in the Eastern Province. When they have done so if you can claim some other persons to state that the Rajapaksa Government in what they desire at this very moment that is not something which anybody in this world would believe. Sir, I want you to be very careful. Please bear this in mind. Do not think you can institutionalize the so-called de-merger. I want to appeal to you to bring to Parliament the necessary legislation to rectify the so-called error. The Supreme Court has talked about to restore the merger in keeping with the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord. Thank you, Sir.
