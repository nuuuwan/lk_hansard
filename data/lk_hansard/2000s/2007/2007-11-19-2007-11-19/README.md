: . . : . () . PRIVILEGE: ABDUCTION OF SON-IN-LAW OF HON. T. KANAGASABAI AND WITHDRAWAL OF SECURITY OF HON. (MISS) THANGESWARY KADIRGAMAN AND HON. P. ARIYANETHRAN

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Hon. Speaker, may I with your leave, raise a matter of Privilege relating to three Members of Parliament of the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi, the Hon. T. Kanagasabai, the Hon. (Miss) Thangeswary Kadirgaman and the Hon. P. Ariyanethran representing the Batticaloa District Yesterday, Sir, on the 18th of November, 2007 around 2.00 p.m. the Hon. Kanagasabais son-in-law, Mr. Sasikaran was abducted by a paramilitary group functioning in Batticaloa and taken away from the house of the Hon. Kanagasabai. Thereafter, messages have been conveyed to the Hon. Kanagasabai that the fate of his son-in-law, Mr. Sasikaran, would depend upon the manner in which the Hon. Kanagasabai conducts himself in regard to the vote to be taken this evening in Parliament on the Appropriation Bill, 2008. It would be relevant to mention that the Hon. Kanagasabais son-in-law, Mr. Sasikaran, was abducted in this way when there were police guards on duty at the house of the Hon. Kanagasabai. Shortly thereafter, the police guards on duty in the houses of Members of Parliament, the Hon. (Miss) Thangeswary

1237 1238

[ . ]

Kadirgaman and the Hon. P. Ariyanethran in Batticaloa were suddenly withdrawn. Immediately after the police guards were withdrawn, members of this paramilitary group entered the houses of these two Members of Parliament and informed the occupants of the houses that their future would depend upon how these two Members of Parliament acted in regard to the Vote on the Appropriation Bill, 2008 to be taken this evening in this House. These messages of intimidation have also been conveyed telephonically to the three Members of Parliament. This constitutes a serious interference with the independence of judgment of the Members of Parliament in regard to how they should conduct themselves in this House. As a matter of fact, Sir, the Parliamentary Group of Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi has met on two occasions recently and taken a decision in regard to how we should vote on the Appropriation Bill, and that decision is to be ratified at the Parliamentary Group Meeting to be held this afternoon at 12.00 oclock. On receiving this information, Sir, from the Members of Parliament, I made every effort to contact the President but unfortunately the President was busy with the Parliamentary Group Meeting and then subsequently with some religious ceremonies, I was told. But last night at 11.30 p.m. the President called me on the telephone and I have conveyed to him what happened in regard to these three Members of Parliament and requested the President to take appropriate action to ensure that Mr. Sasikaran, the son-in-law of the Hon. Kanagasabai, is released and that the threat held out to the three Members of Parliament does not continue and that these Members of Parliament are allowed to exercise their judgment independently when the Vote is taken on the Appropriation Bill. The President initially told me that there was an effort being made to malign him but when I requested him to take appropriate action in regard to this matter, he said that he would do so. A few minutes later, Mr. Lalith Weeratunga, the Secretary to the President, called me and requested me to ask the Members of Parliament affected to speak to him and gave me his mobile telephone number. Subsequently, one Member of Parliament, on behalf of the all three Members of Parliament, spoke to Mr. Weeratunga and conveyed to him as to what had really happened in regard to these three Members of Parliament. We do not know, Sir, what action has been taken. But Mr. Sasikaran, continues to be in the custody of this paramilitary group; he has not been released. This, Sir, is a very serious situation. It constitutes a grievous assault on the rights and Privileges of Hon. Members of Parliament who have been called upon to exercise their judgment in regard to an important Vote to be taken in the House this evening, the Vote on the Appropriation Bill for 2008. It also constitutes a grave infringement on the Rights and Privileges of all Members of Parliament because this may happen to any Member of Parliament. Mr. Speaker, you are the custodian of the Rights and Privileges of the Members of Parliament and

we look upon you to take appropriate action to safeguard the rights of these Members and enable them to freely come to Parliament and act in keeping with their own independent judgement. We shall be grateful, Sir, if you would take appropriate action in regard to this very serious matter forthwith and kindly keep this House informed of the action taken by you. Thank you, Sir. ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Mr. Speaker, in addition to the facts stated by the Hon. Sampanthan, I must also state that yesterday, a group of armed personnel alleged to be from the army entered the estate house of one of our Members of Parliament, the Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka. Fortunately, the Hon. Member happened to be in Colombo. All these together constitute not merely an infringement on the rights of the Members of the House in carrying out their duties but this is a clear indication where people are deprived of security. And more so, in the case the of Hon. Kanagasabai, the Pillayan group, as we all know, is funded and comes under the direction of the Ministry of Defence. I mean, that is not a secret. The recent disputes in the Karuna group alone have revealed all these. So it is a very serious matter and this is not only an assault on the Privileges of this House, it is also an assault on democracy because the Hon. Members of this House represent the people. They have a duty to safeguard the sovereignty of this House and of the people and if those who are there to protect the sovereignty of the people are brought under pressure, then how can the peoples rights be safeguarded? When the Hon. Members are deprived of security by the police; when the army comes into the house of a Member of Parliament and when a family member of an Hon. Member of Parliament is abducted, I must tell this House that that is a very dangerous precedent. There are times when Members of this House have lost their lives. But I must say one thing: no one has ever deliberately at any time, aimed at the families of Members of this House. If you break it, then you have broken it once and for all and everyone on both sides will find not only themselves - we have enough problems safeguarding ourselves - but their families also under threat. I must remind the House that if you start a precedent, others are going to follow it. That affects everyone here. That affects the people because this is an assault on democracy. It only establishes what we have been saying; that there is a gradual decline of democracy and you might find with this type of action the termination of democracy. Then, if the Government Members say it is not so, let them all get together and

2007 19 1239 1240

see that Mr. Sasikaran is got at today. The Eastern Province is under the control of the Sri Lanka Armed Forces. At the Emergency Debate, the Prime Minister and the Members had said so. Then how can this happen? Why were they not caught? This is not like Wanni where you find areas under the control of the LTTE where the army cannot go. Here, everything is under the control of the army. So why can you not find the offenders ?

( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) , . . . . ? . . . , ? . . 12 . 12 . . . - [ ] . . . , . . . . . . , . , . . . . [ ] ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, if you had listened to my speech, you would have observed that I never made reference to what is happening today. The Hon. Sampanthan in his speech, referred to the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill. I said that the Members of Parliament are being prevented from carrying out their duties as Members of Parliament. You can check my speech now. I made no reference of today's Vote at all. And, certainly when I referred to one of our Members, I did not refer at all to the Vote today. I

said the Members are being prevented from carrying out their duties. So, why is the Hon. Member getting excited? - [Interruption.] I never referred to it. Why are you getting excited?

( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) [ ] 2004 ? ? ? [ ] - [ ] , ? . , , , , . [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I am very happy that the Hon. Minister has admitted that they are dealing with the Karuna group. As far as I am concerned, Karuna has said everything to the British authorities and today the UK Government is aware of everything that Karuna has done. So let us not argue here. All I referred to was what the Karuna faction had said in the media about the Pillayan group. I did not refer to anything else. That is an allegation made by that group. And much more than that, as already been admitted by Karuna, as I understand, to the authorities in the United Kingdom, there is a separate investigation as to how he got there and about the third party. I do not want to go into that matter nor into the Vote to be taken up today. All I am saying is, Members of Parliament must be allowed to carry out their duties and if their families are being subjected to threat - today it may be on one Member of the TNA, very soon it can be on the Government side or on the UNP side and others - are you allowing that? That is the main issue. If the Government says that they are not involved - I only said that the Ministry of Defence does something, I did not say the Government does it. What the Ministry of Defence does, sometimes the Minister and others may or may not know. I do not know. That is a different matter. But as far as I am concerned, now Karuna has admitted and made his own confession. So, why do you not get Mr. Sasikaran back today because this area is controlled by the army. How can you intimidate Members like this?

, , , . . ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Mervyn Silva - Minister of Labour) , . - [ ] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Hon. Speaker, my assertion is that the police guards at the house of the Hon. K. Thangeswary and the Hon. P. Ariyanethran were withdrawn last afternoon around 2.00 o' clock and that it was thereafter that this group of persons went into those houses and uttered those threats. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) . The Hon. Ariyanethran is living in Colombo. His security has not been withdrawn. He is living in Colombo. Everybody is living in Colombo. All the Members of Parliament from the Eastern Province, especially from the Batticaloa, Ampara and Trincomalee Districts are living in Colombo. They are not living in Batticaloa. They are not living in Ampara. They are not living in Trincomalee. They have been living here for the last one and a half years. Sir, their security has not been withdrawn. Do not make that allegation against the Government. Their security in Colombo has not been withdrawn. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Kanagasabais son-in-law has been abducted in - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) . The Government cannot provide security for the sons-in-law. We do not have enough security personnel to supply security to sons-in-law, fathers-in-law, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law of Members of Parliament. You are talking about the Members of Parliament. We have not withdrawn any security personnel from the personal security of the Members of Parliament. Do not make that allegation against the Government. . . . ( ) ( . . . - , ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne - Minister of Power and Energy) Families of the Members of Parliament are not entitled to security.

( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) Our families are not entitled to security. My wife is not entitled to security. Our sisters and brothers are not entitled to security. So you cannot blame the Government. It is unfair for you to make allegations against the Government.

PRIVILEGE : ATTEMPT TO PREVENT ATTENDANCE IN PARLIAMENT ( ) (The Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka) Hon. Speaker, thank you for giving me this opportunity to raise this question of Privilege. Yesterday, Sunday, 18th November 2007, a jeep carrying five army personnel in uniform with weapons had come looking for

me at about 4.30 p.m. at our estate house in Kolaweinigama, Deniyaya. One officer had entered through the front door whilst another had entered through the back door at the same time. They had asked for, " ". Only the domestic was at home and on being told that I was not there, after a little more questioning of my whereabouts, they had left. There was no need for any military personnel to come to the estate and look for me. The one and only one inference possible, when they entered the house from both sides with their weapons, is to prevent me from coming to Parliament and block me from carrying out my duties as a Member of Parliament. Since 2006, Members of Parliament are coming under threat and I too would have been in grave danger had I been in Deniyaya as I usually do over the weekends. This action amounts to a breach of Privilege in this House and its Members. I request you to inquire into this matter. Thank you. . . ( . . ) (The Hon. A. P.

. , , 2008 , . . ; . . , , , . . . , . . [ .] [ .] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] . , , . . [ ] . . . ; . . . . , . . [.. 12.42] . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, at the very outset I would like to state that I am privileged to be the last speaker on behalf of my Party, the Tamil National Alliance, in this Debate. In fact I should say that this Debate has been proceeding on a basis that is unprecedented in the history of this august Assembly in that, we have been witnessing generally a rather dry and dull Debate. In spite of that, I should state the fact that the Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe acting in accordance with his conscience has made a bold decision to cross over to the ranks of the Opposition and thereby has given a glimmer of hope that the quality of political leadership in this country could be maintained at any cost, come what may. I would like to place on record, Mr. Deputy Chairman, my congratulations, my appreciation and my admiration for the political honesty that has been displayed by the Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe in his having taken this considered decision in accordance with his conscience.

Now coming to the Debate, Mr. Deputy Chairman, what has been presented to this House by His Excellency the President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance is a war Budget with 20 per cent of the expenditure having being allocated for defence purposes. I cannot help saying that it is nothing but a war Budget. The Government headed by His Excellency the President, if I could put it rather in practical constitutional terms, is hell-bent on a military agenda with the hope that it would be able to find a military solution to the national question of this beautiful island of Sri Lanka. Very many people in the past have tried that. They have failed miserably. I should state that the same fate would befall His Excellency the President also in his futile attempt to thrust a military solution down the throat of the Tamil nation in this country by still pursuing a purposeless and a futile military campaign to capture the territory that is in the hands of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Sir, we, the Tamil National Alliance, have decided to oppose this Budget to the hilt for the reason that it is a war Budget, a Budget that is submitted with the sole purpose of pushing this country further and further into a bloodbath by killing not only innocent youths on both sides of the ethnic divide, but also innocent Tamil-speaking civilians in the North-East and by resorting to various methods including senseless aerial bombardment in the Wanni region that is in the hands of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. I would say, Sir, that sooner or later the Government would be forced to realize that this is a futile exercise and there would be no other way than to seek a peaceful resolution of the ethnic conflict through a political dialogue with the accredited representatives of the Tamil people, namely the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. We are not the proxy for anybody. I would like to say that categorically. If, at all, we are a proxy for anybody, that is for our people - the Tamil people of this country who want their national aspirations to be fulfilled through a peaceful resolution of the ethnic conflict. Now, there is much talk about the possibility of crossovers from either side. I do not want to say anything other than the fact that the Government or rather some leaders of the Government have been pushed to the extent of trying to ensure that some of the Members of my Party representing the Batticaloa District are not present today to vote against the Budget. It very clearly shows the extent of frustration that has crept into the ranks of the Government at this critical juncture of the Debate. It is a shameless exercise, Sir, to use murderers - mercenaries in the Eastern Province to threaten, to intimidate and to blackmail elected Representatives representing the Tamil people of the Batticaloa District and belonging to the Tamil National Alliance from coming to this House and casting their votes in

1289 1290

accordance with their conscience. This is nothing but rigging the voting that is going to take place in a few hours time in this august Assembly. This is, to say the least, a shameful exercise on the part of the Government that is tottering and the days of which, I am very confidently asserting, are numbered. If it is not today, it will be tomorrow and if it will not be tomorrow, it would be the day after. I find that my good Friends of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, for whom I have the highest regard, have not disclosed their position or rather their stand in relation to this Budget. I can see some of my good Friends of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna present here. We are opposed to the Budget and the main party in the Opposition, the United National Party, is opposed to the Budget. I find that the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna is also opposed to the Budget. But the reasons are different. We are opposed for the reason that this is a war Budget. ( ) (An Hon. Member) Who brought about the war? . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) We are opposed also for the reason that this adds to the burden of the poor and the downtrodden people of this country irrespective of the fact whether they be Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Burghers, Malays or any other ethnic community. I find the United National Party opposed to this Budget for certain solid reasons and also, I find that my good Friends of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna opposed to this Budget for the reason that there is nothing in it. This is an empty Budget. So, irrespective of our stand or irrespective of the reasons that have made us to take our own stand in relation to this Budget, I find, Sir, that there is a concurrence of positions and a confluence of views. Therefore, I tell my good Friends of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, this is the time to act. You have to decide whether you are on this side or that side. In other words, you have got to decide whether you are with the poor, downtrodden and oppressed people of this country, whether they be Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims or Malays or whether you are with a Government that is well-known for its rampant corruption, that is well-known for its political opportunism, in that, having paved the way for the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, the party that was mainly responsible for the resounding victory of His Excellency the President at the last Presidential Election, to leave the ranks of the Government, the Government ranks have enticed some Members of the UNP exploiting the internal dissensions in the UNP and thereby, somehow or other, mustered a political majority for the time being in this House. The

Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna should decide now. Either it is now or never. The reasons may be different. Let us get together because this Government, this thankless Government Party, forgetting the fact that it was able to come to power climbing on your mighty, able shoulders, have created a situation for you to leave. In other words, you have been thrown out, lock, stock and barrel and now it is a time for you to give back, to pay back in the same coin. I do not want to say anything about the Gentlemen who had been with the Government like my good Friend, my young Friend, the son of my erstwhile political Colleague for whom I have the highest regard, whom I supported at the 1994 Presidential Elections till his very last moment, the Hon. Navin Dissanayake. I do not want to say anything now. For some reason or other, they have crossed over. I can understand that. But this Government, forgetting the fundamentals of democracy, have gone to the extent of enticing frustrated Members from the UNP exploiting the internal dissensions and shamelessly, I repeat, Sir, shamelessly, cowardly, crudely and extraordinarily, ensured a majority. I can understand my good Friend, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem crossing over because as a party Leader, he made the decision. Being an honourable Gentleman he did it and he is entitled to that and I am awaiting the day to receive him warmly with my both hands. If it is not today, it would be sooner or rather later. But, exploiting internal dissensions in a party for its own advantage by a Government party, which has forgotten the service rendered by a constituent member of its own Alliance and forced it to part ways, is something, I would say, that cannot be easily forgiven by anybody who respects the fundamentals of democracy, who respects the philosophy of democracy and who respects the concept of democracy in this country. Sir, we are now at the crossroads. This Government is going to fall. Very many tactics are being employed: buying people, trading in the so-called "patriotism". I do not want to go into details because I do not want to embarrass anybody. I found the other day, one of my good Friends in the Government ranks, a Minister in that, telling the JVP or rather reminding the JVP about the brutal assassination of our good friend Rohana Wijeweera. I can understand that. I think my memory is still okay; I think my memory is all right and if I remember right, there was also a Member belonging to the SLFP, coming from one of the leading families from Sabaragamuwa, the Hon. Nalanda Ellawala.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , . . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) Sir, I am winding up in a moment. Forgetting the Hon. Nalanda Ellawala, the leaders of the Government

[ . ]

2007 19 1291 1292

5 PL 002683 (2007/12)

ranks are trying shamelessly to remind the JVP about Rohana Wijeweera. This is the state of affairs - no qualms of conscience, no commitment, no policy, no programme, but addiction to power, a desire to cling on to power at any cost. That is where this Government is. On behalf of the oppressed Tamil people, on behalf of the Tamil people to whom political justice has been denied since the British masters left this country with their bags and baggages on the 4th of February 1948, we call upon all the forces in this country and all the democratic forces present in this House, represented in this House, whether that be this side or that side, to join ranks and throw this Government lock, stock and barrel now, now itself into the dustbin of history to which it should rightfully belong. I thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) ! [.. 12.57] ( )

( - , ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem-Minister of Posts and Telecommunication) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, it is my pleasure to say a few words on this final day of the Second Reading of the Budget. I am equally glad to follow my Friend, the Hon. Sri Kantha, who made a very eloquent speech, a quite passionate one and in the meantime, he also extended a very kind invitation to me to join their ranks. While thanking him for all his sentiments, I must very categorically say that the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress does not wish to be identified with the current trend of events which has certainly made every single soul in this House quite unhappy. None of us are quite content with what is happening in the political arena today. It appears that most of us are quite restless and insecure. We should blame no one but ourselves for this situation. Unfortunately, it appears that we all have become saleable commodities with price tags and the masses out there have much superior values than those of ours and this is what everyone is talking on the roads. The Hon. Sri Kantha referred to the JVP and their stand to delay their announcement until the final hours of this Debate. In fact, they have added excitement to this drama by doing so. Until last evening, the SLMC was also thought to be engaging itself in such a speculative drama by delaying its announcement. But, Sir, I made our

stand very clear to His Excellency the President yesterday when he thought to address the Members of the Government Group and referred to many Hon. Members by name saying that so-and-so and so-and-so are the people who have been listed to cross ranks. Then, he very categorically said, I for myself do not believe that any of these people would do so since I have all the confidence in them. My disagreements with His Excellency on many issues is quite legendary. I have on many occasions been at cross purposes with the Head of the Government in whose Cabinet I am serving and quite unsurprisingly, he left me out of the lot of names he referred to yesterday. So, thereafter, when he finished I got up and told him, If Rauff Hakeem was thought to be speculated as a person who is going to cross over tomorrow, you as well as the general public would believe so. That is how the media has built up an expectation and perhaps created the image as if I was a prodigal son of this Government. Be that as it may, Sir, the high command of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress which met on Friday, after having long deliberations, decided to entrust the responsibility of making the decision to the leadership on the eve of the Vote. But, I felt that it was incumbent on me to bring an end to this speculation hence others would feed on it. The responsibility cast on me as an Hon. Member of the Government is to be straightforward, which I have always been. As I told you before, I have had my disagreements with this Government on many issues. But the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress is a principled party and we make decisions on such principles and, therefore, we cannot be seen to be opportunistic cashing in on this speculative climate and trying to win over perks and privileges. I was quite saddened, Mr. Deputy Chairman, yesterday some of the newspapers had alluded to me as if I am going behind the Government asking for more perks and privileges for myself and other Members in the Government. I must very categorically say, Mr. Deputy Chairman, we do have grievances. I am sure many others in the Government also have grievances. But, for that reason I do not think, as the Hon. Sri Kantha told the JVP today, that you must make a decision right away and tell them as if either you are with us or with them. This "Bush Doctrine" has been tested so many times. Sometimes, some Members in this Government and also the JVP keep telling us about following the same doctrine in relation to terrorism in this country: either you are with the terrorists or with the Government. There have been many occasions where the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress had been with neither. We have had our own point of view. And, in this case we must say that we have made a decision based on principles. We have many issues unresolved, many grievances of the community which need to be addressed by the Government and in that regard we must also be quite critical of the conduct of the two main parties. The two main parties have resorted

1293 1294

to the most disgraceful tactics as if their whole life depends on power. We have come here to serve the people and we will not have any title or power in our graves. Politicians have become a laughing-stock of the people due to what the two principal parties are doing. It is a miracle that nobody was killed given the desperation by both parties these few days. Sir, I noticed the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa this morning who very sarcastically took a swipe at the state of affairs in this House saying - he referred to it in Sinhala. It is better said in Sinhala. " '' . " . Therefore, Sir, I say very categorically that the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress is not going to be a party to wait until the last moment and quit the Government. Quit, we will do giving notice very much in advance and giving the reasons why we have to quit the Government, if at all, we have to quit. But it would be quite contrary to our principles to do so on an occasion such as this, on the last day of the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill. I quit one government earlier for the reason that I was removed from the Cabinet without assigning any reason by the then President, on totally different circumstances. As the Hon. Sri Kantha said, they are all waiting with open arms to invite us to the Opposition. But what I am saying is that this misplaced speculation regarding our support to the Budget should be totally discounted. Many of us are quite uncomfortable and uneasy about being in a Cabinet so large as it is and naturally there are issues concerning the responsibilities that should be assigned to us but those are issues that the Executive would address in due course. But what is of real -
