Sir, it is my privilege as the Chairman of the Select Committee on Electoral Reforms to present its Interim Report today. On 4th April, 2006, Parliament, moved a Motion in the House establishing this Committee to look into among other matters, a suitable electoral system for our country. As you all know, there is a public outery to reform the present electoral system which had led to many problems including the creation of unstable governments as well as embarrassment to Members of Parliament which had hampered the development process of our country. The main objective which was undertaken by this Committee was to come up with a suitable electoral system giving fair representation to minorities as well as due recognition to the voters problems by creating smaller electorates then today. You may recall during the tenure of the Fifth Parliament, a Select Committee was appointed under my Chairmanship to consider electoral reforms and an interim Report was tabled by me on 23rd January, 2004. The present Select Committee continued with the areas that were touched upon by the earlier Select Committee in great depth. The present Select Committee has had 38 meetings, over one and a half years of sittings up to the date of this Interim Report. The Committee also considered a large number of representations received from the Government, non-government professional and civil organizations and members of the public who responded to newspaper notices calling for representations. The Committee invited political parties which are represented and not represented in Parliament to make representations and submissions before the Committee. Many political parties also gave oral evidence before the Committee. Many womens organizations and the Womens Caucus of Parliament also made representations before the Committee. Assistance of the Commissioner of Elections, Secretary to the Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils, Attorney-General and Director of Department of Census and Statistics was obtained at the deliberations of the Committee. Dr. Sudantha Liyanage of the University of Sri jayawardenapura together with Mr. S. B. Rathnayake also assisted this Committee throughout its proceedings. I must also mention that the UNDP Provided research officers to assist the Committee in analysing the representations it received sequel to the newspaper advertisement. As already mentioned, the main aspect the Committee considered at its meetings was to formulate an electoral system which ensures fair representation for minority parties while making voters to be represented by small electorates than today. You may recall that the Interim Report submitted by the former Select Committee on Electoral Reforms recommeneded a Mixed System which is a combination of the First-past-the post and Proportional Representations systems. Having appled

2007 05 613 614

various formulas on the results of the past elections, to evolve ideal balance in achieving stated objectives, the Committee came up with the following recommendations. One hundred and forty Members to be elected on First-past-the-post system for an equal number of polling divisions. Seventy Members to be elected based on District Proportional Representation system. Fifteen Members to be elected on the National List. Out of the 15 National List seats, five will he allocated to the party securing the highest number of valid votes at the election. Three seats will be reserved for unrepresented minor parties who have polled a national vote exceeding the natural cut - off point but have not qualified for a seat under the First - past - the - post or District PR system. The balance number of National List scats will be apportioned based on the strength of the vote each party receives at the national level. The Committee also recommended that the provincial elections also be replaced by a mixed system of elections in line with the proposed Parliamentary elections system. The Committee has further emphasized that in demarcating electorates for the purpose of Provincial Council elections, due consideration be given to the district boundaries and the PR allocation be based on the districts which is similar to the practice followed in Parliamentary elections. The Committee has recommended that the ward system be reintroduced for Local Government elections and thirty per cent of representatives be clected under the proportional representation system. Ward committees has also been recommended so that the community participation would increase at local government level. The need for a fresh delimitation of electoral boundaries was viewed as a very vital factor by the majority who made representations before the Committee. The Committee in its Report has emphasized the importance of taking into consideration the concerns of the minorities in the delimitation process. The Committee having considered the representations made by the Womens Caucus has recommended that every third candidate nominated by a party secretary from the National List shall be a woman candidate. Following the recommendations of the earlier Select Committee, the present Select Committee has emphasized the importance of introducing an electronic voting system at the earliest. This would reduce the heavy expenditure and manpower requirements in conducting elections. The Report also recommends, the introduction of the advance voting system in place of voting by post. This would help in eliminating many discrepancies in the present postal voting system including influencing and intimidation of voters. The Committee observed that there are a large number of political parties registered with the Commissioner of Elections which are inactive. On the proposal of the

Commissioner of Elections, the Committee agreed that the laws be amended to streamline the registration process of political parties. The Committee also agreed with the Commissioner of Elections that in many other areas pertaining to elections, necessary legal reforms be brought forward to address shortcomings. These are mentioned in an Appendix to the Report. Finally, before I conclude it is my duty to express my sincere appreciation to all the Members of the Committee who actively took part in the deliberations of the Committee. I would also like to thank the Commissioner of Elections, the Secretary, Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils ; the Director - General, Department of Census and Statistics ; the Attorney - General and officials of his Department ; Dr. Sudantha Liyanage of the Sri Jayewardenpura University ; Members of Parliament and the media for the support given to the Committee. It is also my duty to thank all political parties ; Government and non Government, professional and other civil organizations and members of the public for their participation and sending representations to the Committee. My thanks also go to the UNDP for their assistance in providing research officers for the work of the Committee. I would also take this opportunity to thank the Deputy Secretary - General and all his officers and the staff of Parliament for the assistance given right throughout the proceedings of this Committee. Before I conclude, my appreciation also goes to the rest of the officials in the Parliamentary Secretariat and to you, Hon. Speaker, for giving us this opportunity to deliberate on a very important matter that will make drastic changes and help the voters in representation as well as implementation of a democratically bred system which we all would like to accept. , , . , , . , . , , , . , ; . .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, may I be heard on a point of Order ? Mr. Speaker, according to the Chairman this is a very historic occasion, that he has submitted an Interim Report. With all respect to the conventions of this House and the procedures that are adopted in the Chamber when such a Report is finalized and presented, I would also like to say a few words, not in the form of criticizing the Report. Since the Hon. Chairman has included our observations in this Report, I desist from saying anything on that. But I must say for the record that the majority of parties present in this House are not associating themselves with the findings of the Report. But as the SLMC and the CWC have filed a joint observation which the Hon. Chairman has agreed to include in the Report, I thank him for it.

. , , , . . , , . , . . . . . . , . . . . U. S & Sri Lanka Sign Mutual Services Pact (US Embassy press elease) Sri Lankan Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and U. S Ambassa-dor Robert Blake signed a logistical agreement between the two coun-tries, providing a framework for increased interoperability. The Acquisi-tion and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) will allow the United States and Sri Lanka to transfer and exchange logistics supplies, support. And re-fueling services, either in kind or at cost, during peacekeeping missions, humanitarian operations and joint exercises. The United States has ACSA agreements with 89 other countries around the world.

The categories of allowable goods and services include food, petroleum, and transportation. The provision of weapons systems or ammunition is expressly prohibited under this agreement. Each nations forces can support the other during contingencies, such as disaster relief or peace-keeping operations, which reduces the logistics requirement for each nation.

Logistics support allowed under this agreement cannot be transferred beyond the forces of the receiving party without consent of the providing party, The agreement will be in effect for ten years, and all transactions must be mutually agreed upon before any transfer is made.

ACSA will facilitate the exchange of no-lethal equipment, increase cooperation in the field and reduce the paperwork involved Ambassa-dor Blake said. For example, if the Sri Lankan Army had sent troops to assist in the Pakistani earthquake and needed winter coats for the sol-diers, under ACSA the United States could provide those winter coasts in exchange for fuel and foodstuffs the next time a U. S. Vessel made a port call in Colombo. On-the-ground cooperation between our two armed forces was evident in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster. This will enhance both nations ability to engage in disaster relief and peace-keeping missions more effectively. he added.

The number of this Agreement, US-CE-01, shall be entered on the receipt document. The supplying Party shall forward the signed receipt document to the activity authorized to accept orders under this Agreement where the signed receipt document shall be attached to the original order form by the receiving Party. 7. Logistic support, supplies, and services received through this Agreement shall not be retransferred, either temporarily or permanently, to any person other than a member of the forces of the receiving Party without the prior written consent of the supplying Party.

V. REIMBURSEMENT

1. For transfers of logistic support, supplies, and services under this Agreement, the Parties shall agree for payment either by cash (reimbursable transaction), by replacement-in-kind, or by an equal-value exchange (exchange transaction). The receiving Party shall pay the supplying Party as provided in either paragraph la. or paragraph lb. of this Article, as agreed. a. Reimbursable Transaction. The supplying Party shall submit Invoices to the receiving Party after delivery or performance of the logistic support, supplies, and services. Both Parties shall provide for the payment of all transactions and each Party shall invoice the other Party at least once every 3 months for all completed transactions not previously invoiced. Invoices shall be accompanied by necessary support documentation and shall be paid within 30 days of the date prepared. In pricing a reimbursable transaction, the Parties agree to the following reciprocal pricing principles: (1) In the case of specific acquisition by the supplying Party from its contractors on behalf of a receiving Party, the price shall be no less favorable than the price charged the armed forces by the contractor of the supplying Party for identical items or services, less any amounts excluded by Article VI of this Agreement. The price charged may take into account differentials due to delivery schedules, points of delivery, and other similar considerations. (2) In the case of Transfer from the supplying Partys own resources, the supplying Party shall charge the same price it charges its own forces for identical logistic support, supplies, and services, as of the date delivery or performance occurs, less amounts excluded by Article VI of this Agreement. In any case where a price has not been established or charges are not made for ones own forces, the Parties shall agree on a price in advance, excluding charges that are precluded under these reciprocal pricing principles. However, in the case of items, the price shall be no less than the supplying Partys acquisition cost. b. Exchange Transaction. Exchange transactions may be by replacement-in-kind or equal-value-exchange. Both Parties shall maintain records of all transactions. The receiving Party shall pay by transferring to the supplying Party logistic support, supplies, and services that are agreed between the Parties to be in kind or of equal monetary value to the logistic support, supplies, and services delivered or performed by the supplying Party. If the receiving Party does not complete the exchange within the terms of a replacement schedule

agreed to or in effect at the time of the original transaction, which may not exceed one (1) year from the date of the original transaction, the transaction shall be deemed reimbursable and governed by paragraph 1 a above, except that the price shall be established using actual or estimated prices in effect on the date payment would otherwise have been due. c. Establishment of Price or Value. The following reciprocal pricing principles shall apply: The price established for inventory stock material shall be the supplying Partys stock list price. The price for new procurement shall be the same price paid to the contractor or vendor by the supplying Party. The price for in-shop repair or technical assistance services rendered shall be based on the supplying Partys standard price or, if not applicable, a price equal to only the direct costs associated with providing the services, for example, supply stock list prices and actual labor charges. The price for services rendered in a temporary duty status shall be based on the individuals actual per diem and transportation costs, plus payroll costs for civilian labor. Prices charged shall exclude all taxes and duties which the receiving Party is exempted from paying under other agreements which the Parties have concluded. Upon request, the Parties agree to provide information sufficient to verify that these reciprocal pricing principles have been followed and that prices do not include waived or excluded costs. d. Means of Payment. The following means of payment shall be acceptable: (1) Payment-in-cash. Payment shall be made in the currency of the supplying Party or as otherwise agreed in the Order. (2) Replacement-in-kind. When Replacement-in-kind is used as the method of payment, the receiving Party shall replace or return supplies in the same condition and conforming to the same configuration as the supplies provided by the supplying Party, or, if so agreed, a later configuration within one year of receipt. The receiving Party is responsible for negotiating return transportation and delivery to the location designated by the supplying Party at the time of request. If the receiving Party does not replace or return supplies within one year, payment must be in cash. (3) Equal-value-exchange. To the extent possible, when Equal-value-exchange is the desired method of payment, prior to the provision of the requested support, both Parties shall agree on the goods and services that shall be accepted for payment and their value. If the receiving Party does not provide the agreed upon goods or services to the supplying Party within one year of the original transaction, the method of payment shall convert to Payment-in-cash. 2. When a definitive price for the Order is not agreed to in advance, the Order, pending agreement on final price, shall set forth a maximum liability for the Party ordering the logistic support, supplies, and services. The Parties shall then promptly enter into negotiation to establish the final price. 3. POCs for payments and collections for each Party are identified in annexes to this Agreement. 4. Logistic support, supplies, and services that are available for a lesser price under another agreement shall be priced under this Agreement at the lower price. VI. WAIVED OR EXCLUDED COSTS Insofar as national laws and regulations permit, the Parties shall ensure that any readily identifiable duties, taxes, and similar charges are not imposed on activities conducted under this Agreement. The Parties shall cooperate to provide proper documentation to maximize tax and customs relief. The provisions of any applicable tax and customs relief agreements shall also apply under this Agreement. The Parties shall inform each other whether the price charged for logistic support, supplies, or services includes taxes or duties. In determining whether duties, taxes and similar charges should be levied, the pricing principles in section V, and in particular section V, paragraph 1, subparagraph c, shall govern the value of the support, supplies, or services provided by the supplying Party.

( ) (The Presiding Member) . . [.. 3.12] ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha-Deputy Minister of Tourism) Venerable Presiding Member, today we are debating the Adjournment Motion on the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement, ACSA, signed by and between the Department of Defence of the United States of America and the Ministry of Defence of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. I would like to draw the attention of the House to the history of the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement, ACSA statute, formerly known as NATO Mutual Support Act which was enacted to simplify exchange of logistic support, supplies and services between the United States and other NATO forces. It was subsequently amended in 1986, 1992 and 1994 to permit ACSAs with the governments of eligible non-NATO countries. It also requires Equal-Value Exchanges of logistic support, supplies and services and allows ACSA with the United Nations Organizations and to authorize the loan or lease of equipment. The Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement known as ACSA has been signed between the United States and 92 countries to-date, and if one is to argue that we have compromised our sovereignty by signing this Agreement, those 92 countries also would have compromised their territorial integrity and sovereignty. Thus, one should not live with the misconception that we have compromised our territorial integrity by signing this Agreement as it has only strengthened our hand in our fight against terrorism. Unlike in the past, today terrorism is a global phenomenon and almost every country in the globe has been subjected to some sort of terrorism irrespective of whether it is a developed or developing country and there is a collective effort to counter terrorism. Thus, Sri Lanka has taken support from all countries which have extended their support in its fight against terrorism. The Preamble to the Agreement signed between the Department of Defence of the US and the Ministry of Defence of Sri Lanka clearly states that this Agreement is to increase logistic co-operation between the countries. The Purpose Clause of the Agreement states, This Agreement is entered into for the purpose of establishing basic terms, conditions and procedures to facilitate the reciprocal provision of logistic support and services as that term is defined in Article III of this Agreement.

2007 05 829 830

5 PL 002157 (2007/06)

The US Department of Defence has defined the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement as An Agreement under which the United States agrees to provide logistic support, supplies and service by such government forces of a qualifying country or organization, in return for the reciprocal provision of logistic support, supplies and services by such government or organization to the element of the United States armed forces. Thus, the said Agreement does not amount to an alliance or a treaty between governments but a simple arrangement between governments to exchange goods and services to armed forces in a more collaborative environment. The said Agreement in no way permits the permanent presence of US troops in Sri Lanka or compels Sri Lanka to make or support in alliance with the US in its role in the international scene or commits Sri Lankan forces for US military operations. I would now deal with the method in which the ACSA operates. The ACSA order is a form in which the side requesting support provides an initial statement of need. The first step, therefore, is for that side to determine what it needs. According to the law and the directive of the Department of Defence, the ACSA may be used for logistic support, supplies and service provided for in the Agreement but precludes major end items. Once the need has been determined and initial co-ordination with the potential supplier is completed, the ACSA order is filed out. It specifies among other things, what is required, the organization making the request and the proposed method of payment - cash-based or exchange-based - where one type of LSSS is determined whether or not it is possible to comply. There is never any obligation under an ACSA and a transaction may be declined for any reason. The ACSA allows participants the exchange of goods and services such as transportation facilities, petroleum, oil and lubricants, ports facilities, accommodation, training, clothing and food, spare parts, repair and maintenance facilities, communication facilities, base operation support, storage facilities, medical facilities and ammunition between the armed forces as the need arises. It should also be noted that the ACSA also prohibits the exchange of major end items, weapon systems, deterrent systems, nuclear and chemical ammunition. The ACSA facilitates Sri Lankan forces to obtain help from the US in a national disaster and in crisis situations. It also allows our forces to participate in combined training exercises which gives us exposure in our fight against terrorism with a minimum cost. Thus, I wish to state that in no way can the ACSA be construed as being detrimental to the territorial integrity of our country, but is a mechanism for support from the US in our fight against terrorism. I would also like to bring to the notice of the House that the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara stated that I had objected to the signing of this Agreement. At no forum have I ever stated that I object to the signing of this Agreement. Thank you.

) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila - Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees for giving me this opportunity to speak. When we are debating an ordinary Agreement between two sovereign States, I first do not understand why such a fuss is being made about this. I think the matter has been blown out of proportion and made a mountain out of a molehill, I would say. We have been hearing various Speakers from the Opposition. Some are completely opposing this Agreement. Some say, We support this Agreement but we are not happy the way it has been signed and for not having come before Parliament. But these same Speakers, according to their own statements had negotiated this Agreement when their own party was in power, but they say they are not aware of the contents of the Agreement up-to-date. I do not know whom they are trying to fool but it is a very well-known fact. Anybody who goes into the website of the Ministry of Defence can download this whole Agreement. One Member spoke about the annexes, the difference in the number of pages between what the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva and what the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage handed over to the Opposition. Those were the annexes that were there. Those are the normal forms in this particular Agreement. What is there is the request form for material; the request form for various other things and the type of response that could be received from the receiving party or the

[ ]

835 836

requesting party. These are the normal annexes and these are all available. But, if anybody today says that he is not aware of the contents of this Agreement, I would say that he is trying to fool the people not only of the country but also of this august Assembly. We also heard the Hon. Members of the Opposition telling us that this was signed without informing anybody; without discussing it in the Government Parliamentary Group, in Cabinet or in this Parliament. Are agreements of this nature ever debated at these forums before they are entered into? This is an Agreement signed between two sovereign nations. This is an Agreement that has been signed by two Secretaries of Defence. If these sorts of Agreements have to be brought before all these Committees or Parliament before signing them, I do not think any country will be able to run their affairs. Look at the infamous CFA which is much talked of and just referred to by my good Friend, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella. Even that was not debated in Parliament before signing. In fact on the day it was signed, Parliament was informed that there was no such thing going to be signed. But it was signed. Now these are matters of the State. I am not blaming you, Hon. Member.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) .

( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila ) . . , . I wholeheartedly agree with my Friend because that was not between two countries. That was between a country and a leader of a terrorist organization. Even that was not presented to this Parliament. This Parliament at that time was informed that there was no signing to be done. The Hon. Member also mentioned about India, our great neighbour and great friend. He said that the army should have been allowed to stay here. They were sent away. But I think he seems to have forgotten who was in power at that time. Who sent the Indian Army away? It was not this Government, it was his own Government that sent away the Indian troops from here. So they cannot hide behind the fact that the Indian troops were sent away by us. My good Friend, the Hon. Faizer Musthapha explained the main aspects of this Cross-Servicing Agreement. But, are we looking at this Agreement with a great power only for defence purposes? There are so many other related matters here. If one of our ships goes to that port, they will give us the same facilities. One Member mentioned that there will not be any payment in cash. Payment can be made in cash or in kind. I think a careful reading of this Agreement will make it very clear as to what are the types of payments to be received and what are the services

to be received. This specifically mentions about the ammunitions to be received. We can even request for ammunitions. We can request for many sorts of services and facilities that we could not make use of earlier. There was a talk about the port being used. Yes, there is a port service and if a ship of the American fleet is bypassing our port and if they want to refuel here, they can ask us for permission. It is up to us to decide whether to give permission or not. There is no compulsion in that. It is very clearly stated how orders may be placed or accepted only by the points of contact identified by the parties. It states, I quote: When military forces of the Ministry of Defence of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka require logistic support, supplies or services outside the U.S.PACOM Command (USPACOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR), they may place orders directly with the cognizant POC or may seek the assistance of USPACOM or a USPACOM Component Command, to place an order with a non-USPACOM POC. " If we require any things that are not available in that particular command we can even place an order with one of their other commands and this will also be considered. Therefore, I for one, see no harm in signing this Agreement as there is no hidden hand behind it. This Agreement has been there on the worldwide web for anybody to download and see. It is very good to be spoken of at election times or as somebody mentioned, at the election platforms for people to say that this has not been informed, this is not available to the public and we are subjugating Sri Lanka to the United States. But this is the same Agreement which was negotiated at one time by the United National Party Government. Now this has been renegotiated by us and signed by the Secretaries of Defence of both the countries. We are now in a position that whenever we require, we can request the United States of America for assistance in our hour of need when we are fighting terrorism at its peak. For terrorism to be defeated, it is our bounden duty to go to anybody to get whatever assistance we need. Have we not in the past gone to other countries? Are we not going now? And I am sure in the future also we will go to any country that is in a position to help us in our fight against terrorism. Today, people are dying in the streets just because of this terrorist menace. Two days ago, 1000 kilograms of explosives were fortunately detected. Otherwise you can imagine the mayhem that would have been caused in this part of the country had those explosives exploded in the crowded city. If we are going to stop terrorism, it is our duty as responsible Members of Parliament to get together and try to see from whichever country, whichever source, we can obtain our arms, ammunition or whatever logistical support and services that are available to us. We need not talk about whom we fought against and which country spoke for or against us in our fight against terrorism. If any country is willing to help us, we should be willing to take whatever assistance that is being offered by that country. We also heard a Member of the Opposition making various allegations about ownership of the country and being the custodian of the country. Definitely our President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, in his speeches made

2007 05

earlier and now, has always maintained that he is the custodian of Sri Lanka. As the custodian of the country - not the owner but as the custodian of the country - it is not only his desire but also his bounden duty to look after the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Sri Lanka. In order to safeguard the territorial integrity and sovereignty, if His Excellency the President, Mahinda Rajapaksas Government goes to the extent of even signing any sort of agreement with any foreign country, I think he is showing the responsibility that he has undertaken on 17th of November 2005, the day he was elected. Finally, let me take -
