( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . . , . . . [ ] . - . . ( ) . ( ) () CEYLON HOTELS CORPORATION (REPEAL) BILL . . Order for Second Reading read. ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha-Deputy Minister of Tourism) I move, That the Bill be now read a Second time. Hon. Speaker, before I proceed to address this House on this Bill, I would like to go into the background of presenting the same. This Bill has been presented consequent to an agreement reached by and between the management of the Ceylon Hotels Corporation and the three unions representing the employees. The unions are: , , . This Agreement was reached consequent to cordial and constructive discussions held by the management of the Ceylon Hotels Corporation with the unions in my presence on the instructions of the Hon. Minister of Tourism. Thus, I am obliged to thank all parties to the Agreement for working in a constructive manner to enable a consensus to be reached. I would like to thank the

Secretary to the Ministry of Tourism, Mr. P. M. Leelaratne and the Additional Secretary, Mr. K.A.D. George Michael for their efforts in facilitating the Agreement reached between the unions and the Ceylon Hotels Corporation. Thus, I am confident that all political parties which represent the said unions will not consciously oppose the Bill presented to this House as I believe the unions and the parties they represent speak with one voice. I would now table* this Agreement dated 5th March, 2007 entered by and between the aforesaid unions and the management. The purpose of tabling the same is to demonstrate to this House that the Bill presented to this House is in line with the consensus reached between the management and the unions. Hon. Speaker, I would like to draw your attention to Clause 1(a) of the Agreement which reads thus, It states I quote: () .. Those are the unions. It further states, I quote: 57 . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . , [ ] .

, , [ . ] . Whereupon MR. SPEAKER left the Chair and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES (THE HON. RAMALINGAM CHANDRASEKAR) took the Chair. ( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha) Thus, in terms of the said Clause there is an agreement for a Voluntary Retirement Scheme by and between parties. It should also be noted that the unions have been agitating for a period of over one and a half years for a Voluntary Retirement Scheme. As regards the consensus reached for the repeal of the Ceylon Hotels Corporation Act, No. 14 of 1966, I would like to draw the attention of this House to Clause 2 of the said Agreement which reads thus. It states I quote: 1966 14 .

* . . Placed in the Library.

2007 21 1719 1720

Thus, I foresee no opposition by the JVP or the UNP on a matter documentarily agreed upon by the unions which represent the same. Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I would like to the draw attention of this House to the provision in relation to the Voluntary Retirement Scheme referred to in the Agreement. In terms of Clause 4 (b) of the said Agreement one months salary for each year the employee has served and two months salary for the years to be worked until the retirement age which is 57 years, the employees are entitled to a maximum of Rs.600,000. In addition to the above Agreement reached by and between the unions representing the employees of Ceylon Hotels Corporation and the management of Ceylon Hotels Corporation, the Ministry of Tourism has successfully facilitated an agreement between the Kandy Hotels Company Limited and the which represent the employees in Kandy Hotels Company Limited. I would like to say that Kandy Hotels Company Limited is not a statutory entity. However, since the Galle Face Hotel Group controls over 70 per cent of the Ceylon Hotels Corporation and the Ceylon Hotels Corporation owns 75 per cent of Kandy Hotels Company Limited, we have been able to facilitate this Agreement. The said Agreement also provides, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for a Voluntary Retirement Scheme offering maximum of Rs.600,000. The Ministry of Tourism in addition to the contractual arrangements agreed by and between the Ceylon Hotels Corporation and the unions have incorporated statutory provisions in the Bill to safeguard the rights and interests of employees even consequent to the Ministry of Tourism divesting its statutory control by the repeal of the Ceylon Hotels Corporation Act, No.14 of 1966. Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, now I would like to draw the attention of the House to Clause 1.(4) (a) of the Bill which states, I quote: The officers and servants of the Ceylon Hotels Corporation holding office on the day immediately preceding the appointed date shall, with effect from the appointed date, be offered employment in the Ceylon Hotels Corporation Limited on terms and conditions not less favourable than those enjoyed by them on the day preceding the appointed date. Thus the Repeal Bill has secured continuity of employment on terms and conditions not less favourable than previously offered. Attention is also drawn to Clause 1.(4) (c) which makes reference to the Voluntary Retirement Scheme. Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, Clause 1.(4) (c), states, I quote: An officer or servant referred to in paragraph (a), who wishes to opt out of service in the Ceylon Hotels Corporation Limited may do so within three months from the date on which he was notified of the available offer of serving in the Ceylon Hotels Corporation Limited. If an officer or servant exercises his option not to accept the offer, he shall be paid compensation under a voluntary retirement scheme to be implemented in that behalf, with the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers.

I would also like to bring to the notice of this House that the voluntary retirement scheme has been approved by the Cabinet of Ministers and the Commissioner of Labour has also sanctioned it. Thus, a comparison of the Agreement tabled by me in this House, signed by and between the Ceylon Hotels Corporation and the Unions clearly establishes that the Bill before this House is in total conformity with the terms and conditions agreed upon by the Unions and the management of Ceylon Hotels Corporation. I would like to draw attention of this House to a provision in the Bill, which provides for pecuniary benefit to employees of Ceylon Hotels Corporation accruing from the State. Attention is drawn to Clause 1.(5) of the Bill, whereby after the conversion of the 1.2 million preference shares held by the Treasury into ordinary shares, 10 per cent of shares shall be vested in the Employees' Provident Fund and Employees' Trust Fund in the names of employees of the Ceylon Hotels Corporation. Further to the statutory benefits provided by the Bill, employees of Ceylon Hotels Corporation and Kandy Hotels Company Limited are to be given 10 per cent of the profit of the sale of 35.75 per cent shares of Ceylon Hotels Corporation held by Bank of Ceylon which amounts to Rs. 645 million and 10 per cent of same amounting to Rs. 64.5 million will be distributed among the employees. The Ministry of Tourism and the Treasury have been working towards the disbursement of the said funds and the processing is in progress. I would like to conclude by justifying the necessity of repealing the Ceylon Hotels Corporation Act, and thereby converting same into an entity free from statutory control. It should be noted that the said transformation in no way could be construed as privatization as there are 4,500 shareholders holding 28 per cent of the ordinary shares and the Galle Face Group holding 71.20 per cent shares in Ceylon Hotels Corporation. Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the Ceylon Hotels Corporation was legislated by Act No. 14 of 1966 and was listed in the Colombo Stock Exchange in 1967. There were approximately 7,000 shareholders at the time, as the Government policy at that time was to broadbase the shareholding. The par value of a share was Rs. 2/-. At that time approximately 7,000 shareholders held 65 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital, and the Bank of Ceylon who was the underwriter at that time subscribed to 35 per cent of the ordinary share capital as the said issue was under-subscribed. On the 5th of July 2005, the Bank of Ceylon offered for sale 35 per cent shares held by it in Ceylon Hotels Corporation in the Colombo Stock Exchange. The said

1721 1722

shares went on bid for three continuous days with Nawaloka, Softlogic, Jetwing, Hayleys Group, Connaisssance, and Galle Face Group bidding for same. I would like to draw the attention of the House to the performance of Ceylon Hotels Corporation for the period 2001 to 2005. 2001 loss (9,356,145) 2002 loss (13,339,584) 2003 loss (11,630,228) 2004 profit 22,649,156 2005 loss (40,538,024) Thus, one could say that the Bank of Ceylon took a prudent management decision to sell same in view of the performance of the Ceylon Hotels Corporation. The Bank of Ceylon shares were purchased by the Galle Face Group for a sum of Rs. 663 million. After the said transaction, Galle Face Group increased its holdings to 71.2 per cent. The financial statement of the Bank of Ceylon for the year 2005 reflects a net profit of Rs. 2.2 billion and thus one-third of the profits reflected in the balance sheet of the Bank of Ceylon was from the sale of shares of Ceylon Hotels Corporation. Due to political intervention, overstaffing and low worker morale, the viability of Ceylon Hotels Corporation has declined over the years, Sir, furthermore, additional capital is required to make Ceylon Hotels Corporation a viable entity. Consequent to the sale of the Bank of Ceylon shares, representations were made by the employees of Ceylon Hotels Corporation for a Voluntary Retirement Scheme which could not be accommodated without the infusion of additional capital. The Galle Face Group, the majority shareholder did not infuse additional capital as it considered it not prudent to do so unless the State divested its statutory control. Thus this Bill presented to Parliament is to satisfy the interest of the employees and the majority shareholders request is for independent management control, free from statutory interference. Thus the Government has only one option of streamlining the process through this Ceylon Hotels Corporation (Repeal ) Bill of transforming the Ceylon Hotels Corporation into Ceylon Hotels Corporation Limited, whilst securing the rights and interests of the employees of the Ceylon Hotels Corporation as one should only go forward and not backward and dampen investment confidence in this country. Thank you. . . Question proposed.

[..11.13]

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Nirupama Rajapaksa) Deputy Chairman of Committees, as a former Deputy Minister of Tourism, I am happy to say a few words on the Ceylon Hotels Corporation (Repeal) Bill. The Ceylon Hotels Corporation was incorporated in 1966. This was during the time when there were only a few tourist hotels and most of them were located in Colombo or Kandy. During the British rule their civil servants had located many scenic places outside Colombo and Kandy and established the concept of rest houses for their holidays or stays during their circuit visits. Until the growth of tourism as an industry, these rest houses were the only places where someone could have a quiet holiday. All this changed with tourism developing as a major economic sector and foreign tourists rapidly increasing. With the advent of tourist hotels in the major resorts and in many scenic places, the rest house concept lost its glamour. Despite this, the rest houses and the hotels owned by the Ceylon Hotels Corporation functioned well and in many cases made operational profits. But as in many Government-controlled corporations, the administration staff began to outnumber the operational staff and the profits made in the operation of the rest houses went to finance the administrative expenditure of the head office. So, there was very little surplus left for capital expenditure for the maintenance and upkeep of the properties owned by the Corporation. Thus the decline set in. The Bank of Ceylon which owned shares in the Ceylon Hotels Corporation was apparently not interested in investing further in the leisure sector. In this context, there was no alternative but to infuse private capital. I think the Cabinet Subcommittee on Investment Facilitation took a bold decision to permit the Bank of Ceylon to sell its shares in the open market. Due to this sale, the Ceylon Hotels Corporation shares except for some preference shares were in private hands, but technically due to the Ceylon Hotels Corporation Act, they remained as a State entity. This anomalous situation had to be repealed. This is a very wise decision.

The enactment of the Ceylon Hotels Corporation (Repeal) Bill should also allow the present major shareholder to invest more, to improve the properties owned by the Corporation which need major capital infusion. Although due to the present decline in international tourist arrivals, the tourist hotels now are offering considerable concessions to domestic tourists. This may change when the tourists arrivals improve. I wish to urge the new owners of the Ceylon Hotels Corporation or Company to ensure that they continue to cater for the domestic tourists mainly for family holidays at reasonable and affordable rates. I understand that the Cabinet Subcommittee which looked into this matter has made the following recommendations: Company to maintain a gap of 30 per cent between the prices quoted at a given time for the international tourists and the domestic tourists. Reserve 50 per cent of the presently available rooms in all resorts of the company for domestic tourists on space availability. Advise the Company to enter into a MoU with the Ministry of Tourism ensuring the above. The State to keep ownership of the lands where properties are presently operated by the Ceylon Hotels Corporation, but it is recommended to extend the lease for a longer period under the new management, to ensure the viability of the improvements made to the properties. I agree with these recommendations and urge the Ministry of Tourism to take appropriate measures to ensure the above. One of the redeeming features of the exercise is that all the trade unions have agreed to the proposal for repealing the Act. They also benefit from the distribution of value of the 10 per cent of the shares sold by the Bank of Ceylon. This benefit is to be given to employees of the subsidiary company of the Ceylon Hotels Corporation, the Kandy Hotels Company. This is a laudable decision. Furthermore, the major shareholder has agreed to offer a Voluntary Retirement Scheme to employees who wish to leave the Corporation. I wish the Company would discuss with the employees and offer them better conditions of employment so that they could remain in employment, if they want to. The attraction of receiving a lump sum as an immediate benefit has in many cases turned out to be a sad story since it will be difficult for most of them to get re-employed and when the money runs out they become desperate without any income. I hope the Company can look into this matter as a social obligation.

2007 21 1739 1740

I also wish to take the opportunity to say a few words on the situation faced by the tourism sector at present. It is not the first time Sri Lanka tourism has faced the present situation and the resilience of Sri Lanka tourism has been proved over and over since the 1983 debacle. It is necessary that while we continue our efforts to bring back tourists from countries in the West, we must now look for new markets. India and China are becoming the largest tourist-generating countries and we must explore these markets with vigour and the main attention of the Ceylon Hotels Corporation Limited is to provide food and accommodation facilities to all travellers in the most beautiful locations in Sri Lanka. As I conclude, I hope there will be a joint effort by all the stakeholders to ensure the re-emergence of the tourism industry. Thank you. [..11.20] ( ) (The Hon.

( ) (The Hon. Sivanathan Kissor) I want to ask you this. That day the Hon. Minister told us, after these people were taken to Vavuniya, that it was only on their wish that they went. You told us that. But the next day they came back. Why was that? Was that on their wish or not? I am asking you.

( ) (The Hon. Athauda Seneviratne) No. I want to tell you -

( ) (The Hon. Sivanathan Kissor) In Parliament, in front of all of us, you said, We did not force and send them. It is only on their wish that they went at midnight. Nobody would go at midnight even if it is his wish. But the next day, after the Supreme Court order, I went there and they had come back in five buses. If they went on their wish, why did they return? Can you answer that, Hon. Minister? How do you explain that?
