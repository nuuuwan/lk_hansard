: 1 : 1 PRIVILEGE : PETITION FILED FOR NON IMPLEMENTATION OF GUIDELINES LAID DOWN BY SUPREME COURT ON ADMISSION OF CHILDREN TO GRADE 1 IN SCHOOLS ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) , . . Jayasiri Ittapana, Joint Secretary, Ananda College Old Boys' Association, Ananda College , . . . . Paragraph 14 of the petition states, I quote: The Admission Criteria published by the 1st Respondent is a total deviation from the criteria laid down in the orders of the Supreme Court dated 19.07.2007 and 31.07.2007. The Petitioner is informed that the immediate reason for this unlawful deviation is due to certain observations made by the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament. His opposition had been on the purported basis that the Qualifications, Occupation, and Achievements of Parents should not be the basis for admission of students to Grade 1. The Petitioner states that the said purported basis was irrational and unjustified for the reason that the circulars hitherto in operation allowed 25 marks for deeds pertaining to ownership of property as opposed to other documents of possession which attracted only 2 marks. The Petitioner states that prominent National Schools, such as Royal, Thurstan, Isipathana and Visakha are situated in the best residential areas in Colombo and giving marks as much as 25 to documents pertaining to ownership of property was unreasonable, but for some unknown reason has not attracted any criticism from these critics. The Criteria formulated by the Supreme Court considering Educational Achievements of the Parents was much more rational than considering documents pertaining to ownership of property. . . .

There shall be freedom of speech, debate and proceeding in Parliament and such freedom of speech, debate or proceedings shall not be liable to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament. . . : "Indeed, Section 9 of the Act expressly provides that all privileges, immunities and powers of Parliament shall be part of the general and public law of Sri Lanka and it shall not be necessary to plead the same, but the same shall in all courts in Sri Lanka be judicially noticed." notice . I further quote: It is difficult to appreciate how, notwithstanding these statutory provisions, paragraphs 37 and ..... . : The expression 'proceedings in Parliament' in Section 3 is not statutorily defined but has been broadly construed in British Parliamentary Practice. Its primary meaning, as a technical parliamentary term, signifies some formal action, usually a decision taken by the House in its collective capacity, and embraces all forms of business in which the House takes action and indeed the whole Parliamentary process, the principal feature of which is debate by which it reaches a decision and would naturally include the initial step which sets the process in motion. . , . , .

. . 2007 20 , 13 . . : "13. The Petitioner states that contravening the aforementioned orders of the Supreme Court dated 29.03.2007, 19.07.2007 and 31.07.2007 the 1st Respondent has published guidelines that need to be followed for admission of students to Grade 1 for the year 2008." . . , " " . . . . , ? . . . , . . . , . . I quote Section 2 (1) of the National Education Commission Act: The President, subject to the provisions of the Constitution, may declare from time to time the National Education Policy... Section 8 states that the Commission shall make recommendations to the President and advise the President. , ? Section 9 of the National Education Commission Act states that the Powers of the Minister shall not be affected. . . , . Article 42 of the Constitution states, I quote: The President shall be responsible to Parliament... Article 43 (1) of the Constitution states, I quote: There shall be a Cabinet of Ministers charged with the direction and control of the Government of the Republic, which shall be collectively responsible and answerable to Parliament. In Article 44, the Ministers of Cabinet and their subjects and functions are determined by the President. The President has determined that this Minister should be in charge of the functions of Education and Higher Education. Article 154G refers to the Statutes of Provincial Council. Then Article 154G (7) states that a Provincial Council has no power in respect of the Reserved List - List II of the Ninth Schedule - and this is a National Policy, . Concurrent List .

: Document tabled : An Island in the East - Indies. Wild in the woods are as good, onely they are more scarce and grow deeper, and so more difficult to be plucked up. It would be to no purpose to mention their particular names ; I shall onely speak a little in general of them. They serve both for food, and for carrees, that is,suace or for a relish to their Rice. But they makemany a meal of them alone to lengthen out their Rice, or for want of it ; and of these there is no want to those that will take pains but to set them, and cheap enough to those that will buy. There are two sorts of these Alloes ; some require trees or Sticks to run up on ; others require neither. Of theformer sort, some will run up to the tops of very large Trees, and spreadout very full of branches, and bear great bunches of blossoms, but no use made of them; The Leaves dy every year, but the Roots grow still, which some of them will do to a prodigious bigness within a Year of twos time, becoming as big as a mans wast. The fashion of them somewhat roundish, rugged and uneven, and in divers odd shapes, like a log of cleft wood : they have a very good, savoury mellow tast. Of those that do not run up on Trees, there are likewise sundry sorts ; they bear a long stalk and a broad leaf ; the fashion of these Roots are somewhat roundish, some grow out like a mans fingers ; which they call Angul - alloes, as much as to say Finger -Roots ; some are of a white colour, some of a red. Those that grow in the woods run deeper into the Earth, they run up Trees also. Some bear blossoms somewhat like Hopps, and they may be as big as mans Arm. For Herbs to boyI and eat with Butter they have excellent good ones, and several sorts : some of them are six months growing to maturity, the stalk as high as a man can reach, and being boyled almost as good as Asparagus. There are of this sort, some having leaves and stalks as red as blood, some green : some the leaves green, and the stalk very white. They have several other sorts of Fruits which they dress and eat with their Rice, and tast very savoury, called Carowela, Wattacul, Morongo, Cacorebouns, & C. the which I cannot compare to any things that grow here in England.

These, excepting the two last, are not the natural product of the Land, but they are transplanted hither ; By which I perceive all other European Plants would grow there : They have also Fern, Indian Corn Several sorts of Beans as good as these in Egland ; right Cucumbers, Calabasses, and several sorts of Pumkins & c. The Dutch on that Island on their Gardens have Lettice, Rosemary, Sage, and all other Herbs and Sallettings that we have in these Countreys. Nor are they worse supplied with Medicinal Herbs. The woods are their Apothecaries shops, Where with Herbs, Leaves, and the Rinds of Trees they make all their physic and Plaisters, with which sometimes they will do notable Cures. I will not here enter into a larger discourse of the Medicinal Vertues of their Plants & c. of which there are hundreds ; onlely as a specimen thereof, and likewife of their skill to use them ; I will relate a passage or two. A Neighbour of mine a chingulay, would undertake to cure a broken Leg a Arm by application of some Herbs that grow in the woods, and that with that speed, that the broken Bone after it was set should knit by the time one might boyI a pot of Rice and three carrees, that is about an hour and an half or two hours ; and I knew a man who told me he was thus cured. They will cure an Impostkume in the Throat with the Rind of a Tree called Amaranga, (Wherof I my self had the experience;) by chawing it for a day or two after it is prepared, and swallowing the spittle. I was well in a day and a Night, tho before I was exceedingly ill, and could not swallow my victuals. Of Flowers they have great varieties growing wild, for they plant them not. There are Roses red and white, scented like ours: several sorts of sweet smelling Flowers, which the young Men a Women gather and tie in their hairs to perfume them; they tie up their hair in a bunch behind, and enclose the Flowers therein. There is one Flower deserves to be mentioned for the rarity and use of it they call it a Sindric - mal, there are of them some of Murry colour, and some white. Its Nature is, to open about four a clock in the Evening, and so continueth open all Night until the morning, When it close up it self till four a clock again. Some will transplant them out of the Woods into their Gardens to serve them instead of a Clock, when it is cloudy that they cannot see the Sun. There is another white Flower like our Jasmine, well scented, they call them Pichamauls, which the king hath a parcel of brought to him every morning, wrapt in a white cloth, hanging upon a staff, and carried by people, whose peculiar office this is. All people that meet these Flowers. Out of respect to the King, for whose use they are, must turn out of the Way ; and so they must for all other things that go to the king being wrapt up in white cloth. These Officers Old Land of the King for this service : their Office is,also to plant these Flowers, Which they usually do near the Rivers where they most delight to grow : Nay, they have power to plant them in any mans Ground, and enclose that ground when they have done it for the sole use of their Flowers to grew in : which Inclosures they will keep up for several years, until the Ground becomes so worn, that the Flowers will thrive there no longer, and then the Owners resume their own Lands again. Hop - Mauls, are Flowers growing upon great Trees, which bear nothing else, they are rarely sweet scented ; this is the chief Flower the young people use ; and is of greatest value among them.

[.. 2.01]

.. ( ) ( .. - ) (The Hon. M.N. Abdul Majeed - Minister of Co-operatives) Mr. Deputy Speaker, today we are debating the Chemical Weapons Convention Bill. This Bill may not attract interest as many other subjects which come before this House but its importance cannot be emphasized more. Conflict had been the condition of man since his creation. It will be remembered that it was Cain who stoned to death his brother Abel. With the expansion of population, conflict was extended from individuals to peoples but the weapons used injured or caused death only to the combatants. The civilian population was saved from the horrors of wars. Today war has assumed horrible dimensions, particularly targeting civilian populations. This change of war tactics was initiated by Hitler who bombed civilian population in the Spanish Civil War. The masterpiece painting of Picasso, Guernica, caught the horrors of war waged specifically on a civilian population. These

1659 1660

[ .. ]

lessons were learnt well by the British. Under Britains war Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, Dresden was firebombed daily by 1000 bombers flying in formation. But, there were conscience-stricken British too. Clement Atlee who succeeded in voting out Winston Churchill refused to honour the flying ace responsible for this offensive mass murder. In the 20th Century, the means of war were extended. There was atomic war where the civilian population who were not combatants were evaporated by a atom bomb cast on Hiroshima and later on Nagasaki. Within an instant 160,000 died in Hiroshima and over five lakhs died later because of radio-active contamination. Mass-scale human extermination did not stop with ballistic or atom bomb means. A new dimension of horror weapons was developed with chemical weapons. In the advisory given to me it was stated, The first large scale attack with chlorine gas occurred on 22nd April, 1915 at a leper colony in Belgium. During this attack on allied troops about 5000 were dead and 15,000 wounded. This event did indeed happen but it was not the first chemical attack. This infamous responsibility should again be cast on Winston Churchill. Iraq, then called Mesopotamia was a part of the Ottoman Empire during the First World War. Turkey, which was an ally of Germany, was opposed by Britain and France. Both these colonial powers inspired the Arabs of Mesopotamia to rise against the Ottomans which they did. Once these two powers won the First World War, they cruelly suppressed these Arabs with Winston Churchill using mustard gas killing over 15,000. Winston Churchill was the first to start a chemical war and was the founder of mass graves in which these freedom fighters were buried. There is the fourth form of weapons developed, that of biological weapons. The developed countries have a full arsenal of their biological weapons. Today, we are discussing about chemical weapons. Human beings are created by God with chemical bodies. These bodies are very vulnerable to chemical attacks. That is why it is so important to control chemical weapons, because they go contrary to Gods will. It is very evident that the development process is through both mechanical and chemical means. It is not possible to argue that chemical development should be completely banned because it will deny the people of this country a promising avenue for increasing incomes. What is required is that chemical development be controlled. The Bill before us is devoted to this task. It is very important that the National Chemical Weapons Authority set up under Clause 4(1) and the Steering Committee appointed under Clause 8 of this Bill

meant to advise the National Authority, be strong. The best should be appointed to these bodies, not politically motivated individuals. The decision that the Authority takes should be objective and scientific. We cannot compromise on these requirements. I wholeheartedly support this Bill. But the success of this Bill is in its implementation. I am sure the able Minister will not compromise on this aspect. Thank you. [.. 2.08] ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon.

. , ; ; ; , . , , ? . . . . ; . , . , . . , - I am addressing you, Hon. (Mrs.) Thangeswary. You categorically said that you discussed certain matters with the Minister of Agriculture, but nothing happened. No, a lot of things happened thereafter. You said that the people in the East are unable to buy the basic needs for agriculture. We looked into that, Hon. Member. We started distributing free seed paddy; we started distributing free fertilizer and also, we have launched a programme to cultivate 50,000 hectares of corn in the Eastern Province and in certain parts of Monaragala and Badulla. Corn is the most profitable crop now. Corn and sorghum are known as the camel crops of the world, which require a much less volume of water than that for paddy. So, this corn production is going on and I agree with you, Hon. (Mrs.) Thangeswary, Hon. Member, -

( () ) (The Hon. (Miss) Thangeswary Kadirgaman) I am not Mrs. Thangeswary; I am Miss Thangeswary.

( ) (An Hon. Member) It is a compliment to you.

( ) (The Hon. Hemakumara Nanayakkara) Still you look very, very young. I thought you are Mrs. Thangeswary, though you are a Miss. I am sorry. Miss Thangeswary, I beg your pardon and whole heartedly apologize to you for the mistake I made. I am very sorry about it, Miss Thangeswary. Hon. (Miss) Thangeswary, our corn production programme has been launched there. We are giving loans at the rate of 8 per cent interest. Can you ever think of getting a loan from any bank in Sri Lanka at the rate of 8

1703 1704

per cent interest? We are giving loans at 8 per cent interest and no deed is required to be shown to the Department or the Bank. If the Grama Niladhari gives a letter and if it is approved by the Divisional Secretary, that itself is good enough to obtain a loan at 8 per cent interest. We bring in the companies to sign forward trade agreements, under which your farmers could sell their produce at a very high rate. The cost of production of corn is Rs. 14 per kilogram. Presently, forward trade agreements are being signed to buy corn at Rs. 22 a kilogram. But it will go up to about Rs. 28 or 30 per kilogram. As you know, corn is being used to make bio-fuel in different countries and now in France, a new type of biodegradable plastic, a substitute to plastic is being made out of corn starch. Because of this, corn prices will escalate and in the world market it is going up. We will be unable to even feed our poultry in Sri Lanka if we do not grow corn. So, we have foreseen this and now we are in the process of cultivating corn in the Eastern Province. Hon. Miss Thangeswary, you said that "podiyars" - they are the landlords - of the Eastern Province have been asked to do chena cultivation. I do not know who had asked them to. If you please tell me the name, I will talk to that particular person

( () ) (The Hon. (Miss) Thangeswary Kadirgaman) The Hon. Minister of Nation Building.

( ) (The Hon. Hemakumara Nanayakkara) What is the name of that Minister? There are four Ministers of Nation Building. - [Interruption.] Ah! The Hon. Punchinilame. If he has said that, I will have a discussion with him. But he would have said that with a good intention and the golden idea of recultivating the entire Eastern Province. He is taking an enormous risk visiting the Eastern Province every week. He is not just flying there by helicopter and coming back, as you said. You are totally wrong, Miss Thangeswary, Hon. Member. He goes by car; he takes the road. He is not flying there and flying back. I want to put the record straight on that. His commitment to the Eastern Province is enormous. Had he told, if by chance, that people should go for chena cultivation, I will have a discussion with him and get back to you. We are not enemies; we are friends. You, every Member from that side and myself, all of us are trying to win this new agro-production war. Also you said that "podiyars" have been asked to do chena cultivation. So, please tell the "podiyars" not to get upset, that we will assist them in whatever possible manner to cultivate and to especially go for irrigated agriculture.

Then, you dealt with 129 fishing villages and 15,000 fisher folk. I am not going to talk about those things as my topic is different today. It is on potato cultivation.
