BUSINESS OF THE PARLIAMENT ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva - Minister of Healthcare and Nutrition and Leader of the House of Parliament) , . " 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 12 23 . " , . . Question put, and agreed to. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, I think what has been raised is a very serious issue where three Members have alleged - they have complained to me also - that their relatives have been abducted as a means of pressurizing them in the free exercise of their votes. On the last occasion when this came up, we stated that a relative of the Hon. Kanagasabai was taken away by the Pillayan group and in fact, the Pillayan group had given an interview to the "Daily Mirror" confirming it. What is more serious is, on

2007 12 3313 3314

Monday there were discussions between the Japanese Prime Minister and our President regarding the peace process as well as human rights and certain assurances were given by the Government of Sri Lanka to the Japanese Government. Mr. Akashi arrived here yesterday and he is going to Jaffna today and you do this in the midst of it. Basically it is a slap on the face of the Japanese Government, when they have been one of the Governments that have so far been positive as far as Sri Lanka is concerned. I mean, you are putting the future of this country at stake by this type of thing. It is not only Japan, now the entire world is looking at it. Where in the world do you get a Parliament where relatives of Members are abducted just before a vote? Can you call yourself a democracy? I will not agree with what the Hon. Minister said, not to point the finger at the Government, but I must say that the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence controls the Pillayan Group. That is admitted internationally. That is all. May be he is not aware of it as a Minister. I need not argue that with him or the Leader of the House or anyone else. But this is a very, very serious situation. I mean, Members are being told, "Do not vote". It will be the TNA now. Very soon it will be Members of the other side. Are we going to create a precedent? That is why I say that today itself you have to take action to ensure that these people are released. Thank you. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Sir, the Hon. Premachandran raised on the Floor of this House, with your permission, a grave matter pertaining to the rights of three Members of Parliament. I am disappointed, Sir, that there has been no response from you in regard to that matter. I would like to know from you what action you propose to take as the Hon. Speaker of this House and as the guardian of the rights of our Members in regard to the complaint that has been raised on the Floor of this House. You gave us an assurance last time but nothing whatever happened. I want to know what action you propose to take to ensure that these Members of Parliament are able to freely exercise their vote when the Vote on the Third Reading of the Budget is taken up on the 14th.

( ) (The Presiding Member) , . . : : Letter tabled : DR. JAYALATH JAYAWARDENA MBBS, FICS, MD Member of Parliament Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka COPY URGENT April 5, 2007 Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, M.P. Minister of Human Rights & Disaster Management Ministry of Human Rights & Disaster Management No. 2, Wijerama Mawatha, Colombo 07. Dear Hon. Minister, Request to draw your immediate attention to the violation Of human rights of a Member of Parliament of Sri Lanka I am writing this letter of you in order to draw your urgent attention to the violation of human rights of mine. As you know, I am a Member of Parliament of the United National Party and was the Minister of Rehabilitation, Resettlement & Refugees from 2002 to 2004 in the Government of Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, where you were also a Minister. I am fully aware that you have shown a keen interest to protect the human rights violations of Members of Parliament, and you have even held the position of Chairman of the Human Rights Committee of the Inter-parliamentary Union in Geneva for several years as a Member of Parliament of the UNP. I trust that even though you have become a Minister of the ruling party headed by President Mahinda Rajapaksa, you still continue to show your genuine interest to protect the human rights of Members of Parliament, irrespective of politics. With that trust, let me request you to take immediate action to see that my human rights are-protected by the present Government where you hold the responsibility as a Minister in charge of Human Rights & Disaster Management. 1. My life has been made vulnerable by the present Government : As you are aware, I have been the Minister in charge of the North and the Minister of Rehabilitation, Resettlement & Refugees from 2002 to 2004. There have been several malicious and false accusations leveled against me that I am a sympathizer of the LTTE. Because of that, my life has become vulnerable in the hands of the southern extremists. Hon. Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Public Security, Law & Order has issued hand-written instructions to his Secretary to reduce my security provided by the Government, in spite of the fact that there are 2 separate confidential, individual reports by the Deputy Inspector-General of Police of the Criminal Investigations

2007 12 3381 3382

Department and the Deputy Inspector-General of Police of the Directorate of Internal Intelligence. Copy of Hon. Ratnasiri Wickramanayakas Prime Ministers hand-written order and copies of the reports of the 2 Deputy Inspectors-General of Police, (CID) and (DII) are herewith attached for your perusal. I have made a statement in Parliament that if by any chance there is going to be any danger to my life, that the Prime Minister and your Government will be held responsible for such an act. I am sure that you can take up this matter with the Prime Minister at the Cabinet Meeting. You may agree with me that this is a very serious matter which has made my life highly vulnerable. Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission too has recommended that my security should be restored and guaranteed. (Copy attached.) You may recollect that during the time of Hon. Ranil Wickramasinghes Government, we took steps to provide additional security to the Opposition Members of Parliament. For example, Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar, former Minister of Foreign affairs and Hon. Douglas Devananda, presently a Minister of your Government were provided with additional security and even with bullet-proof vehicles by the Government of . Hon. Ranil Wickramasinghe considering their security risks. Similarly, I as a Member of Parliament of the Opposition face the same security risk, I feel it is nothing but fair to provide me with the required additional security considering my security risk as confirmed by the DIG (CID) and the DID (DII). 2. Case no. SRI/12 Complaint made by Dr. Jayalath Jayawardana, M.P. to the UN Human Rights Committee under the International Covenant on Civil & Political Rights against President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga of Sri Lanka. As you are aware, the UN Human Rights Committee issued a declaration dated 22 July, 2002-reference number 916/2000 to the effect that President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga has violated my human rights. I made a complaint to the Human Rights Committee under the International Covenant on Civil & Political Rights to which Sri Lanka is a signatory. The UN Human Right Committee has been informed by the Government of Sri Lanka that I will be provided with additional security if and when necessary. I am herewith attaching a copy of the above undertaking by the Government of Sri Lanka for your information. I also wish to inform you that the Human Rights Committee of the IPU has passed a resolution with regard to my complaint and has requested the Government of Sri Lanka to provide me with the required security. You have been a former Chairman of the Human Rights Committee of the IPU could contact the Secretary-General of the IPU and get all details. The IPU Human Rights Committee has re-opened my complaint number 916/2000 and is inquiring into the present situation where my security has been reduced on the instructions of Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka, in spite of the fact of 2 Intelligence Reports from the Deputy Inspectors General of Police CID and the DII. You may agree with me that this is a gross violation of the undertaking given by the Government of Sri Lanka to the UN Human Rights Committee . The Government of Sri Lank has given assurance to the UN Human Rights Committee that additional security will be provided to me, depending on the requirement and situation. The 2 Intelligence Reports of the DIG (CID) and the DIG (DII) have confirmed the fact that my life is under threat. 3. The Inspector-General of Police is not taking any steps to investigate my death threats : I wish to draw your attention to the attached letters sent by the Secretary-General of Parliament to Mr. Victor Perera, IGP dated 12 January 2007, 22 January 2007 and 23 February 2007, on the instructions of the Hon. Speaker of Parliament advising the IGP to take action to investigate my death threats. And report back to Hon Speaker.

But up to date, the IGP has not taken any steps to investigate my death threats. This is a very serious lapse on the part of the IGP. I would like to mention that if this is the case of a Member of Parliament elected by the people of Sri Lanka, what would be the position of an ordinary citizen of our country?

4. The Chairman of the state-owned Independent Television Network (ITN) is ignoring the request of the Secretary-General of Parliament : I wish to draw your attention to my letter dated 8. 3. 2007 and letter sent by the acting Secretary-General of Parliament dated 8 March, 2007 on the instructions of the Hon. Speaker of Parliament to the Chairman of the state-owned Independent Television Network regarding a privilege matter taken up by me. The acting Secretary-General of Parliament had requested in his letter under reference to give publicity to my reply speech made in Parliament to the allegations made by a Minister of your Government against me, accusing me again of being a sympathizer of the LTTE, which has made my life more vulnerable. Up to date, the Chairman of the state-owned ITN has taken any steps to telecast my reply speech as requested by the acting Secretary-General of the Parliament of Sri Lanka. I am placing these facts before you to take immediate action and see that my human rights are protected by the present Government in which you are the Minister in charge of Human Rights & Disaster Management. Anticipating an early reply. Yours sincerely (Sgd.) Dr. Jayalath Jayawardana, M.P. Assistant Secretary UNP Chairman/Relief & Human Rights Committee of the UNP (former Minister of Rehabilitation, Resettlement & Refugees) UNP Chairman/Wanni District Copy to : 1. Hon. W. J. M.

Lansdowne Crescent, Edinburgh, EH12 5 EQ 27th November, 2007 President Mahinda Rajapakse The President of Sri Lanka Presidential Secretariat Colombo 01 Sri Lanka. Your Excellency, I have taken a keen interest in the situation of Dr. Jayalath Jayawardena over many years. I am convinced that he is a most genuine and sincere man and parliamentarian who devotes his life and his medical skills to helping his fellow citizens and promoting what he conceives to be the best interests of his country, to which he is devoted.

3383 3384

I have the good fortune to live in a country where, although there are some who do not properly value the work of MPs and others in the public service, at least we do not go about our daily business in fear of our lives. Alas, that does not appear to be the situation currently in Sri Lanka. It is well known to us all - and it has been for many years - that Dr. Jayalath Jayawardenas life is seriously threatened. He surely deserves protection against that palpable threat. It is the duty of the State to protection against that palpable threat. It is the duty of the State to protect its citizens; and that duty is particularly important when those threatened are in the public service. I have been made aware of the many letters of support that have been sent regarding the removal of protection from Dr. Jayalath Jayawardena. I need not repeat here their contents. I merely wish to add my voice to those others who support Dr. Jayalath Jayawardenas plea for adequate protection. The eyes of many are upon Sri Lanka at this time. It is a beautiful country and its people are greatly admired. We are watching with deep concern what is happening and we are very anxious indeed about the outcome of the current proceedings and other attempts to obtain for Dr. Jayalath Jayawardena the protection that he surely needs. His case will surely serve as a precedent for others similarly threatened. Copy for the Prime Minister [..1.07] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) , , point of Order ? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I want to make a small statement and I have asked for your indulgence. I have spoken to the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe and also the Leaders of the Government and they have no objection to my making a statement now. This is a very brief statement. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Statement , , - [.. 2.14] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, it is a part of this Debate. As a part of this Debate, I will make a very short intervention with the permission of the House. Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem Hon. Deputy Chairman, a few minutes ago, I, along with my Colleagues, the Hon. Basheer Segu Dawood, the Hon. Hasen Ali and the Hon. Faizal Cassim, have handed in our letters of resignation from the respective positions we hold in this Government. It reads thus: "December 12, 2007 His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, The President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, Presidential Secretariat, Colombo. Your Excellency, Resignation from the position of Minister for Posts and Telecommunication It is with high sense of regret that I write to convey to Your Excellency my resignation with immediate effect from the post of Minister of Posts and Telecommunication in Your Excellencys Government. I, together with my Colleagues from our Party, have been compelled to take this decision in keeping with the expressed will of our constituency who have felt for a considerable period of time that we have failed to safeguard and protect the dignity and rights that they are entitled to as equal citizens of this country despite our having been partners of Your Excellencys Government. We feel that currently there is a lack of viable alternative, which could convince us of our ability to resolve this most critical issue, being part of the Government. Also it is time that we resolved to rededicate ourselves to strengthening the rule of law, human rights and democracy at all levels. Let me take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude for having afforded me to serve in Your Excellencys Government as Minister of Posts and Telecommunication. Yours faithfully, Rauff Hakeem

Mr. Deputy Chairman, the internationally acclaimed American Writer Mark Twain once said, I quote: When in doubt, tell the truth. Today, I am before you to tell the truth about the doubts that I, and Members of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress had been entertaining during the past several months, as Ministers and Members of the ruling coalition. However, I should emphasize the fact that it is with no malice or acrimony that I present my case and that of my Party and we will continue to maintain very healthy ties with President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his Ministers and Members of the Government even in the future despite our decision to leave the Government. There are no hostilities between us. We have only parted ways on principles. We behaved in the most diplomatic manner possible in the process of leaving the Government. As we promised, we have given adequate advance notice on our decision to quit the Government and we expect the Government too to respond to our departure in a similar mature manner and take it in the spirit that we have made this move. All of you are aware the circumstances under which we became part of the Government. The decision was more to do with keeping the unity of the party, than out of conviction that there would be room within this Government, with its assortment of parties, for us to get at least some leg space to get the basic demands of the Muslim community, met. As the leader of the Party, I had serious misgivings about the capability of this Government, with its far right wing slant, to address the grievances of minorities - both Muslims and Tamils - from the very outset. My Friends in Parliament and outside are witnesses to the fact that even on the day I joined the Government - 28th January, 2007 to be precise - I shared my doubts and dilemmas with them. I told them that my stint in this Government is not going to last long and it is to prevent a split in the party that I was joining the Government. If one peruses through the media interviews given by me during several months it will become clear that I have been maintaining this stance in almost all my media comments. Despite all these uncertainties about the manner the Government would approach the Muslim grievances, we were dignified enough to abide by the collective responsibility. We defended the Government in the House and outside throughout our stint, even putting the partys credibility at stake on many occasions. It is true there were times that I had exercised my right to dissent on many occasions as well but, however we exercised the right to dissent with dignity and decorum. Finally at the

Second Reading of the Budget we kept our word and voted for the Budget. While we were dutifully playing our part as an ally of the Government, we were very much conscious of the growing restlessness among our own constituents. The delicate politics in the East, and as a matter of fact also among Muslims outside the North and the East, is in such a situation that everyday new issues keep on cropping up. There is slew of issues pertaining to land, security, economic interest and our right to exercise our religious freedom. In the case of land issues, our people are facing a type of problems that they have never faced before making them feel that they are outcasts in their own lands. On the other hand, the Northern Muslims who have been languishing in Puttalam and in several other neighbouring areas for seventeen long years are now expected to return to their places of origin without any security guarantees, due to fear psychosis among some Members of the Government that a long-term presence of my people in Puttalam would disturb the traditional demographic pattern of the area. , . . - . , , , , , . . . . ? ? , . , .

. . , . Mr. Deputy Chairman, as a result of all these things, during the last few months my Party came under tremendous pressure from the Muslim community to withdraw our support to the Government as there was absolutely no hope for the community in the horizon under the present regime. The unpalatable reality about the Government is that its composition and power alignment are such that it can make very little progress in addressing the grievances of the minorities, not only Muslims equally those of Tamils. Even though a few may make some genuine efforts to resolve some of the issues, those moves too are doomed to fall apart due to the imbalanced power configuration. Here, I must very emphatically say, that we have no differences with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and its policies. We have always been comfortable and we had been working along, in the past and even in the future we can consider if they have a paradigm shift in their policy towards the post 2000 era policies and that is something that we must emphasize here. It is my duty, Mr. Deputy Chairman, with the same dignity and decorum to thank the Hon. Members of this Government, His Excellency the President, the Hon. Prime Minister, the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, the Leader of the House, the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, the Chief Government Whip as well as my other Cabinet Colleagues with whom I have shared my grievances and my reasons for the discomfort I have had in being part of this Government. I am sure they too do understand these difficulties. Moreover, it is my duty to also thank another new Member of this House, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa. It is not that he did not try to keep us within this fold but I know, he utterly failed. He failed not for trying, but because certain elements in this Government would not see the reasons he saw in trying to have the legitimate representatives of the Muslim community within the fold of this Government. With those words, I thank once again all my Colleagues in this Government and wish them all the very best. Thank you very much. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) .

[ , , , .] [ . . .] [Thereupon the Hon. Rauff Hakeem, the Hon. Hasan Ali, the Hon.Basheer Segu Dawood and the Hon. Faizal Cassim crossed from the Government to the Opposition Benches.] [. . 2.29 ] .

( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Deputy Chairman, before I commence my speech, may I only suggest, Sir, that the time taken by the Hon. Rauff Hakeem in making his statement may be divided amongst all the parties proportionately, within the Government, the Opposition, the UNP, the JVP and we also will forego a part of our time. We are discussing, Sir, the Votes of the Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rights. I would respectfully state that I think the biggest disaster that the Hon. Minister has to manage today is the human rights situation in this country. That, I think is the biggest disaster he is confronted with and which he has to manage. Before I proceed further, Sir, to deal with the question of human rights in this country, I would like to read from a publication of the UN, in regard to the struggle for human rights. That publication states" Each violation of human rights, wherever it occurs is a threat to the welfare and dignity of the entire human family. The protection of human rights therefore is a worldwide responsibility which transcends all racial, ideological and geographical boundaries. This is the fundamental belief which has given birth to the international struggle for human rights. Therefore, Sir, might I state that the human rights situation in this country is not merely a concern for this country but a concern for the whole world. Today, we have begun to see that the world, the international community in particular, is beginning to show their concern in a very grave and serious way in regard to the human rights situation that prevails in this country. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) . . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Before I proceed further, Sir, permit me to read one paragraph from the Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which states, I quote:

3407 3408

Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law In this country, Sir, we are in a situation where certainly human rights are not being protected by the rule of law. In fact, I would submit that there is no rule of law in this country today. We have reached a stage of utter lawlessness and that is precisely the main problem that we face in regard to the human rights in this country today. May I kindly request the Hon. Members, Sir, to keep quiet ? - [Interruption.] Please! - [Interruption.] Might I appeal to the Chair to ask the Hon. Members to let me speak ? ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) , . . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Sir, if they take my time - [Interruption.] They must give me time. Please, do not disturb me. - [Interruption.] I want to say, Sir, that the main reason for the human rights situation in this country being so bad is that the most fundamental human right of the Tamil-speaking people, the Tamil people in particular has not been recognized in this country in the past 50 years. That is, the right to internal self-determination in their areas of historical habitation, which is their fundamental birth right, an inalienable right inherent to those people who bear a distinct identity and who have occupied a certain part of this country. It is the failure to recognize the right to internal self-determination in their areas of historical habitation, which is recognized by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and by the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, I emphasize, is the main reason for the situation we face in regard to human rights. Before I proceed further, Sir, I would like to quote from the Constitution of this country. I consider the Constitution of Sri Lanka to be an albatross, something very oppressive and which needs fundamental changes. This Constitution needs to undergo a paradigm shift in regard to its structure of governance, but, nevertheless, what does the Constitution state? It states, Sir, in Article 3, I quote: "In the Republic of Sri Lanka sovereignty is in the people and is inalienable. Sovereignty includes the powers of government,...." That is the Legislative power, the Executive power and the judicial power. ".....fundamental rights and the franchise." So, sovereignty also includes human rights. All governments in all countries have invariably enshrined in

their Constitutions a chapter on fundamental rights very often, frequently, based upon the Universal Declaration of Human Rights accepted by the UN General Assembly. Different countries may differ. Therefore, the point I want to make is that in terms of your Constitution the expression "sovereignty" also incorporates fundamental rights; it also incorporates human rights. When human rights is under attack in any country, it means that sovereignty is under attack in that country, that sovereignty is no longer a robust whole, on the contrary, it is under pressure; it is under attack and if it continues to be under pressure and if it continues to be under attack- ( ) (The Deputy Chairman)

,

! , . ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Dullas Alahapperuma- Minister of Transport) " " . , . . Question put, and agreed to. , .

, , () . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and THE HON. (MRS.) RENUKA HERATH took the Chair. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Madam Chairperson, if sovereignty continues to be under attack in a country on the ground that human rights is under attack it would mean that that sovereignty cannot continue to be one robust, holistic whole. It must fragment; it will fragment. That will be inevitable and then we will have a situation where the sovereignty has got to be shared. Perhaps, different people will also be entitled to exercise sovereignty. That will be the position. If you continue to deny the right of internal self-determination to a people who have a distinct identity, who have historically inhabited a certain part of this country, it is inevitable that your sovereignty must crumble and when your sovereignty crumbles, it is inevitable that your sovereignty will have to be shared with someone else, with those people who will be entitled to exercise their own sovereignty. Before I proceed any further, Madam, on this very point, I would like to read from a letter that the late Prime Minister of India, Shrimati Indira Gandhi wrote to President Richard Nixon on 15th December, 1971 in regard to the situation that then prevailed in Bangladesh - then, there were the East Pakistan and the West Pakistan - when it was just being created. This is what she said, I quote: The fact of the matter is that the rulers of West Pakistan got away with the impression that they could do what they liked, because no one, not even the United States, would choose to take a public position that

[ . ]

2007 12 3409 3410

while Pakistans integrity was certainly sacrosanct human rights, liberty were no less so, and that there was a necessary inter-connection between the inviolability of states and the contentment of their people. So, if you continue to keep a people continuously in a state of discontentment, denying them of their most fundamental, inalienable human right - the right to internal self-determination - it is inevitable, Madam, that your sovereignty will be under attack. You might well remember what happened in East Pakistan, which was a part of Pakistan, as a result of that and this situation has also happened in other parts of the world. Having said that, Madam, I would like to refer now briefly to the human rights situation that prevails in this country. It is appalling; it is deplorable - there are massive killings and disappearances, persons are being abducted, persons have no freedom, there is large scale aerial bombing, there is large scale artillery fire, multi-barrel rockets are being fired into civilian populated areas, people are being killed in large numbers, civilian property is being destroyed, houses, plantations, crops, livestock, everything is being destroyed and people are being rendered destitute. They are compelled to go into refugee camps in various parts of the Northern and Eastern Provinces and thousands of people have been killed, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced both in the North and the East. I propose to give you a brief account of that before I proceed further with my speech. Around 3,900 people were killed in the North-East in 2006 and in the first quarter of 2007, over 700 people were killed in the North-East. These were largely Tamils. They were killed by aerial bombardment, multi-barrel rocket fire, extrajudicial killings by the armed forces and paramilitary groups collaborating with the armed forces. In about the past one year, over 1,000 people, mostly Tamil civilians, are believed to have disappeared. Individual Tamils, two Tamil Parliamentarians, two ex-Tamil Parliamentarians, Tamil members of the clergy, Tamil academics, leading Tamil businessmen, Tamil journalists, Tamil civil society activists, Tamil aid workers employed by international and domestic Non-Governmental Organizations, Tamil students, Tamil civilians seeking refuge in places of worship and other Tamil civilians have been targeted and killed by the armed forces and by paramilitary groups collaborating with the armed forces. The objective of attacks on religious leaders, journalists and civil society activists is to silence such persons and thereby, prevent the exposure of serious human rights abuses. The Government, we are sorry to say, has not been able to take any action to curb this situation. Madam, recently there has been a publication put out by the Law and Society Trust which has done some research, a study on this question in collaboration with four local partners including the Civil Monitoring Commission and the Free Media Movement. They have found that 662 persons have been killed and 540 persons have disappeared during the period 1st January to 31st August, 2007, in a matter of eight months, the number totalling to 1,202, roughly five victims per day. Copies of this document together with their details have been sent to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry dealing with the abductions and disappearances, the Hon. Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights, the Human Rights Commission and the Attorney-General. In particular, we wish to focus on the fact that the adequacy and propriety of the investigations conducted into these incidents need to be looked at very carefully because there has hardly been any proper investigation done in regard to these several incidents.

I also wish to quote, Madam, from yet another document which has been prepared by several NGOs. "Since the signing of the CFA an approximate total killed amounts to 4,186 in the North and East, with approximately 3,685 killed in the Northern and Eastern provinces from October 2005-May 2007. Whilst exact figures are hard to obtain, other reports from 2005 up to date show an estimated 346 killed/ 533 wounded in 2005, 3,900 killed/ 4,000 wounded in 2006 (with 3,500 killed in the second quarter of 2006 alone) and 705 killed/ 721 wounded in the first quarter of 2007." This is the position, Madam, in regard to the killings that have been going on. In regard to Jaffna, I got some figures this morning from my Friends who are Members of Parliament for Jaffna, since April 2006 up to September, 2007, almost daily two, three or four persons have been killed. About 50 civilians have been killed in a month. Particularly, youth have been targeted by the armed forces and by paramilitary groups. One hundred and ninety three civilians fearing death have sought the protection of the Human Rights Commission in Jaffna and they are presently in custody in the jail in Jaffna for their protection. That is the position in regard to Human Rights. In regard to displacement, according to the reports of various human rights organizations, since August, 2006, 315,000 people fled from their homes in the Eastern Province and 100,000 people in March, 2007 alone. These staggering figures are in addition to the 200,000 to 250,000 people displaced by the tsunami in 2004 and not yet resettled and 315,000 people displaced by the conflict prior to 2002, who also have not yet been resettled in the North and the East. That is in regard to the Eastern Province and what is the position in regard to the North? In the Jaffna District the number of families displaced is 37,631 comprising of 130,248 people. In the Mannar District it is 6,328 families comprising of 23,662 people. In the Vavuniya District it is 3,027 families comprising of 10,643 members and in the Mullaitivu and the Kilinochchi Districts the total number of families displaced is a little over 16,000 and the number of members of families displaced is 83,364 totalling to 247,917 people displaced in the Northern Province in recent times. With the 315,000 people who have been displaced in the Eastern Province as a result of the recent actions of the Government since about August last year, apart from the persons displaced in the earlier period of war and the persons displaced as a result of tsunami, around 600,000 Tamil civilians have been displaced and are living in refugee camps, or with their friends and relations in other places, with hardly any facilities - short of food, short of drinking water, no sanitation and suffering immense deprivation. Sometimes they are being compelled by the Government, against their wish, to return to areas where there is no security. It is an inhuman situation, Madam, that prevails in these areas. I must say that a large number of these people have been displaced as a result of aerial bombardment and multi-barrel rocket launcher fire and that the Government is acting with callous disregard for the safety of the Tamil civilian population. They have no occupation; they have no fishing; they have no farming; they do not have their livestock; they are unable to derive an income; they are unable to survive; the children do not go to school, they have no education and these people are undergoing immense human suffering as a result of the actions of the Government. High Security Zones have been declared. In the Mutur area a High Security Zones has been newly created. There is ethnic cleansing. The Government claimed that they were conducting military operations against the LTTE to free the Tamil people from the clutches of the LTTE. What have

3411 3412

you done now? You have destroyed their homes, their plantations, their crops, their livestock, their fishing and farming equipment and you say, You cannot go back to your lands and live and the people are being prevented from getting back to the properties in which they have lived for generations and centuries and they are living in a state of utter penury and destitution. What else is this but downright ethnic cleansing, displacement of Tamil people in order to make sure that the Tamil people do not return to those areas. The Hon. Rauff Hakeem happened to remark in the course of his speech, I could not agree with him less, that there is no rule of law in this country, that there is a state of lawlessness that prevails in this country. That is the true position Sir, in regard to the current situation of this country. I must also in this context, Sir, refer to a newspaper article under the heading, "LST claims east not liberated but militarized", which quotes the Report of the Law and Society Trust that has been published recently in regard to the position of the Eastern Province. I quote: "Killings, disappearances and abductions of persons persist in the highly militarized environment of Trincomalee and Mutur, while thousands languish in welfare camps seeking adequate food, shelter and protection. Are you not ashamed of yourselves to allow people to languish in this way seeking adequate food, shelter and protection? I further quote the newspaper article: Despite claims of liberation and reawakening of the East, civilians in Trincomalee live in a highly militarized environment. Despite the heavy presence of security forces, disappearances and killings continue regularly," the LST said in the report based on a field visit. The Article goes on, I quote: "Citing the Human Rights Commission, (HRC) Trincomalee office, the report noted that abductions and disappearances were reported almost daily with 24 cases in August and 39 in September. "Many incidents go unreported as no formal complaint is made to the HRC or Police due to fear of reprisals. the report notes while adding that Trincomalee remains heavily militarized and tense with the town deserted after 7 p.m. It said though the HRC intervened on some violations, it failed to make any notable impact, while HRC investigations into the killing of the five students in January 2006, 17 AFC aid workers in August, 2006 and Ven. Nandarathna thera in Trnicomalee had reached a standstill. Ven. Nandarathna thero, Sir, was one of the Buddhist priests who was very friendly, who got along on very well with the Tamil people and who was shot dead for that reason. Now, Sir, while we make all these complaints about all our rights being denied and so on and so forth and about lawlessness in this country being at its zenith and our being deprived of the right to internal self-

determination and so on, we find Sir, there is a degree of arrogance, a degree of intolerance on the part of the Government in regard to these matters and this is reflected particularly in the way in which they deal with the Members of the international community. The first member of the international community who was given a dressing down is a Member of the UN staff, Mr. Allan Rock, Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Children in Armed Conflict. He came to this country; he went around; he had several things to say about various people and he said that children were being conscripted by paramilitary forces and that the security forces were being helpful to the paramilitary forces in carrying these out. It is common knowledge, it is known to everybody. We knew that in Batticaloa sometimes the security forces had round ups to enable these paramilitary forces to go and conscript children, to abduct children. Allan Rock merely said that, and he was hauled over the coals and he was called all manner of things. Then we had Sir John Holmes, UN Under Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs. He did not say anything very much. He came here, he looked around and then he quite correctly has said, I think, and quite truthfully said that Sri Lanka is one of the most dangerous places in the world for international aid workers. That is what he said. It is perfectly true because there have been a large number of aid workers who have been killed and then he was called a terrorist for saying that. It was said that he had taken a bribe from the LTTE . There was also a news report that he had been told that if he comes to Sri Lanka again that he will be dealt with. This is the way international personalities of the United Nations who come to this country, who see for themselves and speak out quite frankly and truthfully in the hope that the situation will improve are treated. In fact, I have a report which appeared in The Sunday Times of August 19th 2007 which states, I quote: The UN Chief of Cabinet, Vijay Nambiar, summoned Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Prasad Kariyawasam. On behalf of the UN Secretary General, Nambiar asked Kariyawasam whether Fernandopulles remarks were the official view of the Sri Lankan Government. He had also referred to a Tamil website, which had attributed remarks to Fernandopulle that Sir John would be arrested if he visits Sri Lanka again. I do not think Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe would have been a party to that arrest but this is what has been said by a Colleague of yours in Cabinet. It further states, I quote: Kariawasam was to explain that the remarks were personal views of Fernandopulle and did not represent the Government. That I will take with a pinch of salt because Fernandopulle is the Chief Government Whip, he is the person who speaks on behalf of the Government most in Parliament and I do not think he would have made such

[ . ]

2007 12 3413 3414

very serious statements unless he had the approval of someone very high-up in the Government. He knew that he had the authority to speak in that way and speaking in that way would find acceptance with the Government and would be approved by the Government otherwise I do not think Fernandopulle would have dared to say that. Of course the UN Secretary-General was also very upset about this matter. He made a statement in regard to this matter. A newspaper report which appeared in the Daily Mirror of 18th August 2007 states, I quote: Several government officials angrily rejected Holmes statement and demanded a retraction. Government Chief Whip and Minister Jeyaraj Fernandopulle on Wednesday called Mr. Holmes a terrorist and alleged he had taken a bribe from the LTTE Naturally the UN Secretary General was very upset about it. The report further states, I quote: UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said today that comments by a Sri Lankan Minister calling his humanitarian co-coordinator a terrorist were unacceptable and unwarranted. UN Humanitarian Chief John Holmes who was in Sri Lanka recently in an interview to Reuters said Sri Lanka was among the most dangerous places in the world for humanitarian workers. He specifically referred in particular to 17 aid workers attached to Action Against Hunger (ACF) killed execution-style in Eastern Sri Lanka an year ago. The report goes on, Madam: During his visit to the island nation, Mr. Holmes said nearly 30 aid workers have been killed over the past 18 months. The Consortium for Humanitarian Agencies, an umbrella group of 104 aid agencies operating in Sri Lanka, puts the number at 34, a figure the Government questions. So what was wrong in Sir. John Holmes saying that Sri Lanka is one of the countries where the highest number of aid workers are killed. It is substantiated by very independent material. Then we have Justice Bhagwati, Chairman of the International Independent Group of Eminent Persons, a body which comprises of eminent people from various countries, from Bangladesh, from Indonesia, from Japan, from the US, from France, in fact we have met with some of them, having said that the Commission appointed to monitor certain human rights violations or to go into certain specific cases, which had been referred to that Commission and the Independent Group of Eminent persons appointed to oversee the working of the Commission cannot be a substitute for a robust mechanism permanently installed in this country to monitor human rights on a regular basis wherever it occurs in the country and Justice Bhagwati was hauled over the coals. I will not go into that in detail but the fact of the matter is that very responsible people in this country said very improper things, in my view, about Justice Bhagwati.

The language used was The International Independent Group of Eminent Persons had engaged in improper conduct. That was the language used. Justice Bhagwati called upon the Government to appoint a robust International Human Rights Monitoring Mechanism which had wider powers than the IIGEP. That is all that he wanted and he wanted that body to regularly monitor all human rights violations in this country by whomever they are committed and he was hauled over the coals for that. Now, Madam Chairperson, this is an indication of the arrogance, the insolence, the impertinence, the impudence, the intolerance, on the part of responsible persons in the Government in regard to statements made by very responsible persons whom you have invited, whom you have appointed to hold positions and when they speak the truth in regard to the actual situation you are unable to stomach it, you are unable to bear it and you insult these people. Now, recently, the UN Human Rights Commissioner, Madam Louise Arbour came here. I and some of my Colleagues also met with her, perhaps not as long as the Hon. Minister met with her, but we had a good meeting with her. She was of course, as everybody knows, a former prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. She was also a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada and this is what she has said after her visit to Sri Lanka. In fact, she was giving evidence in regard to the Sri Lankan situation before the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. I have not been able to see what she said but I am inclined to the view that it could not have been too complimentary. Be that as it may, this is what she said when she came to Sri Lanka. "The Sunday Times" newspaper of 14th October, 2007 states, I quote: Ms. Arbour, a former prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, expressed a different position when addressing the media after winding up her four day visit to Sri Lanka. She said- 'It has become apparent that pure technical co-operation cannot address what I consider are human rights challenges that the country faces at this time.' " She further states, I quote: I want to make my position very clear. I believe that technical assistance or co-operation is always a good thing. But I dont believe that it is sufficient at this particular stage in dealing with the human rights situation in Sri Lanka. I hope to continue my efforts to persuade the government that the presence of the OHCHR .in Sri Lanka would be a great benefit to the people. She made a further statement. I quote: A striking discrepancy exists in the perceptions of reality among different sections of the community. There are allegations that are easily dismissed as those told for propaganda purposes and so do not warrant investigation. I have had a lot of experience in creditability assessment and I have found in this

3415 3416

country that many allegations, in my view, are certainly credible enough to be investigated. The point that she made was that there were several allegations that were being made in this country, which are credible enough to be investigated but which were in fact not being investigated. That was the point she made. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I have got 45 minutes, Madam. I started at - ( ) (The Presiding Member) You have only 40 minutes. .

Ms. Arbour who was in Sri Lanka on an invitation extended to her by President Mahinda Rajapaksa when the two met in Geneva earlier this year, said in her opening remarks, that in the context of the armed conflict and the emergency measures taken against terrorism, the weakness of the rule of law and prevalence of impunity in Sri Lanka were alarming. While the Government pointed to several initiatives it has taken to address these issues, there has yet to be an adequate and credible public accounting for the vast majority of these incidents. In the absence of more vigorous investigations, prosecutions and convictions, it is hard to see how this will come to an end, . I want to ask you, what has happened to the case of five students killed in Trincomalee. The file has been closed. I know that on the night of that killing there were efforts made to make it appear that the students were killed in a self-inflicted explosion. That theory exploded the next day when the JMO who held the postmortem revealed that every one of them was killed as a result of gunshot injuries. Bullets were recovered from the bodies of the children. If the proper guns had been recovered, the assailants would have been captured and would have been brought before the law. But the investigations were botched up. The proper guns were not recovered. That is what happened. When I met the President in regard to that matter, he told me "They were killed by the STF". He said, "I know that". I asked him, "How did the STF go there? They were never there". He said, "I do not know who sent them there". I said, "Your brother is the secretary. He should know". He said, "Even he did not know". The STF had suddenly gone there. They were never in Trincomalee. These five students were killed and thereafter they were called back. Then, what happened to the case of seventeen aid workers killed in Mutur? I have got the letter that I wrote to the President in regard to that matter. What is happening now? The bullets that were recovered as per the orders of the Anuradhapura Magistrate were not sent to the Government Analyst directly. The police went and took charge of the bullets from the doctor in Anuradhapura. The doctor in Anuradhapura should have sent the bullets to the Government Analyst or given the bullets to the court. But bullets were given to the police and the bullets were not in continuing proper safe custody. A senior police officer in charge of that investigation was suddenly transferred. What has happened to the murder of the Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham? What has happened to the murder of the Hon. Raviraj? They were our Members of Parliament. What happened to those investigations? The Hon. Raviraj was shot on a public highway, in a high security area. The assailants went past check posts. They got past check posts when they escaped. Why has not the truth been discovered? I do not say this. Ms. Louise Arbour says that proper investigations are called for. There must be a proper investigative mechanism. There must be a mechanism which oversees these matters which ensures that there are proper investigations, that these things are brought to light immediately, exposed immediately and then the persons concerned will realize that they cannot fudge, that they cannot deceive, that they must do a job of work or they must go home.

That is why, I think, Ms. Louise Arbour had been insisting upon a permanent UN Human Rights Mechanism which will be in a position to look at these matters but you are not concerned, you are not interested. I must also read, Madam, a statement which has been made recently by a very Senior Senator, a powerful US Senator, Senator Patrick Leahy who is the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and this was what he told the Senate when he made his statement. "The Sunday Times" of 4th November, 2007 has his speech. I quote: It is due to this information, from reputable sources, that the Senate attached three conditions to our assistance to the Sri Lankan military in the Fiscal Year 2008 State, Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. Anyone who reviews those conditions should agree that they are reasonable and appropriate. They would require the Sri Lankan government to be bringing to justice members of the military who have been credibly alleged to have committed gross violations of human rights; end unreasonable restrictions on access in the country by humanitarian organizations and journalists; and agree to the establishment of a field presence of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Sri Lanka. People cannot go freely and provide assistance to our refugees. Reputed international organizations, relief organizations that have served in this country and are servicing all parts of the world cannot go freely to our areas and provide relief to our people. Senator Patrick Leahy goes on to further say, Madam, I hope the Minister is listening: But rhetoric about human rights and the appointment of ineffectual commissions I will repeat that. and the appointment of ineffectual commissions I am not saying it. Senator Leahy is saying it. .commissions of inquiry that have no credibility, only goes so far. The situation remains grave and those responsible for abuses are rarely punished, making a peace agreement more difficult to achieve. A field presence of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, with sufficient mandate and capability to conduct full and unfettered monitoring throughout the country, communicate its findings to all sides of the conflict and the public, and provide advice and technical assistance, is overdue. Also urgently needed is greater access for humanitarian organizations to assist civilians caught in the cross-fire and for journalists to report the facts. This is what we want, Madam. But, the Government would not do this. On the other hand, Madam, we find recently the UNICEF is under attack by some of my Colleagues here. They have got some meals ready to eat. They have got some meals for their own people. They serve widely in this country. They serve in all parts of this country and they are under attack, all motivated, to prevent the UNICEF continue their service to the Tamil people. Why are you doing all these? I need to pose the question as to why you are doing all these. I want to say that the reason why you are preventing an Independent United Nations Monitoring Mechanism in this country is not

merely because of the violations that have taken place thus far. This is a part of your larger political agenda. You have got an agenda of displacing the Tamils from the Eastern Province, a large scale displacement of Tamils. You have got an agenda of wanting to carry out an aggressive military programme irrespective of what will happen to the civilians in the Wanni, irrrespective of whether they will die in hundreds or thousands, you will not care. You want to kill them in order to succeed in your military programme. There is heavy aerial bombardment and heavy multi-barrel rocket fire. You want to move into Wanni and you want to kill those people. You do not mind the destruction that will be caused to civilian property. You will not mind the number of Civilian deaths. You do not mind hundreds or thousands of people being displaced. You do not care for those people. But you cannot do these things if you have in this country, a permanent UN human rights monitoring mechanism that will observe these things, will look into these things. That is the real truth. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , 10 . . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I will wind up in two minutes, Madam. In order to succeed in this agenda, you have to somehow keep an independent, impartial, upright and forthright monitoring mechanism out of the country in order to be able to pursue your agenda. This is the objective. I want to say, Madam, that this type of thing cannot be permitted. It must stop. If it does not stop, it will mean that - so far 600,000 Tamil people have being displaced - very soon yet another 500,000 will be displaced. Thousands of people will be killed. Tamil houses will be destroyed. Tamil means of livelihood will be destroyed. Their occupation will suffer. They will be driven to the refugee camps. There will be ethnic cleansing to pursue your programme of Sinhalisation of the East. You cannot do those things if your actions are monitored by an international body. That is the reason why you are not prepared to have this UN field mechanism. Therefore, I want to make an appeal to the Government, Madam. Stop this military pogrom, stop these attacks on the Tamil people, stop this aerial bombardment of Tamil areas which is indiscriminately killing Tamil civilians, stop using the multi-barrel rocket launchers in these areas, stop destroying our property, stop displacing our civilians, stop harassing us in this way and stop harming us in this way. Before I finish, Madam, please permit me to just read a statement made by His Excellency the President in the United Nations. You must know about it. I was a little

surprised because he was pleading in mitigation. He was virtually pleading in mitgaiton for himself and his Government. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Yes. Thank you very much. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I am finishing up, Madam, in just two minutes. ( ) (The Presiding Member) There is no time. You have already taken 13 minutes more. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Okay, Madam. I will not read the statement. But the statement is here. When I read the speech that His Excellency the President had made in the United Nations, I felt he was pleading in mitigation. The journalist who reported said that diplomatic and political observers here are of the view that the message reflected the chasm between Colombo and the international community on human rights. That is sufficient. So, please stop it. If you do not stop it, I want to make an appeal to the international community on the Floor of this House that we have a right to protection, we have a right to protection under international law and we want the international community not to be slow in ensuring that that right to protection under international law is made available to the Tamil civilian population in this country, because we have a right to live, we have a right to survive and we should not be allowed to perish. I thank you, Madam. [. . 3.24] ( )

( . - ) (The Hon. P. Radhakrishnan - Deputy Minister of Vocational Training) Sir, I am pleased to speak on two subjects, Community Development and Human Rights. As far as community development and social inequity eradication are concerned, my Leader, the Hon. Chandrasekaran is doing enormous work to uplift the downtrodden people. We have submitted to the Government, a master plan for the development of the plantation area and also made several proposals for the improvement of that lot. I hope the Government will give serious thought to it and fulfil our needs. As far as the human rights violations are concerned, I need not say about the rampant violations taking place almost everyday. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne) How can you sit on that side? . ( . ) (The Hon. P. Radhakrishnan) My good Friend, the Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne interrupts me, but I should thank him here today. He brought to the notice of the House on 6th June 2007, about one Gajanayake. Since then, abductions have stopped. I take this opportunity to thank him. As far as the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe is concerned as the Minister of Human Rights, he is a very energetic and a capable Minister. But unfortunately he is unable to check on the human rights violations. I do not intend to take my full time since I want to give some of my time to the Hon. Minister. Hon. Minister, I have a list of 270 detainees who are at the Boossa Camp. I shall submit this list to you. You should go through this list and try to release those people who are on the borderline or who have no allegations against them. The parents of these people are suffering. They are shedding tears. Everyday they come to me and cry. I think what has happened is a very, very inhuman thing. Why do you not keep back only the people who really have allegations against them and not the entire lot, which is a very inhuman thing? We, the Tamil Members of Parliament are always at the receiving end. Still, we are with the Government. So, realizing that fact, I think you must take appropriate steps. I am making an earnest appeal to you. Hon. Minister, I would say that because of these arrests, there are some people whose livelihood have been disrupted. They have no means of living. So the Government must do something about it. There are people who have got their visas and air tickets but are not able to go abroad for employment. I think the Government should compensate them. Not only that, I

2007 12 3433 3434

will cite one more case. One person was to appear for an examination for a job in Vavuniya last Saturday. He has been deprived of sitting the examination. So he will not get a job. What is the Government going to do about this? Hon. Minister, I earnestly request you to look into these aspects. I am giving some of my time to you because I really like you. You must find solutions to these problems. As the Minister in charge of Human Rights, you are allowing the international community to come and interfere in our affairs because we are not doing the right thing as far as human rights are concerned. If we uphold human rights perfectly, I do not think anybody can intervene in our matters. So why are you leaving room for that? Let the Government govern. Let us have good governance. Today, I know that relatives of some of the Members of the Eastern Province are being threatened. Is this the way to govern? We want good governance. Everybody must live in peace and harmony and we must be able to get about our day-to-day work. What have we been doing in the past years? Now we are supporting. Every Tamil should be able to go about in the city and be able to send their children out. These things should be remedied and we must have peace. Hon. Minister, since I wish to give most of the time to you, I shall wind up my speech. Sir, you must go through the statements of the Chief Justice who has given wonderful decisions. He has said, Bombs cannot win people. You must win the hearts of the people. You cannot win this war by airdropping bombs and suppressing people. The Bible says, Love thy neighbour. So, please love the citizens of the country and treat them all alike and give them their rights. Then, these problems will not arise. Hon. Minister, I will conclude my speech, once again requesting you to go into all this. I will submit to you a list of the detainees at the Boossa Camp and on various other issues. There is one more thing that I have to state, Hon. Minister. This morning, it was reported to me that four people were missing from yesterday. But fortunately we have found them in the Borella Police Station. Why is this? The Borella Police has not reported; they should have allowed them to use a telephone. They should have been allowed to contact their relatives so that they would have known about these people. One poor man whose brother is one of the detainees had to go in search of his brother. I will give that list to you. Ultimately he had found his brother in the Borella Police Station. If the police had acted with a bit of common sense, I think this situation would have not arisen. So, I conclude my speech by requesting you to please go into all these matters and put an end to the human rights violations and let us live peacefully. Thank you.

Thank you very much, Sir. I want to at the outset, thank all of the - ( ) (The Hon. Palitha Range Bandara)

Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman)

Point of Order ? ( ) (The Hon. Palitha Range Bandara) , , . . - ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) That is not a point of Order. . ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) game . I want to place on record, Sir, that many Members who spoke today acknowledged the work that our Ministry had been doing over the past year. I want to thank them and also

place on record my appreciation for several other Members who spoke. Some were not praiseworthy of what we have been doing as a Government. They brought up certain shortcomings that they felt need to be addressed, that we have failed to address and those I regard, as constructive criticism. Certainly, these are areas that we would be looking into in the coming year to ensure that those constructive criticisms which were put forward would not be just discarded, but would be looked into and some results shown.

Sir, the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana who spoke first mentioned about the IPU. He placed on record the fact that once I had been the President of the Inter-Parliamentary Union's Human Rights Committee. That is correct. I served in that Committee for seven years. He also stated that there are several complaints before the Committee, as we speak now, regarding violations of human rights of Members of this House. That is also correct. There are a number of complaints which have gone before the IPU's Human Rights Committee. Usually, Sir, the IPU deals with these through the national Parliament of a country. They correspond directly with the Hon. Speaker and it is the Speaker, who in turn corresponds and engages in a dialogue with them.

Since I have a long history of association with the IPU's Human Rights Committee and the IPU as well, I took it upon myself as the Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights to intervene and keep them informed from time to time after engaging the stakeholders in the Government and obtaining information - status reports - from them and whenever the IPU's Human Rights Committee met in Geneva or elsewhere, I took the initiative of supplying them with updated information. I also took up some of these matters at the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Human Rights, engaged with investigators, other stakeholders and I did not fail to emphasize the fact that this is not something that can be tolerated and condoned. Violating human rights of Members of Parliament - two of our friends, the Hon. Nadarajah Raviraj and the Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham, who were old friends of mine, were brutally assassinated - is not something that any Member of this House can ever condone. I have taken this matter up with whoever it has to be taken up with. I have even spoken up on behalf of these two MPs and pointed out the need to cultivate a sense of urgency and show a commitment to get to the bottom of these two assassinations. There are other - . .

. . ( . . ) (The Hon. M.K. Shivajilingam) . . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) The identities of the assassins of the late Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham were furnished to the Government. What is the action you have taken? - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) There are investigations being conducted even now, Hon. Member. All I can say is - I am with you on this - this is not something that we can ever condone and I think it is up to Parliament to resolve and make a commitment to see that especially these two cases are concluded immediately so that we can send out the message that we do not condone these kinds of incidents. I am with you on this. -[Interruption.] I do not entertain a different point of view on this. They may have been critical of Government policy and they may have been critical of personalities, but that is not a reason for them to be assassinated. Therefore, I think, it is important that we all work together to ensure that these investigations are concluded as a matter of urgency. The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana also mentioned about the Leader Publications Limited. - [Interruption.] Can I please finish? Hon. Member, I have a - ( ) (The Hon. Selvarajah Kajendren) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) What is the point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Selvarajah Kajendren) 2006 . . . . ? , , , .

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) , . ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Sir, I am sure the Hon. Member knows that I do not have investigative powers. I can only engage with the different stakeholders and tell them that this is an issue which has been raised internationally, an issue which comes up regularly at important international forums and therefore, we must ensure that these investigations are concluded. That is all I can do. I do not have investigative powers. You must understand that. In respect of the statement made by the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana regarding the burning down of some machines at the Leader Publications Limited, which took place not long ago, I would like to say that it is something I very strongly condemn. The freedom of newspapers, the freedom of journalists is a part of democracy. There may be journalists, there may be newspapers, there may be editorial policies which have gone consistently against the Government of the day, but that should not be a reason for these independent newspapers which publish these articles, newspaper reports and these pronouncements to be crushed in the way the Leader Publications office had been attacked. That is something I am willing to condemn publicly. While I say this, I also must say that it is incumbent on the investigators to ensure that these investigations are completed and the people who are responsible for this are brought to justice. That must be done, Sir, because when I go overseas and when I go to international forums, I am asked about this. Recently, when I was in Geneva, several Ambassadors came up to me and asked me about this incident. All I could say was, that is not the Government policy, which is correct. In addition to that, all I could say was that the investigations are continuing and I am hopeful that those would conclude in a satisfactory manner so that the perpetrators can be brought to justice. I am expressing that hope. This is an important issue. - [Interruption.] No, I am not going to yield, Sir. I have only twenty minutes and I have to answer especially the Hon. Sampanthan, who raised some very important issues. The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana also mentioned about the National Advisory Body and asked me the question as to why all the members have resigned. They all have not resigned. I appointed ten members of the Civil Society because I wanted to engage with the civil society on a continuous basis, have a dialogue with them, give them a forum to come and face Government stakeholders, put forward their suggestions, criticize actions which have been taken by the Government and the different agencies of the Government in a spirit of democracy. These 10 members were appointed in that spirit and they engaged with us on several occasions. Of course, the attendance of some of them was not as good as that of the others but nevertheless, depending on their work schedule, they made it a point to come for these meetings and they did put forward some very good suggestions, which we took on board.

3443 3444

[ ]

In fact, I want to place on record some of these suggestions. One was, the reissuance of the special presidential directives on arrest and detention. Our Ministry was able to engage with the Presidential Secretariat and get these special directives of His Excellency the President reissued. In fact, we even went a step further as a result of a suggestion made by the Advisory Body and I put in place a sub-committee consisting some of these people who have resigned, which went with the police to inspect police stations at random to ensure that the receipt books were there and the special presidential directives on arrest and detention were being adhered to. When people are arrested, the directives say that especially if they are under 18 or if they are females, they can be accompanied by the next of kin and when they go to the police station to record their statement, they have a right to choose a language of their choice and get it recorded in that language. There is also a provision to say that if they cannot write, they can get someone to write their statement in the police record book. All these safeguards have been put forward by none other than His Excellency the President. So, we expect especially the police to adhere to this. This is relevant not only to the police, but also to the armed forces. So, we took that step, Sir, of going to the police stations and doing random checks. We found certain shortcomings. Then, we engaged with the Inspector-General of Police; we ensured that he issued a circular to all the police stations and by and large, these directives are now in place for the police stations to follow. So, we express the hope that these would be adhered to. There was another very important suggestion that the Advisory Body brought forward. There are forms being handed over to the householders to get their statistics - who are living in those particular houses - to ensure that the police and other people who are charged with the responsibility - ( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) May I have a small clarification? Are those forms given to all the people or only to Tamils? ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Initially, I must say, we did receive complaints that only a particular ethnic group was targeted. I admit it. ( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) Why? ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Please, wait. Can I finish? Then we took the step of ensuring that a proper circular was issued through the Inspector-General of Police and we made sure that not only one ethnic group is not targeted, but also that the form would not have personal details such as the religion of that person.

Even that was evident in some of those earlier forms, which I disagreed with and we have rectified that. In fact, we went to the Attorney-General, got this form designed according to the laws of the country, got the IGP to issue it and now it is being given to all householders. So, I agree that at the start there were certain complaints and I acted on those complaints. In fact, some of those complaints were brought to my notice through the Advisory Body and this is another example where the Advisory Body played a very constructive role, Sir. I must also admit that I did not take on board all the suggestions that the Advisory Body came out with. There were certain suggestions which were impossible and impracticable to be implemented. Therefore, we could not do that. But, by and large, the good suggestions were taken on board and we implemented those. It is unfortunate, Sir, that four out of those ten members decided to resign. It is their freedom to decide. If they do not want to continue in such an Advisory Body, in such an advisory capacity, advising the Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights, making use of that forum and engaging with Government stakeholders, that is their choice and I respect that. That does not mean that my commitment to engage with the civil society through a structure like an Advisory Body would diminish. I will not let go of that structure I have put in place. In place of those four members, I will appoint equally eminent, credible people who are there in the civil society today. I can find four very good replacements in place of those four members, who, I would also like to aknowledge, are very good. These are people who have a proven track record. I am not discrediting them in any way. But if they do not want to serve in that Advisory Body, that is too bad. In fact, I sent a message to them asking them to reconsider it. But, it is very unfortunate that they decided not to continue. Therefore, I will replace them with four others and my commitment to engage with the civil society through this Advisory Body will continue. Now, Sir, - . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) May I seek a small clarification? ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) I have only fourteen minutes. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) Please, bear with me. Give me just one minute. Hon. Minister, you can see that under the current Emergency Regulations, there is no provision to arrest a person and then detain. According to Regulation 19 (1), to detain a person, first there must be a detention order under the hand of the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, Public Security, Law and Order. But contrary to that, people are being arrested and detained on detention orders issued

2007 12

thereafter. Will you concede that under Regulation 19(1), a person cannot be detained unless and until there is a detention order in the first place issued by the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, Public Security, Law and Order, directing either the armed forces or the police, for that matter, to take that person into custody and place him on detention? Will you clarify that?

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) There is a certain time period and if they keep a person beyond that time period, what you say is correct: they cannot be held without a detention order being issued.

. ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) You have not understood what I said. My contention is - ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) You are not allowing me to reply to your leader. Let me reply to the Hon. Sampanthan. The Hon. Sampanthan made some very important points. He is someone whom I have known for many many years and whom I have always engaged with in a very constructive manner. I was listening to him very attentively and I would like to reply to some of the points he raised. Hon. Sampanthan, let me tell you very clearly - I say this from the bottom of my heart - that sovereignty is something that is not negotiable. There is a Constitution in this country; there are laws in this country which cannot be bypassed or trampled on. - [Interruption.] No, no. Your explanation about self-determination and all those points that you made are something that you have entertained for a very long time, I know. - [Interruption.] You have entertained that for a very long time and that is not something I agree with. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Chairman)

- []

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Can I finish? - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) .

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) I was going to say, Sir, that sovereignty is something that is not negotiable. But we, as a Government, are committed to address the legitimate aspirations and grievances of the people of the North and the East. - [Interruption.] That involves not only Tamils, but Muslims and Sinhalese as well who live in the North and the East, Sir. There are cultural issues; there are religious issues; there are linguistic issues and there are economic issues. These are legitimate grievances and they can only be addressed by way of a political solution because these are political problems. But as far as - [Interruption.] Can I finish? - [Interruption.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne-Minister of Enterprise Development) Hon. Eelaventhan, no wonder you sought refuge in Canada. You are talking big here. What about the Sinhalese people who live in the North and the East? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Sir, please bring these Hon. Members to order, I have to finish my speech. There are some other important matters that the Hon. Sampanthan has raised and I want to reply to those as well. The Hon. Sampanthan referred to Mr. Allan Rock who came to Sri Lanka on the invitation of the Government of Sri Lanka. He made certain allegations in his report which he said were supported by strong and credible evidence. One of the things he had said and which the Hon. Sampanthan brought to our notice was that security forces were working in cohorts with paramilitary forces in some areas and rounding up children for recruitment. Sir, when this allegation was made, we took it very seriously. We took it very seriously to the extent that I wrote personally to Mr. Allan Rock and said, You say in your report that there is strong and credible evidence. Please share this strong and credible evidence with us so that we can deal with the people who have violated military discipline and the Government policy. Up to now, Sir, we have not got even an acknowledgement of that letter. It is sad. If he said that there was strong and credible evidence, then he should share it with us because we made a commitment to investigate into this matter once that information came to us. But we did not get that information and I even went to the extent of writing to the UNICEF because UNICEF was cited in that report and also, privately when it was communicated, it was some UNICEF staff members who had said that they had

3445 3446

3447 3448

observed this incident. So I called the previous UNICEF representative to my Ministry and asked him to please let us have this information because we want to start the investigation. Up to now I have not been given the evidence that they have shared, as they say, with Mr. Allan Rock. So these kinds of baseless accusations, Sir, cannot be reacted to unless they take us into confidence and work with us to ensure that the truth of these kinds of allegations are looked into and then established. - [Interruption.] Sorry, I have to finish. The Hon. Sampanthan also mentioned about Sir John Holmes. He said that Sir John Holmes was called a terrorist. The Hon. Prime Minister made a statement in this House in this regard and that was the official position of the Government of Sri Lanka and we stand by that particular statement. The Hon. Sampanthan also referred to Mrs. Louise Arbour's visit to Sri Lanka. Mrs. Louise Arbour wanted to go to Kilinochchi. That is true. We had reasons to say, No to her. -[Interruption]. Can I finish? We had very good reasons to say, No to her because in the past we have observed that whenever a high UN dignitary goes to Kilinochchi, what they do is that they take photographs with these people, put it on their website and appeal to all those people outside Sri Lanka to give them money to cause the destruction that they have caused in this country. Now, Sir, we are not going to get caught to something like that. We took a decision that we are not going to sponsor terrorism and Mrs. Louise Arbour understood that. And, I must say, Sir, yesterday she made a statement in Geneva and castigated the LTTE. Although she did not go to Kilinochchi, she very clearly castigated the LTTE and accused them of the terror that they have unleashed in this country. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Shivajilingam, please do not disturb. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Hon. Sampanthan - [Interruption.] Sir, I am really sad that the Hon. Sampanthan has to work with people like this. Look at the gentlemanly way, look at the Parliamentary way that your Leader is sitting down and listening. Why do you also not do that? Now, Sir, about the five students who were murdered in Trincomalee- ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) , .

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Okay. Regarding the five students who were murdered in Trincomalee, the Hon. Sampanthan said that investigations have closed. That is not correct. Investigations have not closed. Investigations are still going on and in fact all those who were suspected of engaging in the shooting were put into remand prison. They were held there for several months and when an identification parade took place, no one could identify them. There are laws in the country. We cannot violate them. They have to be followed and investigations should continue. I also want to say, Sir, that the Commission of Inquiry appointed by His Excellency the President is looking into this case. They have started investigations. The Criminal Investigations Department is still investigating and we are hopeful that we will be able to bring the culprits to book. Then, Sir, finally, the Hon. Sampanthan was rattling out statistics about the disappearances, abductions and extrajudicial killings. The Hon. Sampanthan was quoting some civil society organizations. I want to bring to the attention of the Hon. Sampanthan that when these figures were sent out, it was copied to me. I sat down with my team, I brought in the investigators and we looked at these figures one by one and what we found, Sir, was astonishing. I will give you two examples. They referred to in that list about a Filipino national working for an organization called Mercyco who was killed. Sir, when we saw this, we immediately knew that this would mislead the public and we took it up with these civil society organizations and pointed out to them that this Filipino national was shot as a result of going into an area that he should not have gone. In the night he was intoxicated and from what I hear, he was seeking medical treatment in Singapore. Now, he appears in this list as having been killed and then finally - ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) , . ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Just one point, Sir. There was a person who was referred to in that list as Liptina Jayanthan Sooriyaratnan. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) . . . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) If your hands are clean, if you conscience is clean, why do you not have an independent body to conduct an investigation and come up with a report?

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Precisely, what I am saying is - [Interruption.] What I am saying is, we have a National Human Rights Commission and that is an independent mechanism and we have asked the High Commissioners Office to give us assistance in terms of an advisory capacity and we will not substitute anything to the national structure. Thank you very much. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) 145 ? . " " .
