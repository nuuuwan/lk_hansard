Arumugan Thondaman - Minister of Youth Empowerment and Socio Economic Development) Madam Presiding Member, let me at the outset thank His Excellency the President, Mahinda Rajapaksa for the trust and confidence he has placed in me and entrusting the task of implementing projects and programmes through the Ministry of Youth Empowerment and Socio Economic Development for the empowerment of youths and socio-economic development of the underprivileged community in the underserved areas. I am well aware of the needs of this community particularly the youths whose hopes and aspirations are primarily to enter the main stream of the society and enjoy all rights and privileges as the rest of the population. Therefore, it is my duty to take appropriate measures through my Ministry to fulfil their aspirations and needs so that they could be led into proper direction to make them as equal partners in the society. Madam Presiding Member, the mission that I have undertaken to fulfil to the underprivileged community is one that has been conceived and introduced by my late grandfather Savumiamoorthy Thondaman who championed the causes of the people especially in the underserved areas for several decades and enabled them to achieve social, economic, educational and cultural progress. Having assumed the portfolio of the Minister of Youth Empowerment and Socio Economic Development in August 2006, I have initiated and implemented several programmes centering youth empowerment, socio- economic development and infrastructure facilities to the underprivileged community in underserved areas. Out of the Budget allocations of 2007, extensive projects for empowerment of youths of underprivileged community by improving areas covering educational facilities, vocational skills and standards and promoting cultural and religious observances by assistance to places of worship were undertaken.

In the areas of socio - economic development projects covering improved habitats, child development, pre-school education, enhanced health standards and environment, self-employment, entrepreneur skills and skill development were implemented. The underprivileged community needs to be infused with elements of technological support combined with computer literacy to upgrade their living standards from a dependent social structure to an independent mode of life as enjoyed by the rest of the population. The Prajashakthi Centres, e-Kiosk implemented by the Savumiamoorthy Thondaman Memorial Foundation exactly fulfills this long felt need of the underprivileged community to have access to computer literacy. I would like to mention here that the Savumiamoorthy Thondaman Memorial Foundation was founded by an Act of Parliament and that is the organization which we are using to reach to the community. May I mention here that His Excellency the President on an invitation inaugurated the first phase of the project consisting of 27 e-Kiosk Centres on 18th March, 2006 at the Wanaraja Group, Dickoya. The Second phase of the project comprising of 23 new e-Kiosk Centres in addition to relocating the existing centres in bigger buildings is scheduled for implementation before the end of the year. My Ministry is planning to establish more e-Kiosk Centres over a period of six years which I am proud to say will transform and empower the underprivileged community as an information and communication knowledge - based society which would revolutionize to achieve social and economic progress of the community. I am also happy to inform this House that additional effort such as teaching Sinhala language to Tamil students and vice versa towards national integration is being undertaken by the Ministry through the Prajashakthi Programmes. Madam Presiding Member, while emphasizing the need for making the underprivileged community to become a knowledge-based and technologically- oriented society, we have to take note of the steady social changes taking place enabled by improved educational standards, health facilities, provision of electricity et cetera which demands additional inputs by the Government to satisfy the aspirations of the youth. Therefore, the implementation of the e-governance in the underserved areas would supplement and enhance the commitment of the Government to provide new facilities and social needs.

The Plantation Human Development Trust which is functioning under my Ministry has planned to implement additional projects in the forthcoming year covering areas of improved habitat through construction of houses, roads, water supply, sanitation and measures of income enhancement. Vocational and technical training are two areas implemented by this Ministry to empower the youths. The Thondaman Technical Training Institute at Hatton conducts 14 types of technical training courses to develop vocational skills and standards of the underprivileged youths. This will enable them with opportunities to seek employment locally and abroad. Presently there are 175 trainees undergoing these training programmes. At this juncture, I wish to place on record my deep appreciation and thanks to the Government of India for making available fully funded services of seven Indian instructors to conduct the training programmes at the centre. The Thondaman Cultural Centre at Ramboda and Thondaman Sports Complex at Norwood of which the work is in progress, when completed will fulfil the cultural and recreational needs of the underprivileged youths. Madam, my Ministry is taking all steps to ensure that the disadvantaged youths from the underserved areas are brought into the national stream by implementing projects and programmes in par with national standards which will ultimately pave the way for the enhancement of the aspirations of underprivileged youths and achieve socio-economic development. In conclusion, I wish to take this opportunity to thank the Secretary and all my staff in the Ministry as well as the Chairmen, Directors-General and the other staff of the Plantation Human Development Trust and the Savumiamoorthi Thondaman Memorial Foundation for all their co-operation and help they have been giving me to achieve this goal. Thank you.

In the Introduction of the Performance Report 2007 of the Ministry of Youth Affairs, it states, I quote: The word Youth is defined by the Ministry of Youth Affairs as young persons between the age of 15 - 29 years. The live wire of the country is the young generation, who is destined to take-over the future of the country. The nature of the youth is reflected in the aggressiveness . That is, ! It further states, I quote: . revolutionary nature and desire to explore, create and disclose new findings. Youth is the phase of the life in which youth strives to identify the world through new approaches and dedicated to undertake any live, creative responsibilities.

I will do what I can do" . . , It appeared in an article in the Tamil Canadian Website under the heading "Tamil Natonal Alliance Member of Parliament M.K. Eelaventhan meets Canadian Prime Minsiter", It states, I quote: Both Harper and Eelaventhan shook hands and warmly embraced each other when they were introduced. Eelaventhan told Harper that the Canadian government must come to the rescue of the Eelam Tamils as they faced genocide and economic strangulation. There is a determined move to wipe out the Tamil race from Sri Lanka. As such before a bloodbath takes place an urgent intervention by the Canadian government will save the situation. , I said: Canada may consider offering the Canadian constitution as a model for talks between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government. Eelam Tamils consider the Canadian federal constitution as a pragmatic solution to a multilingual, multinational and multi-religious state such as Sri Lanka. Eelam Tamils are prepared to give serious thought to the Canadian constitution as a classic one to preserve unity in diversity. I also told the Canadian Prime Minister and made it very clear to him that the Canadian Government could exert moral pressure on the Sri Lankan Government to let

them see reason. But if the offer by the Canadian Government is spurned by the Sri Lankan Government, then, Canada is duty bound to recognize the de facto government of Tamils and give them de jure recognition. It is in this context that the Canadian Prime Minister said, I will do what I can do. This is the appeal I have made to the Canadian Prime Minister. In the same breath, in a letter dated 26th September, 2007, I have made an appeal to the UN Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-Moon. It states, I quote: His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa waxed eloquent as usual to deceive and mislead the international community. His declaration that he will submit his proposals for the solution of the ethnic conflict before the end of the year rings hollow in the light of his earlier promises. Perhaps this is the fourth time he has made such a promise since coming to power in November, 2005. Assuming that he will submit his proposals, . Mark my words, . the proposals contain anything worthy of consideration. In fact, his proposals which are based on his Mahinda Chinthanaya have put the clock back by 60 years or more. His Chinthanaya has jettisoned the federal model, that the North and East are the traditional habitat of the Tamil people and they are a distinct nation with right to self-determination. It is totally rejected by "Mahinda Chintana". What is he speaking of peace and amity and going round the world? He was in Japan when I left Japan on the 08th. I do not know how it coincided. It further states, I quote: Not surprisingly Mahinda Rajapaksa has confessed that Tamil aspirations are fine, but his political survival depends on the electoral support of the Sinhala constituency. You will agree that the rights and freedoms of the Tamil people are independent and distinct from the rights and freedoms of the Sinhala people. What we the Tamils proclaim is that we are a Nation by any definition in accordance with international norms, have a distinct and separate national identity, a unique language and culture, defined territory and a way of life from time immemorial. We will not dwell on the history of Ceylon, . ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) , . . . ( . . ) (The Hon. M. K. Eelaventhan) Sir, I will conclude. It further states, I quote:

We like to remind you that the UN Charter speaks of third party intervention when there is genocide, right to revolt when there is oppression and the right to self - determination. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) , .

3167 3168

. . ( . . ) (The Hon. M. K. Eelaventhan) Sir, I am concluding. Sir, the Canadian newspaper National Post of 03.12. 2007 under the heading "Canadian attitude takes sea change", states, I quote: Sri Lankan MP M.K. Eelaventhan, a member of the Tamil National Alliance who recently visited Canada, blamed the security forces for abduction, killings and disappearances. Disappearance is now becoming a normal feature. I will call it a normality. When a person disappears and doesnt appear for three days, you can safely say that he is among the dead. This is what I said. Thank you. [. . 12.12] ( )

Venerable Presiding Member, prior to dealing with the progress of my Ministry, I would like to answer the question raised by the Hon. Earl Gunasekara with regard to the incident in Marawila. I would like to inform this House that our Ministry would take every step to protect the tourists or persons who have made investments mainly in relation to tourism. The police has taken action in this regard, there are persons in custody and the law is taking its course. Now, I shall deal with the progress- ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana)

Hon. Minister, for your kind information, this morning I spoke to the owner, Dr. Dietmar Doering. He wanted me to tell the Hon. Minister as well as you - in fact, he thanked you for contacting him - that the police is not doing anything. He is really unhappy. In fact, he has made a complaint to the American Embassy as well as to the German Embassy. ( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha)

I spoke to SSP Maxie Procter, who is the SSP in charge of the Tourist Police and he informed me that steps have been taken and there are persons in custody in relation to this incident. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana)

I am informing you with great responsibility. This morning I spoke to Dr. Dietmar Doering. That was what he told me: that is, the police has not taken any action. I am taking responsibility for my statement, Venerable Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha)

Now, Venerable Presiding Member, I will deal with the progress we have had during the last ten months.

3195 3196

Tourism is the first industry to be affected by any threat to security or negative publicity in the international media. The last ten months have been very challenging as the tourism industry has been faced with many a situation and obstacle. But through collective effort, with the support of all the stakeholders, my Minister and I have managed to face these challenges. Venerable Presiding Member, as you are aware, tourism is a private sector driven industry and as such, it is of paramount importance that the private sector is a part of the decision-making process to achieve this goal. The new Tourism Act, No. 38 of 2005 was passed during the early part of the year 2005. However, due to various factors and concerns, the Act was not promulgated for a period of time. My Minister, after consulting the stakeholders, took the bold step of promulgating the Act this year, which brought new life to the industry. The stakeholders, who earlier had complaints with regard to the decision-making process, became a part of it. I shall now deal with the progress this industry has made during the last ten months. This sector, which has been challenged from time to time by travel advisories, security concerns and negative publicity in the international media, came up with strategies supported by inner strengths and commitments and slowly and steadily progressed towards recovery and growth. For example, soon after the LTTE used airpower to attack the Katunayake Air Force Base in March 2007, the tourism figures, in comparison to May, 2006, had a drastic drop of 40 per cent. But through collective effort, we have recovered with figures indicating an overall drop of only 20 per cent in comparison to the year 2006. To achieve this goal, a short-term recovery strategy including an aggressive communication campaign primarily to give out the message that Sri Lanka is a safe destination was launched, which has shown dividends. In addition, a tactical plan where cost was shared with operators for publicity and marketing was launched in Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Israel, Russia and India. Venerable Presiding Member, the key elements of the new strategies are as follows: the appointment of an advertising agency to represent Sri Lanka tourism and position our country by re-branding it as one of the most exotic and diverse tourism destinations in the world, engagement of international PR agencies in the UK, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, South India, Japan, Russia, Italy, China, the Middle East and Israel and rationalization of foreign offices for cost saving. The Marketing Bureau will be present in the new markets such as the Middle East and China to spearhead the marketing campaign. The Sri Lankan tourism industry has always looked at India as a market which would drive Sri Lanka tourism ahead through regional tourism. With the economic growth India has achieved in recent times, the Sri Lanka

Convention Bureau, knowing the strength of the corporate sector in India, has initiated specific marketing promotions to attract MICE tourism from that region. The new Tourism Act has established four intuitions: the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management and the Sri Lanka Convention Bureau. The function of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority is to concentrate on infrastructure and product development as promotions could only entice foreigners to visit Sri Lanka, but a good product in place is paramount to the sustainability of the industry. The Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau is to carry out marketing Sri Lanka tourism. In addition to promoting Sri Lanka overseas, focus has also been made on domestic tourism, which has helped sustain the industry during difficult times. The Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management has within its purview the Hotel School, which has only been holding management courses for the hotel sector. The mandate of the Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management is not only to conduct hotel management courses, but also to develop entire human resources required by the industry. The Sri Lanka Convention Bureau is re-established to promote the MICE segment, which means the promotion of meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions. All these statutory bodies are represented by persons who are professionals and executives who have, in their own right, contributed to the industry. Their knowledge and expertise would help these institutions in the decision-making process. This Ministry has always identified the role played by the Small and Medium Enterprises in the tourism industry and has considered the SMEs as an integral part of the industry. For that reason, there is adequate representation of SMEs in the decision-making process. The new Tourism Act has also set up a Tourism Advisory Committee and a Tourism Development Fund to provide advice and the required financial resources to all new agencies established. We also intend appointing a Commissioner for Tourism Administration so that there would be action taken against any injustice or infringement of the rights of employees of tourism institutions or ordinary citizens by the tourism administration. The Ministry also intends to create an operations room to ensure implementation of all activities undertaken by it. My Minister and I firmly believe in an inclusive approach to harmonize and accommodate the interests of all concerned parties. To achieve this goal, our Ministry

2007 11 3197 3198

follows a continuous consultative process on a regular basis to take note of the diverse views and to help making decisions with regard to what is best for the industry. Venerable Presiding Member, we believe in sustainable and responsible tourism. Tourism should not be in conflict with our culture, our traditions and our spiritual values. In our effort to safeguard these values, our Ministry has set up a Sangha Advisory Council which meets every three months. A code of ethics for tourists, which would enable them not to be in conflict with our culture and spiritual values, has been prepared on the advice of the Maha Sangha. Today, globally there is a trend of seeking spiritual upliftment through meditation as the man, in todays material world, has failed to find solace through material upliftment alone. Our Ministry realizes the potential for promoting tourism through Buddhist meditation centres and has taken the initiative to improve the standard and the quality of such centres with the advice of the Maha Sangha. Our Ministry has provided funds to upgrade Buddhist meditation centres on the advice of the Sangha Advisory Council. Buddhist tourism has been encouraged with efforts being made to attract Buddhists from Thailand, Myanmar, China and Japan.

Venerable Presiding Member, tourism is a concurrent function in terms of the Constitution, which clearly establishes that the local bodies and the provincial councils have to work hand-in-hand with the Ministry of Tourism in the promotion of tourism, domestic and international. My Minister meets the Chief Ministers of the Provincial Councils once in three months to discuss various views and the challenges faced by them in their respective provinces and to assist them through this Ministry in achieving their goals. The Hon. Minister has taken the view that members and officers of the local bodies and provincial councils should also be given training and foreign exposure, which would otherwise have been restricted to officers of the Ministry of Tourism. The local bodies in tourist attracting areas have been provided with tractors and trailers as a greener and a cleaner environment is essential for the promotion of tourism.

Domestic tourism has also been given its due place by our Ministry. A number of committees have been appointed to obtain advice on promoting domestic tourism. A number of programmes have been initiated to achieve this end. One such initiative is to improve road facilities and visitor facilities in these sites. Training local guides to explain the sites is also a part of the programme. Belilena in Kitulgoda, the Dambadeniya Temple, the Aberdeen Falls, the Bopath Ella are some of these sites. I am pleased to announce that of the Budget allocation for 2008, domestic tourism has been allocated Rs. 115 million, which shows this Ministrys commitment to promoting domestic tourism.

Venerable Presiding Member, the Tourism Resource Improvement Project implemented with financial support of JBIC will improve the visitor facilities at Anuradhapura, Sigiriya, Nuwara Eliya and Negombo. The project involves dredging and cleaning of the Nuwara Eliya Lake, beautification of the city and the Victoria Park. In Anuradhapura, the project will construct a ring road in the puja bhoomi and beautify a section of the Malvathu-Oya. In Sigiriya, the project will install a new stairway with a greater capacity to climb up to see the frescos. The access road to Sigiriya will also be improved. Another important activity will be to dredge and clean a section of the Hamilton Canal in Negombo developing the canal banks and increasing the canal's water flow for tourist activities.

I am also pleased to announce that we will be getting ADB funds next year for two projects in Kandy and Ruhuna. The ADB Project for Kandy will involve dredging, cleaning and beautification of the Kandy Lake and setting up a cultural centre to ensure that the traditional dancing of the Kandy Perahera would be preserved and continued in the future. This cultural centre is also expected to develop and promote Kandyan traditional craftwork. In Ruhuna, the ADB project will improve road access and visitor facilities at Tissamaharama, Buduruwagala, Maligawila and Dambegoda. These sites demonstrate the Mahayana Buddhist tradition in ancient Sri Lanka. Therefore, the tour operators will promote tour packages to attract Mahayana Buddhists from Asian countries.

The Hon. Minister has also taken steps to strengthen the Tourist Police Division as there have been numerous complaints that there is no expeditious action taken on complaints made by tourists. Venerable Presiding Member, the Hon. Minister and I are pleased to announce that we have strengthened the Tourist Police Division. Now there is a DIG in charge of the Tourist Police and a Director with the required police officers to provide tourists with a police service. I must reiterate that the Government policy under the "Mahinda Chintana" is to promote Sri Lanka as a tourist destination among the newly emerging economic giants such as China, India and the Middle East while continuing to maintain our marketing strategies with traditional visitor generating countries in Europe to ensure increased economic benefits to the country. Towards this end, the Government has signed MOUs with countries such as China, India, Israel, Jordan, Iran and the Maldives. An important feature of the MOUs is that they provide for joint working groups with public and private sector representatives to prepare and implement joint action plans.

The newly set up Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau will launch new marketing programmes to promote Sri Lanka as a tourist destination among these new markets. It is significant to take note that whilst other markets had an overall drop of 20 per cent this year, the Middle East market, through the new initiatives taken by this Ministry, has resulted in a growth of 27 per cent, which is an encouraging factor taking into account the air connectivity from the Middle East to Sri Lanka which is second only to India and the disposable income available in that region due to the increase in oil revenue. Ven. Presiding Member, given the improvements in the security situation, we will strive hard to achieve the visitor target of 1.5 million by 2010, the target set out in the Mahinda Chintana. We have realized that Sri Lankas greatest asset is its human resource. Employees in the hotel sector have great opportunities in obtaining jobs overseas to better their prospects in life. The Middle East in the next three years would require 75,000 personnel in the hotel sector. We have realized that we could take benefit of this requirement and have implemented an accelerated programme to train rural youth who would, under normal circumstances, not meet the entry requirement to obtain jobs in the hotel industry in the Middle East. This is in keeping with the Mahinda Chintana which focuses upon giving rural youth an opportunity for social and economic upliftment. At present, there are 300 youth undergoing training under this programme and the target for the year 2008 is to provide training to a greater number to take advantage of the job opportunities in the Middle East. The Hon. Minister and I would like to sincerely thank the Secretary and Additional Secretary of the Ministry, chairmen and the directors of all the agencies that come under the Ministry and their staff for the commitment shown to carry out the programmes of this Ministry. Thank you. [.. 1.50] . . ( . . ) (The Hon. A. D. Premadasa Champika) ,

Mr. Deputy Chairman, I am pleased to take part in this Committee Stage Discussion pertaining to the Votes of the Ministry of Tourism and the Ministry of Sports and Public Recreation, and say a few words relating to the activities of those Ministries. Sir, I believe, the Hon. Minister, Milinda Moragoda, took over the functions of the Ministry of Tourism under very challenging and difficult circumstances. The prevailing security situation in the country certainly is not conducive to tourism arrivals and we have seen an acute drop in the tourist arrivals for several months. But yet during these times the dynamic Minister has not shirked his duty in introducing the necessary reforms envisaging the better times that we would have in the event once again lasting peace dawns in this country. With that in mind he has set in motion several new ideas to improve the conditions of this industry. The new institutional structures that he has introduced with the participation of many pioneers of the industry to make effective policies for the improvement of the tourism sector is one major reform in the tourist industry. I must say that he was able to bring in to force this New Tourism Act which was toiled for more than two years. Though the original draft was ready, for variety of reasons, the Hon. Minister or the previous ministers could not achieve the requred consensus among various stakeholders to bring in the necessary reforms envisaged by the Act. However the Minister, within a very short period, was able to convince several stakeholders and finally promulgated the necessary pending legislation. Now he is

[ . . ]

2007 11 3229 3230

in the process of giving effect to the objectives of this Act. He has also set up variety of advisory panels giving places even for small time business operators who would have some say in ultimate policy making in the tourism sector. Many Speakers before me dealt with the issue of how international cricket has assisted us in these difficult times by at least bringing in thousands of British tourists during this cricket series with the English team. But that as it may, the plight in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces is a very dismal one. My Friend, the Hon. Shivajilingam dealt with the subject before I rose up to speak. I too represent the Ampara Distrist and I have noticed the difficulties the people are undergoing in the area where they have been earning a livelihood through tourism. One such area is Pottuvil which I directly represent in Parliament. Many small time business establishments have had to virtually close up and some of them are surviving since a small number of tourists still patronize Pottuvil even with all the attendant security concerns. But however many hoteliers are facing difficulties with large loan repayments which have now become overdue. In this regard many appeals have been made and with recommendations from the tourism authorities to the banks, some of them have rescheduled the loans but some have even begun to foreclose some of those loans. I would like the Hon. Minister to look into the grievances of those people and try and alleviate their suffering. Together with that I must also say a few words in praise of the young Deputy Minister, the Hon. Faizer Musthapha who, under the guidance of the Hon. Minister has been given an exclusive task to promote tourism from the Middle Eastern countries and he has remarkably succeeded in achieving a 27 per cent increase in the arrival of tourists over the last year from the Middle Eastern countries, particularly from the Arab Countries. Therefore this new area where we had not paid sufficient attention in the past has given us some hope for much improvement in the coming years. Be that as it may, it is very important for us to develop new products and in this area there are various themes such as Community Tourism, Domestic Tourism, Cruise Tourism, Sports and Adventure Tourism and Niche Tourism regarding which the Ministry has developed a framework to improve them and has set up an advisory panel so that these areas could be paid the necessary attention to see that we have the necessary packages and products to entice tourists from different parts of the world to our country. Together with that another challenge the Hon. Minister faced was the frequent travel advisories issued by many countries, particularly the West, which had a serious and drastic impact on tourist arrivals in our country. In this regard, the Hon. Minister took a personal interest in lobbying intensely with the authorities of many such countries and have managed to soften the impact of these travel advisories by speaking to the necessary authorities in UK, France, Germany, Italy and many such

countries. On that, the Hon. Minister who is a multi-faceted personality must be congratulated for his efforts. He is also someone about whom we could be envious because he has had the freedom to choose the heads of institutions coming under his Ministry. He has been able to appoint Mr. Renton de Alwis in charge of tourism and certainly that has borne fruit. I congratulate the Hon. Minister, the Deputy Minister and the officials of the Tourist Board regarding a job well done during these difficult times. However, they must pay immediate attention to the grievances of the many individuals who are dependent on the tourism industry in areas where this industry has suffered most, particularly in the North-East and in that regard I would appeal to the Hon. Minister to have a special task force appointed so that this aspect can be looked into without delay. With those comments I wind up, Sir. Thank you very much. [.. 3.54]

[. . 4. 25] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Milinda Moragoda-Minister of Tourism) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman. There is no doubt that the tourism sector faces many challenges. Of course I think challenges are meant to be faced and met and I believe, in the last 10 months we have managed to do that. As my Deputy Minister outlined this morning in his progress review, we have managed to lay a foundation for the tourism sector in this country and other speakers on the Government side outlined further what we have managed to achieve. Equally, I believe, from the Opposition we received many constructive and useful comments. I will summarize in short what I feel are some of the major achievements that we have had this year and I will also seek to outline some of the challenges that we need to face and also may be, addressed. There were some concerns that were raised by the Opposition. I have listed out all the issues that were raised by the Opposition, but

clearly I will not be able to address all of them here. But I will make a commitment to ensure that we look into them and try to address them later on. As I said, the last year was a year of foundation- building. It was also a year of confidence - building. Part of the foundation - building process was consulting stakeholders and trying to identify where we should head in on an extremely challenging environment. I took a decision after consulting His Excellency the President as well as others in the industry to promulgate the Tourism Act. I believe, the Hon. Kiriella would be familiar with the history of the Act. It evolved over the years. It was not only our work. It was a work, I believe, of a series of Ministers who gave their input to it. There were many concerns of course when this Act was promulgated. The main concern was, will this only help big operators in the tourism sector. We have taken certain safeguards in implementing this Act to ensure that this does not happen. Equally, four new institutions were set up, the four new institutions that were outlined by my Deputy Minister in the morning, the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority which will focus on regulation and product development, the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau will focus on projecting our image abroad and the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management which will concentrate on training not only in hotel management but in tourism as a whole. Our hope is that this institute will become a centre for excellence in the field of tourism not only in Sri Lanka, but even in the region if we can manage to achieve that. The fourth institution is the Sri Lanka Convention Bureau which will focus on conferences and attracting what they called MICE traffic. This institution is currently focused on India trying to attract MICE related traffic from India to Sri Lanka. So, these four institutions have become active now and there is an advisory council headed by very senior members from the trade as well as other experts advising me and these four institutions on the way forward. I must stress, as my Friend and Colleague the Hon. Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena mentioned earlier, there was no political interference in any of the appointments that were made in these organizations. I think, any of you can look at the Boards of Directors of these institutions. You will see that we have chosen the best Sri Lanka has to offer in tourism and related areas. Here I hesitate to use this term, but there is a term I think which is used more in cricket, a dream team. I believe that we have a dream team in tourism. Then, we also proceeded to set up advisory committees to consult different sectors of our society. The leading one of these advisory committees out of these Advisory Committees is Maha Sanga Advisory Committee which we have now met with on three different occasions and under whose guidance we have been able not only to create a culture that is attuned with our own culture but also to look at as to how we can make use of one of our comparative advantageous - if you want to call it that- of Buddhism internationally to attract more tourism from Buddhist countries.

2007 11 3241 3242

We have also looked at other areas of institutional reforms. Very soon we will be announcing the appointment of a Commissioner for Tourism, sort of an ombudsman who will hopefully help settle disputes that would arise when there are unfair practices or in situations where there are disputes within the tourism sector. We have also sought to strengthen the Tourist Police. The Secretary to Ministry of Defence, Public Security, Law and Order has been kind enough to appoint a DIG in charge of tourism through the IGP. Now we have an SSP located in our Ministry looking into this area and trying to set up its structure. These are some of the highlights on the institutional side. The new Tourism Act was promulgated on the 1st of October and I have given the four Boards, three months to come with their plans on the way forward. I hope that the year 2008 would be a year to put of a building on the foundations we have laid.

As we look forward, we see many challenges. Of course, when there are disturbances and acts of terrorisms, they do affect tourism. There is no doubt about that. Equally, there are many countries that face these challenges and move ahead. So what we say is, let us environment as given, and let us face it in that manner. In that context we have looked at how other countries have handled these challenges. Whether they are countries in the Middle-East or East Asia or it is Israel to look at as to how these countries handle these challenges and we are trying to learn from them because as I said challenges are realities in life and we have to face them. In the year ahead, besides looking to how we project ourselves in the international environment, we also have to look at our products to see as to what we have to offer. There were many suggestions that have made here, in this House Yes, I think eco-tourism, an environmentally conscious and environmentally sensitive tourism is something that we need to look at because we should not become a destination for mass tourism. We should be a destination for niche tourism and in that context we have to ensure that our product is developed to meet that challenged. The officers of various institutions that are under my Ministry are working on that. Then, I move on to the specific challenges I see. I am going to start with one of the greatest challenges which I specifically see among other challenges in order to look at as to how we can address the small and medium scale enterprises in the tourism sector. The tourism sector in Sri Lanka is dominated by big players. I believe, they are now working with us giving their maximum to develop the sector. But we also need to work with the small and medium scale enterprises which actually create employment and growth. It is my intension in the coming year, to focus on that to see whether we can

facilitate and provide more support for this sector because that is from where we can expect real growth. We need to work to work on it; we need to see it as a challenge. The other aspect is something that has to do with the employees in this sector. As it was pointed out earlier, we need to relook as to how we can ensure that the employees get a good living wage and the incentives they deserve. We have been having discussions in this regard. Actually, we have had many rounds of discussions. It is not easy to match the problems of the employees with that of the employees and we, as a Ministry, are trying to facilitate the process without being part of the problem. Then we have the issue of domestic tourism. Domestic tourism is the key to any tourism industry. It is domestic tourism that creates the building blocks for international tourism. If you look at countries like China, if you look at countries like India it is the domestic tourism which laid the foundation for building the international tourism and the coming year we intend to focus a lot on that sector. We have some money in our Budget for it as well, and we hope to make a meaningful impact on that particular sector. We also need to look at tourism in the Eastern Province where we have to build the infrastructure and we have the land there. We need to create the necessary investor confidence in the Eastern Province and to look at ways of doing that. Then we have the issue, which was raised a little while ago, about our training how the boom that is taking place in the hotel sector in the Middle East and East Asia can be exploited by out youth. In other words, providing training for them to go overseas. It is with that in mind, we have set up this new institute. We have a very strong Board in that institute and we are now in the process of locating a Director-General for it. My Deputy Minister has been personally supervising the employment needs of the Middle East and how we can provide employees to the Middle East. I believe we can become a potential supplier of employees to the Middle East and East Asia through this training mechanism we have set up. I do not intend to speak at length because I think out record is clear. We have done good work, whatever the criticism may be. Equally, the challenges should not be underestimated. My hope is that through th Consultative Committee process, we could make this a bipartisan initiative, if not a multi-partisan initiative. We have held several Consultative Committee meetings and I must thank the Members of Parliament from both sides for the constructive suggestions they have put in. It is my view that next month, when the plans of different institutions are ready, I would be able to present those or I world let those institutions present their plans to the Consultative Committee and make their inputs as well. I am convinced that tourism is a sector in which we can work without petty politics, parochial politics and even without ideological problems and it is my hope that in the coming year we would be able to achieve that.

3243 3244

In conclusion, I would like to thank my Deputy Minister, my Secretary, my Additional Secretary, the chairmen of all organizations under me and all the staff for the support they have given. They worked hard and I believe in the coming year, they will have to work harder if they are to make a difference. I frankly believe that if we are to successfully develop the Ministry to Tourism, it should be a Ministry that runs without Ministries; it should be able to run itself. I think we are getting there and it will take some time for as to get there. My plea to all of you is, if you have any concerns, if you have any questions, please write or please bring them up at the Consultative Committee. Let us try to make the Tourism Ministry a model of bipartisan work and achievement. Thank you very much. [. . 4. 39] ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon.
