Speaker, I want to bring to the notice of the Hon. Minister of Education that Tamil translations of advertisements and circulars should be prepared by competent Tamil officers, so that it will acceptable. Sir, the second matter is about the examination of SLEAS. Your Ministry had made a blunder. In the Sinhala version of the Gazette, it had been stated that if you are

applying for Western Music, you have to put number 25 and in the Tamil version it had been stated to put number 26, Seven people were selected according to the marks. They were called for three interviews. But so far no appointments have been given. Therefore, kindly look into this matter. Otherwise, it will be a real discrimination, Sir. . .

( . . )

(The Hon. A. D. Susil Premajayantha) You are referring to the translation of certain circulars, advertisements and textbooks. We have taken steps to appoint separate boards for different subjects, this year. To prepare the Tamil medium books there are professors from universities, master teachers and directors in Tamil medium. They are there to look into all these matters. Therefore , I believe that this type of discrepancy will not happen this time and the future. . ( . ) (The Hon. T. Kanagasabai) Sir, kindly look into the second matter also. . .

( . . ) (The Hon. A. D. Susil Premajayantha) Okay. We can discuss this matter on the 23rd as we are having our Consultative Committee Meeting on that day. ( ) (The Hon. Senathirajah Jeyanandamoorthy) ,

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, it is better if you can answer (c) (i). Is there a prohibition on any mother who is having a child less than five years, from going overseas? ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) There had been certain views expressed. The views are evaluated - those suggestions have been submitted to a Committee and the Committee is looking into it. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, there is no law as yet. Is it?

2007 08 951 952

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) No, not yet.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Then, Hon. Minister, the new Chairman who has been appointed by you has gone into the institutions previous activities, and has been able to show that there has been a lot of corruption going on. He has referred it to the Auditor-Generals Department as well as the Commission to investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. What action has been taken since then, Hon. Minister?

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) What has happened is, we have also appointed two organizations to look into the matters in relation to various financial aspects. In addition to that, we have now cut down the overheads of the institution by about 50 per cent. It is quite evident that there had been certain issues. Those will have to be looked into and the report will be submitted. A Select Committee also had been asked to be set up and we have agreed on that. So, all those details will be listed and then -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, Hon. Minister, my question was not that. My point is that the Chairman has referred it to the Auditor-Generals Department as well as the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, saying that there had been corruption amounting to over Rs. 700 million. He has given the figure saying an x amount and we saw it in the newspapers in the Daily News, just couple of days ago.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) I cannot subscribe to those figures right now. But the fact of the matter is that we have referred it to the Bribery Commissioner and then we have also asked for plain-clothes officers to be in the institution. There are a few activities taking place.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Then, Hon. Minister, on the same note, there has also been a report that has been given by the Chairman saying that the funds that had come for the Kuwait returnees between 1992-1993 are yet to be paid.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) We have taken a decision and the Cabinet approved it two weeks ago. I put a Cabinet Paper to pay them. There is Rs. 1.6 billion left and that has to be divided among the 15,000 claimants because there are certain documents that they cannot produce; out of nine documents, some are able to give only seven. So, taking the background of this into consideration, we have dicided to give a blanket cover to pay Rs. 75,000 each and finish off. That Department will be closed within the next month or so. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) When you and I were in the COPE, we showed that each one will get Rs. 126,000. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) That is when we had 9,000 odd claimants, but subsequently a survey was done. There had been cases where they have lost the passports and some documents. But, there are certain other evidences to show that they had worked there. So, we have taken the whole lot into account. That leads to about 15,600 instead of 9,000 odd cases or nearly 10,000. Therefore, the figure of compensation came down. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) If I may help you with this that is not the case. There was Rs. 1.1 billion and then there was another Rs. 300 million that was used for activities not related to the Kuwait returnees. I would appreciate if you could go into the COPE Report and ensure that the returnees, who in any case are suffering, get the additional funds as well. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Whatever that is left will be divided equally among the cases that we have already identified and not a cent will be given to any other institiution or any other activity. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) What action will be taken against the institution that had used such money for activities not related to the Kuwait returnees? ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Well. I have to go into it and see. Then we can commence an inquiry into it. And the Department will be closed because that entire section has been there for the

953 954

[ ]

last 15 years and we feel that it is a waste. Once these payments are over, within the next month we be able to pay that and it will be closed. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) On behalf of the Kuwait returnees, one request that we can make is, please ensure that you pay the capital plus the interest. Because the Government received the money then and if you do not calculate it at todays exchange rate these returnees will hose money. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) The question does not arise because all the accumulated interest is also accounted for payment. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No. Again my question is not that. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) There is no capital as such. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) When the money was received, the Dollar was at Rs. 55. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Parity is taken into account; the interest is taken into account. All that will be looked into and there is no capital as such. The monies that come in had gone into fixed deposits. The interest will be taken into account, the parity difference will be taken into account and the entire amount would be calculated and paid to the claimants. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I would appreciate if you would look into that because in that case, they should get a return of about Rs. 300,000 at todays exchange rate. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) No, you cannot. I have got the figures. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) We will send the Report of the COPE, in which you were also a Member under the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama. We directed at that time-

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) But, you forget one fact that the number has increased from 9,000 to 15,000. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No. It was only a case of people who got money, but did not get the balance. So, it cannot suddenly increase further. I do not want to take much of your time, but I will speak to you. But on behalf of all the returnees who had been suffering then and who are suffering today, I would say that they should get at the existing - ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) You can be 100 per cent certain that the monies that had been sent for paying compensation to Kuwait returnees will be paid together with interest and that the parity will also be taken into account in calculating it- ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) And the exchange loss. Is it? ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Palitha Range Bandara) , . . . ( ) (The Hon.

I quote the relevant section from the National Education Commission Act, No. 19 of 1991:

2. (2) The National Education Policy includes the following matters : Aims and goals of education; the structure of the educational system preschool, primary, secondary, tertiary, higher, informal, non formal, adult, special, professional and religious; the establishment, location and distribution of educational institutions, including methods and criteria for admission of students and recruitment of teachers;..." So it very clearly specifies that the National Education Commission has the power, the mandate, to decide on the criteria for admission to schools. If you look at our Constitution, under Directive Principles of State Policy and Fundamental Duties, it states that the State is pledged to carry forward the progressive advancement towards the establishment in Sri Lanka a democratic socialist society, the objectives of which include full realization of all rights and freedom of citizens including group rights. There is another section which states that the State shall endeavour to eliminate economic and social privilege and disparity, and exploitation and ensure equality of opportunity to all citizens. I do not see any equality of opportunity in this new system that this Government has devised this year. I would like to propose to the Hon. Minister that you assert your rights. You have the mandate from this Parliament. You have to protect the rights of the 225 Parliamentarians who sit here on behalf of the 20 million odd people who have voted us in. We will support you, Sir. We will give you that support -

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member you have one more minute.

( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) Yes. I would like to make a request, Sir, to overcome this problem this year. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition was magnanimous in his approach yesterday. He spoke on behalf of the people of this country, the lesser privileged people of this country against whom an injustice is going to be created. He suggested that you have the right to bring a Bill to this House and if you do

1009 1010

[ ]

not have enough support, if the Supreme Court requires a two-thirds mandate, the United National Party will stand with the Government and give you that two-thirds mandate. We suggest to you to implement the existing scheme for the admission of children this year - for the year 2008 still it will be late - although you might not be able to finish the admissions around March next year. But bring the existing schemes and get it legislated in Parliament. You get the necessary mandate from Parliament and the Supreme Court may ask you to get it ratified. I am sure you can get it ratified from the Supreme Court. Then we also propose to you that from the year 2009 onwards, for the Scheme of Admission to bring in a new policy, a new Bill, a Bill that we can debate in this House and a Bill that we could support if it is for the goodwill of all the people of this country; we will give you the fullest support to implement this Bill.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over.

( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) I will wind up in a second, Sir. I would like to say that in this situation the responsibility lies again in the hands of the Minister, in the hands of the Ministry and this Parliament has a right to ask the Ministry to protect this right. Therefore, our support will be there if you can ratify this issue. Thank you.

The limited examination of the Sri Lanka Educational Administrative Service was held about a year ago and now they have selected the candidates. When calling for applications in the Gazette, the conditions required to apply for this examination were mentioned. In the Sinhala

and English versions it had been stated that if you are applying for Western Music you have to put number 25 and if you are applying for Eastern Music, you have to put number 26. But in the Tamil version it had been stated that if you are applying for Western Music you have to put number 26 and for the other, number 25. That is how they have gazetted. Our people have applied according to the Tamil version of the Gazette. Now the authorities say they want to clarify it. What is there to clarify? Who is responsible for this? Who are the officers responsible for doing these things? They have been called for an interview. They have scored very high marks in the competitive examination and I thought seven people will be selected. But they say that they want to clarify it. Then, I met the Secretary, the Additional Secretary and the Commissioner of Examinations. The Ministry of Education says, We have sent all the clarifications and the Public Service Commission says, We are not satisfied. What are all these officers in the Public Service Commission and the Ministry of Education for? They are there to serve the people. They are paid salaries from taxes collected from the people. They must take quick action. If I was one of those who had passed the examination, I would be waiting with a sense of anxiety because I studied hard burning midnight oil and passed this examination. After passing this examination, they have been called for interviews thrice and finally they have been asked to pay Rs. 25 and they have got receipts too. But appointments have not been given. What is this administration? Where is justice? Why are they harassing these poor teachers? They have to travel by ship and train to come to Colombo and also stay in Colombo. They cannot stay in the lodges because as you know, they will be rounded up and sent in buses back to their home stations. So, they have to stay with one of their relatives. This is what is happening now. So, Sir, please try to do something. We want a responsible reply to be given to these teachers. I was elected on the votes of those teachers. So, when they ask me, I must give them a reply. I spoke to the Hon. Minister in the morning too. He said he will look into it. We will wait and see. Thank you, Sir. [..1.58]

, . ( ) (The Presiding Member) . . [..2.17] ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem-Minister of Posts and Telecommunication) "Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem" Madam Presiding Member, a huge controversy has arisen as a result of the intervention by the Supreme Court on the issue pertaining to admission of children to schools in this country. Madam Presiding Member, I think I will at the very outset deal with one issue that my good Friend, the Hon. Vajira Abeywardena raised relating to policy formulation. He was criticizing the intervention of the Secretary to the President with regard to this matter and there I must clarify one issue. I think the intervention of the Secretary to the President came about as a result of the Supreme Court itself asking him to come before the Supreme Court mainly perhaps because the National Education Commission is a subject that comes under the purview of His Excellency the President as explained by the Hon. Minister. One Speaker after another was trying to find fault with our amiable Minister of Education saying that he did not take timely sufficient steps to see that this anomalous situation that has arisen, does not arise. But, there I must say in his defence that his Ministry as he says, had always been assisting in this process and it was the Supreme Court that had wanted the National Education Commission to formulate a different scheme of admission and submit it for their consideration. And now whatever it may be, the final outcome appears to be having many loopholes and many controversial admission criteria which cause unnecessary social disparities and also worsens sometimes the existing divisions in society. I am fully in agreement with those contentions and would also like to support that. The prudent measure at this stage would be for us to adopt the available circular for the next year since any new criteria being introduced now would create unnecessary tension and difficulties which for all purposes should be avoided at a time like this. I am sure, here the Supreme Court also has got to be informed about the intention of Parliament but in any issue the policy formulation is the right of the Executive. The legislature can give effect to that policy by legislation and in this regard I must bring to the attention of this House an attempt that was made during President Chandrika Kumaratungas time. She herself was once like our current Minister of Education, the Chief Minister of the

1029 1030

Western Province and took a special interest since she held the portfolio of Education in guiding policies regarding education in this country. In that regard, I must say, the Hon. (Prof.) G. L. Peiris who was the Minister in charge of constitutional affairs at that time brought in a legislation called the "Equal Opportunity Bill" which sought to remedy some of these difficulties that we face in the circular relating to admission to Government schools. What happened to the Equal Opportunity Bill which was presented to this House is an important lesson for all of us to remember in trying to take over the responsibility of deciding on policy, and legislating through the House to seek correction in that regard. What happened at that time was, when the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris presented the Bill in the House, unfortunately my late leader, the Hon. M.H.M. Ashraff and the late Hon. Thondaman had their effigies burnt in front of popular schools in this country. The protesters felt that they were the people who pushed the Government to bring this Equal Opportunity Bill. But today liberally all the Members in this House are talking about equal opportunities. , "equal opportunities" . . . . Madam, I would like to advert to a particular issue and in this respect I cannot compare statistics all over the Island. Just take Colombo as an example. I would like to quote from some of the documents I have about the plight of popular schools in many areas in Colombo. For instance, I will take a list of existing schools in Slave Island. There are six schools in Slave Island and not a single school falls within the category of a popular school. Similarly, if you take the Dematagoda area, there are ten schools. I do not think even one school in that area qualifies to be among top schools in the country. Then comes the schools in Maradana and Panchikawatte areas. Except for Ananda College, Nalanda College, St. Josephs College, Ananda Balika Vidyalaya and Gothami Balika Vidayalaya - altogether there are 15 schools in that area - the rest of the ten schools do not fall within this category. In the Hulftsdorp area, there are nine schools but not a single school falls within that category. Similarly, in the Kotahena and Kochchikade areas there are 17 schools. Except for St. Benedicts College, I do not think any other school will qualify to be called a popular school in that area. In the Grandpass area, there are ten schools and I do not think any of those schools will qualify to be among better schools in the city. In the Mutwal, Modera, Madampitiya and Mattakkuliya areas, there are 19 schools. I do not think we can call even a single school among those 19 as one of the best in Colombo. So, this being the case, I would like to just quote some words of the former Mayor of Colombo Municipal Council, Mr. Prasanna Gunawardena, brother of our Colleague, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena. In the Preface of a book titled, "A Study of Resettlement Schemes in Colombo", under the caption, Improving livelihoods of the Urban Poor", he has stated, I quote:

"Approximately half the population of Colombo lives in 66,000 households in around 1650 so-called Underserved Settlements..." "They are dispersed over different parts of Colombo. The majority of the Underserved Settlements is known as slum or shanty gardens with a large portion of the population being longstanding residents in them It is obvious that if we want to develop Colombo, then priority should be given to develop the underserved settlements, which as the Mayor of Colombo has stated, houses almost half the population of the City of Colombo. The areas I quoted citing the paucity of a number of popular schools are all inundated and infested with such underserved settlements. I took the above information from the statistics, facts and figures available in the Colombo Municipality. Within the areas I mentioned earlier, Maligawatte West, Aluthkade East, New Bazaar, Mattakkuliya, Maligawatte East, Grandpass North, Grandpass South et cetera, there are several such areas with so many underserved settlements. I am sure the Minister of Housing is also here. She must also be quite possessed of some of these details. There appears to be a large number. These are areas where there are a large Muslim population too. The grievances of the Muslim community are such that many schools - I do not think they can call many schools as leading schools - there are perhaps some schools which have a certain level of standard, but then except for a few, many schools do not fall within this category. Here the grievances of the Muslims are such that they have faced many difficulties. One recent case was when the Principal of Ramanadan Ladies College refused admission for Muslim students from Batticaloa and other areas who had attained the Government stipulated cut-off mark for the Grade Five Scholarship. These students had scored, as the Hon. Minister of Education said, 176 marks that make them eligible to enter these schools. Finally police complaints had been lodged on various pretexts preventing parents from going to the school. This has become such an issue where unnecessary ethnic tension is created as a result of imposing admission policies which have been decided on certain criteria by the Ministry of Education. This is why I say we need to exercise a lot of caution. I do not think, it may be an easy matter for us to even legislate through this House and stipulate criteria that easily, without once again having effigies burnt before popular schools. We hope not. My late Leader is not there; Mr. Thondaman is no more among us but then these illustrious leaders finally had to suffer that fate for having espoused this cause of equal opportunities for everyone in this country. Therefore it is just a matter of caution that we must look at issues in its proper context. I think we should not go to the extent of dragging the Supreme Court into this. It appears that the Supreme Court is passionately involved in this issue and it must be a welcome thing for us to have the apex court in this country taking a passionate interest in such an important socio-political issue. But then the right of this House to also guide and be involved, particularly the Ministry of Education, which is possessed of the details and the experience, having devised the former circulars which related or which guided the principles relating to admission to schools should be properly consulted before a final decision is made. Therefore, we would support the contention that has been made. I must say that though the United National Party sought to take some cheap political mileage by trying to

[ ]

2007 08 1031 1032

drag the Hon. Minister into this Debate and say that he was negligent on the issue, I heard most of these Members, finally when they wound up, saying that it would be prudent for us to adopt the available formula or circular for admissions next year and to think of introducing reforms for admissions in the year 2009. That being the case, I think that that is a very prudent measure for us to adopt.

But, in the meantime, it may not be so. I must say with sufficient caution that some attention has to be paid to certain areas in the City where there is a serious lack of proper educational institutions and a recent study conducted among some of these schools has shown that in the Colombo District there are about 50,000 Muslims students. Out of the 50,000 Muslim students, 23,000 students to be exact - I have got the figures which I have obtained from most of the principals of these schools - are attending the so-called Government Muslim Schools and you would be surprised, Madam Presiding Member, that there are 25 Muslim international schools in Colombo. The so-called Islamiya international schools are 25 in number and in those 25 schools, there appears to be almost 15,000 students attending classes. That goes to show that the Government school system is unable to provide places for Muslim students and that is how these schools have come about. This is apart from the Muslim students studying in other non-secular Government schools, church-run Government schools and other schools run by Buddhist institutions.

If you look at this issue, it goes back to the original year in which the Government took over private schools. That was way back in 1961. In 1961, there was English medium available. When the Government took the decision to abolish English medium in all schools, a vast majority of Muslims were studying in English classes in many of those schools and finally when the English medium was abolished, most of these students had to find places in other schools which had by that time, restrictive criteria. Particularly when the Government took over those schools, there were supposed to be assurances given, that ethnicwise the same proportion of students who had studied in those schools in 1961, would be applied in future admissions. But, what we do forget is that none of those schools or no parent could today challenge and say that there was a certain percentage of Muslim students or Tamil students in a particular school in 1961 since that would be such a difficult exercise to obtain those figures. So, this being the case, it is quite a serious issue. This has affected all communities across the board, but then a community like the Muslim community has many grievances, particularly in urban areas, in getting admissions for their children in these schools. When it comes to the population of Underserved Settlements in Colombo, my estimation is that almost 60 per cent of the Muslim population in Colombo live in them. If you look at the population figures given by the Colombo Municipal Council of the Underserved Settlements, you could very easily ascertain the number of Muslims living in them in many of the areas. Wardwise, I have got the figures here. I would like to table* this entire document for the benefit of the House so that it would be made available for any study that could be done in this regard.

Finally, I would say a few words in Tamil to clarify an issue that came up in the morning. I had to make an intervention when the Hon. Jeyanandamoorthy raised an issue regarding a new zone being created in the Batticaloa District. , , . , , . . , " , " , " " . , , , " , , , " , .

- the so-called popular schools, the National Schools or even some of the private schools, why are they so popular? They are popular because every good teacher tries to go into those schools. Why is it that our people clamour to go to these big schools or the popular schools? It is because they think that their children can study well. But the Government has not taken any action at least to train

[ ]

2007 08 1043 1044

these teachers who are in the rural schools by sending them to a big school. Send them for some kind of training or an internship so that they will know how to develop a school in that area, without which they cannot manage. Even the private schools and the so-called international schools I always think are business concerns and not schools rather. The Hon. Vijitha Herath was speaking about the Catholic Schools, the Anglican Schools, the Buddhist Schools and the Muslim Schools. I myself was educated in an Anglican School. When I joined the school they asked me for my Christian name. When I went for admission after giving my Birth Certificate, the Principal of the school asked my father, What is his Christian name? Fortunately, I am not a Christian and my father could not give me a Christian name. But, anyway I got admission to the school with the greatest difficulty at that point of time. Sir, the teachers have to be trained. But what is happening today? ,

. Hon. Minister, the teachers who come from the rural and estate sector do not have the exposure that those in big and popular schools have. They do not even know to organize a proper sportsmeet. I have been to some of these schools when I was the Minister of Education in the Central Provincial Council. When I attended some of their sportsmeets or other functions, I felt sorry for them. I realized that they had not got the proper exposure and that they did not know how to properly organize something. If at all, we are going to develop and give equal opportunities to all students, whether they study in Royal College, in rural schools or in estate sector schools, they must get an exposure so that they will be able to compete with the rest in the education system. Some of the Hon. Members said that in areas like Laggala - when I was a Minister I knew that - none of the students of the Sinhala schools passed the English Language paper at the G.C.E. Ordinary Level Examination. None. No one passes the English language paper because they do not have teachers. So, how are we going to get over this situation? Our disbursement of the resources is not proper. Even yesterday I was personally speaking to the Hon. Minister about one of the best schools. But then they do not get the proper resources and the Hon. Minister assured me that he will try to improve that school taking that over as one of the Navodya schools. I am very happy about that.

. , I think even the Hon. Deputy Speaker will say that he went to a school. But our children do not go to school. They either go to a Sinhala Vidyalaya, a Tamil Maha Vidyalaya or a Muslim Vidyalaya. They do not go to school because they do not get equal opportunities. As the Hon. Vijitha Herath said, they go and start with that idea from the beginning. We did not have that idea because fortunately we were able to go to a school. But, today very little children in this country go to a school because all of them go to Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim Vidyalayas. So we have to change the whole system. If we do not change the whole system, this problem will continue. And, the privileges enjoyed by the National Schools and the big or popular schools must also go to the rural and the plantation sector schools. Thank you very much. [..3.24] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon.
