FREEZING OF TRO ASSETS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA : STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama - Minister of Foreign Affairs) , . Hon. Speaker, I wish to make this Statement on the freezing of TRO assets in the United States of America on 16th November, 2007. Yesterday, Thursday, 15th November, 2007, the US Government designated the Tamil Rehabilitation Organization - TRO - that acts as a charitable organization as a front to facilitate fund-raising and procurement of weapons for the LTTE. The effect of this decision is that it freezes any assets that the TRO may have under the US jurisdiction and bans Americans from engaging in transactions with it.

1075 1076

The following entities have been added to the SDN list of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, OFAC : a.k.a Tamils Rehabilitation Organisation; a.k.a. Organisation De Rehabilitation Tamoule; a.k.a. Organisation Pre La Rehabilitation Tamil; a.k.a. Organizzazione Per La Riabilitazione Dei Tamil ; a.k.a. ORT France; a.k.a. Tamil Rehabilitation Organization; a.k.a. Tamil Rehabiliterings Organisasjonen; a.k.a. Tamilische Rehabilitation Organisation; a.k.a. Tamils Rehabilitation Organization; a.ka. Tamilsk Rehabiliterings Organisasjon; a.k.a. TRO; a.k.a. TRO Danmark; a.k.a. TRO Italia; a.k.a. TRO Norge; a.k.a. TRO Schweiz; a.k.a. Tsunami Relief Fund - Colombo, Sri Lanka; a.k.a. White Pigeon and a.k.a. Whitepigeon. This measure carried out under Executive Order 13224 has been described as aimed at financially isolating terrorist groups and their support networks. It has previously been applied to a number of front organizations, particularly of Islamic militant groups in the United States. The Government of Sri Lanka has in recent times emphasized that the proscription of the LTTE by India, the United States of America, Canada and the EU member countries has been undermined and diluted through the continuing ability of numerous front organizations of the LTTE, which posed off as charitable fronts - groupings that operated under the guise of rehabilitation, educational, social, religious, and economic activities - to collect funds to boost the LTTE arsenal. The TRO has been the most prominent among them and in September, 2006, following investigations into its financial transactions by the Financial Intelligence Unit of the Central Bank under Sri Lankas Financing of Terrorism Law, the Government of Sri Lanka froze TRO accounts in Sri Lanka. I have emphasized the damage done by this organization particularly in the United States of America and we provided evidence that lends credence to our concerns at meetings I have had with the US Treasury Department during my visits to the United States in March and October this year. We were assured that the Treasury Department, despite its preoccupation with Islamic terrorist groups and their front organizations, was closely tracking the activities of the TRO. It is in this context that I wish to place on record the deep appreciation of the Government of Sri Lanka and this entire House, to the US Administration, especially the Treasury Department, for the speedy investigation carried out and for the action taken yesterday against the TRO. In doing so, the US Government becomes the first foreign Government to take tangible action against the LTTE's front organization. It must be recalled that besides India which proscribed the LTTE in the aftermath of the assassination of Shri Rajiv Gandhi in 1992, the US was the first Western Government to take action against the LTTE when the Department of State designated the LTTE a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) on 8th October, 1997 and on 2nd November, 2001, named the LTTE a

Specially Designated Global Terrorist Organization (SDGT). Following the August 2006 arrest of 17 LTTE agents in New York and in several US cities across the United States and Canada, the October 2006 arrest of six persons including a Sri Lankan national who have already pleaded guilty and the May 2007 arrest of US-based leader of the LTTE Karunakaran Kandasamy, yesterdays action constitutes a vital further step in the United States co-operation towards helping to end terrorism by the LTTE. This investigation, the results of which are detailed in the statement issued by the United States Department of the Treasury, titled Treasury Targets Charity Covertly Supporting Violence in Sri Lanka, is revealing. It quotes Mr. Adam J. Szubin, Director of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) as saying, TRO passed off its operations as charitable, when in fact it was raising money for a designated terrorist group responsible for heinous acts of terrorism." This statement confirms much of what we have been pointing out to the international community with regard to the LTTE front organization's operations that have been taking place for decades. It observes, firstly, the TRO is the preferred conduit of funds from the United States to the LTTE in Sri Lanka and raised funds on behalf of the LTTE through a network of individual representatives. Secondly, the TRO has facilitated LTTE procurement operations in the United States, including the purchase of ammunition, equipment, communication devices, and other technology for the LTTE. Thirdly, the TROs efforts worldwide reportedly have allowed the LTTE to use humanitarian aid, which the TRO collected from the international community after the December 2004 tsunami, to launch new campaigns to strengthen LTTE military capacity. , . , TRO . Fourthly, the TRO maintains its headquarters in Killinochchi, Sri Lanka and operates branch offices throughout Sri Lanka and in seventeen countries worldwide, including the United States, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The announcement also provides identified information for the Tamil Rehabilitation Organization, including AKAs and address information for its branches worldwide. Fifthly, the LTTE oversees the activities of the TRO and other LTTE-linked Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in Sri Lanka and abroad. Directives issued by the LTTE suggest that the LTTE-affiliated branch representatives are expected to co-ordinate their efforts with the respective TRO representatives in their locations and report all activities to the LTTE. Recent information indicates that the LTTE has ordered international NGOs operating in the areas

controlled by the LTTE to provide all project funding through local NGOs which are managed collectively by the TRO. This arrangement allows the TRO to withdraw money from the local NGO accounts and to provide a portion of the relief funds to the LTTE. The LTTE has reportedly exerted pressure to comply on a few international NGOs that have resisted these arrangements. While one can expect a significant decline in the monthly collections of the LTTE worldwide, estimated at around US Dollars 20 to 30 million per month, at the same time we need to be vigilant of the propensity shown by the LTTE to shift its operations from one organization to another when they realize that it is running into trouble with the law of the land. The statement further observes, "It would be recalled how the management of the TRO-UK was taken over by the UK Charity Commission in 2002 following a series of internal investigations pointing to misappropriation of funds and allegations in connection with the LTTE, and subsequently it was delisted as a charity on 10th August, 2005. Eighteen days later, on 28th August, 2005, the LTTE registered a company with Companies House in the United Kingdom under the name International Tamil Rehabilitation Organization London (ITRO) with the same aims and purposes. It is also noted that another UK charity, White Pigeon is also engaged in fund-raising for similar purposes. Having been a trustee of TRO-UK, Dr. N. Sathiyamoorthy is also a trustee of the charity White Pigeon, whilst at the same time being a Director of ITRO". "Similarly, when the French authorities shut down the Tamil Television Network (TTN) which broadcast LTTE propaganda material, within days the LTTE was able to shift its operation to Switzerland and serve the same TTN subscriber base through a new channel, 'Tharisanam'. " Hence the need for vigilance to ensure that the functions carried out by the LTTE front organization, the TRO which is now proscribed in the US is not taken on by another front. Above all, yesterdays action by the United States shows with no uncertainty that the TRO was not focused solely on rehabilitation but also on financing LTTEs arms procurement. This precedent set by freezing of the assets of the TRO in the United States following a detailed investigation, we believe, would encourage other countries which are also investigating the LTTEs front organizations including the TRO, particularly Australia, Canada, Denmark, France and the United Kingdom to take tangible action against these Organizations. I call upon the international community to act speedily in this regard. , - - , , ,

: : PRIVILEGE : VIOLATION OF RIGHTS OF MEMBERS ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, I want to raise a matter concerning the privileges of the Members of Parliament in the Opposition of the United National Party. The powers and privileges of Members include the rights to participate in debates, take part in debates and especially the Budget Debate is mandated by the Constitution. Now, all of a sudden yesterday, three Members of Parliament of the UNP have been asked to come before the CID for inquiry. There is no lawful basis for that. One Member I will mention is the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake. The largest single foreign investor in Sri Lankan companies is the Galleon Fund and Mr. Raj Rajaratnam. He had apparently sent monies to Sri Lanka to a bank account to purchase bank shares. This was known to the Central Bank. He has dealt it with the Central Bank. Subsequently, the transaction fell through and the monies have been kept in the account. He has asked permission from the Central Bank to invest it in other ventures here. That is a policy decision for the Central Bank to take. But, all of a sudden, there is an inquiry on money laundering and the State electronic media has made allegations against the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake. The monies have been legally accounted for, as far as I understand, and this matter is well-known to the Governor of the Central Bank. Mr. Rajaratnam has discussed this matter with the Secretary to the President when they were in New York. The Hon. Karunanayake has only been a promoter of the transaction that did not take place. Thereafter, it is a matter for the Galleon Fund and Mr. Rajaratnam as to what should be done. The Central Bank inquiries have already revealed that they have on-going inquiries and some of them have been concluded showing that there has been legal transfers of monies. So, in those circumstances, in any case, I do not think that a question of money-laundering arises and certainly what the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake has to do with this is a mystery. Why should it be investigated by the CID? I will not take too much time because the time of the House has already been taken by the Deputy Ministers statement. The Hon. Earl Gunasekara, the Hon. Vajira Abeywardena have all been asked to go before the police. Whatever their acts, have been legitimate. And, all of a sudden this happens during the Budget Debate. This is a means of bringing pressure on Members of Parliament by the CID. I would ask the Hon. Speaker to speak to the Hon. Members concerned and take the matter up with the police and safeguard the rights of the Members.

: 2007 16 PRIVILEGE: THE ISLAND REPORT OF 16th NOVEMBER, 2007 . ( . ) (The Hon. M. Mahroof) Hon. Speaker, there is an article published on page 2 of The Island newspaper today, the 16th of November, 2007, under the caption, "Tension reigns in Parliament as four UNPers join Govt." stating that I had met President Rajapaksa at Temple Trees together with Members of Parliament, the Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera and the Hon. T. Maheswaran and indicated our willingness to join the Government. Sir, this is totally a fabricated story and no such thing happened and I believe that false articles such as this amount to a breach of Privilege of Members of Parliament. Sir, I leave it to you to take necessary action regarding this matter which also tarnishes my image. Interestingly, Sir, the article has no byline. I wish to categorically state that I have no intention of joining the Government and I will always uphold the decision taken by the people of Colombo who voted for the United National Party under the leadership of the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe and that I will always be a UNPer and will never betray my supporters. Thank you. , 2008

The Government of Sri Lanka tried to convince that concessionary funds are drying up and therefore the Government wanted to raise infrastructure finance from the commercial market. But, critics pointed out that the Government in fact had US Dollars 4.76 billion in concessionary finance for large scale projects and that remains undisbursed. . US Dollars 1.64 billion was forecast to be disbursed in 2007. Up to June, Hon. Presiding Member, only US Dollars 295 million or 18 per cent has been spent. . , .

.. ( ) ( . . - ) (The Hon. M.N. Abdul Majeed - Minister of Co-operatives) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem Hon. Presiding Member, last year, on the Second Reading of the Budget, I made a prediction which Members of this House thought was difficult to believe.

1187 1188

[ .. ]

The prediction was that by next year a barrel of oil would hit US Dollars 100. Unfortunately, this prediction is coming true. The consequences are difficult for the world on a whole, and particularly, for a small country like Sri Lanka which is totally dependent on imported oil for its major energy supply. The Budget presented by His Excellency the President faces these consequences bravely and has indicated the strategies he will adopt to meet these important problems over which Sri Lanka has no control. We, politicians, are all aware of the ups and downs of the political process. But great leaders like President Rajapaksa know how to overcome these difficulties and steer the country forward. I am from the East. The East has been the cockpit of Sri Lanka. Like Belgium and Khyber Pass, armies are constantly marching through the East. We, so far, have had ten armies bringing death and destruction. Finally, President Rajapaksa, has liberated the East and given the region stability. The East is rich in potential. It has untapped agricultural resources, enormous fishing possibilities, mineral sands and tourist potential. All these have not been tapped. With the stability brought in by President Rajapaksa, we are now entering a new era. So far, the development strategy had been dictated by the World Bank and IMF. It was, mainly, to privatize the national assets which were profit- making to the private sector. This did not create wealth. It only transferred wealth at cheap prices. The poor were being robbed to pay the rich. This World Bank policy was a failure all around the world. Africa and Latin America, which follow this policy, are poorer than earlier. Sir, a new policy had been suggested particularly by Stiglitz and Sachs. That is, the Government should invest heavily in infrastructure - roads, bridges, schools, hospitals et cetera. Once these investments are made, entrepreneurs will develop the locally available resources. This policy was followed by India, China and Malaysia. Their development is fantastic, reaching a 10 per cent growth rate or more. This is the route that Sri Lanka should take. This is the route that President Rajapaksa has adopted for the East. The Budget concentrates on infrastructure development of the East. Once this is done, the people can develop the productive assets of their own region. There are many salient features in the Budget that we should be happy about. The five-year tax holiday for investments over Rs. 50 million paves the way for long-term benefits by boosting confidence for foreign investments and holding out incentives for local

entrepreneurs. His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa's Government is keen that investors should invest in enterprises outside the Western Province. Our President has made it clear that he does not like to see the people of the East living as displaced people in refugee camps. He has instituted special programmes to ensure that the Eastern Province is also developed like other provinces. Under the "Nagenahira Udanaya", he has proposed special incentives and concessions for development activities of the region. There are many other welcome features in the Budget. The proposal to increase the guaranteed price of fresh milk is certain to bring about a big change in our over-dependence on powdered milk. This is a welcome proposal for our nation to reach self-sufficiency in milk production in the long run. The proposal to make available all varieties of fertilizers at concessionary prices will be an incentive to boost agricultural productivity. In this context, His Excellency the President deserves commendation for allocating Rs. 500 million to encourage the use of organic fertilizer instead of chemical fertilizers as those have been found to be harmful to the environment and health. As the Minister of Co-operatives, I am extremely glad about the priority given by His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa to strengthen the co-operative sector. The various provisions and concessions contained in the Budget Proposals to strengthen and modernize the co-operative sector and make it a viable system is truly praiseworthy. There has been misguided criticism about the recent loan floated from the international banks to the tune of US Dollars 500 million. The criticism is wrong. If the international banks were unhappy about the financial viability, they would not have oversubscribed it by three times. A part of this loan is for infrastructure development, for which the returns are long-term. But, it is infrastructure that lays the foundation for the private sector to develop resources. By getting this loan and making the infrastructural investments, the East is assured of a stable future. The East has all three ethnic communities or races that follow all four religions. It should be the location for nation building. President Rajapaksa, in this Budget, has laid the foundation for the development of the East aimed at self-sufficiency and peace-building. Also, I must mention that we should, first of all bear in mind that the extraordinary circumstances prevailing in the country today pose a big challenge to the Budget for the year 2008. The Members of the Opposition have been predicting that the Budget was going to heap unbearable burden on the people. They have been saying with absolute conviction that the Government would collapse in the face of the mounting economic crisis. But, His Excellency the President has silenced all their critics

2007 16 1189 1190

by presenting a Budget that is not only people-friendly, but also one prepared with far-sighted wisdom. I wish to state quite emphatically that the Budget for 2008 is a big victory for the Government and the people and at the same time, an unpleasant defeat for the Opposition. In the past, we have had many budgets prepared with the ostensible purpose of putting the country on a sound footing. Ours is a Government that is forced to wage wars on several fronts simultaneously, both literally and metaphorically. These are wars forced on the Government by circumstances and by inheritance from the previous regime - the war against terrorism, the war against inflation, the unfavourable situation arising from new global trends and soaring prices of fuel in the world market and so on and so forth. In the midst of all these serious challenges before us, we must honestly think and ask the question whether a better Budget than this could have been presented to the country. If one has taken the trouble to study and understand the vision and the objectives embodied in the "Mahinda Chintana", it would not be difficult for him to appreciate the salient features of the Budget. The Budget lays the groundwork to put the future of the country on a sound footing. It is a Budget that focuses on the national economy for the greater good of the people and is heavily development-oriented. Sir, His Excellency the President has shown great concern for the upliftment of the rural economy and the betterment of the rural people in the Budget. The emphasis given to fishery, milk production, weaving, agriculture et cetera indicates His Excellencys firm resolve to resurrect the rural sector. The proposal to strengthen the legal framework to prevent slaughter of milching cows by increasing the associated fine by as much as 200 times in order to encourage milk production is certain to bring about a big change in our over-dependence on powdered milk. This is a welcome proposal for our nation to reach self-sufficiency in milk production in the long run. Thank you.
