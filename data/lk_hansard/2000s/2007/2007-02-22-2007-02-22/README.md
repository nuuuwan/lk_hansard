[. . 10.36] ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Hon. Speaker, the COPE Report that has been presented to Parliament and what is being debated today are a direct indictment on the present Government. , , particularly on corruption, inefficiency and mismanagement of the public enterprises in Sri Lanka. The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage in his speech tried to shift the responsibility onto the officials, the secretaries and may be the chairmen or the CEOs of the enterprises. I do not agree with that, Sir. It is the responsibility of the Minister; it is the responsibility of the Government for all what has taken place. Particularly, the question of corruption has been spelt out very clearly by a former Minister, a powerful Minister in the Government, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, who refused to take office unless the corrupt practices are stopped. It is a very serious situation. All this refers to the public enterprises highlighted in the Report. His reference to the Rajapaksa company, I think is ample evidence of what has taken place. I am not going to emphasize on that. That is well known. That has been appearing in the newspapers and so on. The First Report of the Committee on Public Enterprises under the heading General Observations in page 4, gives a list of deficiencies and irregularities common to the institutions examined. I would very briefly mention, - not all of them but a few of them - among other things, it first refers to the failure on the part

of the Secretaries to the Ministries to supervise and follow up the performance of the institutions under review. That is well known; that was amply spoken of by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake. The second is, the failure on the part of the Ministers to supervise and control the enterprises under their Ministries. Well, that is the most important deficiency we see in most cases. Not only under this regime, but it may have taken place under the previous regimes as well. The third is, "Lack of professionalism in the management of public enterprises". Quite right, because we find that there is no professionalism in any of those institutions. Then another is, "Political interference." It is very common and more common nowadays than it was in the past. Also, another deficiency is, "Absence of good governance practice". So, those and several other deficiencies have resulted in the declining of profitability, liquidity and financial viability of those enterprises. Sir, the most important thing is the cumulative effect of this type of behaviour of the public enterprises in the country. It contributes to the increase in the cost of living. It has a direct impact on the cost of living of the country, particularly in regard to the goods and services these institutions are responsible for. Then, it affects the quality of the day-to-day life of the people of this country. This is very important. When the cost of living goes up, people find it difficult to make ends meet. The economy of the country as a whole is also affected. The growth rate and foreign aid contributions to the country are affected. All foreign agencies, foreign countries and financial agencies take note of how public enterprises are managed and controlled in this country. Invariably, there are budget deficits as a result of mismanagement of these enterprises that results in the printing of currency and finally it becomes a question of good governance.

The issue of responsibility and answerability to Parliament is what is in question in this Debate. Sir, if you examine Article 30(1) of the Constitution, it says that the Head of the State, the Head of the Executive and of the Government is the President. Overall, the President is responsible for the governance of this country. It is very clearly laid down in Article 42 of the Constitution. It states that the President is responsible to Parliament for the due exercise and performance of his powers and duties. Therefore, he is not only the President but is also responsible to Parliament. We have a right to question. And Article 43 states that the Cabinet of Ministers shall be collectively responsible and answerable to Parliament. Not only one Minister, not only the Line Minister, but the entire Cabinet of Ministers is responsible for whatever shortcomings in the public enterprises or government departments, as it may be. The Ministers appointed to handle the respective Ministries are responsible and answerable to Parliament. When questions are raised, when the Consultative Committees meet and when the issues are taken up, it is the Line Minister who has to make good and give remedies.

2007 22 775 776

This means the Executive is solely responsible and answerable to Parliament and through Parliament, to the people of Sri Lanka. Therefore, Parliament is supreme, particularly in matters of finance and the people have a right to know. We are the peoples Representatives, whether we are in the Government or Opposition. Therefore, we have a right to question. There is no escape or excuse. The Presidency has been held for approximately 14 to15 years by candidates of the Alliance which forms the present Government whether it be His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa or former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, and the corruption, deficiencies, irregularities, misconduct and the irresponsible management are the responsibility of the Executive according to the Constitution of Sri Lanka. Article 148 states, I quote: "Parliament shall have full control over public finance." The two Committees, the Committee on Public Enterprises and the Committee on Public Accounts, facilitate Parliament with information by way of reports from time to time to discharge its responsibility - that is what has been done by the COPE under the able Chairmanship of the Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, who had produced a very dynamic, useful and an important Report - over the control of public finances, which is found embodied in the Constitution of Sri Lanka, the Finance Act, the Administrative Regulations and the Financial Regulations. The Standing Orders of the House provide for the two Committees to present reports et cetera in regard to the day-to-day working of these corporations and the performance of these two Committees. The Debate in the House should be not to sling mud at each other. That is not what is intended. In my view, it has to ensure that the taxpayers' money, that is, the coffers of the Government, is fruitfully spent for the benefit of the citizens of this country. That is the underlying principle. Every cent -

, , [ ] . Whereupon MR. SPEAKER left the Chair and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER [THE HON. GITANJANA GUNAWARDENA] took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) If the public enterprises are defective, if they are ineffective, it is the duty of this House to go into those, analyse whatever reports that are brought before it and call

upon the respective Ministers to take corrective measures to punish the wrongdoers to ensure that the institutions are free of corruption and run efficiently for the benefit of the country. If one examines the list of enterprises coming under the COPE - I have got a list here - he would notice that there are approximately 66 enterprises which are important and affect the day-to-day life of the people of this country. The public enterprises reviewed under this Report directly affect the lives of the people. I would like to emphasize some of them which are very important. The Ceylon Electricity Board determines the cost of electricity for every citizen of this country and for the industrialists, whether big or small. It is a vital factor for the cost of production and the day-to-day life of the people. Then, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation determines the cost of fuel. Every enterprise, every undertaking, every business depends on the cost of fuel, whether it be kerosene, diesel, petrol or any other fuel. Then, we will take the financial institutions: the Central Bank, the Bank of Ceylon and the Peoples Bank, whose efficiency depends on the lending rate, also on which the people are dependent in their borrowings. If these institutions are inefficient, defective or running at a loss, the burden is passed onto the customers. The RDA, the BOI, the Sri Jayewardenepura General Hospital, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board affect right across the society, the big and the small. The Airport and Aviation Services Limited, the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and the UDA are some of the key sectors that the Government has to run efficiently and effectively for the benefit of the country. But, once we read the Audit Report, when we think of the condition they are in, it is alarming to note what is going to happen. What has to be remedied is very clearly given under General Observations in page four of the Report. The Report says that the Secretaries to the Ministries should have a closer supervision and monitor the performance of these enterprises. In the good old days during our regime, I remember the Secretaries were instructed to have review meetings quarterly. Once in three months, the Secretary was expected to call up the Boards, the Chairmen, the Board of Directors and officials of each and every corporation, which were under their purview, analyse and review the performance so as to prevent corruption or any major deficiencies from taking place. There were quarterly meetings to go into their management problems and even the Minister was expected to participate in those meetings. I do not know whether that is happening now. It is very rarely that we find this type of things taking place because, when the respective corporation or the undertaking is called before the Committee on Public Enterprises, we see that they have not even gone through the audit report that has been forwarded in order to come up with explanations and answers.

Of course, it is very easy for us to come here and put the blame on the officials. It is not correct. Invariably, the officials carry out what the Ministers say. If you speak to them secretly, then they will say, What can I do? I was forced by the Line Minister to do this. So, I had to carry it out. This is a very unfortunate situation. Of course, they have no opportunity of answering any charges that are levelled against them in this House. So, here in this House, it is the politicians who have to take responsibility. They are put in charge by the people to run the Government and the Government through the line ministries et cetera.

It is very important that the salary scales of the top management of the key enterprises have to be revised and increased to keep abreast with the private sector. Now why do all the efficient people in the public sector leave and join the private sector? That is for the simple reason that they get better salaries and perks. So, if the Government intends to keep, manage and run the public enterprises, then they must pay good salaries so that it will attract the best possible people, the educated people and the learned people to the public enterprises. Without that we will never be able to make public enterprises viable, profitable or run efficiently. This is a very important factor and the efficiency of these corporations mainly depends on the people who are at the helm, who are at the managerial level. Those are the people who would be able to turn around and make the enterprises profitable ventures.

Then of course, it is a very common administrative process that there should be a strong internal audit in all enterprises. For a strong internal audit to function, there should be qualified accountants. Once again unless good salaries and perks are given you will not be able to attract good accountants. No accountant wants to come and serve in the public enterprise for poor salaries. They are attracted by the private sector or they go abroad. This is a problem. Unless we rectify these things we will never be able to get anywhere. Of course, the Auditor-General, the key man, the man who goes into the day-to-day workings of the public corporations must be strengthened. Adequate staff and wherewithal must be given to the Auditor-General to carry out the audit effectively and efficiently. Then, Sir, provisions for surcharge must be made. The whole trouble is, by the time a detection is made of any corrupt practice or misappropriation the man involved has vanished, he has run away. So there is no point in talking about it when the culprit has run away. So the surcharge provisions should be invoked, brought in and the law must be amended in order to round them up. Sir, considering all these, the best remedy is to privatize a large number of these enterprises which are now managed by the State, to reduce the burden on the

Treasury and give a better deal to the citizens. All privatizations that have been carried out in Sri Lanka so far, I say, are successful and the country has benefited. Now I will give you one example. Take the case of privatization of the Sri Lanka Telecom. In the good old days we could not obtain a telephone without giving a bribe to the officials; otherwise they will say, No loops. Today the telephone is coming to the house. No problem, they are giving it without bribes. The simple example is the privatization of the telecommunication sector. And there are so many other enterprises that could be easily privatized and the government could get rid of the burden. Recently there was a development forum in the Maldives. The Maldivian Government said that it has privatized the entire fishing industry and they say it is a success and previously the Government had to bear the losses. Similarly in this country there are so many enterprises that could be still given to the private sector. The most important of all you see the world over; in Europe, in America, in Britain, in the Far East Asia, now the trend is privatization, it is very successful. Of course the regulatory bodies are important. They must be set up in order to maintain and ensure that there is no exploitation of the people in the form of high prices.

The appointment of Chairmen and Board of Directors is very important. We often see Chairmen and the Directors who are appointed people are clueless of management or clueless of the subjects they have to handle and are unable to manage the affairs of the corporations. This is a very serious situation. In India there is a panel of competent educated people lined up to fill these vacancies. It is not the Ministers or the politicians who are allowed to appoint Chairmen and Board of Directors at their will. In India there is a procedure to be followed in the appointment of Chairmen and Directors. There is an interview and qualified people are selected to be appointed to these positions. Therefore, Sir, it is the duty of Parliament not only to scrutinize and monitor the public enterprises, but also to make recommendations to the Government on the policies towards the management of public enterprises such as privatization programmes, amending of legislation and the general principles of governance of public enterprises. And it is for the legislature to ensure and maintain the efficiency and the effectiveness of these government undertakings.

Sir, finally, I hope the Government will take very serious notice of this report and take corrective measures. It is the people who suffer ultimately. It is not the Ministers or the Members of Parliament. It is the people who suffer as a result of mismanagement of Government establishments which account for nearly 40 per cent of the Treasury contributions annually through the Budget for the running of most of these enterprises.

(The Hon. P. Radhakrishnan - Deputy Minister of Vocational and Technical Training) Venerable Presiding Member, thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak at this historic moment. Many newspapers over the last few weeks have referred to the findings of the Committee on Public Enterprises. The Report highlighted many of the irregularities in the privatization of some state institutions and the sorry State of affairs in the BOI, CEB, CPC and the NLB to name a few.

The Report also highlights the incompetence of the officials heading these institutions. The services of these institutions are vital for public welfare and for the countrys economic progress. The tax payers, to deliver a service to the public, fund these institutions. Therefore, the relevant Ministries must at least now follow up on their findings and make sure that the necessary changes are made within these enterprises to prevent further abuse and mismanagement. These institutions in particular are in this mess due to political abuse and years of mismanagement by its politically-biased management. Over the years nothing substantial was done either by the UNP or the SLFP to set matters right in many of the ailing institutions for political reasons. On the other hand, the trade unions and the senior management were preoccupied by their domestic squabbles to worry about the rape or the plundering that was taking place. As a result today the CEB and the CPC are in the throes of a financial crisis. In fact, the CEBs daily loss alone is a staggering Rs. 50 million. The Trade Unions in the CEB have often accused politicians of abuse of the Boards property. Regardless, the abuse goes on and on. This is often attributed to irresponsible secretaries to ministries.

Venerable Sir, it is now recognized that a healthy public sector should exist side by side with the private sector in Sri Lanka. Unfortunately, however, some public enterprises like the CEB and CPC are becoming an intolerable burden on the budget and on the people of the country. We all know a budget deficit can be a great burden on the people. The large allocations to public enterprises directly from the budget have drastically reduced financial provisions for several essential sectors or in the alternative have resulted in an increase in direct and indirect taxes on the people. Unless we do something

immediately to improve the efficiency of public enterprises, the effect on the future is likely to be serious. The people ultimately have to pay for the sins of omissions and commissions of public corporations. On the other hand, the private sector is not developed enough to undertake heavy investments particularly in infrastructure and certain essential investments with a low direct return although the social rate of return is very high. In such instances the private sector does not have the capacity or the will to undertake certain types of investments. State intervention is therefore required in such situations. However, when a public sector corporation runs at a loss and it is a burden on the budget, it is ultimately a burden on the people of this land. Every man, woman and child in the country will pay for these losses by way of direct or indirect taxes.

Therefore, Venerable Sir, we have a responsibility to the people to run our State enterprises more professionally. I would like to recommend some solutions to this House and I hope my ministerial Colleagues would look at some of my suggestions positively. Appointments to the Board of Directors and to the position of Chief Executive should be on merit and on an assessment of the managerial skills of the persons available. The Board of Directors should consist of persons representing finance, marketing, technical functions and human resources. The Boards of key public institutions should have nominees from the chambers and industry to raise the level of debate and accountability. The position of working directors appears to be quite irrelevant and unnecessary. Proper corporate planning is necessary and for such purpose it is necessary to guarantee a flow of information from top to bottom and from the bottom upwards. The objectives of the organization should be clearly spelt out and these should be attainable objectives which should be reviewed from time to time, the effectiveness of which should also be reviewed from time to time and monitored on a continuous basis. The Boards of Directors should have autonomy and should be unfettered in making decisions especially in the area of selection of personnel, investment, pricing and marketing, acquisition of materials and the fixing of terms and conditions of employment. The Board must publish their yearly accounts in the newspapers and be subjected to public scrutiny. Employees in corporations do not have the stability and security, which are necessary to bring out the best in them. It would be necessary to have proper induction of employees and also to have career development programmes to encourage executives and even staff lower down to integrate themselves fully in their management environment.

837 838

The creation of incentives for workers to increase their productivity, the formation of quality circles and suggestion schemes to provide worker involvement may bring better results. Employees Councils which were set up had not had the desired results due to trade union involvement. The trade union structure in Sri Lanka is such that their political objectives and affiliations to political parties tend to remove the closeness and relationship within a workplace between workers and their managers. In fact, the development of that relationship is an important factor in ensuring the success of the organization. Public institutions should get the services of a professional accounting body like the ICA or CIMA for professional advice and support to raise the level of governance at enterprise level. Finally, I thank the Members of COPE for their effort to promote norms of good governance, discipline and accountability within our State entities. It is, Venerable Sir, our responsibility as peoples Representatives to promote good governance and to develop processes and systems to improve the performance of State enterprises and institutions. After all, Venerable Sir, we are elected to serve the people and not to be served by them. , . . . , . . , , . .., .... , , . .., ., .., , . 2002 22

( The Hon. Navin Dissanayake - Minister of Investment Promotion) , . . I would like to stress some points for consideration in this House as a Member of COPE, a Member of Parliament and also as a Minister, particularly because I

am now able to look at things from both sides. First, when I was a Member of COPE, I was able to be critical of certain institutions that we examined. Especially now as the Minister of Investment Promotion, I can see things from the opposite point of view and I would also like to go into detail of some of those aspects. Particularly, I would like to say that COPE is one of the premier bodies that come under Parliament. It has powers that enable the Chairman and the Members of COPE to examine government bodies that come under the various ministries. This regulatory power to examine the functions of various organizations and Government bodies also enhances the role of Parliament which acts as the chief institution that controls the finances of this country. Therefore, I would like to state that COPE has a multiplicity of functions and one of them is to examine the transparency of the organizations that come under the various ministries. It is also very pertinent to keep in mind that we are talking about public institutions and public funds. When we mention these two words, the word "accountability" also comes into our minds, especially the fact that all Government officers are accountable to Parliament and to the people of this country. Therefore, when we talk about the powers and the duties of COPE, we must keep some principles in mind. Actually this particular COPE Report which we are arguing and debating today, to me is not a big deal. . , , . ; . . . , . , COPE . . Therefore, I would like to stress that this COPE Report is no big deal to me. As Members of Parliament, especially the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella is here, a seasoned and experienced politician, you may have debated so many COPE reports in your political and public life. This is not a big deal. This happens. This has to be done. But there is a new dimension to this particular COPE Report because there are certain individuals, who are trying to twist this COPE Report to their advantage and sling mud at the Government. This cannot and will not be allowed to happen. I must stress that. Some people were very happy when three Cabinet Ministers were sacked. They thought the Government was going to collapse the next day. . . , . .

849 850

, , . The first point is, when we debate this Report we must bear in mind that it does not specify a particular period of time. Some people try to say that all this corruption took place under the presidency of Mahinda Rajapaksa. That is wrong. The references in this COPE report go back to the early 1990s. I would like to stress that point to you. Especially if you look at the sale of 90 per cent shares of Lanka Marine Services Limited, the date goes back to 1993 when there was a UNP Government in place. I would like to quote from page 25 of the COPE Report. It states, I quote:

"PERC Chairman P.B. Jayasundara forwarding Chief Valuers 1993 Valuation of LMSL,. So, it does not cover a particular period. That is the first point that I would like to stress and you cannot say that a particular individual or a particular organization or a particular government is responsible for the misdeeds that have been highlighted in this COPE Report. It covers many governments, many institutions and many ministers. But, the important point to remember is that this is a public document and that everybody in this House is responsible to find out as to what happened in these public institutions that have been covered by COPE. That is a responsibility of Parliament. We are not here to sling mud at people or to accuse people or to point a finger at people or to go on particular political witch-hunts like some people are trying to do. We are here as Members of Parliament responsible to the people of this country, responsible to this august Assembly to examine this Report in detail and to take corrective measures. That is what we are here for.

Then, of course, I would like to stress that this COPE Report should not have individual agendas. I would like to mention that and emphasize it particularly because particular individuals can have various individual agendas for this COPE Report. For example, there is a transaction that involves the Insurance Corporation of Sri Lanka. There can be certain aspersions cast. Under the Preferential Voting System the Manape problem is coming up in the Colombo District. As you know a certain gentleman from the UNP came to this side and now he is a Minister and another gentleman has become the newly appointed Colombo District . So, there cannot be any individual agendas for this COPE Report and when we are debating this you should not use this COPE Report to sling mud at people and I feel that there is an element of underhand activity when this Report is being examined today. That cannot be allowed to happen. Individual agendas, no; public agendas, yes. That should be the bottom line when we are debating this COPE Report.

Then of course, as you know, in my own personal view this COPE Report highlights a major malaise in the administrative service of this country. I am sure, the Hon. Kiriella would agree with me that the Public Service is not what it was ten, fifteen or perhaps twenty years ago. When you look at the gamut of this Report, when you look at all the institutions that have been examined by us what does it say? It shows the deteriorating standards of public institutions in this country. You have to accept that. You cannot get away from that fact. What we have to understand and rationalize in this House is to find a methodology to arrest this deteriorating situation. This is the sad plight of Sri Lanka.

When you examine the Ports Authority, when you examine the BOI, when you examine the Ceylon Electricity Board we see a large number of lapses and some can say they are frauds, some can say they are mistakes and some can say that the public officials were negligent but that they were not fraudulent. You can argue it in any way you want.

The Hon. Kiriella is a lawyer. There are so many lawyers in this House. Sometimes there are mistakes that genuinely happen. Sometimes there is negligence but that does not amount to fraud. Sometimes officials are forced to do certain things that they cannot, but they have to do that. For example, when you look at the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation it clearly says that the cadre has exceeded and that there are about 700 excess staff in the Petroleum Corporation. But then who gives the orders for the officials to take these people? It is the politician. So the politician is also responsible for the deteriorating situation in these public institutions. We are all collectively responsible. We have to go deep into our souls and ask, "Are we really fulfilling our role as Members of Parliament and Representatives of the people of this country?" Therefore when you look at these institutions that we have examined, it is not only the officials who have to be blamed but also the politicians who should take the responsibility for it. Definitely there have been certain wrong doings in these public institutions.

We are using about 10 floors and that has been a much-maligned criticism because when I started my speech I said that when I was on that side and when I was a member of the COPE I criticized it. But, now, when I am on this side I have to honestly state that that decision to stay in the World Trade Centre can be justified because the BOI has got a very good deal on that. We are paying a maximum of Rs. 70 per square foot whereas if we go to another building it will be double that, Rs. 130, Rs. 140 or perhaps even Rs. 150. But, the BOI has got a very good deal from this company and we can justify the decision to stay in the World Trade Centre. But, we will be moving to a new location in the near future. My time is up. There are a lot of other things that I can talk about but there is one more thing I have to say. COPE . COPE . . , .

( - ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama - Minister of Foreign Affairs) Hon. Deputy Speaker, in fact it is with great pleasure that I join this Debate on the First Report of the COPE, a Debate associated with our public enterprises. I held office of Chairman of the COPE in the year 2005 and during that time we registered a new dimension in the responsibilities associated with the COPE as an oversight committee responsible for public enterprises in the Government and as an oversight committee of Parliament. I must compliment the Members serving in this Committee, who have taken a lot of effort in coming out with fundamental issues that are affecting the good performance of some of the enterprises that have been cited in the Report submitted to this House by its current Chairman, my Friend, the Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe

I think it is an important Debate that we had during the last two days and on behalf of the Government I have the privilege of winding up the Debate for the Government side and may I compliment all speakers who associated themselves with in contributing to this Debate positively as well as critically on some of the concerns that have come out in this Report.

The objective of the COPE must be understood when we are discussing a report of this nature. It is a Committee that oversees the discharge of financial responsibility of the given enterprises. There is a Board of Directors that we appoint to run these institutions on behalf of the Government and the Treasury being the owner, the equity owner of its investment, has a responsibility to ensure that good performance takes place. We believe in the management of these enterprises by the Boards that are appointed, believing that they are competent Boards. The Secretaries to Ministries who are the Chief Accounting Officers, have a dual responsibility to ensure the accountability of these enterprises in financial and other administrative activities. It is that culture that we now have to instil which has not been the case with regard to some of these institutions.

One has to remember the Government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa came into office on the 19th of November, 2005. Now, it is that Government that has gone into the affairs of these enterprises in instilling the type of development that these enterprises should acquire for good performance in terms of their responsibilities, accountability and performance in the contemporary period. Also, we must keep in mind what we as a Government inherited. This is not what we have created. A Government of one year and three months in office has inherited these enterprises with a legacy that is deficient, that lacks organizational structures, that may not have Corporate Plans and may not know the accountability and responsibilities associated with these enterprises. Lethargy, incompetence and many of these shortcomings have been highlighted in the Report that has been submitted to this House. It is a fact. Against this fact, today our Government is instilling the aspect of good governance - the corporate responsibility of these institutions to be measured in terms of accountability and performance. It is a Report highlighting these deficiencies and the deficiencies associated with the legacy of these enterprises that we, as a Government have come to manage today. The Opposition is speaking about the deficiencies. We are also speaking about the deficiencies. Our august Committee that went into the affairs of these enterprises have highlighted these deficiencies, shortcomings, may be corrupt practices; all these things, because we believe in instilling the spirit of good governance that is needed to improve these enterprises. That is why I value this Debate. In a debate we must understand as to where it should begin and where it should end. Some of our Members went on to say without understanding that the Cabinet came into

869 870

2007 22

office only one year and three months ago that it is responsible for certain shortcomings that had been there right throughout, when the present ministers concerned have taken very meaningful steps to put them straight. I personally know, having run the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka for one year, that we were able to register an FDI of US Dollars 600 million for the first time. How did this same organization, with all these deficiencies that have been spoken in this Report - which I will later on discuss - be able to perform to register US Dollars 600 million in Foreign Direct Investment to this country as compared with US Dollars 272 million in the year 2005? Now, can this House see the means that were employed to generate the higher level of Foreign Direct Investment to the country? How is our economy performing at 7 per cent GDP annually on a continuous basis during the last two years for the first time? How are we instilling the confidence in the investors of this country under His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksas regime? How have we brought in development associated with peoples well-being and prosperity to the people if our Government is responsible for all the deficiencies it is accused of ? Now, that is the difference. The positive side also must be spoken of. Sometimes, it is easy to target officials but it is difficult to find the cures. I like targeting if the officers can be held personally responsible and the committees can go into that. There can be subcommittees. I am encouraging the COPE to set up a couple of subcommittees to investigate certain areas of deficiencies, shortcomings and corrupt practices highlighted in this Report. Only then can we have a more meaningful debate in this House. Then the persons who are being identified as responsible can be dealt with accordingly. Otherwise, it is very unfair to get a blanket approval for what is being said. Sometimes things that are being said with the best of intentions may get reflected in the wrong manner in this House and the press may just pick up only what they want to highlight.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please ! .

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) , .

As I mentioned earlier, Mr. Speaker, we are looking at the good governance programme under President Mahinda Rajapaksas regime. What we have inherited is something we have to live with, until such time we bring in reforms that are necessary. This is why we are now instilling public reforms for enterprises as well. We have brought in more meaningful legislation to this country like the Companies Act which is progressive in generating the confidence and that what will apply to the companies that are in the hands of the Government. The public enterprises - either they are in the corporate form through legislation or they are incorporated under the Companies Act - owe a responsibility to this House. That is, to account and to properly manage their institutions. In this regard there are certain highlighted areas that we can always discuss. In fact, I want the COPE to get further strengthened. It was during my time that I sought assistance from the Government and I must compliment the Secretary to the Treasury for having voted Rs. 100 million for the COPE in order to make it a more meaningful structure and an institutional framework for us to address the issues of this nature. It was with that assistance I was able to generate confidence amongst my own Colleagues in the Committee at that time and we were able to go into the affairs of several public enterprises, holding 125 meetings in the year 2005.

Now I see certain very important shortcomings have got highlighted and I suggest that these shortcomings be rectified. We cannot allow this legacy to be passed on.

If I am to speak on all the enterprises that have been cited in this report - several of my Colleagues in the House have spoken on some of them - I may not be able to conclude today on any of them. However, I owe a responsibility to this House as a Member of the COPE and one who has handled the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka in the past. I would not hesitate to mention that certain submissions that have been made in this Report needs further investigation and I suggest that the Subcommittee of the COPE must go into certain agreements that had been entered into in 1997. Particularly, Item 16 of the COPE Report under the Board of Investment states that the Merbok Company has been given a very favourable status against the national interests of our country. This is a matter that the Subcommittee must go into. If there are any shortcomings associated with that, all officers including the officers who have been delaying action on this must be held accountable to any of these favourable and special treatment that has been extended to this company which created havoc in our local base. I took every step to bring in legal steps. I got my Colleague, the Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe as a lawyer to go into this and to appear on behalf of the Board of Investment because they need to be dealt with in the right manner, in a manner in which the national interest of this country is protected.

Then, there is another very important submission which I also want to make. Item 11 of the COPE Report under the the Board of Investment states that a certain document had not been tendered properly and I do not expect any Chairman to apologize to the COPE in the event they had done the right thing. But if they have done the wrong thing, they are not suitable to be Chairmen of these organizations and they have to be dealt with accordingly because that is a misrepresentation of facts in relation to the submissions made. They cannot be tolerated. They have to be dealt with having heard them properly but they must be given an opportunity to explain. Then only any conclusion could be arrived at. It is very important that we instil confidence in the officials who work in our public institutions, otherwise it will not be possible for us to run the administration. Good management must apply to individuals as well. These individuals must be given responsibility. We must always try to make the best use of officials in the Public Service so that we obtain the best output, not thrash them merely because there are certain shortcomings. If there are shortcomings these officers should not be allowed to serve in these organizations, they must be told that accordingly. This is how we can instil responsibility associated with management. For the sake of not bringing disrepute to an organization which contributes to the national economy, we cannot allow things to be swept under the carpet . But at the same time, we cannot allow people to be targeted irresponsibly. And that responsibility lies in a two-way traffic system rather than in a one-way direction. I want to instil accountability and responsibility in the public servants and the employees of the corporations. These employees, some may not be corrupt, some may be corrupt and the corrupt ones must be isolated from the good ones and the good ones must be encouraged to work their way up and make these enterprises more productive for the benefit of Sri Lanka. It is in that context that this COPE Report must be viewed and there are certain responsibilities cast on the permanent secretaries. The permanent secretaries must be encouraged to look into these affairs. There must be a structure in the Ministry to facilitate the supervision of corporations coming under it. In the absence of such a structure, Hon. Speaker, the responsibility cannot be discharged by the respective officials whatever position they hold. They may command a certain amount of responsibility, they may have some status to go into these matters but the corporate responsibility must be implemented, otherwise it is ineffective. Therefore, these are areas we must look into further. This is only a superficial Debate in my opinion addressing issues on a general basis. We must go in for specific remedial action in relation to matters arising from this report without just allowing it to pass after todays Debate. There are specific areas where the Subcommittee must go into and submit recommendations to the COPE. The Members can preside in this Subcommittee, further evidence could be brought in and conclusions arrived at so that these institutions function efficiently.

Hon. Speaker, we also have another area to look at, the objective being the accountability to Parliament and the people of this country. Any person holding public office whether he be a Minister, a public servant, a corporate employee, or a board member of a corporate institution owes a responsibility to the people of this country. That is what we have to ensure. How can we make them responsible? That must be instilled in them. In the United States, Mr. Speaker, you will recall, any institution can be brought before the Congress for review. It need not necessarily be a public institution in the event national interests get affected. This happened when the Dubai Ports World took over certain ports run by the P & O in the United States. The Congress did not permit that because they were able to place national interests before commercial interests. Here again, we cannot leave out certain institutions that have national responsibility of the purview of the House because it is the House that gives the direction to the people of this country and their destiny is decided by us, who are seated here. Can we allow organizations to act contrary to the interests of this nation? Can we have institutions acting contrary to the interests of the sovereignty of this country? This is where the accountability lies. This is what I think we have to look at even through bringing in an amendment to the Standing Orders of this House. Any institution even if it is a commercial institution, which is of national interest and has a bearing to the economy or the people of this country must come under the purview of this House. The House must have that extended arm to oversee whenever an oversight has been committed
