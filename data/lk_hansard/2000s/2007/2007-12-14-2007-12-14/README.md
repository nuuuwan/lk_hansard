: : STATEMENTS OF BRITISH HIGH COMMISSIONER AND DIRECTOR-GENERAL, UNESCO : STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama - Minister of Foreign Affairs)

Mr. Speaker, I wish to avail of this opportunity to provide the Hon. Members of this House an account of the action taken by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with respect to three matters that we have been confronted with in recent times. The first is the content of the Dudley Senanayake Memorial Oration by the outgoing British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Dominic Chilcott. High Commissioner Chilcott was summoned yesterday, the 13th of December, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to express the deep displeasure of the Government of Sri Lanka at some of the comments made by him at this recent public gathering. The Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs drew the High Commissioners attention to his comment which I quote below and expressed the Governments deep concern : I am not saying that the political aspiration for Eelam is illegitimate The Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs further stated that this statement was unacceptable to the Government of Sri Lanka given the British Governments categorical rejection of the creation of a separate State in Sri Lanka. Additionally at a time when the painstaking process of evolving a negotiated political settlement was underway, such sentiments would have a negative impact and send confusing signals. The Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also expressed disappointment that such statement was made particularly at a politically-sensitive time in the country. Further, the UK remains a country that has banned the LTTE and has continued to assist all counter-terrorism measures against the LTTE activities in the UK including the arrest of Shanthan in 2007, an action taken by the British Government against the LTTE operations. The British High Commissioner categorically confirmed that the UK does not support in any way the establishment of a separate State in Sri Lanka, neither did he personally. The British High

3713 3714

[ ]

Commissioner by way of explanation stated that what he meant was that political aspirations could be expressed through legitimate methods just as much as the aspirations for independence for Yorkshire. The Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, additionally stated that there was no substantiation of the allegation made that the relatives of the Members of the TNA had been abducted. The law enforcement authorities had advised that preliminary investigations had not revealed any basis for these allegations which seemed to follow a similar pattern. It was noted that upholding the rule of law was amongst the Governments foremost priorities, adding that such allegations have the potential to be used and manipulated by interested parties in the current political environment. The High Commissioner agreed that the Government had the right to take measures within the law to confront the terrorist threat posed by the LTTE. He said that he was greatly encouraged by the ready acceptance of the supremacy of the legal process evidenced by the deference demonstrated by the law enforcement authorities to the recent rulings by the Supreme Court. He also stated that political opposition must be consistent with the legal framework of the country. The second is the statement made by the Director-General of UNESCO, Mr. Koichiro Matsuura, on 3rd December, 2007 regarding the attack on the Voice of Tigers - VoT radio station. On 5th December, I informed this House that the Sri Lankan Government has lodged a strong protest through our Ambassador in France and Permanent Delegate to the UNESCO, Ms. Chitranganee Wagiswara, seeking retraction of the statement made by the Director-General. We were assured by the Director-General that he will re-examine the entire issue regarding the statement made on 3rd December. On 7th December 2007, after a meeting with our Ambassador, the office of the Director-General of UNESCO issued the following statement. It states, I quote:

On 7th December, 2007, the Director-General of UNESCO met with Ambassador Chitranganee Wagiswara, Permanent Delegate of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka to UNESCO, concerning UNESCOs press release issued on the bombing of the radio station of the Tamil Tigers in Northern Sri Lanka, and asked the Ambassador to convey to her authorities the following two points :

1. The Director-General reaffirms his strong condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, committed by whomever, whatever and for whatever purposes, as it constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security. He also states that acts, methods and practices of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations are activities aimed at the destruction of human rights, fundamental freedoms and democracy.

In this regard, the Director-General strongly condemns the acts of terrorism committed by the Tamil Tigers. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Mr. Matsuura recalls UNESCOs commitment to the implementation of 'Uniting against terrorism: recommendations for a global counter-terrorism strategy' adopted by the UN General Assembly at its 60th session.

2. Mr. Matsuura joins his voice with that of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, who appealed on 28 November, 2007 for 'an end to the destructive spiral of violence in Sri Lanka and [called] on the parties to the conflict [Government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)] to return to the peace process while making every effort to ensure the protection of civilians.'

The Director-General takes note of Sri Lankas assurance of its commitment to a negotiated political settlement. Hon. Speaker, the first part of the statement very much condemns the LTTE by name, using words as "Tigers" and "terrorists". It is the second part of the statement, once again, that we took objection to and reiterated our position on, saying that the Director-General should further examine it and withdraw the statement made using the word "parties" because it gives rise to a status of parity between the parties. Sir, in this regard, we have made a further request. Since this statement was unsatisfactory and it continued to refer to them as the parties to the conflict, on my instructions Ambassador Wagiswara on 10th December 2007, four days ago, drew the attention of the UNESCO to the fact that the Government of Sri Lankas holds the position that the UNESCO must not explicitly or implicitly draw a parity between the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE. She noted that the second paragraph of the statement of 7th December had the effect of equating the legitimately elected Government of Sri Lanka with a banned terrorist entity. We have sought correction of this. I am informed that the UNESCO Director-General, who was on a visit to Dakar, is due to be back in Paris only on Friday, that is today, and this matter awaits his attention. Then the third is, the issues taken up with the UNICEF. Further to my Statement in this House on 6thDecember 2007, I wish to share the following update : (a) With respect to the import of "ready-to-eat meals" and the fixing of bulletproof plates to a UNICEF vehicle, a meeting is scheduled to be held on 17th December, 2007 between UNICEF representatives, the CID and the officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to further examine the matter and take appropriate action accordingly. (b) On the participation of the UNICEF officials in a local demonstration, the Controller of Immigration and Emigration has confirmed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the departure of the following UNICEF staff officers from Sri Lanka: Ms. Larissa (Lara) Scott on 6th November, 2007 and Ms. Rachel McKinney on 4th December, 2007.

2007 14 3715 3716

The UNICEF has also informed that Ms. Patricia Purvez's - a locally recruited consultant - contract with the UNICEF expired on 19th October, 2007. She is the wife of a clergyman living in Sri Lanka and her passport details have been conveyed to the Controller of Immigration and Emigration, requesting for further action and information in this regard. Ms. Dharshiny Kirubaharan is a local recruit and an inquiry is presently being carried out by the Department of Human Resources of the United Nations Headquarters. The outcome, we are awaiting and that will be shared with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (c) Regarding the use of the bulletproof vehicle, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also requested the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Traffic to inform as to what action he would propose with regard to the conversion of the UNICEF vehicle bearing number WP HN 9401 by fitting bulletproof plates. (d) With respect to the UNICEFs involvement in TRO activities, visa clearance was granted to two UNICEF officials attached to the UNICEF Headquarters in New York and the regional office in India to carry out audit duties in the Kilinochchi UNICEF zonal office from 4th to 6th December, 2007. The UNICEF has informed that they will share the outcome of the report with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. So, Mr. Speaker, you will note that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is fully conscious of its responsibility in maintaining good relations with states as well as international organizations, not permitting any type of allegations against Sri Lanka to be swept under the carpet, not taking any affronts that may be made by anyone to undermine the unity, sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka lying down or acting against the violation of the rules of this land. I can assure you that we would continue to act with the same vigor in the future as well. Thank you, Sir. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) ( ) (The Hon. Wimal Weerawansa) - - , . , , . ,

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) In regard to some parts of the statement made by the Hon. Foreign Minister, I think, Sir, it is becoming a fashion in this country for both persons in the Government and for some sections in the Opposition to be strongly critical of whatever is said by international personalities, whether it be the UN officials or the Ambassadors or the High Commissioners stationed in

3717 3718

this country or even persons who come to deliver lectures, like Mr. Gareth Evans when he came here to deliver the eighth Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam Memorial Lecture. That is because of the atmosphere of intolerance, of arrogance under the belief that a government in power can do anything that it wants to and get away with it. This is totally wrong, Sir. It is not acceptable. It is not in keeping with democracy; it is not in keeping with international norms and standards; it is not in keeping with fundamental human rights; it is not in keeping with good governance; it is not in keeping with the rational behaviour on the part of any government. That, I must say. I think High Commissioner Dominic Chilcott, in the course of the Memorial Lecture on the late Hon. Dudley Senanayake, a much-esteemed Prime Minister in this country, was certainly entitled to express his views in regard to the situation prevalent in this country, particularly, if it was obvious that there was no substantial, consistent, constructive effort being made to reach a political settlement to the conflict pertaining to the Tamil question, that the aspiration for Tamil Eelam cannot be regarded as being illegitimate. This is not something which he advocates but it is something which he says could well be the outcome of the most negative manner in which this Government is presently conducting itself supported by some of its alliance partners in the Government and some in the Opposition. So, I want to say, Sir, that international personalities are not here to say what pleases you. They are here to speak the truth and make you realize that you must come along with the truth, adopt the path of the truth and move in the correct direction and that I think, is the purpose of the speech made by High Commissioner Dominic Chilcott and it is extremely unfortunate that this honourable gentleman who has been stationed in Sri Lanka for some time and who is about to leave, is unnecessarily being hauled over the coals for saying something very legitimate. The other matter, Sir, is in regard to three TNA Members of Parliament. Their relations are still in custody. I want to say that it is only the Government which knows who has done this. We know who has done it and where they are being kept. But, the Government is silent. This happened last time on the 19th of November when the Vote was taken on the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill. Just a day before the Vote was taken, the Hon. Kanagasabais son-in-law was abducted. What happened? The Hon. Kanagasabai did not come to Parliament. He did not exercise his vote as a Member of Parliament. He was not able to express his democratic wish in this House despite being a Member of this honourable House and that very night his son-in-law was taken by the abductors, handed over to the Headquarters Inspector of the Batticaloa Police Station who brought him to Colombo and delivered him safely to the Hon. Kanagasabai. Have you made a statement in this House? Have you conducted any inquiry in regard to that matter? Have you questioned the Headquarters Inspector of Police how he got this person? Have you questioned the Hon. Kanagasabai? You have done nothing and now you

have the brass, the impudence, the impertinence to come to this House and say, "We do not know from where this complaint comes. It may be true. It may not be true." You know it is damn well true. You know what happened and I say that the Government knows because the Government wants to prevent these three Members of Parliament from voting in this House today in keeping with their independent wish and if something happens to the relations of Members of Parliament who are in custody, because the Members of Parliament decide to exercise their franchise freely, the Government and you, Mr. Speaker, as being the custodian of the rights and Privileges of Members of Parliament will have to take responsibility for whatever happens to those poor, innocent people.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Sir, I want to say this very briefly. I only want to say that the verdict at the 2004 election was consistent with the verdict delivered by the Tamil people in the North-East in 1956, in 1960-March, in 1960-July, in 1965, in 1970, in 1977, in 2001-January and at all elections that have taken place during the entire period. There has been a trend in the deliverance of the verdicts of the Tamil people in the North-East and that is something which we might find uncomfortable. You might find unpalatable but that is the truth and you cannot get away from that. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . , . - ( ) (An Hon. Member) ? ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . earphones . [ ] . . , . . DIG , . . , . . .

The Auditor General has raised this query with regard to the refund of VAT amounting to Rs. 3,573,372,886 to 20 companies by 235 cheques during the period 15th November, 2002 to 25th August, 2004. This matter is being investigated by the Bribery Commission. I also appointed a committee of which Mr. P. P. D. P. Karunasekera has been appointed as the Chairman. The report of the committee has not been submitted yet. I hereby attached a copy of the appointment letter. I have decided to draw your attention to above query as I will retire from 9th July 2005 and this is very important, and I believe that remedial action should be taken without delaying because these type of refunds have to be stopped, and proper system of issuing VAT refunds has to be implemented. R. P. L. Weerasinghe Commissioner General of Inland Revenue. Internal Audit & Assessment Control 22.06.2005. C. G. I. R., Interim Report of Committee to enquire into certain VAT refunds alleged to be improperly made. This refers to your request-dated 24.03.2005, appointing a committee to conduct an inquiry into and report on certain VAT refunds alleges to have been improperly made. Initially the committee intended to collect the information from relevant files themselves. All the files were called from the VAT branch. In its response, instead of VAT files being furnished, relevant two G. S. T. files were made available to the committee. It was also informed that some of these files were taken over by the Bribery Commission and the Auditor Generals Department (Numbers are given below).

Documents relevant to registration of VAT taxpayers are all handled by the D. P. R. A. U. and thereafter kept in the custody. No single VAT file after being subjected to audit with connected papers has been furnished despite several requests made by the Committee. So Committee is unable to ascertain whether those files have been audited or not. Failure to obtain above documents the committee looked into what re-funds have been made in those files. A copy of the details of the re-funds is attached herewith. Steps are being taken to call the relevant tax payers to get preliminary information in relation to those refunds. Further details in relation to clearing of cheques will be obtained from the relevant bank. Please treat this as an interim report on what we have completed up to now and enquiries will be continued and further developments will be informed to you in due course. Sgd. Mr. P. P. D. P.

Secretary to the Treasury Ministry of Finance Fraudulent VAT Refund With reference to your letter dated 12th September 2005 on the above, the details requested are kindly given below. (1) VAT refunds have already been issued to all parties men-tioned in your letter during the period from 01.01.2002 to 01.10.2004 (2) All these refunds have been issued on the basis of returns furnished and they have been made in accordance with the provisions of VAT law. (3) No any refund found to have been made in contravention of guidelines and procedures prescribed for the issue of refunds. (4) When refunds are issued for exports during the period under consideration there was no facility available in the system to check the amount declared as exports in the return with exports actually made through the customs. However, this checking was done after obtaining a custom declaration obtained from the taxpayer. (5) So far no any amendment was proposed in this regard. (6) Since the issue of refund is a collective activity of number of officers it is not possible to identify and name officers individually responsible for the issue of improper refunds. (7) Following are some of the steps taken subsequently to minimize the chances of happening of similar situations. i. Making compulsory to check up the export data w i t h taxpayers returns. ii. Directing officers to pay more attention when register-ing taxpayers for VAT. iii. Instead of issuing refund cheques directly to persons concerned over the counter, instructions have been given to dispatch all cheques by registered post to the address provided at the time of registering for VAT. iv. Facility to check on line the amount of exports de-clared in the return with the exports through the cus-toms was made available to the officers in issuing the refunds. v. Deferred Refund System for VAT was introduced for the apparel industry to curtail improper refunds. (8) In addition to the steps introduced on above, all cases in-volved for this type of irregular refunds were subjected to VAT Audits including field audits and assessments were raised wherever necessary to recover the appro-priate amounts and recovery has already been ini-tianted. A Committee has been appointed by me investigate the cases where refunds claimed to have been irregularly made. P. P. D. P. Karunasekara Commissioner General of Inland Revenue Secretary to the Treasury,

On the basis of findings it is suggested that an independent commission of inquiry be appointed to inquire in to these cases where irregularities have been taken place. Further, a copy of the reply to the audit query by Auditor General under reference No. EF/C/R/Wimasum/2004/30 is attached here-with for your kind considerations.

, 01 , 01 The Secretariat, Colombo 01 23rd January, 2006 Mr. Lalith Weerathunge Secretary to the President Dear Sir, APPOINTMENT OF A COMMISSION OF INFQUIRY TO INQUIRE INTO ALLEGED FRAUDULENT VAT REFUNDS As you may be aware, wide publicity was given to alleged fraudulent VAT refunds at the Department of Inland Revenue, based on findings by the Auditor General in his report No: EH/C/IR vimasum /2004/30, dated June, 2005. The then Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (CGIR) on 23rd June 2005 brought to my notice of an audit query made by the Auditor Generals Department with regard to alleged malpractices involving VAT refunds, amounting to Rs. 3.6 billion to 20 companies through 235 eheques, during the period 15th November 2002 to 25th August 2004. I was also informed that this matter is being investigated by the Bribery Commission and that in addition and that the CGIR has appointed a committee headed by Mr. P. P. D. P. Karunasekera, the then Addl. Com-missioner General as Chairman of this committee. The then CGIR fur-ther informed me that he is bringing this matter to my Attention in view of his impending retirement on 9th July 2005. In the meantime, Hon. Minister of Finance and Planning also directed me to appoint a unable officer from the Ministry of Finance and Plan-ning to examine this matter. However, as the VAT Act gives full powers to the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue, there was no room for an independent officer of this Ministry to conduct any inquiry. I was also advised that the Secretary Provisions of the VAT Act (Section 23) do not permit Internal Auditors to have access to tax files. In this at background three alternatives were identified ; * Request to CGIR to carryout a further inquiry focusing on identi fied aspects. * Request the Auditor General to carry out a further audit focusing on identified aspects. * To establish a Commission under the Commissions of Inquiry Act No. 17 of 1948 to investigate. As such, I wrote to the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue and the Attorney General seeking clarifications on what action this Ministry could take in this regard, since this matter would have a serious adverse impact on the credibility of the Inland Revenue Department. I wish to note that this matter was also raised in Parliament during the last Budget debate and the Hon. Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning informed the house that the matter has being referred to the Hon. Attorney General for relevant legal advise. After many reminders and follow up corre-spondence with the CGIR and the Attorney Generals Department, I have finally received a response from the CGIR. However I have still

not received any response from the Attorney Generals Department. In this background I do not consider that any further delay in action by this Ministry is in the best interest of the public. Since the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue has now documented in his report various information indicating a series of lapses and he, himself who headed the departmental inquiry has advised to appoint an independent inquiry commission to further go into the matter and since it involves an alleged fraud of billions of rupees and there is serious public concern, conduct-ing a high powered inquiry appears to be the correct option. Therefore, I kindly request you to consider advising His Excellency the President to appoint a Commission of Inquiry, to look into this matter and report within 3 months from the date of such appointment, the find-ings thereof. Considering the seriousness of the alleged fraud and also to ensure an impartial conclusion, in my view, two judges of the Superior Courts may be appointed to go into this matter.

Jayasundara, Secretary/Finance & Planning. 23rd August 2007 CONFIDENTIAL Hon. Attorney General Attorney Generals Department Colombo 12 Dear Sir Alleged VAT Fraud-Department of Inland Revenue Further to the telephone conversation I had with you after my having appearing before the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) which was held on 22.08.2007. As you are aware, I have been constantly in touch with you and your predecessor with regard to the investigations relating to the aforesaid alleged VAT fraud which was referred to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) in mid 2006 by this Ministry, on the instructions of His Excellency the President. This Ministry also commenced related Administrative investigations on the instructions of the then Minister of Finance in early 2005. Then the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (CGIR) having carried out initial investigations over a period of three months submitted his report to me in September 2005, observing that the issue of refunds is a collec-tive activity of a number of officers and as such it is not possible to identify and single-out any individual as being responsible. In one of his reports, the CGIR has named the Deputy Commissioners who certified related refund documents but not identified any specific default on the part of any officer. In view of the complexities involved with this matter associating several parties, including third parties, I was compelled to seek the advise of the Attorney General as to how the investigation should be proceeded with i.e. through a Presidential Commission of Inquiry or in any other au-thoritative form through whom third parties could also be summoned. Futher such advise was considered necessary in the light of the specific charges that were being formulated by the CID inter alia through the examination of relevant officials of the Inland Revenue Department.

Further it is suggested that upon the conclusion of the said inquiry, ap-propriate disciplinary action may be instituted against errant officers as provided for under the Establishments Code. Sgd. C.

In the meantime, as I explained to you over the phone, at the COPA meetings before which I appeared on 21st-22nd August 2007 pertaining to the Inland Revenue Department, a view was expressed that an admin-istrative inquiry should have been preceeded with in terms of the provi-sions of the Establishments Code. Since this is contrary to the under-standing we had in relation to the manner in which this inquiry should be proceeded with having recognized the associated complexities and the seriousness of the allegations, I seek your views as to whether it is advis-able to appoint an inquiring Officer to conduct an inquiry under the Establishments Code. If the CID inquiry has noq been completed, it may be possible to identify officials against whom specific charges could be framed to proceed with and administrative investigation, in addition to the legal proceedings being handled by the Attorney Generals Department. In this case I whould appreciate if you could forward the names of the officials and the possible charges based on which this Ministry could initiate such administrative investigation. I shall be thankful if you could advise me accordingly. Yours faithfully P.B. Jayasundera Secretary to the Treasury Cc: Secretary to the President 12, , 12, .

Jayasundera, Secretary to the Treasury, Ministry of Finance and Planning, The Secretariat, Colombo 01. Alleged vat Fraud-Department of Inland Revenue I refer to your letter dated 23rd August 2007. I wish to inform you that it had been decided to forward an indictment against, the following offi-cers namely, Agampodi Gnanasiri de Soysa Jayatilleke and Ananda Wickramasinghe Ambepitiya along with 12 others on charges of con-spiracy to commit misappropriation and misappropriation of state prop-erty to the value of Rs. 339,600,815.55. In view of the magnitude of this fraud and the serious shortcomings in the procedure pertaining to the refund of VAT in the Department of Inland Revenue and to prevent a recurrence of similar offences in the future, I would suggest that you recommend to His Excellency the Presi-dent to appoint a Commission of Inquiry in terms of the Commissions of Inquiry Act No. 17 of 1948 to investigate the commission of the said fraud and irregularities. This would enable the relevant authorities to ascertain the persons directly and indirectly responsible and also to identify the shortcomings in the procedure that existed in the Department of Inland revenue which would enable the said authorities to make rec-ommendations regarding measures that should be taken to prevent the recurrence of irregularities and frauds of similar nature in future. I also wish to inform you that although the CID has conducted very exhaustive investigations in respect of criminal aspects of this fraud there appear to be several other aspects relating to this fraud and other similar acts that may be necessary to be inquired and investigated. Therefore, I believe that this is a matter that should be left to a Commis-sion of Inquiry to investigate and report as suggested above.

As per my consultation with senior officials responsible for administra-tion of this Ministry and with you, I share the view that in addition to the criminal proceedings being conducted, the appointment of a Presidential Commission of Inquiry is the most prudent step to achieve a credible outcome in view of the complexities involved with this alleged fraud. This is so, inter alia considering the lack of legal mandate to summon outside witnesses in the event of proceeding with an Administrative Inquiry, the Possible implications of the Inland Revenue Act involving secrecy provisions with regard to evidence and the findings informed by the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (CGIR) on the conclusion of the Preliminary Investigations already conducted at Inland Revenue Department level at my request in 2006. It is in this background that I thought it was desirable to appoint a high powered Commission of In-quiry to go into the matters connected. However, if an administrative inquiry is a necessity as insisted by members of the COPA, the only remaining option available to proceed appears to be for myself as the Secretary, Ministry of Finance and Planning to appoint a suitable officer to conduct a fresh Preliminary Investigation in parallel with the inquiry by Presidential Commission. I seek your kind advice in this regard.

Yours faithfully,

I refer to your letter dated 23rd October, 2007.

A Commission of Inquiry has been appointed to inquire in to the above mentioned matter and the mandate of the said Commission covers all aspects of the alleged fraud. Therefore, I am of the opinion that it would not be necessary to hold a domestic inquiry in to the same matter as it would amount to duplicating of the proceedings and also may affect the inquiry by the said Commission.

Dear Sir, ALLEGED VAT FRAUD - DEPARTMENT OF INLAND REVENUE Further to my letter dated 23rd August 2007 and your reply thereto dated 24th August 2007. As advised by you, His Excellency the President appointed a Presidential Commission of Inquiry to probe into this mat-ter. I have been informed that at the request of the Chairman of the said Commission of Inquiry you have already nominated a State Counsel to assist the Commission as provided for in the relevant statute and that work is in progress and scheduled to be completed before April 2008. I am also aware that the related indictment has been served and the criminal case is being heard in the High Court of Colombo on a continu-ous basis to ensure early conclusion. Despite repeated clarifications made to the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) on the above meas-ures so far taken, the members of the COPA at meetings held on 18th and 19th of September 2007, once again insisted that an administrative inquiry should be held in this regard.

As the Government has been continuing to pursue a military solution to the national question of this country, we, as the Representatives of the Tamil people, the Tamil National Alliance, are duty-bound to oppose this Budget. Sir, we have a burning problem. For the last twenty four years, the ethnic conflict has, in fact, escalated into a massive military conflict that has been consuming precious lives of our youth irrespective of the fact whether they belong to the Sinhala community, the Tamil community or for that matter, the Muslim community or any other ethnic community. There needs to be an urgent endevour to find a political solution to this national question. But, what we have found about the Government is that it has been hell-bent on pursuing a military solution regardless of the fact that it is a political question that demands and deserves a political answer, a political resolution through peaceful and meaningful political dialogue. Therefore, Sir, as far as we are concerned, there is no doubt in our minds that we have to perform our national responsibility by opposing this Budget. But, at the same time, Sir, I find that there are shameless efforts on the part of the Government and on the part of the murderous mercenaries operating in the Eastern Province under the leadership of that LTTE renegade, a criminal, who should have been locked up behind bars for very many war crimes. They have abducted three persons, namely two relatives of two of our MPs and the private secretary of another Member of Parliament hailing from the Batticaloa District. This is a shameless and cowardly exercise! Orders have been given from Colombo, we know, from the nerve centre very much closer to the Government, orders have been given to this murderous mercenary, that coward, namely Pillayan, operating in the Batticaloa District to abduct three persons who are very much closer to these three MPs - the Hon. (Miss) Thangeswary Kadirgaman, the Hon P. Ariyanethran and the Hon. Senathirajah Jeyanandamoorthy - in order to see that psychological

3833 3834

pressure is exerted on them and the end result of preventing them from attending the parliamentary sessions today and casting their vote on the Budget according to their conscience is achieved. I repeat, Sir, this is a shameless exercise! At the same time, Sir, we are not concerned about the outcome of the voting. I would like to make it very clear. Whether this Government is defeated or whether it survives is none of our concern. We are concerned firstly and primarily about registering our protest to the whole approach and attitude on the part of this Government in regard to its military pursuit to solve the ethnic question. Secondly, but not of least importance, we, as accredited representatives of our people, would be echoing and re-echoing their sentiments, in that, they are still ready to consider a political solution to the ethnic question within the framework of a united Sri Lanka provided that that solution goes to the extent of satisfying their basic aspirations. Therefore, Mr. Deputy Chairman, the ball is in the court of the Government. There was a golden opportunity that was presented some time back, in the latter part of last year when my good Friend, the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government. But what happened? The Government or for that matter, I am very sorry to state, His Excellency the President has in fact taken the Hon. Leader of the Opposition for a good ride, in the sense that while that Memorandum of Understanding was in force, there were shameless exercises on the part of the Government to entice disillusioned Members from the UNP ranks and having succeeded on that, the Government is today confident that somehow or other it would be able to sail through. But we are not concerned. We are not concerned with the power play. We are not concerned about this ding-dong battle that has been going on between the Government Party and the main Opposition. We are not a party who would be waiting till the last moment to take a decision. We have taken a decision at the very outset in regard to the Budget and there would be no change. There can be no change. This Budget should be opposed. But at the same time, Mr. Deputy Chairman, I would like to state that this country has sacrificed very many thousands of precious lives whether they be Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims or whoever it may. This country has been bleeding for the last 24 years. Still we are concerned about power politics. Still we are concerned about petty character assassinations. I am very shocked to see the charges that have been traded to and fro on the Floor of this august Assembly today, in breaching Parliamentary norms, breaching the noble principles of decency and decorum that should be observed by each and every Member of the House irrespective of party affiliation, there has been an attempt, a common attempt from both sides to sling mud at a very personal level on certain Members of the House. It is very saddening. We should not descend to that level. In the gallery today that is

packed to the capacity, our people, I repeat, our people are watching their elected representatives. Let us not forget that. Mr. Deputy Chairman, we have a duty, we have an onerous duty, we have a national duty irrespective of the party to which we belong to rise to the occasion at least today in order to see that this national question is resolved through a political process. But what has been the response of the Government up to this moment?

( ) (The Deputy Chairman)

, - . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) Sir, I will wind up in two minutes. There is the All Party Conference, a useless exercise. Please, wind it up. In spite of the good intentions of the Hon. Ministers involved in the process, I would say, Mr. Deputy Chairman, please, wind it up. Let the Government in consultation with its constituent parties put forward a political package so that the Tamil people would be able to consider whether on the basis of that package they can build on, they can add on and they can also contribute so that they can ultimately find, through a broad-based national effort,a political solution to this burning issue. Otherwise, Mr. Deputy Chairman, we would have to part ways. There is no way out. It has to be resolved. We cannot pass it on to the succeeding generations. We cannot pass it on to our daughters and sons, to our grandsons and granddaughters because, in the past we have found that political leadership has failed; miserably failed. At least now, though it is late, I call upon all the political forces, all democratic forces of this country, irrespective of whatever may be the outcome of the Vote on the Third Reading of the Budget Debate to consider the question of launching a serious effort, a sincere effort to resolve this problem. Otherwise, I repeat, Mr. Deputy Chairman, we, the Tamil National Alliance would be forced to consider whether we have to withdraw from this House and go back to square one from where we came into this House, that is the question of insisting on our right of self-determination to have a [ .] [ .] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] for our own people on their own homeland. I thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Thank you very much. .
