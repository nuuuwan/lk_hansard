For the Government of the For the Government of Sri Lanka United States of America By: By: Date: 14th March 2007 Date: 14th March 2007 Witnessed: Witnessed: By: By: Annex I -- Terms of Reference Annex II -- USTDA Mandatory Clauses Annex I Terms of Reference Background This technical assistance will support Sri Lanka in the development of oil and gas regulations, and in the establishment of an organizational structure for its regulatory authority. In brief, Sri Lanka seeks to transition from its current consumer driven oil and gas sector regulatory structure to a production-oriented regulatory structure, based on its plans to open up promising offshore oil and gas blocks to exploration and development. Task A Project Preparation and Review 1. The Contractor shall provide a concise statement describing the purpose and objective of this technical assistance project, which is to assist the Government of Sri Lanka in developing a regulatory system for the petroleum industry. 2. In preparing for the project, the Contractor shall review all relevant documents, especially the Petroleum Resources Act of 2003 and the Production Sharing Contract that the Government of Sri Lanka has developed. The Ministry of Petroleum and Petroleum Resources Development (MPPRD) shall provide copies of both documents to the Contractor. 3. The Contractor shall review the MPPRDs current regulatory plans that propose the establishment of a petroleum regulatory regime based on current Newfoundland off shore regulations. The MPPRD shall provide copies of the Newfoundland regulatory documents now in its possession to the Contractor. Task B Preliminary Environmental Analysis of the Project 1. To make sure the Regulator understands the environmental issues involved in oil and gas operations, the Contractor shall provide a preliminary review of the projects anticipated impact on the environment with reference to existing or needed legal and regulatory provisions in Sri Lanka, as well as environmental requirements of international lending institutions. This review shall

2279 2280

3 PL 002286 (2007/07)

identify potentially negative impacts, including the slow erosion of t he environment through small leaks and similar day-by-day neglect as well as catastrophic events such as well blow-outs, deep-water pipeline ruptures and marine tanker collisions, and emergency stand-by plans to deal with them. 2. The regulations to be developed under this project shall include a chapter devoted to environmental protection. This shall include rules and regulations, to be covered in Task D below, aimed at mitigating pollution and preventing catastrophic environmental events. Task C Analysis of Development Impact 1. The Contractor shall report on the potential development impacts of the proposed technical assistance project in Sri Lanka. While the discussion should focus on the immediate impact of the project, the Contractor shall include, where appropriate, any additional developmental benefits, including spin-off and demonstration effects. The Contractors analysis of potential benefits shall be as concrete and detailed as possible. USTDA-mandated specific developmental impact factors are intended to provide the projects decision-makers and interested parties with a broader view of the projects potential effects. The Contractor shall provide estimates of the projects potential benefits in the following areas: 1.1. Infrastructure / Industry. The Contractor shall provide a description of the impact that the recommendations of this technical assistance, if implemented, is likely to have on the regulatory and investment regime that will affect foreign companies participation in the exploration and development of Sri Lankas offshore oil and gas resources. This can be accomplished by referencing the concrete recommendations and providing a logical narrative as to why it can be expected that with the new regulations and investment regime, more foreign oil and gas companies will compete to participate. (Note: Ultimately, the test of whether the technical assistance was effective will be (1) whether the recommendations are adopted and (2) whether more foreign oil and gas companies participated in the development effort. Such subjects, however, are beyond the scope of the contractors work). 1.2. Market-Oriented Reforms. The Contractor shall provide a description of any regulations, laws, or institutional changes that are recommended and the effect they would have if implemented. This should cover the benefits of a regulatory system designed to create stability and inspire confidence in the international petroleum community that the petroleum industry in Sri Lanka rests on a solid legal and regulatory foundation to be relied on by all players. 1.3. Human Capacity Building. 1.3.1. The Contractor shall address the number and types of positions that will need to be filled within the regulatory system, as well as positions that will be created in the regulated industry and beyond, through the regulations to be developed . This will include the number of people who will receive training and a brief description of their training programs. 1.3.2. The Contractor shall use every opportunity in its development work to impact and understanding of the principles of oil and gas regulation. This will involve the participation of government employees in the step-by-step development of the regulations and in expanding the existing organizational structure of the regulatory authority. 1.3.3. Other forms of human capacity building include the seminar on regulations listed in Task D-5 and the seminar on the structural organization of the

regulatory authority listed in Task E-6. Broader versions of these seminars will be presented in the form of electronic slideshow presentations (e.g. Power Point) to high-echelon officials in related Ministries, to oil company officials, and to media and the public as needed. 1.4 Technology Transfer and Productivity Enhancement. The Contractor shall provide a description of advanced technologies that will be implemented as a result of this project. The Contractor shall also provide an overview of the oil companies, and of the many service companies that will follow and shall demonstrate how the development and implementation of a sound regulatory regime will enhance the technological awareness and know-how, as well as the productivity, of the workers in the petroleum industry. 1.5. Enhanced Government Revenue. While it is impossible to provide an exact quantification of the revenues that will accrue to the Government following the successful conclusion of an exploration phase fraught with uncertainties, the Contractor will make an effort to come up with a reasonable estimate of such revenues. This may have to be based on realistic or reasonable assumptions regarding the size of the reservoir or reservoirs to be discovered, their productive capacities, development and production costs, and oil company and government final takes. The Contractor shall demonstrate how the development of a respected regulatory regime contributes to the success of the petroleum-industry development effort and its overall effect of increased government revenues. Task D Development of Oil and Gas Regulations 1. The Contractor shall provide an introductory presentation to the MPPRD and other Government Officials that will offer a broad overview of the issues involved in upstream petroleum regulation. The Contractor shall emphasize the need to design the regulatory system in a way that will assure the efficient and effective administration of Sri Lankas nascent petroleum industry along internationally-recognized norms, and inspire confidence in the international petroleum community regarding transparent and fair transactions with equal rights to all participants 2. Having reviewed the environmental and regulatory aspects of Sri Lankas petroleum situation, and taking into consideration the different types of petroleum production environments (on-shore, off-shore, shallow water, deep water, etc.), the Contractor shall discuss regulatory options and, along with the MPPRD, agree on the type of regulatory regime that will best serve the MPPRDs interest. The MPPRD currently is familiar with the Newfoundland off-shore statutes and regulations. 3. The Contractor shall review the Newfoundland regulations and determine whether and to what extent they should be adapted for use in Sri Lanka. The regulations to be developed include: 3.1. Offshore Petroleum Drilling Operations Regulations; 3.2. Offshore Petroleum Geophysical Operations Regulations; 3.3. Offshore Oil and Gas Operations Regulations; 3.4. Offshore Petroleum Production and Conservation Regulations; 3.5. Offshore Safety and Health Regulations; 3.6. Offshore Environmental Regulations; and 3.7. Other Offshore Regulations as needed. 4. The Newfoundland regulations, if chosen to be emulated, contain the principal data forms the regulatory authority will require to collect the information it needs in the performance of its functions. The Contractor shall prepare data collection forms as needed and include them in a regulatory handbook. 5. Once a draft of oil and gas regulations has been presented to and approved by the MPPRD, the Contractor shall publish a formal oil and gas regulatory handbook, which will become the working tool

2281 2282

of the competent regulatory authority. The Contractor shall use the handbook as the basic instructional material for a formal in-depth seminar to be held over two days for candidates for relevant positions at the proposed regulatory authority. In that seminar, the Contractor shall explain in detail, through lectures and appropriate question-and-answer sessions, the various provisions and the reasons for having them. 6. The Contractor shall engage local expertise to translate the handbook into Sinhalese and Tamil. The Contractor shall assume final editing responsibility for the English, Sinhalese, and Tamil language versions of the handbook. 7. The Contractor shall also develop an electronic slideshow presentation that will highlight the principal provisions of the oil and gas regulations, and shall deliver the presentation in a one-or two-hour seminar to high-ranking Government Officials not directly charged with implementing the regulations, and to interested oil companies. Task E Establishment of Organizational Structure of Regulatory Authority 1. The Contract or shall become familiar with the existing organizational structure of the regulatory authority, as mandated for the top echelons by the Petroleum Resources Act of 2003. During the organizational work, the Contractor shall make every effort to leave that structure intact, limiting its efforts to filling in the organizational details needed to fulfill the diverse functions mandated under the law and developed under Task D above. 2. The Contract or shall take note whether and where conflicts of interest or hierarchical ambiguities exist in the Petroleum Resources Act of 2003 and bring them to the attention of the MPPRD, to deal with as needed. 3. The Government has developed an internal organizational structure at the lower echelons. The Contractor shall review that structure and scrutinize it for adequacy in terms of size and regulatory reach and compatibility with the recommended regulations developed pursuant to Task D above. The Contractor shall identify any gaps in the organizational structure and discuss suggested changes or additions with the MPPRD. 4. The Contractor shall develop a draft report reflecting the proposed organizational structure. In addition to the regulatory functions discussed above, the draft report shall also address staffing issues including staffing levels and staff qualifications for individual offices, tenure for senior officials, specific authorities and responsibilities attached to proposed offices, etc. The overall structure of the regulatory authority shall be laid out in a detailed organizational diagram. 5. Whether the regulatory agency should be an independent agency (as the U.S. Federal Regulatory Commission is) or part of a cabinet-level Ministry (as the Minerals Management Service under the U.S. Department of the Interior is) shall be discussed in detail in the draft report. The Contract shall discuss the merits of each option, and make an appropriate recommendation for Sri Lanka. 6. Following review and approval by the MPPRD regarding the organizational structure draft report, the Contractor shall have that report bound, to be used as the official internal organizational handbook of the regulatory authority. The handbook shall serve as instructional material in a one-day seminar to be offered by the Contractor to future employees of the regulatory authority. 7. The Contractor shall engage local expertise to translate the handbook into Sinhalese and Tamil, and shall assume final editing responsibility for the English, Sinhalese, and Tamil language versions of the handbook. 8. The Contractor shall also develop an electronic slideshow presentation that provides highlights of the organizational handbook, and shall deliver the presentation on one-or two-hour

seminars to relevant higher-echelon government officials in related government positions such as the Ministry of Finance and Planning, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Internal Administration, Ministry of Justice and Law Reform, and others.

Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi was totally unwarranted and irregular. Therefore, the Magistrate should be summoned before Parliament, is what the Hon. Leader of the Opposition said the day the Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi was arrested because it was an arrest of a Member of Parliament without a reason. . . [ ]

(The Hon. P. Radhakrishnan - Deputy Minister of Vocational Training) Hon. Deputy Speaker, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to take part in the Debate on the extension of Emergency. At the outset let me thank and express my gratitude to His Excellency the President for appointing a Committee to monitor the investigation into abductions and disappearances. Since the commencement of the work of this Committee, 12 cases have been reported to this Committee and it has been taking speedy action. In one instance, I think the abductors or the people who were demanding ransom have been identified and taken into custody. At this moment through the initiative of His Excellency the President, I believe things have been brought under control. I take this opportunity to congratulate the Inspector-General of Police for arresting Gajanayake, an ex-Air Force person who is the kingpin behind the abductions for ransom. Two Sub Inspectors also have been taken into custody along with eight others. It has come to light that some persons from the Defence are also involved in this. This is the grievance that the Tamils have always been complaining. The police as well as persons from the Defence were involved in these abductions and thereby they have been able to travel throughout the country scot-free. These people have brought discredit, they are the black sheep in these Forces. Ninety-nine point nine per cent of the Forces are good people. They do their duty. The Armed Forces do their duty in the war front. The police of course has to give security to the innocent man which they have been doing. But these black sheep in these Forces, that is in the Police and the Army, have brought discredit and disrepute not only to the Department they serve but also to the Government. We have been repeatedly telling this in the past. At least I am happy that these people have now been brought to book. I appeal to the Inspector-General of Police that they should not give in to any pressure or anything like that. They must investigate impartially and bring to book these people and all others involved in these abductions and disappearances. This issue has been a thorn in the flesh. The investigation should be expedited and they should be punished. I wish there had been the Arabian system of punishing where you take these people to a public place and stone them to death. They deserve this punishment because they have brought unnecessary problems to the country, to the Government and to His Excellency the President. This is the plight today. The tears shed by the relatives of the abducted people will not go in vain. I appeal to the abductors again; still there are people -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! Will an hon. Member propose that the Hon. Dimuthu Bandara Abayakoon do take the Chair ? . . ( )

( () . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W. A. Wiswa Warnapala- Minister of Higher Education) I propose that the Hon. Dimuthu Bandara Abayakoon do now take the Chair. , . . Question put, and agreed to. , .

, , . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair and THE HON. DIMUTHU BANDARA ABAYAKOON took the Chair. . ( . ) (The Hon. P. Radhakrishnan) Hon. Presiding Member, I shall continue my speech. This inquiry should be expedited and the culprits brought to book. The relatives of the abducted people are undergoing misery. I appeal again to the abductors - I think some of these people according to the information available or according to what we understand from the media and so on - are either in Weli Oya or in the Eastern Province - to treat these people as humans and release them. There is one Mr. Sriskandarajah who had been abducted about six months back and still the family is crying day and night. His business has also crashed. One of our own Members, Mr. Sivakanthan who had been abducted on the 23rd of August 2006 is still missing. We appeal to these people who are holding them to release them. I also suggest that the Government should consider giving some relief to the people paid the ransom. There are business houses which have gone broke after paying ransom. They have mortgaged their houses, they have sold their property and paid the ransom. I hear Gajanayake has accumulated millions and millions of rupees. So, what was this money? Their property should be confiscated. The entire property of the people who have got involved in abduction and detention should be confiscated. The Government should seriously look into this and thereby put an end to this misery. Let the Government do its work. Let the Forces do their work. Let the police personnel do their work legitimately. If somebody is doing something wrong they should be legitimately arrested and brought before justice. On the other hand, war can never bring peace. Our party, the Upcountry Peoples Front is always against war. We do not pursue war. We do not support war. There must be dialogue. Peace should be brought about. I think violence should be stopped by all sides, not only the

2371 2372

[ . ]

2373 2374

forces but everybody involved in it should cease violence and find a solution to this ongoing problem. We can really bring peace through Buddhas way. Most people in this country believe in Buddhism. Whatever Lord Buddha has preached we have not put into practice. If we practice what Lord Buddha has preached, definitely this country can achieve peace, not only peace but there cannot be any problem. The very little I know about Buddhism - [Interruption.] I do not know. I am talking about Buddhism. If we really practice this religion word to word there cannot be any problem. As I know, Lord Buddha always said, "give". "No violence at all". Therefore, I urge everybody in this august Assembly to follow Buddhism and to practice what Lord Buddha has preached so that we can have a very peaceful country where everybody can live happily and in harmony. Sir, there are a lot of detainees in the Boosa camp and TID. It includes Tamils from the North and East as well as from the plantation sector. We have never objected to the arresting of people. But the only thing I have been repeatedly asking is to expedite the investigations and release those innocent. There are so many people. Some of these people are the breadwinners of the family. So the family is undergoing untold hardships.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, your time is over. Please wind up. .

( . ) (The Hon. P. Radhakrishnan) Therefore, I urge the authorities to expedite the inquiries of these people who are detained. There is one more matter. Today, we represent the people in the plantation sector. The cost of living has sky-rocketed. The Government should do something to bring down the cost of living. The kerosene oil which people in the plantation sector use is very expensive. It has gone up by Rs. 16 a litre. They are unable to make ends meet. All this misery can be eliminated if we can bring a solution to the ethnic problem and stop the war so that our country would be the most prosperous country in the South Asian Region. We can be far better than all the neighbouring countries but unfortunately we are not able to live as brethren in the same country; we are not able to understand each other and we are not able to live in harmony. This is a very pathetic situation, Sir. Therefore, we must strive hard; all the Members of this House should strive hard to bring in peace so that everybody can live in peace. When peace is achieved, definitely the cost of living will go down by at least 40 per cent. Therefore, let us all get together and strive for peace. Let us reach for peace the Buddhas way. Thank you.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Thank you. . . [..12.58] . .

( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala) . The extension of Emergency is a constitutional ritual which we are performing monthly in this House. Therefore, I would like to make use of this opportunity to raise a couple of pertinent issues relating to terrorism in this country. The greatest danger facing Sri Lanka is terrorism, a form of terrorism with international ramifications. Today, terrorism is an international phenomenon and the modern state has been threatened by this menace. All states, both big and small, have to fight against terrorism in order to maintain law and order in the given territory of the particular state. Therefore, defence is one of the fundamental aspects of the modern states and all states therefore, have to take various measures for that matter, effective measures to defend its own territory. In that sense, Mr. Presiding Member, security has now become an important function for the State. Normal laws are not enough to tackle terrorist problems or to tackle terrorism. Extraordinary or special kind of laws like the state of Emergency which we are discussing today are necessary to eliminate the threat to security within a State. Since September 11,2001 incident even major developed States like the United States have taken extraordinary measures to maintain security within the State. You will see for instance immediately after September 11th incidents in New York and Washington, the United States took special measures to strengthen homeland security and now legislation has been enacted to ensure security of the State. In Britain three important pieces of legislation were enacted. They are as follows : Terrorism Act of 2000, Anti-terrorism Crime and Security Act of 2001 and the latest one was Prevention of Terrorism Act of 2005. These Acts provide for new offences relating to speech which might be construed as encouraging terrorism, other broad offences concerning training grounds for proscription and extension of detention without trial. A person could be kept in detention without trial for 28 days. Initially, the suggestion was to detain a person for 90 days but it has been given up and now a person could be kept in detention for 28 days. Most countries want to strengthen their security systems with a view to combatting, with a view to controlling the terrorist organization like the LTTE. We know that all terrorist

2007 05 2375 2376

6 PL 002286 (2007/07)

organizations throughout the world, organizations like the LTTE and the al-Qaeda, are fascist-oriented organizations engaged in absolute violence, destruction and anarchy. For instance, the record of the LTTE in the last 20 years amply demonstrates that they are the most dangerous, most sophisticated fascist-oriented terrorist organization in the modern world. Fascism, Sir, in any of its forms, in any of its manifestations is the doctrine of nihilism. Total anarchy, total destruction is the philosophic base of fascism. It is the philosophy of absolute and total destruction of a society and the LTTE is now engaged in total destruction of the society. All such terrorist organizations all over the world are engaged in such acts of violence. They have invented the technique of suicide terrorism. Since 1990, suicide terrorism has become a kind of world phenomenon and this has not only threatened State security around the world, but has also become a reason for major international concern. Small terrorist groups have resorted to suicide tactics as a means of inflicting both material and psychological damage to the State structure. I would like to ask the question, "Which is the State that can tolerate this"? At present, 17 terrorist groups make use of this weapon - the suicide terrorism - in 14 different countries. It was the LTTE which perfected suicide bombing as a weapon of war. Suicide terrorism is aimed at causing devastating physical damage, which in turn inflicts profound fear and anxiety upon an unsuspecting people. Sri Lanka is one country which has experienced a very large number of suicide operations. The LTTE has carried out more suicide operations or more suicide attacks than all the other groups in the world. It was in 1987 that they began to train suicide cadres and since then the LTTE has carried out 240 attacks and killed more than 1,500 people. Most of the victims were innocent civilians and the members of the security forces. We all must realize that it is not easy to counter suicide terrorism. Today this has become one of the most complicated and difficult aspects of counter-terrorism. I mentioned all these details in order to show that this is the nature of the terrorist outfit of the LTTE. Sri Lanka is fighting the most sophisticated terrorist outfit in the world and our patriotic defence forces have done a commendable job; they have done an excellent job. Since the September 11 incident in the USA, there is a global coalition against this menace, this phenomenon of terrorism and the international community, instead of talking of human rights violations, should help the countries afflicted with terrorism to destroy terrorism. Any State in the world in the context of international terrorism, goes into a crisis. The Sri Lankan State has gone into a crisis. In such a context, it is not easy to protect rights and civil liberties. They need to be curtailed in the larger interest of the society. Certain liberties and certain individual freedoms have to be curtailed in the

larger interest of the society. Today there is such a discussion on the rights of the people. I would like to pose the question, what are rights of which we are talking so much? The rights, according to Harold Laski, are those conditions which an individual needs to realize his best personality in a given society. Rights are conditions which an individual requires to realize his best personality. How can the State protect the rights of the individual when the very existence of the State is threatened by organized violence? That is the question which needs to be posed. This is what needs to be realized by those champions of human rights. What about the flagrant violations of rights of the individuals by terrorist organizations?

( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala) Okay. I have one more point to make. What did Mr. Gordon Brown, the new Prime Minister of Britain, say as soon as he took over power? He said that the security of the State is fundamental. That is what Mr. Gordon Brown said - the security of the State is fundamental. In other words, he stated that no terrorist organization should be allowed to threaten the very existence of the State. Liberties have to be curtailed in the larger interest of the society. It is in this context that one has to look at the Opposition - my good Friend, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella is here - primarily, the role of the Opposition. Traditionally, Sri Lanka has had a responsible parliamentary Opposition. Now the question has arisen whether the present Opposition is that responsible and that responsive. The Opposition in Sri Lanka is a multi-party Opposition with low internal unity. The multi-party charactered Opposition has given it a new dimension. The Opposition instead of playing the role of a very effective, responsible Opposition, is playing the role of an utterly irresponsible Opposition guided primarily by political opportunism. In a democracy, the Opposition

2377 2378

[ . . ]

should wait till its turn comes to topple the Government at the General Election. That is the tradition in all parliamentary democracies. The Opposition in Sri Lanka despite its internal disunity, which manifests disunity, is in a hurry to capture power. I do not blame my good Friend, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella. The Leader of the Opposition with a view to enlisting support goes all over the world and our Government, which still commands legitimacy, is criticized. But he has the right to criticize; nobody denies that. This is not the function of an Opposition in a parliamentary democracy. With regard to the role and function of the Leader of the Opposition, I would like to produce a quotation - with that I would finish - from Robert Dahl, from his work titled Political Oppositions in Western Democracies. This is what Robert Dahl says with regard to the role of the Leader of the Opposition. It states, I quote: The leaders of Opposition have responsibilities not to damage the security of the State. Mark the words: The leaders of Opposition have responsibilities not to damage the security of the State and other public interests in their criticism of government. The role of the Opposition, particularly the role of its Leader was such that every statement of his, both here and abroad, has damaged the security of the Sri Lankan State. Thank you.
