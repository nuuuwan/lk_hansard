Court assembled for hearing on 17.10.2007 at 10.30 a.m. The above petitions presented in terms of Article 121(1) of the Constitution were taken up before this Court and considered together since the gorunds of constitutionality in respect of the Bill are common. The Petitioners challenge the content of Clauses 5 and 6 of the Bill. The basis is that, the provisions of these Clauses are inconsistent with Article 148 and the connected Articles of the Constitution that provide for full control of public finance by Parliament. It was submitted that the impugned provisions detract from Parliamentary control amounting to an abdication of power by Parliament. It would be convenient to first deal with the submissions as to clause 6. This clause provides that any money allocated to Recurrent Expenditure or Capital Expenditure under the Development Activities Programme appearing under the Head Department of National Budget may be transferred to any other Programme under any other Head by Order of the Secretary to the Treasury or any other officer authorized by him. It further provides that the money so transferred shall be deemed to have been covered by a supplementary estimate submitted by the appropriate Minister. A similar caluse had been contained in all preceding years commencing from the Appropriation Act No. 44 of 2003. In that Act Section 5(3) provided for the transfer from the Public Resources Management Program appearing under the Head Department of National Budget to any other Programme under any other Head by Order of the Secretary to Treasury. The money so transferred was deemed to have been covered by a supplementary estimate. Identical provision was contained in the Appropriation Act No. 15 of 2004 as Section 5(3). In the Appropriation Act No.39 of 2005 the identical provision was Section 6. The Appropriation Act No.47 of 2006 provided for a transfer from the Development Activities Programme as in the present Bill instead of a transfer From the Public Resources Management Programme specified in the Acts of 2003, 2004 and 2005. This is only a change of nomenclature and not a budgetary innovation of any significance. The crux of the submissions of the Petitioners is that by this provision the Secretary to the Treasury is vested with an unfettered discretion to transfer funds voted for Development Activities to meet expenditure under other Programmes and Heads. That, if there is unexpected additional expenditure under any other Head and Programme, the proper procedure would be for a supplementary estimate to be presented to Parliament for withdrawal from the Consolidated Fund in terms of

1713 1714

Article 150(2) of the Constitution or to establish a Contingencies Fund in terms of Article 151 to provide for urgent and unforeseen expenditure. It was further submitted in particular that the final sentence in clause 6, which reads as : The money so transferred shall be deemed to have been covered by a supplementary estimate submitted by the appropriate Minister Is an abdication of Parliamentary control. The Additional Solicitor General submitted that there is no abdication of Parliamentary control of public finance, since money could be transferred by the Secretary to the Treasury in terms of Clause 6, only dependent on the amount voted by Parliament for Development Activities (Head 240 - Department of National Budget - Programme 2). He submitted that the amount would be voted in terms of Rule 131 of the Standing Orders after a specific consideration of the budged expenditure under the Programme. In doing so a Committee of the whole Parliament would in terms of the Standing Orders take cognizance and deliberate not only whether the amount appearing under the Programme of Development Activities should be approved but also take cognizance of the fact that the Secretary to the Treasury is authorized in terms of the principal Clause to transfer any sum under that Programme to meet expenditure under any other Head and Programme. On this basis it was submitted that the vesting discretaion by Parliament in the Secretary to the Treasury would only be after due and proper consideration and cannot amount to an abdication of Parliamentary control of public finance as contended by the Petitioners. It was further submitted that in any event the amount so transferred by the Secretary to the Treasury would be to meet expenditure under any other Head and Programme already included in the Appropriation Bill. In answer to this contention Counsel for the Petitioners submitted that there should be included in the Clause 6 a specific reservation as in Clause 7 that such transfer by the Secretary to the Treasury should only be for the purpose of meeting authorized expenditure The submissions of Counsel focus on the allocation for Recurrent and Capital expenditure to the Ministry of Finance and Planning. The immediate responsibility of meeting unexpected expenditure under other Heads and Programmes would finally rest on the Department of National Budget. In this context it appears that from the year 2003 a budgetary method has been adopted in which a relatively large sum is allocated under the Head Department of National Budget with an attendant reduction under other Heads and at times a further cut proposed by the Minister to balance the Budget, on the premise that urgent and immediate excess expenditure under other Heads be met by a transfer from the Head, Department of National Budget. The submission of Addl. Solicitor General is that such action is necessary in view of the volatile state of the countrys financial position resulting from a variety of factors, including the escalating defence expenditure caused by the war, steeply rising oil prices, inflation and an unfavourable balance of payments situation resulting in the downward trend of the Rupee vis - a - vis other currencies. We have to accept the submissions of the Additional Solicitor General as to the context in which Parliament has passed into law clauses to the same effect consistently from the year 2003 onwards. The volatile situation may not provide the space and time for a supplementary estimate and the machinery of Government could otherwise come to a halt. A degree of flexibility may therefore be necessary as contended. We are also inclined to agree with the submissions of the Additional Solicitor General that the establishment of a Contingencies Fund to meet urgent and unforeseen expenditure as envisaged by Article 151 is farfetched in the current fiscal context plainly due to a lack of resources. The sentence referred to above in Clause 6, which drew much criticism by the Petitioners provides that the money transferred shall be deemed to have been covered by a supplementary estimate submitted by the appropriate Minister. This provision is necessary in our view to ensure accountability by the officer who is actually responsible for the expenditure. In any event the expenditure would be subject to audit and the Auditor General would report on the matter to Parliament in terms of Article 154 of the Constitution.

A qualification as in Clause 7 that the transfer should be to meet authorized expenditure cannot be included. The transfer to meet authorized expenditure is covered by Clause 5(1). The provision that the transfer in terms of Clause 6 is deemed to be a supplementary estimate connotes that it is not intended to cover authorize expenditure. The qualification suggested could therefore be a contradiction in terms. Our attention has also been drawn to the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act No.3 of 2003. The Act provides for extensive Parliamentary supervision of the fiscal position at different stages. Section 7 provides for the Budget Economic and Fiscal Position Report to be tabled in Parliament in respect of each year when the Appropriation Bill is taken up for the second reading. The object of this requirement is to provide information to Parliament for the evaluation of the governments fiscal performance as against the strategy which had been previously laid down. Section 10 provides for a Mid-Year Fiscal Position Report by the end of June in the current year. In terms of Section 12 this Report should contain a statement of estimated and actual expenditure of the first four months. Section 13 requires Final Budget Position Report to cover the entire year In terms of Section 15(a) this Report should contain a statement of the estimated and actual expenditure and Section 15(2) requires reasons to be stated for any deviations from the estimates. It is thus seen that although a discretion is vested by Clause 6 in the Secretary to the Treasury to transfer money voted under Head 240 of the Department of National Budget to meet expenditure under any other Head and Program, any such transfer could come within the purview of the Parliament pursuant to the reporting mechanisms as contained in the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act No.3 of 2003. Thus the vesting of discretion in the Secretary to the Treasury from the year 2003 as noted above, has been matched by the reporting mechanisms introduced to ensure Fiscal Management Responsibility from the same year. In the circumstances Clause 6 would not in our view be inconsistent with Article 148 of the Constitution and the connected Articles, since the Parliament finally retains full control of public finance not only in the matter of allocation of expenditure but also by supervision of the actual expenditure for which there is adequate legislative provision in Article 154 of the Constitution and the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act No. 3 of 2003. All the Reports presented to Parliament under the said Act have not been produced in Court. There is no requirement to do so. But we note that in the Reports submitted there is no specific reference to the transfers made by the Secretary, in terms of Sections 5(3) or 6 of the previous Appropriation Acts. It is not feasible or permissible for this Court to go into the matter of accounting to ascertain the actual transfers as contended by the Petitioner appearing in person. We have to restrict our review to the area of constitutionality. But, considering the severe criticism made, we have to observe that for purposes of ensuring transparency and prudential financial management, the transfers made in terms of Clause 6 that are deemed to be supplementary estimates should be specifically included in the relevant reports submitted in terms of the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act No. 3 of 2003, with reasons for the particular deviation. The challenge in respect of Clause 5(1) also relate to the authority vested in the Secretary to the Treasury. The first part of Clause 5(1) provides for a transfer of unexpended money allocated to Recurrent Expenditure in any Programme, to meet Capital Expenditure in that Programme. This is a blanket authority which can be exercised by the Accounting Officer in respect of that Head. The second part of the Clause permits transfer of any unexpended allocation for Recurrent Expenditure to meet Recurrent Expenditure or the Capital Expenditure under any other Programme within the Head by order of the Secretary to the Treasury or any other officer authorized by him. Similar provisions had been included in all preceding appropriation accounts referred to above.

2007 06 1715 1716

The submission of Counsel was that although such transfer may be necessary, the vesting of authority only in the Secretary to the Treasury in this regard would be unconstitutional and that there should be specific provision for the Secretarys power to be exercised in consultation with or on the recommendation of the Secretary of the appropriate Ministry in respect of which the transfer is made. It appears that this submission is made without taking into account the ordinary administrative procedure. In practice the Secretary to the Treasury would necessarily act on the basis of a request for such transfer by the Accounting Officer of the particular Head of expenditure. In the absence of such a request the Secretary to the Treasury would have no basis or reason to make an order for transfer as empowered in Clause 5(1). It was further submitted that an officer who may be authorized by the Secretary to the Treasury to make such order should be from amongst officers to be specified in the Clause. In this regard to have to observe that the Secretary to the Treasury would finally be responsible for the order and he would delegate this power only to an officer of suitable standing. Counsel did not pin point any particular provision of the Constitution in relation to which Clause 5(1) could be held to be inconsistent. The submissions were made based on the need to introduce sufficient guidelines and limitations that would apply to the exercise of power by the Secretary to the Treasury. We have to note that these are matters of inveterate practice in the Treasury. We are unable to agree with the submission that there is now a need to ignore the well accepted norms as to administrative procedure and to introduce additional guidelines and limitations. Accordingly we see no merit in the submissions made in respect of Clause 5(1) of the Bill. For the reasons stated above we make a determination in terms of Article 123 of the Constitution that the above Bill is not inconsistent with the Constitution. We wish to however note the observation stated above that any transfer made from the Development Activities Program, in terms of Clause 6 to any other Programme under any other Head by order of the Secretary to the Treasury should be specifically included in the respective Reports submitted in terms of Fiscal Management Responsibility Act No.3 of 2003 with reasons for such deviation.

* : Statement tabled Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On Sri Lanka U. S. SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY Contact : Office of Senator Leahy, 202-224-4242 VERMONT Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On Sri Lanka November 2, 2007 MR. LEAHY, Mr. President, it has been a little over a year since I last spoke in this chamber about the fragile peace process in Sri Lanka. I want to take a moment to discuss the situation today, because in the past year we have seen human rights in that small island nation steadily deteriorate. I also want to correct some confusion that may have occurred as a result of statements reported in the press regarding the

Senates action in connection with the Fiscal Year 2008 State, Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. That bill passed the Senate by a vote of 81 to 12 on September 6, 2007, and we are waiting to begin conference discussions with the House of Representatives. Over the years, I have been a strong supporter of U.S. Sri Lankan relations. A good friend, Ambassador James Spain, served there, and the American people acted quickly to provide emergency assistance for Sri Lanka after the December 2004 tsunami devastated Sri Lankas east, north and southern coasts, claiming tens of thousands of lives. Beyond that, we have long supported the Sri Lankan governments efforts to respond to acts of terrorism by the LTTE, which has been designated by the Department of State and the European Union as a foreign terrorist organization because of its attacks against civilians, assassinations of political leaders, forced recruitment of children, and other crimes. We deplore these tactics. However, we are also aware that the LTTE has, at times, shown a willingness to participate in serious negotiations, as well as to respond to human rights concerns. These overtures should be pursued. We also recognize that the LTTE should not be equated with the Tamil community. There are many ethnic Tamils living in and outside of Sri Lanka who do not condone acts of violence and terrorism against civilians. Many have been victims of the LTTE themselves. At the same time, our aid to the Sri Lankan government is not a blank check. We have been mcreasingly concerned with reports of abuses by Sri Lankan government forces - not from the LTTE or their supporters as some have inaccurately claimed, but from the United Nations, the Department of State, and international human rights organizations. These reports are not disinformation or misinformation as some Sri Lankan officials have alleged. Rather, they contain specific, documented, consistent information including a steady increase in serious human rights violations by both Sri Lankan government forces and the LTTE since the collapse of the ceasefire. While the first acts of aggression were attributed to the LTTE, these reports also implicate government forces in attacks on civilians, extrajudicial executions, torture, and forced disappearances. There is also evidence that Sri Lankan government forces have stood by while paramilitary organizations have carried out abuses, including forcibly recruiting child soldiers. With few exceptions, the Sri Lankan government has yet to bring the perpetrators, including member of government security forces, to justice. It is important to note that the Sri Lankan governments respect for human rights and rule of law has deteriorated even outside conflict-affected areas. The Millennium Challenge Corporation suspended more than $ 11 million intended for Sri Lanka because of the deteriorating security situation and the governments worsening performance on human rights. Freedom House, whose assessments of political rights and civil liberties are factored into the Millennium Challenge Corporations analysis stated The serious human rights abuses and excessive restrictions on freedom of speech and association by the government of Sri Lanka merit the countrys removal from a list of eligible recipients for U.S. Millennium Challenge Account assistance. We want to see a Millennium Challenge compact for Sri Lanka, but these problems must first be recognized and effectively addressed. An international human rights field presence, under the auspices of the United Nations, could do much to improve the situation. Given the gravity and scale of the violations witnessed in Sri Lanka, and particularly the inability of the Sri Lankan government to monitor the abuses taking place in areas held by the LTTE, such a presence would help protect lives, document abuses by all sides, and support the government and civil society in protecting the civilian population. The Department of State has publicly endorsed such a role for the United Nations. It is due to this information, from reputable sources, that the Senate attached three conditions to our assistance to the Sri Lankan military in the Fiscal Year 2008 State, Foreign Operations. Appropriations bill. Anyone who reviews those conditions should agree that they are reasonable and appropriate. They would require the Sri Lankan government to be bringing to justice members of the military who have been credibly alleged to have committed gross violations of human

1757 1758

[ ]

rights; end unreasonable restrictions on access in the country by humanitarian organizations and journalists ; and agree to the establishment of a field presence of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Sri Lanka. It is regrettable that rather than explain why the Sri Lankan government should not meet such reasonable standards when it is seeking millions of dollars in U.S. taxpayer assistance, some Sri Lankan officials have attacked our motives and falsely attributed our actions to LTTE propaganda. Others have insisted that they are meeting these standards already, when the facts clearly indicate that for more needs to be done. We want Sri Lanka to succeed in stopping terrorism, and we recognize that military force can be necessary against terrorists tactics. But there is no military to the Sri Lankan conflict, which has dragged on for more that two decades. Thousands of innocent people, Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims, have been killed. More than 1,000 are reported to have disappeared in just the past twelve to eighteen months, and many more before that. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been displaced by the fighting. Families on both sides of the conflict have suffered terribly, and the country remains divided and no closer to peace. Every time a Sri Lankan soldier violates international humanitarian law it alienates the very people in the Tamil community whose support the government needs to combat terrorism. Our country has experienced a similar problem in Iraq, where killings of civilians have hurt our mission, tarnished our image and weakened the support of our allies. Mr. President, I would hope that the Sri Lankan government would see our action for what it is. We want to help, but not unconditionally. I believe the United stated could and should play a more active role, with other key partners, in helping to facilitate negotiations on a political settlement. But rhetoric about human rights and the appointment of ineffectual commissions of inquiry that have no credibility, only goes so far. The situation remains grave and those responsible for abuses are rarely punished, making a peace agreement more difficult to achieve. A field presence of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, with sufficient mandate and capability to conduct full and unfettered monitoring throughout the country, communicate its findings to all sides of the conflict and the public, and provide advice and technical assistance, is overdue. Also urgently needed is greater access for humanitarian organizations to assist civilians caught in the cross-fire and for journalists to report the facts. The Sri Lankan people have suffered the consequences of ethnic discrimination, violence and injustice for the better part of their countrys history. We cannot solve Sri Lankas conflict ; only the Sri Lankan people can. But we can and want to continue helping if the government demonstrated that it takes our concerns seriously.

. , about Senator Leahy's amendment to the Senate Appropriation Bill. I will respond to you, Hon. Member. In terms of Senator Leahys amendment, there are three areas that they have been concerned about. Senator Leahy, as much as our Members in this House, can raise matters of interest. This is a belated issue. This is a matter that has come up sometime back and they have cited Leahys amendment as the position of an individual Senator. It is not the position of the Government of the United States of America. It is the position of an individual Senator making an amendment to the Senate Appropriation Bill. In Senator Leahys amendment there are three areas of concern. The first is, Sri Lankas military is suspending human rights and the Sri Lankan Government has yet to bring to justice members of the military. That is, we are not bringing to justice the offenders of the military. The second is, the Sri Lankan Government has not provided unimpeded access to the humanitarian organizations to visit Tamil areas in the country. The third is, the Sri Lankan Government has to establish field presence of the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. These are the three areas that we are now responding to. We have said that and we have explained this position. As the Government of Sri Lanka, we have taken steps and I have set up a special unit, a Committee headed by the Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to address these issues on a weekly basis along with several other agencies and Line Ministries of the Government of Sri Lanka because we want to be very transparent; there is nothing to hide. We have been able to strike at Tamilselvan right inside the den in which he had been living or from where they had been operating their military communications, and we

6 PL 002592 (2007/11)

1813 1814

[ ]

say that we did hit them. Why should we hide that? Even if we do not say that, an SMS will communicate it to the whole world. With todays technology all these happenings that are taking place in Sri Lanka will go to the whole world. As the Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka I have said this to the world at large. They will get the message from Sri Lanka with clarity and also with responsibility and credibility. That is how we are trying to articulate our position. As much as this very Senator Leahy can state these concerns, I will cite a statement of a Congressman from the Congressional Record of the United States of America on 8th December, 2006. Now what does the Member of the Congress, Scott Garrett say? He states, I quote: "The Sri Lankan government gives every indication that it is committed to a peaceful settlement to this conflict within their nations borders. Even after an attempt on the life of Defence Secretary Rajapaksa, the Presidents brother, the Government refuses to institute an outright ban on the Tamil Tigers. Norwegian peace negotiators, who had presided over the current cease-fire agreements, continue their efforts to bring the LTTE to the peace table but, unfortunately, Tiger leader Prabhakaran has called for a full resumption of hostilities. The Government is ready to accept the Tigers as a peaceful political party but not as a purveyor of violence. . ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, you will have to conclude your speech.

FEDERATION OF BATTICALO DISATRICT MOSQUES AND MUSLIM INSTITUTIONS OFFICE : Main Street, Kattankudy, Sri Lanka. Tel : 065-2246603. 065-2257600 Ref No.: Date : 06.11.2007 Hon. Mr. Ameer Ali M. P. Minister of Disaster Relief service 189, Galle Road, Colombo 03. REQUEST FOR RESOLUTION TO THE FOLLOWING ISSUES OF BATTICALOA DISTRICT MUSLIMS It was found to be habitual the Tamil militants are of threat to the normalcy and peace living of Muslims community of Batticaloa District for the last two decades. In the past thousands of innocent Muslims were the victims of abduction, murders, intimidation, and extortion. The civilian death toll is very high in recent times they continue to display callous disregard for the innocent lives of Muslim civilians. In addition, the ransom paid to them for the safe release of abducted victims is very high. Moreover, they cause serious damages to our economy as well. In this regard, our negotiations with the armed groups by state officials, Religious Leaders, Foreign Peace Keepers, International Community and host of other organizations proved futile. No viable solution reached until now, especially, display of callous and intimidation on Muslim civil society makes to strengthen the culture of impunity and the environment of silence and fear. It is at its peak only during the period of truce. In this context on 2007.10.30 a youth named M. C. M. Riyal of Mavadichenai, Valaichenai on his way back home from Batticaloa on his motor bicycle, was abducted together with his bike, between the regions sittandy & Kiran around 06.55 pm. The lack of any credible response to our complaints to State Forces, Tamil Militant Groups, Religious Leaders proves the absence of avenue for justice and redress within the country on this issue -
