Soysa, Senior Assistant Secretary of the Ministry of Education with the approval of the Public Service Commission; (iii) when she called at the school concerned to assume duties on 29.04.2005, assignment of duties was rejected on the ground that the said letter was a false document; (iv) although, the officials of the School Development Society had made complaints to the then Minister of Education, the former President; the Secretary of Education and to the Director of National Schools, no inquiry has been conducted by the Ministry?

The world oil prices have been increased by 267% since 1995. (b) (i) Since the Government has adjusted the fuel prices by five times during the year 2004 in line with increasing international oil prices, hence the statement in B(i) cannot be accepted. (ii) Fuel subsidy scheme has been abolished by the Government with effect from 30th June,2005. At present CPC is adjusting the domestic fuel prices according to the international oil prices. However, Kerosene which is being sold around Rs. 14/- less than the comparative international oil prices in line with the Government policy to protect the poorest sector of the community.

, Government spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella on Thursday said that reports about internally displaced persons in the Eastern Province as a result of the military conflicts going on were highly exaggerated. . " " . . ' .

He was referring to those who had crossed over to Government controlled areas from areas under LTTE control. Some reports said that the number of internally displaced persons, (IDPs) amounted to 200,000 whereas the actual number was around 52,447 and they were being resettled in the areas from which they had fled, .. ; . ; . , ? . , . "The Sunday Leader" - - , Rambukwella, the Government spokesman quite obviously quoted the statistics .. . ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , . . . ( . . ) (The Hon. M. K. Eelaventhan)

. However, is the issue one about statistics? Arthur Koestler, one of the best known writers of the last century remarked: Statistics do not bleed. Also apt is the remark of American humorist Mark Twain: Lies, damn lies and statistics. " , ; ; . . , . , . , . . . , . .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) 3 , . - [ ] 30 , . , , , , . , , . I table* the Agreement signed between Mihin Air and the BOI dated 13th of October, 2006. During the last Debate I did mention that there was an incorporation of a company. It was incorporated within three days, sent to the BOI and within 24 hours this company got the approval. I will refer to the project operated intentions of the company. In that they say that the investors are the Secretary, Ministry of Defence, the Commander, Sri Lanka Air Force, the Secretary, Ministry of Finance and Mr. Sajin de Vass Gunawardane, Presidents office. They also say that the cost of the project is a fixed capital of Rs. 2,596 million. That is Rs. 2.56 billion. It is stated as US Dollars 25 million here. The working capital is Rs. 1,020 million making a total of Rs. 3,616 million, equivalent to US Dollars 36 million. They also say that the project financing share capital is Rs. 3,616 million. * . * . * Produced at end of speech. 7 - PL 001910 - (2007/ 03)

2289 2290

So, Sir, you would see that the capital going to be brought into this company is Rs. 3,616 million - [Interruption]. Mr. Deputy Speaker, I would appreciate if this House is made relatively free to speak, otherwise our minds get distracted. This has become a standard joke in Parliament. They also say that the Bandaranaike International Airport is the operational base and the office is at the West Tower of the World Trade Centre. With regard to employment, there is going to be a capacity for almost 400 people at the commencement which will be in three months. Then we asked a question relating to this, the answer was, There is no Cabinet approval obtained. There is no supplementary estimate nor is there any allocation from the Budget. On the 3rd of March, we read in the newspapers that there was a test flight of Mihin Air which went from Colombo to Trivandrum. The first flight was cancelled owing to technical reasons and the second flight took off in the night with certain officials who were forced into this. Sir, the Department of Civil Aviation which is subject to international scrutiny has basically a certain work chart sheet that needs to be followed. That means, there are certain steps that need to be followed. Here is an application that comes to the Department of Civil Aviation on the 28th of December, 2006. In that it is very clearly mandated that any aircraft getting civil aviation approval in this country needs to have an aircraft either owned or on dry lease. This aircraft was hired from Expo Air. Expo Air has given this Fokker aircraft which is 26 years old. The Civil Aviation Authority which is subjected to international scrutiny says that no aircraft older than 20 years is air worthy. Mihin Air got the approval from the Department of Civil Aviation violating that condition, took a sub-contracted aircraft which is 25 years old and got the approval within one day.

I also table* an article which appeared in the "Daily News" of 15th March 2007.

This appeared in many newspapers, but I thought I will refer to your government-owned mouthpiece. The "Daily News" of 15th March, 2007 shows a picture of the airbus 320 with the Mihin Air logo which has arrived in this country.

Now, Hon. Deputy Speaker, we are asking this House, and the Minister of Finance needs to answer it, if money is not allocated through the Budget, if money is not allocated through a supplementary estimate and if there was no Cabinet approval, how was this expenditure met? This is not Rs. 25,000. This is US Dollars 25 million. How were they able to get an aircraft on wet least terms and obtain approval in this country?

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) This is where misuse of public property comes in. I have another two minutes, Sir.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) No, you have taken the five minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) This is where the misuse of public property comes in. What action is going to be taken against these officials? This is what has got to be looked at. All what you would do is, make a big political noise, make headlines and deadlines and at the end of the day nothing seems to be happening. Our poor, innocent citizens in this country are paying for every sinful act. We, in this House are able to speak on behalf of them. But there is an attempt to even stymie and stifle us from doing this. We, in this House ask you to please listen to what we say rather than jump like a jack-in-the-box. We say something that is of national importance. If such monies are spent without approval, if this is the type of thing that is going on, what is the purpose of bringing amendments to the Finance Act or the Goods and Services Act? What action is the Minister of Finance taking? We brought in the EPF, the ETF and the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment. All of them who are significant contributors to the share capital have said that not a single cent has gone into the capital of this company. If that is the case, how has the aircraft been brought into this country? How has the staff been recruited? How have the advertisements been published? How have the wet leases and the dry leases been signed by this company? Who are these shareholders? Remember, Government officials are subject to Parliament scrutiny. All of them are collectively and individually held responsible and we want the Ministry of Finance to give us a reasonable answer as to how such misuse of public funds is taking place. On one side you are trying to harass Members of Parliament who are vocal, who are open and critical of the Government. If they are subjected to harassment, what is this daylight robbery that is taking place? That is what we ask this House?
