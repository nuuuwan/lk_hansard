: , EXPLORATION OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESOURCES IN SRI LANKA : STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF PETROLEUM AND PETROLEUM RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT

. -. . ( )

( . . . - , ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie - Minister of Petroleum and Petroleum Resources Development) Mr. Speaker, I wish to draw your kind attention to the statement made by the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa, Member of Parliament, on 6th November, 2007 with regard to oil exploration in the territorial waters of Sri Lanka. In his statement serious allegations were levelled against us. I state that all those allegations are baseless, sometimes malicious, false and facts distorted. Hence, at the outset, I totally dismiss all of them. I am sorry that he chose to make a slander on Dr. Neil R. De Silva describing him as an economy killer who came to Sri Lanka to facilitate the companies of the West to loot Sri Lankas oil resources. It is unfair to attack an officer who is defenceless in this House. Dr. Neil R. De Silva came to be engaged as the Director-General of the Petroleum Resources Development Secretariat by due process of selection. At

2007 13 533 534

the very inception of the Ministry of Petroleum and Petroleum Resources Development, we had no expertise in oil exploration. When we called for applications for the post of Director-General of the Petroleum Resources Development Secretariat through the internet, we received 58 applications and out of them 15 were shortlisted as suitably qualified candidates. Among them, three applicants including Dr. De Silva were found to have been born in Sri Lanka and had later acquired foreign citizenship. All three of them were screened by an Interview Board consisting of professionals. Dr. De Silva had secured 98 out of 100 marks at this interview and was selected as the most suitable person for the post. Everything was done in the most transparent manner. I table* the result sheet of the interview along with the biodata of Dr. De Silva. Since his appointment on 5th May, 2006 he strived hard to establish the Petroleum Resources Development Secretariat and has made progress up to the level of calling international tenders for oil exploration. Prelude to the calling of tenders, the model Petroleum Resources Agreement was prepared and the fiscal terms were incorporated taking into consideration the domestic tax laws and the international accepted norms and related fiscal conditions. It is our responsibility to act in a manner which could attract investors and to bring maximum benefits to the country. The bidder should specifically mention in the tender documents the amount to be paid at the stage of signing of agreement which is called, signature bonus and the production bonus to be paid at the commencement of production which is called, production bonus. Based on the assessment of total production, oil companies should pay 10 per cent royalty to the Government of Sri Lanka. Bidders have the legitimate right to recover the expenditure incurred on oil exploration, development and production activities out of the production income. But this too is restricted by the condition that the tenderers should indicate the expected annual percentages to be deducted specifically in their tenders. The profit-sharing of oil and natural gas means the profit-sharing between the contractor and the Government of Sri Lanka based on investment multiples. Tenderers should clearly indicate in their tenders regarding the profit-sharing investment multiples according to specified income ranges. The tenderers should include in their tender that they would provide facilities to the Sri Lanka National Oil Company to collaborate a minimum of 10 per cent

investment in oil exploration, development and production activities. Action is being taken to set up this National Oil Company. The profit earned by this Company will be fully owned by the Government of Sri Lanka. Besides all this, the contractor should pay 35 per cent of income tax on petroleum profit and 10 per cent of dividend remittance tax as per the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act. In addition, other general conditions in accordance with other laws of the country have been included after studying internationally accepted production-sharing contracts. The company that makes the best offer will be considered as the successful bidder. Mr. Speaker, you will therefore see that the statement made by the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa that Sri Lanka will only own 10 per cent of petroleum revenue is based on misconception. It is an accepted practice in this industry to conduct road shows in major cities of the world which are famous for this industry. Someone could perceive the word Road Show as an event taking place publicly on a road or on a highway. This is not such a thing. This is an event in the nature of conferences and discussions usually held in hotels which are famous for arranging meetings for the petroleum sector. We have entrusted this responsibility of conducting these road shows to Fugro Data Solutions Private Limited which was selected after a tender was called. We have not received or been granted any financial assistance from any country or institution for this purpose. The entire expenses were borne by the Treasury and not by the Americans as stated by the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa. Mr. Speaker, I also wish to emphasize the fact that whatever decisions we make with regard to oil exploration, they have to be made only within the scope of legal procedures. The Petroleum Resources Development Committee established under the Petroleum Resources Development Act, No. 26 of 2006 has been progressing successfully. When making decisions on oil exploration, we have kept other important committees informed of and their advice has been obtained. Even at the Consultative Committee in my Ministry, I have openly invited all the Members of Parliament to discuss this matter. Moreover, at the National Economic Council Meetings chaired by His Excellency the President, all important matters related to oil exploration were discussed and instructions and directions are being received. All those who participated at these meetings know that we have given our maximum co-operation. In addition to this, I arranged a presentation by the Director-General, PRDS to bring awareness among all the Members of Parliament. Despite my efforts, the participation was very poor. Among the participants, the majority were JVP Members of Parliament who extended their support to carry forward the good work we have been doing. I have come to know through the media that an Association called the Association for Protection of Petroleum Resources in Sri Lanka has been formed. No

sooner I saw this I summoned the Members of Parliament, the Hon. Bimal Ratnayake and the Hon. Lalkantha who give leadership to this Association, to my office and a discussion was arranged. At this discussion, I very openly answered to all the queries that were raised. At many occasions, I have given discussions to trade unions who have shown interest in oil exploration in the country. I have openly answered their problems and queries. There are crafty opportunists who have realized future oil explorations as a treasure of wealth, as well as those who pretend to show themselves as genius, are trying to execute their hidden agendas in a crafty manner. I would now answer the questions raised by the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa. At the outset, I would categorize them into two parts. The first is, expressing his own opinion and conclusion. The second is, submitting specific charges. I respect his right to express opinions and to come to conclusions as it is a democratic right as explained by French Theologian Voltaire. However, I have no alternative but to dismiss them with sympathy if his opinion has been based on falsehood, fictitious, childish, vicious, malicious short-sightedness and part of a hidden agenda and unacceptable negative arguments. While I welcome constructive criticism as a blessing, I consider destructive criticism as a curse. I totally reject the allegation that the United States of America made a payment of US Dollars 450 million through the Fugro company for conducting the road show in London, Houston and Kuala Lumpur. I also reject as a false allegation that 200 oil exploration companies have already submitted tenders. I reject his allegation that after 10 per cent production share is given to the Government of Sri Lanka, the remaining 90 per cent will be enjoyed by the oil exploring company. In fact, maximum advantages to Sri Lanka have been incorporated in the Agreement. I further reject as false, the statement that the US Government has granted US Dollars 65 million to set up an establishment to regulate petroleum trade. I totally reject the statement that decisions relating to petroleum resources were made by His Excellency the President, the Government, Dr. Neil R. De Silva and the Minister. This is totally false. Decisions are made in conformity with the existing laws of the land and in consultation with the Petroleum Resources Development Committee as well as the Parliamentary Consultative Committee. I further reject the statement that fraudulent activities in oil exploration aimed at fattening their purse have been carried on by some persons.

I reject the statement as false that action has been taken to treacherously sell the Sri Lanka petroleum resources to America and the Western imperialist countries. I reject as totally false that Dr. Neil R. De Silva is an economy killer who came to Sri Lanka to facilitate the foreigners to loot Sri Lankan petroleum resources. Hon. Speaker, I table* all the documentary proofs to confirm what I have stated in my speech. That is my cultured way of life as a responsible Member of Parliament, senior Minister and a senior politician. It is my duty too. I cannot make baseless statements merely because there are words in the language, and I have a mouth to speak out. Furthermore, I earnestly and strongly request the Member of Parliament, the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa to forward to this House and table all true and genuine documents to prove the facts, opinions, inferences and the charges he has made in his statement. I have a great respect and gratitude for the Member of Parliament, the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa for his valuable mission carried out at the last Presidential Election which contributed to the victory of His Excellency the President. However, we cannot accept his statements with full of false allegations as it is. The United States of America is a friendly country to Sri Lanka. As in other fields, in this field too, their assistance is given in good faith. We will accept them with gratitude. At this moment, I state with responsibility that we have received benevolent assistance from the US Ambassador and the USTDA. I am particularly grateful to His Excellency Mr. Robert O' Blake the Ambassador of the USA who, accepting my invitation, came and addressed the US investors and told them that there is no threat for investors in Sri Lanka. I also thank the USTDA in this regard. Mr. Speaker, having explained in clear terms the true position regarding the oil exploration I wish to table* my entire speech in Sinhala and English as time does not permit me to make the full speech. I have also submitted the relevant documents and Cabinet Papers to prove what I have stated. I am sorry that I am unable to produce a Tamil version of my speech for which I apologize to the Tamil-speaking Members of this House. However, I will make it available soon. Finally, I wish to state that highest level of transparency has been observed so far with regard to oil exploration and let me say we have nothing to hide. I wish to assure the

Members of this House that even the oil exploration tender will be selected based on the evaluation of their offers to the highest advantage of our country and there is good time until the end of January 2008 to close tenders. Hon. Speaker, firstly I must thank you for giving me this opportunity. My special thanks go to the Member of Parliament, Hon. Wimal Weerawansa, for providing me this special opportunity to inform this House the mission carried out by my Ministry under my leadership. I thank all of you for patiently hearing my speech and I also expect all media institutions to give my speech too, the same publicity that was given to the statement of the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa, Member of Parliament. . , . . [ ]

Chidambaram on 25th September, 2007, refers to the oil crisis as the biggest crisis. I quote excerpts of his speech from the "India News" of October 2007: ...The price of crude oil is an enormous external risk. Since these outrageous prices cannot be fully passed through to the consumers in India, the burden falls largely on the domestic budget and constrains our capacity for investment. The depreciation of the value of the dollar vis-a-vis the rupee has thrown up an unexpected downside risk: it has challenged our exports and our tax revenues, and we may find ourselves in a situation where we need to provide for the consequences of an appreciating currency. . . , . , , "" . , , , .

And whereas the newspaper reports state that passport bearing No. D 1944260 has been fraudulently issued by the Sri Lanka Foreign Ministry in the fictitious name of Kokila Dushmantha Gunawardene. And whereas it is also reported that the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry had sent a Third Person Note to the British High Commission recommending a visa for the said Gunawardene to attend Climate Change Conference in Britain. And whereas the reports go on to further state that Gunawardene was falsely represented by the Foreign Ministry to be the Director-General of the Wildlife Conservation Department and that his departure from the Katunayake International Airport was further facilitated by a very senior official of the Sri Lanka Airport and Aviation Authority. And whereas these reports in the newspapers disclose that officials of the Government of Sri Lanka have deliberately engaged in several fraudulent acts even on previous occasions. And whereas if it is true, this conduct will bring disrepute to Sri Lanka and will cast serious doubts on our credibility as a member of the international community. This House requests the Government to make a statement setting out the correct position with regard to these reports."

( - ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila - Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs) Hon. Deputy Speaker, today, various wild and unfounded allegations have been made by the Hon. John Amaratunga added on by the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella who has gone into a flight of fancy very specially not only in this Adjournment Motion but also as reported in some English and Tamil newspapers. I do not intend to reply to all these allegations because I consider it beneath the dignity of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to even respond to wild allegations like this. But going to the meat of the allegations, let me tell you Hon. Member, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has no authority to issue any passports. That, a grade five student also will know. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) That, we know. ( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila ) But what have you said?

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) The Ministry has a right to recommend for a - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila ) But that is not what you have said. What are you talking? Are you talking from the backside? The competent authority to - [Interruption.] I never disturbed you Hon. Member - [Interruption.] But what you have said is different. ( ) (An Hon. Member) This is what you call "baila".

( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila ) Everybody knows that the competent authority to issue passports is the Controller of Immigration and Emigration - [Interruption.] But what you have said is that the Foreign Ministry has issued it. The Foreign Ministry is not entitled to issue passports. What is a Third Person Note? You have said that it is a Third Person Note. It is a formal mode of communication between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a Diplomatic Mission here or our Diplomatic Mission and the host country. That is a TPN. In the Ministry records there is nothing to indicate that the Ministry has issued a TPN requesting the British High Commission to issue a visa to Kokila Dushmantha Gunawardene - [Interruption.] That also is not there. You said that we have made false representations and brought the country into disrepute. Accordingly, that does not arise even by innuendo. This is what you have said. I categorically deny it. - [Interruption.] Of course, I am unaware; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is unaware of a senior official of the Sri Lanka Airports and Aviation Authority facilitating the departure of the said Kokila Dushmantha Gunawardene. I do not intend to respond to any of the other wild allegations made by the former Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs during whose term of three years, we know how the Foreign Ministry worked. I do not intend to respond to him at this moment. Anyway, once again let me thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker for giving me this opportunity to respond to a storm in a tea cup. Thank you. , . . Question put, and agreed to.
