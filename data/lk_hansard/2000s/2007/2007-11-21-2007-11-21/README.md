APPROPRIATION BILL, 2008 - [ : 20] [ .] . - [ : 20 ][ .] Considered further in Committee. - [Progress: November 20 ] [MR. SPEAKER in the Chair.] ( ) (The Chairman) . . . [.. 10.15] . . ( ) ( . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala- Minister of Higher Education) Mr. Chairman, at just before the adjournment of the Debate yesterday, I was on the innovative role of the

2007 21 199 200

Executive Presidency. I referred to the way in which His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa has strengthened the office of the Presidency. Within a period of two years where he has been in power or has been in office as the Head of the State, Head of the Executive and Head of the Government and the Commander-in-Chief, he has displayed his ability and capacity in providing proper leadership to all these roles in this sphere of Government; all roles associated with the powerful Executive Presidency. He, unlike others, did not show arrogance in exercising political power. This is a matter which needs to be emphasized. He has been exercising political power with utmost humility and this is a unique character of our President because he is one who has his feet on the ground. As the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, he has given commendable leadership about which we can be proud of for a process through which he proposes to protect and safeguard the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the Sri Lankan State. The institution of the Presidency is such that it has been endowed with enormous power. It is a very powerful political institution in this country. It is an all-powerful institution of Government and it, because of the nature and organization of its power, needs advisers. In the American system, we see a number of advisers and advisory councils associated with the all-powerful American Presidency and in the same way our President, because of the nature of responsibility in governance, needs advisers. I know that a good set of advisers representing different walks of life have been appointed to advise him on all areas of governmental activities. In the last two years the Opposition, primarily the United National Party and a section of the media began criticizing His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksas brothers. They went to the extent of describing it as the "Company of Brothers". This kind of criticism has been made to slander His Excellency the President. In this country, slandering of politicians, Mr. Chairman, has become an occupation for certain individuals. In all political systems, especially in the systems in developing countries, the closest advisers of leaders come from people who are close to their families. This is a phenomenon in most third world political systems. Mr. Jawaharlal Nehru, for instance, made use of Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit. She was the UN Representative during that particular period. Mrs. Indira Gandhi made use of Sanjay Gandhi and Arun Nehru. Mr. John F. Kennedy made use of Robert Kennedy. Mr. J.R. Jayewardene made use of Mr. H.W. Jayewardene and Mrs. Bandaranaike made use of Dr. Mackie Ratwatte and Mr. Felix Dias Bandaranaike. They were all competent men who could advise the ruler; who could advise the political leadership of that period. These are people who are very close to the top. If there are competent men, if there are

experienced people who could advise and tender proper advice, they need to be made use of. I would like to mention Kautilya, in his celebrated Arthashastra referring to the ancient polity, spoke of advisers. Machiavelli in his famous work "The Prince" referred to advisers and Mr. J. R. Jayewardene in his initial Constitutional proposals which he submitted before the introduction of the 1978 Constitution recommended the appointment of special advisers more in the nature of a super Cabinet. This is the general background. Therefore, what I want to say is, all leaders need confidential advisers and this has been the trend from ancient times. That is why I referred to Kautilyas "Arthashastra" and Machiavellis "The Prince". If the UNP comes into power they would do the same thing. They would appoint a set of advisers in whom they can place total and absolute reliance and the UNP in its initial period was more known as the "uncle-nephew party" because the UNP began as a party composed of closest relatives. I do not want to refer to my good Friends of the JVP but I would like to request them to read the editorial under the heading "Bogus patriots unmasked" in "The Island" newspaper of yesterday. That is the only reference I would like to make to my good, learned, young and idealistic Friends of the JVP. Now, yet another criticism is that the size of the Cabinet is unwieldy. This is another criticism which has been made by the UNP in the last several years. It has been made by my good Friends in the JVP as well. Sir, these critics have forgotten the fact that there were 91 Ministers. Of course, all of them were not in the Cabinet during the time of the United National Party regime. Today, it has swelled into 100, largely because of the impact of the proportional representation on our political system and the need to accommodate smaller political parties has become a major reason for the increase in the size of the Cabinet. What we need to do, Mr. Chairman, is to change the electoral system which, in my view, has become the major source of political and parliamentary instability in this country. People are waiting for a change in the electoral system. There is so much of support in the country for the abolition of the Proportional Representation system. The Select Committee headed by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena with the expert assistance of the Commissioner of Elections has done a good bit of work and its Report should be implemented early in the national interests of this country. For that matter, no third world country can develop economically under the existing system of representation. The type of political leadership which it produces, both at the local government level and at the national level is such that deterioration of standards of political behaviour is entirely and absolutely due to the Proportional Representation system. I am sure the Hon. Speaker knows this. This country can never achieve political stability. It can never achieve parliamentary stability under this system of representation. The Commissioner of Elections, Mr. Dayananda Dissanayake who, in my view, is an able

201 202

[ . . ]

and dedicated Commissioner of Elections says that this Proportional Representation system is the primary reason for political and parliamentary instability in this country. There are 15 institutions which come directly under the purview of His Excellency the President. I do not propose to refer to all of them since there is not much time. There are important institutions such as the Institute of Policy Studies, the National Education Commission, the National Research Council and the Salaries and Cadres Commission. The Institute of Policy Studies which is now functioning under two distinguished Economists, Prof. Buddhadasa Hewavitharana and Dr. Saman Kelegama, is a think-tank engaged in providing advice on economic and social policy. The Institute of Policy Studies, since its inception was initially under the leadership of Dr. Gamini Corea, a distinguished, internationally reputed Economist, has done enough research in the area of economic and social policy. The National Education Commission, which functions under my good learned Friend, my former colleague Prof. A. V. Suraweera, is the apex organization engaged in the formulation of educational policy. This Institution in fact is the key policy-formulation body in the sphere of education and they have provided us with the relevant guidelines for the formulation of an educational policy for this country. In the sphere of higher education with which I am associated, we propose to formulate a development-oriented higher education policy on the basis of the guidelines provided by the National Education Commission. Prof. A. V. Suraweera and his colleagues have done a good bit of work in the last two years with a view to formulating a new development-oriented higher education policy. The Salaries and Cadres Commission, Mr. Chairman, has been set up for the purpose of formulating a national wages policy and a salaries policy. This is a major requirement for a country which is engaged in development and the country, in my view, needs a comprehensive wages and salaries policy. It is only through such a policy that ad hoc and unrealistic salary increases could be avoided in this country. His Excellency the President needs to be commended for appointing a Salaries and Cadres Commission consisting of distinguished public personalities and they, in my view, are doing an excellent job. You need to have brave and honest men to tackle decisions on such burning issues. Yet another innovation, Mr. Chairman, which His Excellency the President made was the creation of the National Research Council and its purpose was to co-ordinate and facilitate research in the country. It has a programme to produce 500 PhDs within a certain time frame. In my view, Sir, this Research Council could provide leadership to a research programme which, in the end, could help in the acceleration of the social and economic development of this country. Since Parliament comes within this Vote, Sir, you need to give me two to three minutes to mention one or two matters. I would like to refer to some parliamentary

institutions. Several instruments of parliamentary control traditionally recognized as effective instruments have not been properly used in this House for the last several years. Take for instance the Question time - we saw what happened in the morning - which is an effective weapon in the hands of a Member of Parliament. What is the purpose of raising a Question, Mr. Chairman? The purpose is to obtain information and press for action and it should not be in effect, a short speech or a short debate. Today a debate took place and all the Members in the Opposition were participating in the Question time oriented debate with which they are overturning the procedure in this House. Today the Question time in this House has been converted into a mini-debate and the procedure relating to it has been totally and absolutely overturned. Sir, Ivor Jennings once said, "A Question has to be short and simple". A Question in the House of Commons is a matter between the Minister and a Member of Parliament. Once the original Question is asked, it becomes the possession of the House. The Members have an automatic right to put the supplementary questions and according to our Standing Orders three supplementary questions can be raised. Today, I nearly ten supplementary questions were raised and they were allowed. Unfortunately, it is not adhered to and as a result, the time of the House is wasted. Sir, the time of this House is very precious and it should not be wasted. The Select Committee on Procedure of the House of Commons chaired by Mr. Richard Crossman, one of the leading scholars of Britain wrote a very powerful introduction to Walter Bagehots "The English Constitution". During the years 1964 to 1965, Richard Crossman called upon the Members to restrict the length of their Questions and Answers and to respect the Rules of Order relating to supplementary questions. The procedure in the House of Commons is that, if the Ministers answer is unsatisfactory, the Member who asked the question has the opportunity to put the second supplementary question. The Question time should not interfere with the Business of the Day. In this House, it interferes practically everyday. Today, Question time interferes with the Business of the Day and this must be avoided.

( ) (The Chairman) , .

. . ( . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala) Okay, Sir. The cardinal principle which needs to govern the Question time is, brief Questions and short Answers. This is the cardinal principle on which Questions need to be asked. Sir, give me one more minute. The Adjournment hour too has been misused in this House. The Adjournment hour is there to discuss matters of urgent public importance. Statements also

2007 21 203 204

in the right direction with the right perception and vision on major issues affecting the lives of the people. We have the political will to undertake this process of change in the country. In conclusion, I would like to pay a tribute to the Prime Minister, the Hon. Ratnasiri Wickramanayake for his effective role in the office of the Prime Minister. He, like the President, has his feet on the ground and understands the aspirations of the people. He has given full expression to the role of the Prime Minister. Under his leadership, the office of the Prime Minister has become a dignified institution of Government in this country. [.. 10.31] ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne) , 2008 , . . , . . . - - .

could be made in the House on such matters with the permission of the Speaker. Today trivial issues, absolutely trivial issues, which are parochial in character, which are provincial in character, which are regional in character are used during this hour. This has to be restricted in order to preserve the Standing Orders of this House. A Member can raise an urgent matter at short notice and it is provided in the Standing Orders. Members can ask leave to move an Adjournment, to call attention of the House to a definite matter of urgent public importance. It is at the discretion of the Hon. Speaker to consider the urgency and allow an immediate debate. In the House of Commons, the phrase, Definite matters of Urgent Public Importance has come to acquire a special significance. In Sri Lanka, it has not been properly interpreted, and all sundry issues, which are not of public importance are discussed during the Adjournment hour. This should undergo a change because we need to establish good traditions of parliamentary government.

There is yet another matter on which the Opposition has been making wild allegations. In the Budget, there was this provision or the proposal to set up a Project Management Department to ensure direct supervision of the preparation and implementation of various agreements. This has been set up in the Ministry of Finance, and the interpretation has been that this strengthens the hand of His Excellency in the management of administrative affairs. Similar co-ordinating mechanisms are found in established Presidential systems. In my view, this is a co-ordinating mechanism consisting of experts, and this would facilitate better co-ordination, and overall supervision of all projects. It is a form of Presidential administrative leadership like in the United States. There is nothing wrong in such a co-ordinating mechanism.

The President, in the last two years, has shown his capacity for effective political and administrative leadership, and he, with popular acceptance among the masses of this country, has emerged as a leader with a charismatic quality of leadership. He has emerged as a leader with a unique charisma of his own and this means that he still commands massive acceptance among the masses of this country. This is primarily because of the fact that he is providing effective leadership to a process of economic and social change, a key aspect of which is the protection of sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. The President, through a wide variety of development programmes which come under the purview of Nation Building, has provided leadership to an experiment in social democracy, the basis of which is the removal of social and economic inequalities in society.

The Opposition, consisting of three main political parties with different points of view on major national issues of the day, can make serious allegations; that is their role though it is a divided Opposition. The Government, in the given scenario, is determined to move

( )

( - , ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe - Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights) Sir, I would like to touch on just two or three issues in the brief time that is available to me. Sir, there was a news report giving quite prominent publicity in the front pages of several English newspapers today that the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Serious Violations of Human Rights established by His Excellency the President is unable to start its public inquiries as a result of the amendments to the Commissions of Inquiry Act passed by Cabinet, and ruled as being consistent with the Constitution by the Supreme Court, not being brought before Parliament. I want to make it quite clear, Sir, through you, to the House as well as to be reported by the media that this amendment is now ready to be taken up by Parliament as soon as the Budget Debate is over. In fact, we wanted to bring it before the Budget Debate. But, unfortunately time did not permit us to do so. The Supreme Court has ruled favourably. Mr. Speaker has made the announcement to this House. Now, it is just a question of time that would permit us to bring it before the House and get the support of all those who are concerned to ensure that this Commissions of Inquiry Act is further strengthened to discharge its mandate comprehensively. So, commitment is very evident. It is now just a question of bringing it before Parliament and getting it adopted. I express the hope that this could be done in January when we meet after the Budget Debate. Sir, I also want to state for the record that the Commission of Inquiry has been meeting progressively now for over a year. They have been doing some solid work. This is an independent Commission of Inquiry appointed by His Excellency the President. No one either within the country or internationally has ever questioned the integrity, the impartiality, the stature and the eminence of the people whom His Excellency the President has appointed for this very important Commission of Inquiry. We have also put in place a very unique structure which can be the best practice, I think, anywhere in the world. We have sourced 11 eminent persons from international human rights arenas, forums and lawyers of eminence to observe the proceedings of the Commission of Inquiry and ensure that in their inquiry and investigative process, the minimum international standards are being met and adhered to. The IIGEP, as we call it, has also been observing the Commission of Inquiry and reporting very independently on how they have seen the Commission of Inquiry proceeding. I also want to very confidently state that our end objective, of course, Sir, is to ensure that the 16 cases the Commission of Inquiry is charged with by His Excellency

the President to look into and report, will be concluded comprehensively so that the culprits who are responsible for these very gruesome and unforgivable acts of violence and human rights violations will be brought to book and dealt with within the law of the country. I also want to, Sir, very quickly state for the record that there is a perception, especially internationally that the national Human Rights Commission which comes under His Excellency the President, has put into place personalities, at least the Commissioners by executive authority, stifling the independent mechanism which is in place under the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution, to recommend for appointment eminent and suitable persons to man these independent commissions. Sir, now the national Human Rights Commission is an unfortunate experience really in the context that the President had to intervene. He had no choice at all, but to intervene and appoint eminent and suitable persons to be Commissioners of the national Human Rights Commission as a result of the Constitutional Council not meeting to discharge its mandate. Sir, now, we all know that the Constitutional Council was unable to meet not as a result of the Government stifling the meeting of the Constitutional Council deliberately by using its powers, but as a result of smaller parties not being able to agree among themselves as to who should be nominated as their representative, so that the Constitutional Council can meet and start discharging their obligations and their mandate. As a result, there is a perception which has been created internationally; unfortunately, that the Presidents appointments to the national Human Rights Commission has not been done properly and therefore the national Human Rights Commission should not be supported. Sir, as the Minister of Human Rights whenever I go overseas and speak to those people, as I told you a little while ago, I have always maintained that the President had no other option, but to intervene and appoint these eminent persons and also had to look at it in the context of not personalities, but to protect, nurture and strengthen an institution which has been put into place in this country by legislation enacted by this very Parliament. This is not an ad hoc body. This is a body which has been put into place since 1997. It is 10 years since it has been put into place and those who believe in protecting and promoting human rights in this country must not look at personalities but at the institution proper and then support if they really want to help build capacity in this national institution. Now this is another thing, Sir, which we have had to put forward when certain sections of the international community - I must be very clear when I say certain sections - I mean, international non-governmental organizations who have been calling for international monitors to come to Sri Lanka. Some have been calling for a UN mission to come to Sri Lanka and others have been calling for an office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to be established in this country. We have

221 222

categorically and very clearly said, No to these kinds of pressure tactics and these kinds of requests because truly and objectively, we do not feel that the situation warrants that kind of extreme measure. What we have in turn asked these people to do, Sir, is to help us to build capacity and give us the technical co-operation to strengthen our independent institutions to do the job. If we have strong, vibrant and independent national institutions set up in this country, then the call for all these foreign monitors and missions to come here will no longer be there. It will not be valid. So therefore, what is important for us, is to resolve as a Parliament without division, to ensure that the Select Committee Report will be presented shortly. I must say incidentally, Sir, the Select Committee was established as a result of a Motion that I brought in as the Minister of Human Rights to this very Parliament. It was adopted unanimously. The Select Committee has been meeting under the Chairmanship of the Minister, the Hon. Dew Gunasekara. The Interim Report is out. When the Report proper is presented to this Parliament, we must adopt it and ensure that the Constitutional Council is put into place, to ensure that the appointments are made to these independent Commissions, so that national institutions will be set up, functioning in an independent, strong and vibrant manner to discharge the mandate given to them, so that all these calling for international monitors and Office of the High Commission for Human Rights will no longer be valid. Finally, Sir, very quickly, I want to also state for the record that the draft Witness and Victims Protection Bill is now before the Legal Draftsman. The final touches are being put to it. I was told that in the next two to three weeks it will come before the Cabinet. The Cabinet will then naturally have to adopt it. It will go as an urgent Bill. The Cabinet has already taken a decision that this Bill should be an urgent one. It will go as an urgent Bill before the Supreme Court and within 72 hours, judgment will be given, which will be announced in Parliament and hopefully early next year this Bill will come before Parliament. It will be co-sponsored by my Ministry and the Ministry of Justice and that will ensure, Sir, that the investigations on alleged human rights violations will be conducted in a very much more efficient manner with public co-operation because the commitment of our Government is not to tolerate these kinds of incidents but to ensure that clean, independent, impartial and objective investigations are conducted and the culprits responsible for these kinds of acts are brought to book. Thank you very much, Sir. [..11.36] . .
