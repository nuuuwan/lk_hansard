( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, because you had made a reference to the party also, I thought I should say a few words. Both you and I belong to the United National Party and we are proud that a Member of our party sits there as the Speaker. When you sit there as the Speaker, you are not only looking after the UNP. You are the guardian of the powers of this House overseeing how the Government and the Opposition, the different political parties conduct business. So having said that, I think I have made our position and my position very clear. The Chief Opposition Whip raised an issue that certain Items have not been included in the Order Paper. We are not expecting them to be taken up today. Today was set aside for Votes of Condolence. But the Order Paper must contain everything that has to be taken up in the future. On these five Items, there was a common Second Reading Debate and then the Voting took place on the Finance (Amendment) Bill (No. 256). I would not refer to that issue immediately. Thereafter, you had the other four Bills - the Finance (Amendment) Bill (No. 257), the Regional Infrastructure Development Levy (Amendment) Bill, the Excise (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Bill and the Special Commodity Levy Bill. Now in regard to the Finance (Amendment) Bill (No. 257), none of us were opposed to it. But we cannot say that it was passed because there was no Committee Stage. None of us were going to oppose it. I think everyone in the House agreed that they would pass the Finance (Amendment) Bill (No. 257). But there was no Committee Stage. Therefore, despite the fact that we were not opposing it, we cannot say that the Finance (Amendment) Bill (No.257) has been passed due to the lack of a Committee Stage. That is why I think he raised the issue with regard to Items 2, 3, 4 and 5. Those are Bills, if put to Vote, could be corrected; you could start off from the Committee Stage and go ahead. Then in regard to the Finance ( Amendment ) Bill (No. 256), we have made our position clear. If the issue comes up, I will address the House on that. But in regard to the Finance (Amendment) Bill (No. 257) to which all the parties agreed, there was no Committee Stage. Therefore, we have not proceeded beyond that and it is not law. I did not see a Committee Stage taking place for the other Bills also. It is very unfortunate as to what happened here yesterday and I think we all regret it. As a result of that we could not conclude the issues relating to the Bill (No. 256). But certainly in regard to the Finance (Amendment) Bill (No. 257) also, you could not go beyond a certain step if the first step had been taken. With regard to the other Bills also, I certainly did not witness any similar steps of the Committee Stage here in the House because the situation in the House was impossible for the Committee Stage to take place at that time. So those are the Bills that have to be on the Order Paper and could be brought up and disposed of. I cannot say that we are going to support all the Bills. But there

2007 07 2573 2574

was one which the UNP certainly was not going to oppose; we were going to support it and I think the same applied for the other parties. So I thought if you can clear up those positions, we can take up the other one which is the Finance (Amendment) Bill (No. 256). ( ) (Mr. Speaker) - ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) , . . 224 - - . , . . " , " . . - - . , -106 81 ,- . , " , , , , " . , . 81 - - , , , , " " , . , , . . , " , " . , . . , .. Items 31, , . Items , .. . . ..

. . , , , , , , ? ; . . . ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, firstly Items 2 to 5 are matters that had to be put up for voting in the Committee Stage. You must have a Committee Stage. The Hon. Member, the Chief Government Whip referred to the fact that during times of disturbances that certain Items were passed in the House. I say, "Yes". But those were Regulations. We did not resort to passing Bills because then the Hon. Speaker would have had to leave the Speakers Chair and take the position of the Chairman at the Committee Stage. If you look at the Proceedings of those days, you will find that every Item passed was certainly not an Item which required the Speaker to leave the Chair and take the position of the Chairman at the Committee Stage. In fact, since I was the person who read it, I was very careful to omit any Item where the Hon. Speaker would have to leave the Chair. There are certain things you can do. Like for the Vote on the First Reading, you could take from the Chair. That is why our position has been that there was no Second Reading. We have no problem on this Finance (Amendment) Bill (No.257). If it is put today, we can pass it today - [Interruption.] No, no. That is a different matter. You can say what you have to say. But listen to what I say. I say we have no problems on that. There has been no Committee Stage. The Committee Stage procedure has to be followed where it is called clause by clause. Certainly, I did not hear it being called clause by clause. I did hear some mention on the Finance (Amendment) Bill (No.257). Then, coming back to the other issue, the matter of electronic voting has been the subject of debate in this House. When this was discussed - I was not there yesterday morning; it was discussed the previous day - there was a belief that either there would be a suspension of Standing Orders because there had been a reference on the need to amend the Standing Orders or otherwise after the electronic voting has taken place, there would be the normal conventional voting which is also done in many Parliaments when they introduce it to ensure that there are no mistakes. In the Third Reading of that first Item, though I was raising a point of Order with you, we saw the numbers changing regularly. It just went up. There is some defect. Leaving this issue aside, before we use this system, this must be checked - [Interruption.] But when we found that the conventional vote had not taken place, you were in the Committee Stage and as you finished we raised this issue.

2575 2576

What I would like to bring to your notice is, according to Article 148 of the Constitution, Parliament has the power to levy a tax. They can impose a tax, rate or any other levy by public law. Then if you go to the Articles dealing with the Legislature, Article 75 states, I quote: Parliament shall have power to make laws, including laws having retrospective effect. Then, Article 74. (1) states, I quote: . Parliament may by resolution or Standing Order provide for - (ii) the regulation of its business, the preservation of order at its sittings et cetera. So, at the moment the only matters which governed yesterdays Proceeding are the Standing Orders. There was no Resolution on the Order Paper. It was only the Standing Orders. So, when you go by the Standing Orders, the qualification of Standing Order 42 has not been fulfilled both in respect of the Second Reading as well as in the case of the Third Reading. You accepted our position and said that there should be no electronic voting. But then, we went back to the Second Reading instead of finalizing the challenge to your decision which is made here. The Hon. Speaker, listening to the voices gives a decision, saying "Ayes" have it or "Noes" have it. You said, "Ayes" had it. Then an Hon. Member can challenge. If that happens, then that challenge has to be met. So, there was no decision given on that. That is why in regard to the first Item I would say that there has been no conclusion. But from Items 2 to 5, there was no Committee Stage and there was no way in which the Committee Stage could have functioned. Not only me, there are many other Hon. Members of this House who would say that the Committee Stage on Items 2 to 5 did not take place. That is why we thought we should bring it to your notice. Finally, we have to be guided by the Standing Orders and the earlier precedents. Certainly, it is a different matter if some Regulations had come in. These are all Bills and Bills have to go through the Committee Stage.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Speaker, I would like to seek your indulgence on the basis of what the Hon. Chief Government Whip stated that the necessary information was conveyed that there would be an electronic voting. Yesterday morning when I got up and said that the Consultative Committee should have not more than 12 Members, the Chief Government Whip corrected me saying that the Standing Orders were amended and rectified my mistake. So, I did accept that and that was to keep in line with the Standing Orders. My Leader, referring to the Indian system where three or four Standing Orders were amended and the British system which permitted it, clearly stated that there has been no amendment to the Standing Orders in this regard. Furthermore, we also would like to say that this is completely against natural justice. There is a decision by the Supreme Court to reduce telecommunication charges in this country. And here is a Government which is forcefully

bringing in legislation, at the will of their own, to increase telecommunication charges. So, that is why we have made a concerted effort to stop it saying that this type of burden cannot be put on the people. Furthermore, Hon. Speaker, I would like to say that all these things happened yesterday after 6 o clock. There was not an opportunity to seek the approval of the House to go beyond 6 o' clock. Did you get the approval of the House to go beyond 6 o clock? With the consent of Parliament, yes, you could do so. I am stating that as the third point and as the least of the charges. But, if we try to go beyond the Standing Orders, beyond the democratic norms, we are going to convert this into a very dangerous situation. I leave this for your judgment and ensure that democracy is upheld in the very place that we try to protect it. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . . ( ) (The Hon. Anura Dissanayake) , . . . , . "" .

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Bimal Ratnayake) . . . - [ ] ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Bimal Ratnayake) . , . , . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , [ ] , . ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, I think all these issues fall into two categories. First I will deal with the issues in regard to the Finance (Amendment) Bill (No. 257), the Regional Infrastructure Development Levy (Amendment) Bill, the Excise (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Bill and the Special Commodity Levy Bill. The issues that have come up are in regard to the procedure on these Bills in Committee. With regard to these Bills, neither did I hear any clauses being read out nor did I hear the Chairman reporting to Parliament that the Committee has concluded its functions. I stand corrected if it has happened. That is why we say that provisions of Standing Orders have not been complied with in regard to the Finance (Amendment) Bill (No. 257), the Regional Infrastructure Development Levy (Amendment) Bill, the Excise (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Bill and the Special Commodity Levy Bill. Therefore, it is essential that these Bills stay on in the Order Paper to be taken up next time. The issue regarding the Finance (Amendment) Bill (No. 256) was first raised by the Chief Opposition Whip and then I supported it. What happened as you said was, after the Second Reading the Bill was put to Vote. There was a voice vote. After the voice vote a Division was called. Then, you wanted the electronic voting system used for the Division. We anticipated that there

will be another vote taken either by standing or calling out by name. That did not take place. In fact I happened to discuss that. We went on to the Committee Stage and then onto the Third Reading. That was the time the Chief Opposition Whip raised this issue. When we said that there is no provision in the Standing Orders for electronic voting, you accepted it and said that you will go back to the other system. From that arose two other issues. One is in regard to the Third Reading. Standing Order 42 states, I quote: The question shall be put by Mr. Speaker and the votes may be taken by voices, Ayes and Noes, and the result may be declared by Mr. Speaker. If the opinion of Mr. Speaker as to the decision of the question is challenged by any member, the division bells shall be rung for two minutes......." That happened. .....and division shall, subject to the provisions of Standing Order 43, be taken as follows:" Now, that was not followed and that was the time I stated that I saw the numbers changing. It went up to 113 in regard to the Third Reading. I did not see the numbers changing in the Second Reading of the electronic voting, but in the Third Reading of the electronic voting, I saw the numbers all changing. So, when it was stopped, you had declared that the voice vote was carried by "Ayes". It had been challenged by the Chief Opposition Whip. . ( . ) (The Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera) I wanted it by name. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Yes, and he asked for the vote to be taken by name. But we did not have a vote on the Third Reading at all. That challenge had not been met. So, that Bill had not been passed in the Third Reading. In regard to going back and holding a vote on the second issue, we said that we had gone past the Committee Stage. I remember mentioning very, very specifically that we had already bypassed Standing Orders 52, 53, 54 and come to Standing Order 62 and it was not possible to go back for a vote at that stage. That was the discussion we were having when it got interrupted. So, you were unable to give a ruling on the question that I raised when the interruptions and the disorderly conduct took place in the House. But what we said still stands valid. Because once you have come up to the Third Reading, can you then go back to take a vote on the Second Reading? Then, on the Third Reading there was a voice vote which the Hon. Speaker said, the "Ayes" had it. It was challenged and thereafter you did

2587 2588

[ ]

not go through the rest of the procedure according to Standing Order 42 to say either the challenge has been defeated because more Members stood for the Bill or that the challenge has been carried because more Members voted against it. So, we are in suspension as far as the Third Reading is concerned. These are the very complex issues that have come up and which require discussion. What I suggest is for the Party Leaders to meet with you and talk this over and allow the Votes of Condolence to be taken up today. Otherwise, we will be debating this the whole day. It is much better if the Party Leaders meet with you and go through these issues and then see what can be done. That is what I suggest.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Firstly, I think all of us want to go ahead with the Vote of Condolence. There is no dispute over that. But certain matters have been raised today in Parliament, both by the Chief Opposition Whip, by me and the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake amongst others. According to the Parliament procedure and Standing Orders we are entitled to do that. Yesterday, there were disruptions and the whole proceedings ended there. So we wanted to know what happened and then to get clarification, issues have been raised. But there is no finality. Since we were anxious to go ahead with the Votes of Condolence, we suggested that you meet with Party Leaders but if they are not willing to do that, we will go ahead with the Votes of Condolence and we will take the issue up again because we have not concluded it. Either they must discuss it with you in the Chambers or otherwise we must take it up next Tuesday. We also do not want to stand in your way in taking up the Votes of Condolence. Their family members and friends have come. They have anticipated and they have come all the way. Some of them were our colleagues. You and I both entered Parliament with them. So let us go ahead with the Votes of Condolence and take this up subsequently. That is all that can be done because they are not anxious to discuss it in any other way.

[.. 11.39] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Deputy Speaker. It was my privilege to know the late Hon. Vincent Perera when he was elected a Member of Parliament in 1977 for the Yatiyantota Constituency. He belonged to the UNP and we, the Members of the TULF who were in Parliament at that time, developed a very close relationship with him. He was a very friendly person who related to all the Members of Parliament and in fact he had the reputation of being a person who was fair-minded and bore a lot of goodwill to the minority community of this country. He is said to have had a very

close relationship in particular, with Tamil people. I am aware that he used to often go to Jaffna and that he was a very close associate of my late Colleague and Friend Mr. Yogeswaran. Mr. Vincent Perera was looked after by Mr. Yogeswaran very well whenever he went to Jaffna. He was an easy person to get along with, Sir. I am not very much aware of his activities in his own area. But the Members here have been speaking highly about him and about the service he rendered to his people. I am reminded, Sir, of something that used to be said just after the 1977 Election and I think it may be appropriate for me to just mention that on the Floor of this House. It was said that President J.R. Jayewardene, when the elections were in full steam, he realized that some of the left stalwarts of the day like Dr. N.M.Perera and Dr. Colvin R. de Silva whose membership in Parliament and with whom President J.R.Jayewardene had associated very closely, probably for several decades and whose contributions to the House were very valuable, that there was a likelihood that they would not be returned to Parliament. This upset President J.R.Jayewardene because he thought that persons like Dr. N.P.Perera and Dr. Colvin R. de Silva should come to Parliament and should be returned to Parliament. In this context, Sir, the anecdote goes like this. When President J.R.Jayewardene addressed the meeting of Mr. Vincent Perera of Yatiyantota, and his opponent was Dr. N.M.Perera, President J.R. Jayewardene is supposed to have said to the people of Yatiyantota, Well, there are two Pereras contesting in the electorate. You may vote for the better Perera ". Whatever President J.R.Jayewardene said, I think the people of Yatiyantota with all due respect to that political giant Dr. N.M. Perera seemed to think at that point of time at that election that Vincent Perera was the better Perera and he was returned to Parliament and in that sense he was a giant killer like some of the giant killers who also came to the Parliament in 1977. Anyway, Sir, all that apart, I think Mr. Vincent Perera was a very amiable sort of person. We got along well with him and on behalf of my party I would like to associate myself with all the sentiments that have been expressed in this House. I would like to request you, Sir, to ensure that a Minute of the proceedings of today pertaining to the Vote of Condolence is sent to the family of the deceased Member. I thank you, Sir.
