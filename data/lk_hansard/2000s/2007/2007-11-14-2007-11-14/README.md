[.. 12.30] . . ( ) ( . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala- Minister of Higher Education) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I happy to follow my good, learned Friend from Batticaloa, Miss Thangeswary Kadirgaman. I would like to begin by congratulating the Hon. Minister of Finance and Planning, who, in this case, is the Head of State, for introducing a realistic Budget under very difficult circumstances. Before I draw the attention of the House to those difficult circumstances, which in my view are both local and global in character, I would like to refer to the present role of the main political party in the Opposition. The United National Party, as the main party in the Opposition, launched a very powerful, popular offensive in the country with a view to capturing political power within a certain time frame and this strategy was supported by the so-called "dissidents" who left the Sri Lanka Freedom Party a couple of months back. I do not grudge them. They are entitled to their line of political action, the political thinking, for that matter. The question is whether they could achieve their objective within that particular time frame. It is in this scenario that His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, who, unlike his predecessors, has his feet on the ground, produced a realistic Budget which could address the basic issues of social welfare and development in this country. In the given context, any government, Sir, which comes to power in Sri Lanka at this moment of time has to give priority to both social welfare or social welfarism and development. Budget-making is not an easy task. It is equally difficult to introduce acceptable budgetary policies in an economic environment dominated by global factors which are beyond our control. That is the international scenario. The emerging Asian economies have shown considerable progress in the last few years. Take, for instance, China. Its economy grew by 11.9 per

[ ]

2007 14 715 716

cent in the eighties and it has grown by an average of 10 per cent a year, more than the Japanese economy or the Asian Tigers in the region. For the first time, China is now contributing more to the global GDP growth than the United States of America. In India, strong growth tendencies have appeared and there is no reason to doubt about its sustainability. Economic reforms of the 1990s have paid good dividends and the annual growth rate is 9 per cent in India. This is likely to remain in the next five years. This is the emerging economic scenario in our part of the world and Sri Lanka, in the given context has to produce a set of policies with which development could be accelerated in this county. The existing human resource base could be used to achieve this objective. We have the highest literacy rate in this part of the world. What are the factors which interfere with the introduction of a realistic set of policies? The major problem is the ongoing ethnic conflict and the cost of it. The defence expenditure is in the region of Rs. 117 billion and this kind of expenditure, though a burden on the Sri Lankan State, is necessary to defend the territorial integrity of the Sri Lankan State. The so-called "patriotic forces" in the country are asking the Government to protect and safeguard the sovereignty of the State and the very same forces, impelled by an idealism of their own, are asking the Government to raise the salaries of public servants and the salaries of the private sector employees as well. This is a major contradiction, in my view. All countries engaged in fighting terrorism have to spend millions to defend and safeguard the territorial integrity of the respective State. Sri Lanka is now engaged in that task; defending its own territory. One has to look at the economic impact of terrorism and this is a thing which needs to be highlighted in the context of this Budget. I would like to place before this House, Sir, some statistics relating to the cost of ethnic conflicts in the African part of the world. I am quoting from the international edition of "The Guardian Weekly", which was earlier known as "The Manchester Guardian", of 26th October, 2007, which states:

Africa pays the cost of conflicts. Sterling Pounds 150 billion has been spent because of the wars, because of the conflicts. For instance, the Democratic Republic of Congo has lost Sterling Pounds 9 billion, Eritrea has lost Pounds 140 million, Rwanda has lost Pounds 4.2 billion and Burundi 2.8 billion. This is the cost of conflicts in the context of Africa. The purpose in showing or in placing these statistics is to show that an ongoing conflict is certain to interfere with the process of economic development in a given country. The conflicts in Africa, as I said, cost the continent Sterling Pounds 150 billion and this was the equivalent of all foreign aid which the region received in that particular period. Since 1990, there were a number of countries involved in

conflicts and the region has lost more than Sterling Pounds 150 billion. This was due to both increased military expenditure and destruction of infrastructure. It is in this kind of a background that we need to look at the Budgetary Proposals of the Government. Sir, the economic performance in 2007 was satisfactory and the economy grew by 6.4 per cent. The industrial sector showed a steady growth and the growth in the services sector was equally good. The other important features are as follows: the worker remittances have increased by 17 per cent - it increased from US Dollars 1.5 billion to US Dollars 1.7 billion. The Sri Lankan foreign reserves too increased. The Foreign Direct Investment, Sir, amounted to over US Dollars 260 million. On the basis of these developments, the balance of payment position reached a surplus of US Dollars 151 million. These positive developments could be attributed to good economic management. As I said earlier, it is not easy to manage the economy in the context of an offensive against international terrorism. In the sphere of unemployment, it recorded the lowest rate. Unemployment fell to 6.2 per cent. In this country, the private sector share of the total employment is 44.1 per cent and the State sector accounted for 12.6 per cent. This is yet another area where policy initiatives are necessary and the Budget is indirectly addressing it. Inflation is a major problem in the country. International economic factors, primarily the oil prices, contributed to the increase in inflation and it is here that the monetary policy had to be tightened. I think the Government had tightened it and the fiscal expenditure needs to be properly managed. Sir, the "Mahinda Chintana" is a package of policies based on the realistic assessment of our resources in the rural sector. Our Government, from its very inception, has been looking at the process of economic development from the point of view of the need to rejuvenate the rural economy. In other words, the Colombo-centred development strategy must undergo a change. I can again quote from the document of the Institute of Policy Studies which gives all the figures relating to the contribution to the GDP from different districts. In other words, the Colombo-centered development policy has undergone a transformation and the rural sector is being targeted. The "Mahinda Chintana" always thought in terms of the need to make use of the rural economy. The resources in the rural sector need to be tapped properly. Most of our resources, as we are well aware, are in the rural sector and they need to be tapped properly in order to accelerate the social and economic development of this country. The "Mahinda Chintana" understood the development of the rural productive forces as the central economic question of Sri Lanka and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, which believes in the potentiality of the Sri Lankan peasantry, proposes to provide all incentives to the rural sector to increase its productivity. Productivity in the rural sector needs to be increased.

717 718

This Budget has rightly focused on the rural sector and emphasis has been placed on the development of the domestic production capacity. Agriculture has been recognized as a priority area. It has been recognized as a priority sector and all the allied sectors such as the plantation sector, fisheries sector, industries sector and the livestock sector are to be provided with capital to increase domestic production. Nearly Rs.7,000 million has been allocated to provide domestic production and exports. This is certain to transform the rural productive forces in this country. As envisaged in the "Mahinda Chintana : Vision for a New Sri Lanka, A Ten Year Horizon Development Framework 2006 - 2016, there is a plan to develop the infrastructure necessary for the development of the productive forces in the rural sector. This Budget has rightly, in my view, focused on infrastructure development, without which the productive forces in the rural sector cannot be activated. Therefore, the Budget is infrastructure development-oriented. By infrastructure development, we mean the provision of key inputs into the economy. Today we use the terms "infrastructure investment" and "infrastructure capital". There is a difference between economic infrastructure and the social infrastructure. Roads, railways, ports, bridges and power come within economic infrastructure whereas hospitals, schools, housing, childcare and water supply come within social infrastructure. Economic infrastructure provides the key services to the business and industry and social infrastructure is seen as providing the basic services to the households. Its main role is to improve the quality of life and the welfare of the community. In my view, Sir, the Budgetary Proposals have given due recognition to the thesis the need to develop the rural sector; the need to make the rural sector development-oriented. Hard social realities in our rural sector have been recognized and the importance of the rural sector in the overall pattern of economic development of this country has been recognized in the Budget. This is one important aspect of the Budget. The recognition of the need for infrastructure development is one of the important aspects of the Budget. That is why I emphasize the fact that this Budget is infrastructure development-oriented. - is a realistic agricultural development programme which could deliver the goods within a certain time frame. This is a timely programme for which the Ministry of Agricultural Development and Agrarian Services is giving leadership and the Government should have undertaken this several decades ago.

At a time when international food prices are escalating, the Government has taken steps to increase domestic production of local food items. Sri Lanka is vulnerable to the escalation of international food prices. China and

India, as I mentioned earlier, are not food importers. Therefore, they are not vulnerable to changes in international food prices. There is a shortage of milk production in Australia and New Zealand - I can remember that several speakers referred to this matter - and as a result, the import price of milk has gone up in Sri Lanka. These are economic realities which we need to take into consideration in formulating our domestic economic policy. We need a new policy in respect of milk production in this country. We now produce only 14 per cent of our demand. The Budget, realizing the importance of the industry, has now allocated Rs. 100 million to develop the local milk production industry. The new restriction imposed on the killing of cows is yet another good proposal. It should not be viewed as a policy with a religious connotation. Do not look at it from the point of view of religion. In my view, it is a policy with economic advantages and the Government should be commended for taking such a bold decision. Nagenahira Udanaya" is another important programme of development in the Budget. We know that the Eastern Province has all the resources in terms of land wealth; a good bit of our land wealth is in the East. When you look at from the point of view of water resources, when you look at from the point of view of forestry resources and when you look at from the point of view of the coastal belt, all these resources are found in the East. Therefore, the potentiality of the East needs to be utilized to accelerate the development process in that particular region. Various incentives have been offered to attract investment into the region. One has to attract investment into that particular province, without which you cannot accelerate the development process in that area and the Government policy is to give priority to the development of that region. This is yet another important aspect of the Budget, which in a big way focuses on infrastructure development because the infrastructure has been destroyed in that part of the country. Therefore, it needs to be developed. It is only on the basis of development of infrastructure that the economic process could be developed. In my view, one can be satisfied with the overall macroeconomic stability in the country. The Budget has generated a surplus on the current account. In other words, the current expenditure needs are met by revenue and this is what good budgeting means. The 7 per cent GDP Budget deficit is entirely granted from capital expenditure, which is used for development activities. I need to say it again, that a realistic Budget has been introduced under very difficult economic and political circumstances. Sri Lanka is now in the direction of a 7 per cent growth and the Government, with the prudent economic management, is committed to sustain this growth despite the unfavourable conditions in both the domestic and external economic environments. Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees.

( - , ) (The Hon. Dew Gunasekara -Minister of Constitutional Affairs and National Integration) Madam Chairperson, may I express at the outset, my thanks, satisfaction and appreciation to His Excellency the President for introducing the Budget for 2008 in his capacity as Minister of Finance and Planning. I have got limited time. Therefore, I wish to make my intervention in English. It needs no special mention that the preparation of the Budget was an arduous task under difficult circumstances. Before I come to the Budget proper, I wish to make some preliminary observations on the international economic trends. This aspect of the Budget does not receive adequate attention of this House, not even the media. Therefore, we need to touch upon the politics of economic development first. Even some of our professionals, economists, social scientists and above all, those engaged in politics seem to ignore, underestimate, pretend not to know, misinterpret or are simply unable to comprehend the realities of the international situation - international economic trends, turmoils and upheavals in various parts of the world. Global climate changes, acts of terrorism and combating terrorism, man-made as well as nature-made crises, all these decisively influence the fiscal and monetary management of our economy. One of the factors that contribute to economic recessions, crises and instability is the unbridled circulation of speculative capital and that is a frightening trend. In this connection, it is appropriate to quote two authorities belonging to two different schools of thought. First, I quote Alan Greenspan, who for 20 years headed the Federal Reserve of the United States known as the authority on markets in the western world. Madam, he says, I quote: To restore policy sanity, we will first have to trudge through economic and political minefields. The trip through the minefields is a major source of risk for my forecast.

Then, what does Joseph Stiglitz, the former Chief of the IMF, say? The world could be approaching a huge financial earthquake. However much these two differ, they hold identical conclusions on the impending financial instability of the world economy. Madam Chairperson, it is necessary to comprehend this background in which we were called upon to present this Budget. There is not only potential for economic turmoils and upheavals as predicted by both Alan Greenspan and Joseph Stiglitz, but there are other changes as well taking place in the world: the emerging multi-polarity, the ongoing changes in the world balance of forces, the resurgence of Asian economies, the emergence of the two new economic giants, China and India, the reawakening of Latin American people against neoliberalism and the re-emergence of Russia as a potential economic power. As regards policies, the US foreign policy of pre-emption, its defence policy of "unilateralism", all that contribute to the current world economic trends. Then, the threat to natural economic environment. It is more serious than 15 years ago. There is scientific evidence as well as proof of day-to-day disasters. In these circumstances, it has become necessary to change the current unsustainable patterns of production and consumption. Millions of dollars are being spent for global advertising of these patterns. Madam, before others and above all, the Parliamentarians should have an understanding of these problems, these realities. I emphatically say here that this understanding should be the principal weapon to tackle the current economic problems. Madam, as an introduction, I thought of making these observations, having listened to the speeches of the Hon. Members from both sides of the House. I wonder whether they are aware of these current trends, positive as well as negative. I agree that a number of Members from the Opposition made some very constructive remarks and very constructive and positive criticisms. When we prepared this Budget, we had a prior knowledge and understanding of these ground realities, both international and domestic. What did the Opposition offer in this Debate? As for the UNP, the main group in the Opposition, it is in a state of confusion, worst confounded. Either they are confused or they are attempting to confuse the people. As for the JVP, their speeches are a bundle of contradictions being unable to identify the distinction between the general and the specifics or the difference between the fundamental and the subsidiary. I believe it takes time for them to comprehend the world realities. They see nothing else beyond terrorism; their vision needs perfection.

As for the TNA, they see nothing else other than the Eelam; for them it is the panacea for all ills, a never-ending theme in every Debate. It is understandable, taking the circumstances they are placed in. Madam Chairperson, you would well remember that the Budget for the year 2005 commenced with an unprecedented catastrophe, tsunami, a nature-made disaster. We recovered from it faster than expected. Then, the Budget for the year 2006 had to commence with a man-made disaster with the resumption of LTTE violence. The Budget for the year 2007 had to face, in midstream, Mavil-Aru sabotage and as a counter to it, an offensive retaliation by the armed forces was carried out till the collapse of Thoppigala. Despite all these constraints, both international and domestic, our performance in the management of economy has been spectacular much to the disappointment of the Opposition. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . . , .

, () , . Whereupon THE HON. (MRS.) RENUKA HERATH left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES took the Chair. ( )

( The Hon. Dew Gunasekara) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I would request the Opposition to do a careful comparative study of our performance from the year 2005 to date. There may be areas where there are shortfalls but it is better than the preceding year and it is a case of plus and not minus. Now I come to the proposals of the Budget for the year 2008. What are its salient features and its striking features? The revenue for the first time in 30 years will exceed the current expenditure allowing a surplus for capital expenditure. Our revenue as a percentage of GDP which was on the decline from 1978 onwards is now in the ascendancy. There is an increase in direct tax of approximately 25 per cent over the estimates of the year 2007. This is a positive move for which I have been campaigning for in this House. Do not forget the fact that this reduced the tax burden on the poor through the reduction of indirect taxes which would affect them. Sir, there is a 44 per cent increase in public investment. As a ratio of GDP, it is an increase from 6.6 per cent to 8 per cent which reflects the development

2007 14 755 756

orientation of the Budget. The Budget deficit, excluding fully foreign-funded projects, will be reduced from 6.3 per cent to 5.7 per cent. Given the extremely difficult international situation and the need to protect the living conditions of the people, while pushing for economic growth and future development contrary to the myopic impressions and the illogical conclusions of the Opposition, there had been an accelerated growth, a growth with equity. This is the striking difference between the policies of the UNP and the Government. The main thread running through the Budget Debate, as far as the Opposition is concerned, is the increase in the cost of living. Firstly, the increase in the cost of living cannot be attributed to a single isolated factor. It is the result of interplay by both the supply and the demand-related factors. Fundamentally, they are beyond the control of the Government; for that matter any government. On the supply side, a Budget in the short run can bring down prices by increasing subsidies and reducing taxes. But they are both constrained by the need to maintain growth. Further, increasing subsidies could mean an increase in indirect taxes, which will then add to the debt service burden. In any case, the Budget has no control over the increase in international prices. Sir, is the Opposition denying the sharp increase in the prices of fuel, gas, milk powder and wheat flour in the international market? From 2004 to date the price of milk powder has been increased thrice in the international market. Is the Opposition so blind or deaf to these realities? According to speculations and also forecasts, oil prices may perhaps go up to over US Dollars 105 per barrel. This is a common problem, a grave problem to all non oil-producing countries. However, within the capacity of the Government, it has reduced taxes and duties on essential commodities to the tune of around Rs. 10 billion. But surprisingly, this relief has not been passed down to the people in the same measure as we expected. That is why State intervention has become imperative. We have already taken a series of measures in this regard. Mind you, this was a political decision by the Cabinet. It was done in the interests of the lower segments of society in particular. Sir, it may not be a sound, economic decision. This is precisely the difference between the policy of the UNP and the policy of the Government. Sir, now let us look at the problem from the demand side. The money supply has undoubtedly gone up by about 19 per cent owing to the credit growth of the public enterprises and the private sector. I confess that the Government is confronted with two major problems as far as the economy is concerned. That is, firstly, to pay back the accumulated borrowings and

interest thereupon, the burden of servicing past borrowings. That is one of the main problems. Secondly, the losses sustained by public enterprises. Here the question of poor management arises. Of these enterprises, the most crucial and strategically important areas are transport, electricity and petroleum. In the interests of the people, we are compelled to maintain subsidized tariffs and prices. But they continue to contribute to losses. This is the most vulnerable link of the national economy. I agree that there is a lot of waste and corruption. But, in my judgement, it is much more than waste and corruption. This is the area that is not identified even by the trade union leaders, with due respect to them. If there is not going to be discipline, productivity and sound management, this area of national economy is going to be baneful. Continued dependence on oil for the production of energy is the rudimentary cause of this whole crisis. The substitutes for oil are the remedy. Where previous governments failed, even where our own PA Government failed, the present Government has embarked upon several gigantic projects which will of course take three to five years to bear fruit. That bold decision was taken by us during the first few months of the present Government. Why can the Opposition not appreciate this? With all these constraints, this Government has effected several salary increases. All these increases add to the total expenditure which in turn affects goods and services, money supply eventually pushing up prices. The compelling defence expenditure will also add to the total expenditure and money supply. Undoubtedly, this is a vicious circle. There is no salvation if we fail in our efforts. That is precisely why we give these projects the highest priority. Would the Opposition advocate cutting down the wage expenditure or the defence expenditure? In these circumstances the only option available before us is to bridle inflation through higher economic growth with equity. The difference between the policy of the UNP and the policy of the Government is that it promotes growth with equity. Another argument running through the Debate is the size of the Cabinet and the high cost involved in maintaining it. I agree that this criticism is justified. There is undoubtedly sense and logic in it. But on the other hand, what is the source of this crisis of instability? It is nothing but the 1978 Constitution and the electoral system wedded to it. The society is fragmented. So many political parties are emerging. There may be objective conditions for it. This is the trend throughout the world; coalition governments have become the order of the day, whether you like it or not. So, democracy has become so costly. That is why we attempted to effect some electoral

757 758

changes. But again, Sir, there is no consensus and the Opposition wants to perpetuate this situation. This situation has undoubtedly affected the UNP more than any other party. That is why there is constant and continued erosion within that party. The dream of J.R. Jayewardene to foist an authoritarian rule through its five-sixth majority could not be realized. His objective was to push through neo-liberal policies through such a regime - another variety of Pinochet type administration in Chile. Can the UNP attempt to solve the countrys problems through the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghes Regaining Sri Lanka concept of neo-liberalism? It is this theory which has made the world economy vulnerable, unstable and crisis-ridden. The then Chief Economic Adviser of the UNP, Jim Robertson who prescribed the concept of Regaining Sri Lanka has only closed doors for the Hon. Ranil Wickremasighe to come to power. That concept or theory is being rejected the world over. It is an impotent theory. Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, to implement neo-liberal policies in the context of the present stage of globalization, the country will need an authoritarian regime which is more authoritarian than Singapore, South Korea or perhaps of a Pinochet type. Why are some members of the international community so unfriendly towards this Government? In my assessment and judgement, they cannot tolerate this Governments gradual departure from neo-liberal policies. This is the crux of the matter. The talk of human rights and good governance is only a pretext. The real reason is class-based. This is what my Friends of the JVP are unable to comprehend. They cannot see anything beyond terrorism. This Budget is based on the Ten Year Horizon Development Framework. It targets an average 8 per cent growth rate built on unprecedented investments on infrastructure, human resource development and a more productive and dynamic Public Service. It lays emphasis on rural economy, regional development, SME projects et cetera. These investments are made without sacrificing the well-being of the vulnerable segments of the society. It will be growth cum equity - economic development cum human development. Our success depends on productivity. For this, Public Service should be more vibrant, efficient and people-oriented. I repeat the urgent need for administrative reforms because if the Public Service fails, we shall also fail. Sir, education is at the base of human resource development. The National Education Commissions survey makes some startling revelations with regard to the quality of our education. According to the NEC report, the knowledge of a Grade 10 student is equivalent to the knowledge of a Grade 5 student, both in the Sinhala the Tamil mediums, with regard to four basic rules of

Arithmetic. So, what appears on the surface is totally different from what appears on the ground. Therefore, we will have to give higher priority to human resource development. Our success depends on productivity. For this, Public Service should be more vibrant, more efficient and more people-oriented. I repeat the urgent need for administrative reforms. Thank you, Sir.

P. Keith Vaz is reported to have strongly condemned the assassination of the LTTE political head S. P. Thamilselvan. The Government of Sri Lanka should take exception in the strongest possible terms to this categorization of the death of Thamilselvan as an assassination, and call for an unconditional apology by the Head of the APPG.

793 794

The LTTE has stated clearly and repeatedly that its goal is to create an independent state of Tamil Eelam through armed conflict. As such, all members of the LTTE, in whatever capacity they serve, are committed to the realization of this goal. Consequently, all members of the LTTE are combatants engaged in the creation of separate state through armed aggression. It is the bounden duty and responsibility of the Government of Sri Lanka to resist the creation of a separate state by defending its territorial integrity. The Oxford English Dictionary defines the action of assassination as taking the life of anyone by treacherous violence especially by a hired emissary or one who has taken upon him to execute the deed. The circumstances under which Thamilselvan died do not fit the definition of assassination. To be categorized as an assassination, the victim in question must be specifically targeted. In this instance, the identities of the targets were not known. All that was known was that the premises were used for LTTE operations. Consequently, Thamilselvan died in the course of a military operation that was no different to other operations conducted by the security forces against LTTE targets. Intelligence had reported the existence of a safe house that was being used for meetings by LTTE personnel. A further report has indicated that a meeting was to take place on a certain date. The Sri Lanka Air Force targeted the building in question on that fatal day without a clue as to who the occupants were. It was only after the names of the occupants were released by the LTTE that the Government of Sri Lanka became aware of the significance of the action taken by the Air Force. The fact that Thamilselvam participated in peace talks does not make him an angel of peace any more than Karuna, who has also participated in peace talks. While the UK Government is considering taking action against Karuna for his crimes against humanity, Keith Vaz, M.P., finds Thamilselvam an apostle of peace, whereas his crimes against humanity as a member of the LTTE high command were no different in scale horror to hose of Karuna. The Sri Lanka Air Force operation was no different to the military operations being conducted by the British Forces in Afghanistan and earlier in Iraq in the name of combating terrorism. If the military operation conducted on the safe house in Sri Lanka was an assassination, then the operations conducted by the British forces on a daily basis in Afghanistan have also to be categorized as assassinations. To categorize British actions in Afghanistan as legitimate military operations and the Sri Lankan attack on the safe house as an assassination, reveals a level of APPG complicity with the LTTE that could be considered as act against the national interests of UK where the LTTE is designated a terrorist organization. The circumstances under which Thamilselvan died contrast sharply with those under which leaders such as President Premadasa, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, Ketheesh Loganathan, and a host of others have been targeted and executed by the LTTE. They were all assassinations. Recent attempts on the lives of Sri Lankas Defense Secretary, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and Army Commander Sarath Fonseka were attempted assassinations. Since the circumstances in which Thamilselvan died were vastly different, the APPG has committed a grave breach of protocol by accusing the Government of Sri Lanka of assassinating Thamilselvan. M.P. Keith Vaz who heads the group owes an unconditional apology to the Government and the Sri Lankan nation.

( - ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama - Minister of Foreign Affairs) , , . , , . . , . , , . , . , . , , . , . , . . . . , , , , . , , . . I have just returned from London where I attended the extraordinary meeting of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group - CMAG - convened by the Commonwealth Secretary-General on Monday to primarily decide on Developments in Pakistan. Foreign Ministers from Lesotho, Malaysia, Malta, Sri Lanka and

2007 14 795 796

the UK and representatives of Canada, Papua New Guinea, St. Lucia and Tanzania participated in the session. I must say that Sri Lanka was able to play a pivotal role in ensuring that no precipitous action was taken with regard to Pakistan. Following extensive deliberations which lasted almost five hours, the CMAG succeeded in arriving at a formula which can be put to test, in terms of the progress Pakistan makes in fulfilling its obligations in accordance with Commonwealth principles. Conscious of the complexities Pakistan presently faces in maintaining stability while ensuring liberty and security, Sri Lanka expressed the need to give Pakistan more time to demonstrate progress. Our position taken at this meeting was greatly influenced by the fact that Sri Lanka was keen to ensure the continuous stability of Pakistan, which is vital for regional stability in South Asia and would assist in enabling the opportunity for greater dialogue within the polity of Pakistan. As for the Motion before us today regarding the commemoration event for Tamilselvan in London, I wish to make the following observations: Two commemorative events took place in London to mark the death of S.P. Tamilselvan and five others. On Sunday, the 4th of November, a religious ceremony to commemorate the death of S.P. Tamilselvan and five LTTE cadres killed was held at the Sri Katpahavinayagar Temple in Tooting in South West London. This event was mainly a religious ritual with no speeches et cetera and was attended by a few devotees. The main event of remembrance was organized by a committee comprising several Tamil groups and with the support of some British local councillors, who are Sri Lankan Tamils, at the Harrow Leisure Centre in North West London on Monday, the 5th of November from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. Harrow is an area where there is a large concentration of Sri Lankan Tamils and four elected Borough Councillors - equivalent of Municipal Councillors - from the Tamil community in this Borough. These councillors have been in the forefront of organizing LTTE-related activities. The Harrow Leisure Centre where the event was held is a hall that belongs to the local Borough Council and used for public events. Posters advertising this event were displayed in shops owned by the Tamil community most of which showed these dead LTTE cadres in civilian dress. Nearly 2,000 people attended the commemorative event. The programme comprised placing of floral tributes before the photographs of these deceased LTTE cadres and speeches recalling mainly Tamilselvans role as a peace negotiator for the LTTE. Among the prominent speakers were the TNA Members of Parliament, Mr. Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam, Mrs. Pathmini Sithamparanathan,

Mr. S. Vino Noharathalingam from Sri Lanka and Mr. Rajan Ethiveerasingham representing TRO Sri Lanka. The speakers from the UK were all British Sri Lankans - Dr. N. Sathiyamoorthy, a trustee of the White Pigeon Charity and Mrs. Anandi Sooriyapragasam, a former head of BBC Tamil Service. Mrs. Adele Balasingham also participated and placed a floral tribute. It is noted that relatives and family members of the deceased LTTE cadres garlanded the photographs. This included one Mrs. Mohandas, sister of Maj Mithuthan. A statement issued by the All Party British Parliamentary Tamil Group - this is what is very relevant - from the House of Commons, was also read. This statement condemned the killings and expressed sympathy. No British Members of Parliament or councillors or prominent persons participated. The UK Police authorities were notified by the Sri Lanka High Commission in advance of this event, summoned the organizers and gave them strict guidelines in accordance with the law. In this context, the LTTE emblems, flags or photographs of the LTTE leader were not to be displayed, though it was observed that red and yellow colours had been used for dcor in the hall. The event was restricted to strictly identified people. The High Commission in London has already obtained video footage of sections of the event and is carrying out a detailed analysis before handing over scripts to police authorities and to assess whether the organizers or speakers could be prosecuted under the UK Terrorism legislation. Further action which is being taken - I do not want to reveal in the House at this very moment - in order to facilitate the inquiries that are being conducted by the relevant law enforcement authorities in the United Kingdom. It had been previously made known that an Adjournment Debate on British Governments assistance for supporting Sri Lanka was also listed to have been taken up for discussion on Tuesday, 13th November, 2007 in the British House of Commons. However, this Debate did not take place as the Liberal Democratic Party Member, Hon. Simon Hughes was not present in the House due to personal reasons. In anticipation of this Debate and to provide an update on developments in Sri Lanka, I had also arranged to use my presence in London, to meet with the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Lord Malloch Brown as well as the shadow Foreign Ministers, namely the Conservative Party shadow Minister for Trade and Foreign Affairs, Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown and the Liberal Democratic Party shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Michael Moore, shadow Secretary of State for Defence of the Conservative Party, Dr. Liam Fox and the Co-Chair of the UK All Party Parliamentary Group on Sri Lanka, Andrew Love of the Labour Party and Barry Gardiner, a Member of the group also of the Labour

Party. The basis for identifying these personalities was as they represented those charged with the subject of foreign affairs across party lines in the British Parliament, the All Party Parliamentary Group on Sri Lanka (APPG - SL) and those representing constituencies had a large Sri Lankan diaspora in their constituencies. I must state that my discussions with all these Members reveal one salient factor; they are not willing in any manner to be part of a process that sometimes emanates in the House. , . In our discussions the following positions concerning Sri Lanka were made by my interlocutors. It must be emphasized that the three parties are in agreement of the serious threat posed by LTTE terrorism to Sri Lanka. Secondly, it does also recognize the need for a speedy agreement for a political settlement to the present conflict and that the Sri Lankan political parties must shun differences to unite on this issue. Thirdly, their perception through statements emanating from Colombo was that Sri Lanka seems to be seeking a military solution to the conflict which is unsustainable in their opinion. Since a large and active Tamil diaspora in the UK shares this view, it has come to be reflected in the representations of the Members of Parliament on behalf of their constituents. Fourthly, referring to the past Debate on Sri Lanka held in May 2007, it was noted that even Front Bench Members of Parliament had not reflected accurately their party positions and were swayed by the pressures of their constituents. Political party leaderships are unable to dictate positions to be taken by Members of Parliament but give them guidelines as UK is a vibrant democracy. , , . , , . , ; . , , , .

, , . I made it clear to all representatives that the Government of Sri Lanka is not seeking a military solution to the present conflict, and that the All Party Representative Committee had come a long way in evolving a Southern consensus on the political settlement that would be offered. I also pointed out that the current pre-occupation with the Budget Debate has necessitated us to move away in terms of the deliberations at the APRC and no sooner the Budget Debate is concluded, a political settlement in terms of structured proposals will be finalized. It should be remembered that the political proposals to be announced, are not only to satisfy the LTTE, but to safeguard the interests of all communities in Sri Lanka. While the Government is hopeful that the LTTE would use this opportunity to return to the negotiating table, the growing alternate Tamil voices both within Sri Lanka and the diaspora abroad need greater recognition of the international community. It was noted that already 54 per cent of the Tamils in Sri Lanka live in areas outside the Northern and the Eastern Provinces in harmony with the Sinhalese, Muslims and other communities. Detailing the measures taken by the Government to institute inquiries into the alleged human rights violations, it was stressed that the Government was committed to punish whoever was found guilty of committing such offences. Referring to the recent statement issued by the All Party Parliamentary Group for Tamils condemning the killing of Tamilselvan and expressing sympathy, it would seem inappropriate that at this time when there was a growing consensus on the need to eradicate terrorism worldwide, the Members of the British Parliament were expressing condolences on the demise of the second highest ranking leader of the LTTE - a proscribed terrorist organization in the United Kingdom. . 2001 , , . . I emphatically appealed to British MPs not to queer the pitch by making such statements, largely based on propaganda of the LTTE, as this makes it more difficult, the task of the Sri Lanka Government bringing about a consensus with other political parties within Sri Lanka to end the conflict and also engaging with the international community towards this end. , .
