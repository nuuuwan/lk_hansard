ut ENGLISH TEXT OF THE SPEECH

A SPEECH MADE BY HON. DINESH GUNAWARDENA, MINISTER OF URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND SACRED AREAS DEVELOPMENT DURING THE ADJOURNMENT DEBATE ON SRI LANKACHINESE FRIENDSHIP HELD ON 8TH FEBRUARY 2007 Hon. Deputy Speaker, We take this opportunity, on the occasion of the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and the Peoples Republic of China, to send our warm and good wishes of the Parliament of Sri Lanka to the Peoples Republic of China.

343 344

Relations between Sri Lanka and China began in the time of the emperor Xiao Ping of the Han dynasty, and the two states had close relations at the time of the Ming emperors. It is with honour that it is recorded that, in the era when Sri Lanka was a developed state, we united to spread the achievements of the Chinese people to the rest of the world. In particular, relations with Chinese government, architects, builders, craftsmen and merchants during the construction of the Raja Maha Vihara in the Yapahuwa kingdom in Sri Lanka, is recorded as great achievements in the friendship between the two nations. The manner of Sri Lanka and China friendship several centuries ago is proven by the Buddhist activities and ancient Chinese coins found on the grounds of the Yapahuwa Raja Maha Vihara in excavations. The Peoples Government of 1956 led by the late Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike established diplomatic relations with friendly nations and especially between Sri Lanka and China on 7th February 1957. It is now fifty years since then. This historic decision taken by the late Hon. Bandaranaike has given strength and blessing not merely to Sri Lanka Chinese friendship, but also to the political, economic, social and cultural development of Sri Lanka. Before that, the signing of the ChinaSri Lanka RubberRice Agreement by minister the Hon. R.G. Senanayake in 1951 was an important step. However, diplomatic relations were not established between the two countries at that time. It was in 1957 that the people of this country were able to carry out that historic task. It is an important historical fact that the Communist Party leader Mao Ze-Dong and Prime Minister Zhou En-Lai gave leadership to the Chinese revolution of 1949, which set China on a new course. China was thereby able to lead Asia and the World on a new course. On this occasion I should particularly like to mention the diverse ways in which Chinese economic aid was received by the Sri Lanka people. Notably, at the time that Mrs. Bandaranaike was Prime Minister, the Bandaranaike Memorial Conference Hall was gifted by the Chinese people so that Sri Lanka could emerge onto International stage. The Hulftsdorp Courts Complex is an equally important symbol. It was not merely various buildings and highway, irrigation and electrical systems, but also the Proposed performance arts centre is Colombo are important landmark contributions made by China to the development of the cultural heritage of this country. Official visits to China by Prime Minister Hon. Sirimavo Bandaranaike, and later by President J. R. Jayewardena, President R. Premadasa and President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga further developed out friendly ties. The forthcoming official visit to China by HE President Mahinda Rajapaksa will be another historic occasion and on the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations with China. In this manner the leaders of Sri Lanka have given continuous support to the process of strengthening ties with the Chinese people. Hon. Deputy Speaker, I should like to mention the then Member of Parliament for Avissawella, your mother and mine (Madam Kusuma Gunawardena) who became the founding Chair of the Lanka- China Friendship Society in 1951. Hon. S. D. Bandaranaike was one of its principal leaders. The visit to China by a delegation of left leaders as Philip Gunawardena, S. D. Bandaranaike, H. G. S. Ratnaweera, N. Shanmugathason and Edmund Samarakkody, in 1951 strengthened the friendly ties with the progressive people, the trade unions and other organizations and paved the way for establishing diplomatic relations. While we remember all these people, I should like to take this opportunity on this fifteenth anniversary of Sri Lankan-Chinese ties to honor them, especially former MP, Hon. S. D. Bandaranaike, who acted like a giant. As an MP, he was sent to China officially by Prime Minister Bandaranaike to begin this process. The junior minister for foreign affairs at the time, Hon. T. B. Subasinghe, gave equal support to speeding up this process. It is because of this that we are able to commemorate 50 years of Sri Lanka- China diplomatic relations on this occasion. We have progressed by half a century. On this occasion I am moving this motion not merely as a Minister of Government, but also as a representative of the Mahajana Eksath Preramuna. The people of this country have been able to gain fruits of this victory because the Chinese people, the Chinese Government, the Chinese Communist Party and its leaders have acted as a true friend in our progress and our social elevation, and to protect our independence and sovereignty. Before concluding my speech, I would like to quote a section of the speech that the Minister of Agriculture and food in the 1956 Government, Hon. Philip Gunawadena stated at the international meeting of the Food and Agriculture Organization in 1958 :

Before ending my Speech, I should remind you of one further fact. We are today participating in an international conference in which rice is being discussed. However, the main producer and exporter of rice in the world is not among us. This is like staging Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark. The folly of excluding Peoples China from international for a is emphasized in conferences such as this. It is my sincere hope that the Peoples Republic of China will receive its just and rightful place within the United Nations organization, before the next conference on rice is held by the FAO. Since 1957, in this manner, the Sri Lanka Government had given its due support to gain for China its rightful place in the United Nations. The country with the highest economic growth rate in the world at present is China. With its economic growth rate of over 10% and having the largest population in the world, China has become the economy with the greatest growth and can exert a tremendous effect on the world economy. While noting these achievements of this great friendly nation, we are also justifiably proud of theirs. That is why all of us in the Sri Lanka Parliament are joining hands to extend our warm greetings to them. Not only the Revolution in China under the leadership of Mao Zedong but also the 1978 economic reform of Deng Xiao Ping carried out by the Communist Party of China, aimed at achieving socialism with Chinese characteristics great victories. A Great victory dawned on the Chinese people, as China entered an era of rapid economic growth. The statistics thereafter prove Chinas huge victory as the poverty level which stood at 53% was reduced to 8% last year. That was a great event for the world and a proud occasion for us. At the same time, China has increased its international trade with friendly nations, and has especially aided small countries as a true friend at every occasion. It should be stated at this point that the friendship of the government of China holds a special position in out foreign relations. In need not be repeated that many of the worlds inventions came from China. Great inventions from ancient China were Paper, compass, gunpowder ; Printing changed the whole world ; Silk and the Historic Silk Road ; Fireworks, Porcelain were invented in China ; Treating of tea was invented in China. But today china has advanced much more than what other countries thought. China has today launched its first satellite. Don fan hong was launched after two and a half decades, making China the 5th space faring nation. The manned space programme began in 1968. China became the third country which put a man in space in 2004. Chinas victory covers many areas from science and technology and advancement in many fields. Hon. Deputy Speaker, on this Occasion I would like to propose wishing the Chinese government and the Chinese people our good wishes, that the Chinese Government under the leadership of President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao will gain many more victories and with friendly countries China will be one of the principal countries transforming the world to a better one. May I conclude with the wishes that China - Sri Lanka friendship will continue to grow stronger and stronger in the future.

(

) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama - Minister of Foreign Affairs) Hon. Speaker, it is indeed a great pleasure for me to join in a very important commemoration Debate today in terms of the Adjournment Motion on completion of 50 years of diplomatic relations between the Peoples Republic of China and Sri Lanka.

We are indeed happy as a country to have maintained a very cordial and a friendly relationship in every respect with this great nation, the Peoples Republic of China. If we may recall the historical backdrop of our relationship, Hon. Speaker, our history speaks well of several milestones that have today cemented our ties without any blemish or fear of a break down but only successful completion in the annals of history bringing about diplomatic and historical relationships to the height in which today we are discussing this Motion in this august Assembly. In the year 1949 after this great country was declared as the Peoples Republic of China, the then Ceylon ordered the closure of Kuo Ming Tang Consulate in Colombo in December 1949. By January 1950, Ceylon had extended diplomatic recognition to the new Peoples Republic of China. Sri Lankas earliest contacts with China date back to 206 BC during the Han Dynasty in the reign of Emperor Ping-ti. Thirteen missions were sent to China by the Kings of Sri Lanka between 13 AD and 989 AD. In 401 AD, a Chinese monk, Fa Hsien of the Eastern Jin Dynasty came to Sri Lanka to study the Buddhist scriptures. He wrote a book titled Accounts of Buddhist Kingdoms. In 428 AD a Sri Lankan King sent a model of the Sacred Tooth Relic Shrine to the Chinese Emperor. In 527 AD, another King sent an ambassador to the Chinese Emperors Court. During the Tang Dynasty, 618 AD to 907 AD, several Chinese monks visited Sri Lanka to learn Theravada Buddhism. Fragments of Chinese bowls and coins unearthed in Sri Lanka which were analyzed in 1925 show that most of the coins belong to the Tang Dynasty. During the Ming Dynasty, 1368 AD to 1644 AD, the Island was visited by Admiral Zheng Ho. An inscription regarding his visit presently lies in the National Museum in Colombo. One of the greatest emperors of the Southern Kingdoms of China, Liang Wu Ti of the Liang Dynasty was himself a Buddhist. Now, this is the backdrop, Hon. Speaker, through which we built up our historical ties. What is the other country that can be equally compared with China in these respects? That is why we are proud to call China as one of our oldest friends and a friend that has understood Sri Lanka well in terms of our own perspective and as a friend who has always been with us in need and remains a friend who is always promoting our well-being as a nation

377 378

in matters both in the Asian context and the global context. Therefore, we have to complement our relationship with several reciprocal arrangements that we have now brought in in order to have a wider dimension to our historic relationship that has brought us to this level of development. In the bilateral relationship in the political sphere, the establishment of links with China in the distant past was a significant initiative on the part of the rulers of Sri Lanka and we were one of the first countries in Asia to undertake such initiatives. It could be said that through Buddhism Sri Lanka made an impact on diplomacy and that is because China reciprocated equally recognizing our stand and our cultural linkage with Buddhism. As the repository of the Theravada Doctrine, Sri Lanka attracted pilgrims and scholars from other countries as well. On the economic side, the signing of the historic Rice-Rubber Pact in 1951 during the time of late Prime Minister D.S. Senanayakes Government took a new dimension which marked the solidarity between the two countries and the political developments of that era were also extremely beneficial to both countries given their urgent needs at that time. Now, this Rice-Rubber Pact is one of the unique features of our relationship and also one of the landmark developments in terms of our economic ties. We needed rice and they needed rubber as an industrial country and this Pact came in as barter trade that was established at that time and was a significant development in terms of bilateral economic ties. With that background, in the political arena Sri Lanka and China have consistently worked together in the international fora on many issues. Sri Lanka has remained a steadfast friend and in response to the question my learned Friend, the Hon. Bimal Ratnayake posed as to whether we maintain the one China policy, as the Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka, I state that we maintain the one China policy in our relationship with China. There is no dispute on that. There is no debate on that. That is how we have worked and we have reciprocated to this great nation and we believe in that as much as we want Sri Lanka to remain as one country. That is why we are advocating against terrorism. That is why we have taken a stand against terrorism and that is why His Excellency the President, Mahinda Rajapaksa has gone on record saying, We will bring a political solution to the problem whilst standing against terrorism as much as the other countries are advocating us. That is the policy that Sri Lanka is advocating and promoting. As the Minister of Foreign Affairs, I will take that policy forward and I will see that the international community recognizes us with better clarity and understanding in terms of our own perspective and objectives. This is how we are trying to fashion our foreign policy and that would remain as much as we are committed to one-China policy. One Sri Lanka policy would remain in the history and the future of our nation as well.

Then I would like to move on to address the economic relationship that has now triggered and propped up into a greater height because of the generosity that has been displayed by China. I must cite how much the landscape of Sri Lanka and the skyline of Colombo have changed due to the reciprocities of the Chinese benevolence. We cannot forget the immense generosity that was displayed by China in gifting the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall, BMICH, as an edifice towards our friendship, which stands well above the ground in the landscape of Colombo, the capital city of Sri Lanka. Another is the Superior Courts complex. Hon. Speaker, having been the Minister of Justice, Law Reforms and National Integration at one time, you would recall the value of that complex, admire the quality of that building and the speed in which that building was constructed. Today, the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal of Sri Lanka stand well in the administration of justice because we have been well sheltered and provided. Also, it has catered to the needs of our judiciary and we must compliment the Chinese Government on that account. Together with that, the recently opened Central Mail Exchange about which my learned Friend, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem made special mention yesterday at the time of the issuance of the stamp to mark the completion of 50 years of diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka, can also be mentioned. The Central Mail Exchange from where the mail is dispatched has become a fast action location today. We must thank the Chinese Government for the generosity that they have extended. Many other contributions also have been made by the People's Republic of China to spearhead the infrastructure development of several villages and hospitals. We are also trying to turn a new page in infrastructure development in the future. One is power generation. For the first time in Sri Lanka we are having a coal power generation plant at the highest level, the Norachcholai Coal Power Plant. We have got several coal power plants at the private sector level. But this time a Government to Government power project is taking off the ground in order to address the needs of the energy sector in Sri Lanka. We must appreciate the benevolence, generosity, assistance and the support that the Chinese Government is extending to Sri Lanka for its future prosperity. We are also looking for greater co-operation in respect of the investment drive. Having been the Minister of Enterprise Development and Investment Promotion at one time, I know that we have special focus on Chinese investment and development because we need the type of investment that a big country like China can bring into Sri Lanka. That is how we can achieve the US Dollars 1000 million goal that I set for the investment drive of Sri Lanka in the year 2006. We must realize that target in the

[ ]

2007 08 379 380

year 2007. I am going to extend the highest co-operation for it through the bilateral relations that we are going to build up with countries like that of China in order to get this gap filled. This is how we are looking at the investment drive.

The Chinese entrepreneurship, investment, industry and the service sector are all going to be a major presence in the Sri Lankan soil and that is where we can ignite our economy and the Chinese co-operation is most needed for that. We are happy to see the reciprocation extended by the Chinese private companies which are currently looking at Sri Lanka as a destination for development of the investment drive.

Also, the agreement for the construction of a highway between the Katunayake International Airport and Colombo has been signed up with a Chinese company and we look forward to developing the Southern Port of Hambantota with the assistance and extension of the credit line that will come from the Peoples Republic of China. The oil storage and bunkering facilities will also get augmented under the Hambantota development programme. His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa is now very much pursuing with the bilateral relations that we have established. Then, Hon. Speaker, once again you will have to be cited as the one- time Minister of Cultural Affairs if I may say about the cultural ties in which you are very well versed with and the Chinese co-operation that was instilled into our culture. Hon. Speaker, I am particularly happy that the stamp we issued yesterday reflected two great world wonders. One is the Great Wall of China alongside the Sigiriya, the rock that we claim another world wonder. And these two can be matched so well. The only difference is that Sigiriya is 1000 years ahead of the Great Wall of China. It also must be said as to how we had progressed at that time. When it is said that this is a world wonder we can match these two great edifices to show the parity between China and Sri Lanka. And in terms of our historical development, infrastructure, trade and the other cultural values, Buddhism becomes the foremost attraction between the two countries. Then, Sir, when it comes to the co-operation that we have, the Hon. Minister of Cultural Affairs is seated by me, he and I will be shortly visiting China. The National Performing Arts Theatre in Colombo soon will come off the ground and it will add to the skyline of Colombo and that again is a great benevolence that is demonstrated by the Peoples Republic of China. The land is ready for the construction and now there is the question of getting the actual development work started with the identification of the civil contractors and so on. We have to appreciate all these trends that have emerged in the past. The landmarks have been built up as a result of Chinese support and assistance and we must appreciate the co-operation between the two countries.

Then, another development which is very much relevant to this discussion in the House today is the completion of 50 years of diplomatic relations with China. Now, Sir, the main aspect that I see as the Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka is that each country respects each others policies. There is no interference in the policy framework. China has always remained a respected friend of ours who respects our line of thinking, our culture, our value-based judgements, our pursuits, our political desires and our international presence. That is why we have come to recognize the Peoples Republic of China on the one-China policy throughout our diplomatic relations and our foreign policy for that matter is a major step that we have taken right throughout. We never compromise that position and I am sure the Chinese Government is very much aware of our stand on that.

The year 2007 is going to unfold several major developments. In regard to diplomatic ties, we have a long history. In this contemporary relationship we have got a major milestone that is being unfolded. To commemorate the 50 years of diplomatic relations His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa has been invited on a State visit to the Peoples Republic of China beginning on the 26th of this month . During this State visit there is going to be several exchanges in economic and cultural ties enhancing our relationship for the prosperity of the people of Sri Lanka. And we must appreciate beforehand the efforts taken by the Peoples Republic of China in inviting our President for this State visit with a request to bring along with him a business delegation, a political delegation and a ministerial delegation that would ultimately make this visit a very fruitful and a development-oriented one. In this regard, a significant factor that I would like to cite here once again is that a Samadhi Buddha Statue will be presented to the Lingguang Temple in China by our President and also the Government of Sri Lanka will donate a baby elephant named Migara to symbolize the commemoration of this important milestone.

With this State visit that is being contemporaneously planned, we look forward to bringing about economic prosperity to our country by addressing our trade issues. China is a major market nowhere can we find. My learned Friend, the Hon. Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena is reiterating the need for me to once again emphasise on the Buddhist Statue to Lingguang Temple which I mentioned, Sir. The major intervention of the Minister of Cultural Affairs in this regard helped us to facilitate this process and, Sir, this visit will be marked as one of the major milestones in our future relationship with China.

May I now take this opportunity to wish a lasting relationship and a friendship between Sri Lanka and China.

Thank you.
