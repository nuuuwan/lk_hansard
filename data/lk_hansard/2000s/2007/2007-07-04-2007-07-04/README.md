With regard to (b) (i), there is a schedule. I can give it to you. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) My question is what is the subsidy that the Government gives for the fuel itemspetrol, diesel, furnaces oil, kerosene oil and aviation fuel. If you can give the subsidy that is enough. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) There is no subsidy now. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No subsidy given ? . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) No, there is no subsidy given. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That means, the Government does not subsidize any of these items ? . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) The Government does not subsidize any of these items. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) In regard to (C) (iii) - . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) In regard to (C) (iii), We encash and take it to CPC Account.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, my first Supplementary Question is, that the world oil prices have been dipping over the last couple of months and it seems to be having a drop now. But this Government has increased prices unconscionable. I mean the price of kerosene has been increased by 31 per cent. So what is the justification for such unjust increases, Hon. Minister ? . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) We are now charging the actual price. Earlier we were subsidizing. We were subsidizing kerosene at Rs. 23.60. Now we cannot subsidize because there is no subsidy given by the Government from last July and thereby last year we have lost Rs. 1.7 billion whereas we have made Rs. 7.7 billion in the previous year, 2005. Therefore we are unable to continue losing. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, Hon. Minister, what you are saying is that there is going to be another increase in prices have been - . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) I do not think there will be an immediate increase in prices. Even during the last two months we did not increase. We lost more than Rs. 2 billion just because we did not increase the process. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The second Question, the Hon. Minister, is that during the election campaign is was alleged that the President had a very good relationship with the Middle Eastern countries and that he will ensure that that friendship will be used to purchase oil and all that free of charge, if not a very concessionary prices. What has happened to that friendship, now ? . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) The friendship has nothing to do with this because this is the OPEC price and you have to buy at the OPEC price. Anybody can give - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I know the reality is spoken by you but the nonsense that was spoken then removing the plugs and all those things. Nothing of those - (Interruption)

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) That friendship was used for various other things, not to purchase oil. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It is revealed by you, now. ( ) (The Hon.

I would like to submit some reports to the Hon. Minister. The Alternative Energy in Developing Countries : New UN Report states, I quote: A United Nations environment agency survey has revealed the potential for renewable energy in some of the worlds developing countries is much greater than previously thought. The UN Environment Agency (UNEP)'s four-year project to map the solar and wind resources of 13 countries has discovered thousands of megawatts of new renewable energy... This could solve the fuel crisis in developing and developed countries. It also states, I quote: Small countries also have surprising potential. Sri Lanka has a wind power potential of 26,000 megawatts, which is 10 times higher than the countrys installed electricity capacity. I do not know whether the CEB or the officers and experts in your Ministry have thought how to use this, how to harness this and how the private sector is going to use this. It is a very sad situation. It further states, I quote: Instead of always importing petroleum they would have domestic resources so they would save on the costs and risks of having petroleum prices fluctuate wildly. Hon. Minister, our country has got all the resources. Nature has given us that. Neither the politicians nor the officers can grumble about it. It is our fault, the politicians and the officers and not of the poor people. Do not put the blame on the people. If you take the renewable energy power projects that are in operation, there are 875 micro-hydropower projects identified by a British company. Out of that only 132 are in operation. There are 200 mini-hydropower projects identified, out of which 22 are in operation. There are eight wind energy power projects identified by this British company and one is in operation. The Haycarb Company uses dendro power - I will give you the details - and more than 600 megawatts of power can be generated from dendro energy. The Hon. Minister of Agriculture told me that in his massive rice factory - the monopoly in Polonnaruwa - 100 per cent of energy is generated from today. If you take biomass, you can generate 50 megawatts of power. Biomass and paddy husks generate about 15 megawatts of power. Bio mass and saw dust generate 10 megawatts of power and biomass and coconut shells generate about 20 megawatts of power. If we generate power through these methods there will be no pollution today. If you take the Haycarb factory, they have developed a technology where there is no smoke and pollution in their generation of power and they are also generating their own power. I saw in one of yesterdays newspapers that an Israeli company had come to Sri Lanka and signed an agreement to generate electricity from sea waves. The University of Moratuwa - I do not know whether you know - has done a research on the generation of electricity using the sea waves. That is to pump the water up into the tanks using the power of sea waves and then generate power. We should use these technologies. Why do we go for money and commissions?

2007 04 2151 2152

Let us blame ourselves. I, as a politician feel sorry and ashamed of myself because there is no plan in our country. Since 1999, we have had nine elections. How many national plans have we brought before this Parliament? Every government is trying to bring their own "chintana". When I was the Minister of Irrigation and Water Management, Dr. U.V. Rathnayake-[Interruption.] Hon. Minister, my time is limited.

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne) I will not take long. The purpose of this Authority is to develop renewable energy. Thank you very much for highlighting these. Our whole purpose is to improve renewable energy. All this time there had not been any specific Authority for this.

( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) All right, let me speak. You take down whatever I say. We have approved and implemented hundreds of boards. Let us see how they are going to perform in our country. That is what I am trying to show you. I will give you the facts and figures. Do not disturb me. Dr. U.V. Rathnayake - I do not know whether he is working in your Ministry now - gave me a Report on Wind Power when I was the Minister of Irrigation and Water Management. I have that Report. The Report says that Ambewela, Narakkali near Kalpitiya are the best and most promising areas for wind power. What have we done in that regard? Then, there is another report which I want to bring to your notice.

During the monsoon we can get the wind power from the regions of the South, the West and the North and even in the mountain areas we can generate power by small turbines. We should encourage such things which we are not doing. There are sites in the Puttalam region that show good signs for wind power projects. There are nearly eight to ten sites which are suitable for wind power projects. But only one project has been identified which is in Hambantota. This is a sad situation. At least additional 100 megawatts or may be 200 megawatts could be generated by harnessing these. Then we have the sea waves also. Why not we get technology from the Moratuwa University? They have done research. But our people do not want to use the skills of our own engineers, may be because of petty mindedness or jealousy. But, they go to other countries and use their skills. It is a very sad situation, Hon. Minister. You should also know what the Moratuwa University has done. It is very simple. If you want I will give you the article also. It is about the technology of using sea waves to generate power. Let us work on this. If you are going to do this you have to prepare a plan. Money is not the problem in this. I have experience as a Chief Minister. You do not have to submit project plans or

project proposals to the international donors. You can arrange a loan scheme with a low interest rate and encourage the private sector and the villagers with or whatever it is, to start their own mills by generating power. This is what you should do; prepare project proposals. It is not happening. If you take dendro power, one of the richest plantations are using it. I will give you the report and you will be surprised. I am going to submit it to you with facts and figures.

Why do you not consult Dr. Ray Wijewardena who is one of the pioneers in this country whom we should respect. He is the man who made the mini- chopper and the first Land Master in this country. He was my neighbour. When I was young he was living in his land in Bopitiya. While he was going in his vehicle he used to shave. For him time was precious. I spoke to him in the morning also. He guides the people. He gives them the know-how. You should use the knowledge of such people.

Then, take Hayleys Haycarb factory. There is a young engineer. When I was the Chief Minister I got his services. He is Mr. Ananda Hettiarachchi, a young, genius engineer. Hon. Minister you should go to Madampe. Do not wait in the Ministry. You should go to the Haycarb factories at Madampe and Badalgama. They are using not only coconut shells in the generation of power but it is also the pioneer factory in this country which used watahiriya to generate dendro power. They have stopped getting power from the CEB terminal. Today, they are buying it at Rs. 2,500 a ton. You should encourage them. They are buying from the agents. They have not planted one single hectare. The people are supplying. So, work out a system. You alone cannot do that. What you should do is, you should get together with the Ministry of Plantation Industries, Ministry of Agricultural Development and Agrarian Services, the Coconut Cultivation Board and the Ministry of Livestock Development. There should be a task force of these Ministries. Hon. Minister you cannot do it alone though you are creating empires in this country. You should have a task force for the Ministries. Give targets to these Ministries and then implement this. Let the message go. I will give you the details. Then you will be shocked.

You should arrange loan schemes and the know-how should be given to the people. There is the private sector. We do not want foreign companies. Our people want to have thermal power. They are getting good commissions. We know that and our Hon. Minister knows that too. This is a very sad situation in this country. It goes from top to bottom. Everything is like that.

When you talk of electricity generation, there is a concept called Green Energy Label Concept". Electricity generation by hydropower system is one of the

2153 2154

[ ]

sustainable systems approved, recommended and selected by the world under the Green Energy Label Concept. That is accepted because there is no pollution. So, why do you not use this system? I have a document of the Haycarb Group which contains the facts and figures of the dendro energy. It states, I quote:

Why does Sri Lanka need Dendro Energy? The energy crisis. Sri Lanka needs at least 150 MW to be added to the generation capacity every year to meet the projected 7-8 per cent growth in demand for electricity. I may be right or wrong. Then it further states, I quote:

We have nearly exhausted all hydro capacity except for about 200 MW of Mini Hydro. We have the Upper Kotmale Hydropower Project. But, I do not know whether the Uma Oya Hydropower Project will be implemented or not. There are mini-hydropower projects. I will give you the details. I do not know whether this has been submitted to you. When I was the Minister of Irrigation and Water Management, GTZ identified small canals. I do not think that you have the details. I will give them. I will read that document. It states, I quote: The requirement of Foreign exchange for net import of petroleum fuels already exceed the total earning from export of tea, and will surpass all FE earnings from Tea, Rubber and Coconut by year 2008. Today, we are spending for fuel more than tea, rubber and coconut. The price of it will increase again. The demand is high for fuel. This document further states, I quote:

The opportunity and benefits. The supply of fuel wood can be a major boon to rural farmers as a subsidiary income by part-time activity. The target of the Haycarb is 1000 megawatts. They are targeting to make 1000 megawatts. I will give you the details. It further states, I quote : We target 1000 MW by year 2015 which will pump in Rs. 15 billion annually to the rural economies.The availability of foliage from the Dendro plantations will overcome the main barrier for the development of the dairy industry. The dairy industry is based on the green leaf. - .

Again, I quote: The above target will generate enough fodder to produce 2700 million litres of milk with a value of Rs. 81,000 million. The use of the foliage or the dung from the dairy farms is equivalent to 400,000 tons of urea annually The use of foliage or dung from the dairy farms would produce 400,000 tons of urea by this company annually, with a market value of Rs. 2,800 million. The above avenues will generate an income of Rs. 235,000 per year for a family having one hectare of dendro plantation and six cows, Hon. Minister. What is Samurdhi? What is poverty alleviation? This is poverty alleviation. Our country is suffering because we take loans from the World Bank and trying to alleviate our proverty strickent people. We have to pay this money back. Let us create our own system of self-economic development like in India. A family with one hectare of dendro plantation and six cows would be able to earn an income of Rs. 235,000 per year from the sale of milk.. By integrating this with the Samurdhi project we could alleviate abject poverty of 10 per cent of the population in Sri Lanka in 10 years. The distributed generation of electricity will reduce the transmission losses which is currently nearly 20 per cent. If we promote private sector investments on 5 to 25 megawatt small power generation plants it will promote centres of economic activities in rural areas and the burden on the State for investments in the energy sector will be minimized. Why should the state sector take that responsibility? You should be there to decide and prepare policies of this country. , . ; . . That should be your policy. Hon. Minister, there is a Cabinet decision dated 7th September, 2005 on "What needs to be done". It is to grant a tariff of Rs.8.50 per kilowatt-hour for the first 50 megawatts from dendro power projects. Power plants with capacities less than 5 megawatt would require a contribution of Rs. 3 per kilowatt-hour from the Government. The megawatt power plant at Walapane - I am very sad to say that when I was the Minister - the Tobacco Company started this project. I am sorry to state that they have stopped this project because subsidies and all that agreed upon were not given.

. . .

( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne) That was paid [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) I am so glad, then. Very good. I am glad, Hon. Minister. We respect you. So maintain that respect and reputation. For this purpose only Rs. 25 million is

2007 04 2155 2156

needed per year. What is Rs. 25 million? Hon. Minister, you direct the Treasury to provide that Rs. 25 million, immediately. There should be State commitment to generate 50 per cent of future thermal-based generation from dendro resources and CEB should be given a firm directive to achieve this target. There should be a proactive role by the CEB to streamline the approval process and development of the grid to accept the dendro power generated in the rural sector. Give the authority to the Kuliyapitiya regional office. Likewise you decentralize it. Do not centralize. Decentralize this. Then, development of the dendro plantations. Targets have been set by the Coconut Cultivation Board as per the Cabinet decision to declare Gliricidia as a national plantation crop in this country. Action must be taken to encourage awareness programmes in order to make the people realize that this plantation generates income. If you come to Katugampola, closer to my home you could see the types of plants that I have planted. That is the way we have to do it. Intensify that. We do not get gems as you get from Ratnapura. We do not suck the soil and suck gems. We plant trees and get fruits out of that. That is our policy. We go in a nature-friendly way. We do not tap the rivers, drill and suck the gems and damage the environment. We do not do that, Hon. Minister - [Interruption.] No, when you are laughing, I have to counter attack you. Hon. Minister, I am an environment-friendly politician. You go to Kurunegala and see the trees that I have planted. Your CEB contractors cut those and I have to go there and shout at them. I am still planting trees though I am in the Opposition. I get the private sector to plant trees along the roads. That is my way, my policy. . . .

( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne) Even in Ratnapura we promote environment-friendly programmes.

( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) Very good. That is what I say, Hon. Minister. I will give you the details. Power generation 1,000 megawatts. If you do that and cultivate 1,000 hectares or whatever the extent required to generate this power, it will help milk production, save foreign exchange and alleviate poverty. One hectare of dendro can feed six cows. They will earn an income of Rs. 235,000 from the sale of milk. Not only that. The total potential milk production will be 2700 million litres per family and if they sell at Rs. 30 per litre, they will be getting Rs. 81 billion. So, Hon. Minister -

( ) (The Presiding Member) , . .

( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) Then I will go on to solar power. Hon. Minister, we should encourage the use of more solar power among small people and the use of this power in factories. The Government must arrange good solar power companies to be established. An "SLS" quality certificate has to be given. Otherwise the poor people will be affected as they get the money to obtain solar power by taking loans. Hon. Minister, take the energy-saving bulbs for instance. We say the energy-saving bulbs save energy. Give these bulbs to every house with the cost to be recovered on a monthly basis, then energy could be saved. Hon. Minister now what is happening is, they have to go to the CEB office to obtain this facility and waste their time.. Make it compulsory for every householder - [Interruption.] Hon. Minister, you implement it. You do an awareness programme on how energy-saving bulbs can save nearly 30 per cent of energy. You make it compulsory. See that people are made aware of this. Give the people bulbs and recover from their monthly CEB bills.

. . .

( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne) It will not be successful for the reason that you cannot compel people to use a particular bulb. But we are trying to persuade the people to buy the CFL bulb and use it. Now, we are doing that. We are in the process of doing it. If possible we are trying to distribute a bulb to each house.

( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) I am also a consumer. Hon. Minister, you have to create awareness among the people and give the bulbs. Today the electricity cost is the biggest problem for a family. So, Hon. Minister, try to do it. Do not say, cannot, never say cannot. You see, this is the problem with the politicians. I never say, I cannot. Create a system. You can never be a good politician if you say, cannot. What is this? , . ?

. . .

( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne) , .

( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) "cannot" . Start from that. Think of a practical way of implementing it.

2157 2158

( ) (The Presiding Member) .

( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) . Take the mini-hydropower projects in Sri Lanka. The Intermediate Technology Development Group, a South East Asia and U.K. based NGO, has identified 875 projects, which I told you earlier also. So encourage these mini-hydropower projects. Give them loans and facilities to start these projects. .

. . . . . . . , . When you spoke in Parliament last time on a matter relating to your Ministry, you yourself said that corruption in the CEB is phenomenal and you are finding it difficult to control it. That is not good enough because it is your responsibility. If you do not act we will have to face a huge crisis where you will not have enough electricity, the prices will be too high, the people will not be able to afford it and the whole industry will collapse. The CEB will collapse and this will be a huge damage to the country, to the industry and to the people. Already, the breakdowns are growing. I do not know whether you are doing load shedding because you are having a shortage. In an area like Deniyaya, on a daily basis we have two to three hour power failures. This is not a thing that happens once a week or once a month. It happens daily. Sometimes we are inclined to believe that the crisis is so severe that you have started load shedding without informing the people. . . , ? , CEB 170 . 170 ? . . ; .

[..1.37] ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees. Basically, the Opposition has no objection to increasing the number of judges from 40 to 60. But, the fact of the matter is whether the infrastructure is ready to accommodate the additional 20. That is a matter that you have to address your mind. You can go on increasing the number of judges but the problem would be whether they have adequate facilities; whether they have housing, manpower and whether the Government can provide them with vehicles and all other requirements. I mean, it is very easy to get a Bill or an Amendment passed here without having the infrastructure in place. This was quite rightly mentioned. What happened in the past, I see has been rectified. But, I do not know whether you are able to cope up with it by adding more numbers. I am sure that in the Budget for the year 2007, additional funds have not been set aside to provide facilities for the additional judges that you are going to appoint to the High Courts to hear the appeals. Then, of course there is a problem with regard to the conduct or the legal culture in this country. It has been often found that our culture is a question of postponement. At every turn, may be the lawyers, the litigants, their habit or their way of thinking is how to obtain a postponement of a case when it comes to a hearing. This has to be changed and the first example has to be given by the lawyers. The Bar must set the example by insisting or finding ways and means to see that the laws delays are eliminated. The first step, the initiative has to be taken by the lawyers. Of course, there are litigants who always want to get a case postponed for diverse reasons. For them, they feel that a postponement is the saviour for their problem. You can have courts all over the island. But, there should be lawyers available who are specialized in the various fields in which the client would like to obtain their services. How many of them are available? Very often cases are postponed because there are only a few lawyers who are specialized in the different subjects and invariably they are held up in another court. So, these are some of the matters that the Minister of Justice will have to address his mind and take remedial measures. If not, we will be back in square one. Increasing the number of judges will be of no use unless the attitudes both of the lawyers and the litigants change. Sir, the Hon. Minister was harping on the fact that there is independence of the judiciary in this country. I disagree with that to a certain extent because recently at the UNHCR Conference that was held in Geneva and according to the reports received from Geneva, the Secretary-General of the International Commission of Jurists -ICJ - Nicholas Howen had expressed concern

[ ]

2007 04

about the constitutional paralysis that is damaging the independence of the Sri Lankan institutions including the judiciary and the Judicial Service Commission. So, it is a very serious allegation which is the view of the international community. The ICJ said that in the absence of the Constitutional Council - We cannot blame the Chief Justice or the judges. Now, the problem lies with the Governments failure to set up the Constitutional Council in terms of the Seventeenth Amendment. The President contrary to the Seventeenth Amendment to the Sri Lanka Constitution has made direct appointments to the Judicial Service Commission, - this is where the problem is - the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal and most recently to the post of Attorney-General. Now, these are the comments by the International Commission of Jurists in regard to the independence of judiciary in Sri Lanka. This is a very serious allegation. All that came in one package when the question of violation of human rights surfaced and it went to the highest forum in the international community. So, this is a very serious situation. I do not know how the Hon. Minister could come to this House and make a statement that there is absolute independence of judiciary in this country when daring criticism has been made, allegations have been made by the international community with regard to what is happening in Sri Lanka. We do not blame the judges or the Chief Justice. On the contrary, the Chief Justice must be commended for pushing the Ministry to appoint more and more judges in order to avoid laws delays. But in the international fora we are being criticized very severely for not practising and not allowing the independence of the judiciary in this country. Now, Sir, quite recently there were very interesting statements being made. I have never seen and never heard such statements in my career as a Member of Parliament or even as a lawyer. The Chief Justice made a statement at the opening of the Civil High Court in Colombo on the 29th of June. Now what did he say? It is very interesting. He says, "The Judiciary does not do shoddy jobs like the Executive." Who is the Executive? The Executive means the President, the Cabinet Ministers, other Ministers and all those who exercise executive powers. It is very interesting. The Chief Justice, Sarath N. Silva has said yesterday that he could proclaim fearlessly that the judiciary does not do shoddy jobs like the Executive. I do not know. When you say, "shoddy", there is something wrong, there is something happening. I cannot understand. The Chief Justice is No. 4 in the protocol list of this country. First comes the President, then comes the Prime Minister, then the Speaker and the Chief Justice. Now he is making certain strictures on the Government. What more does he say? He says, "We do not say one thing today, another tomorrow and something else the day after." To whom is he referring? He is referring to the Government, the Executive. It is a very serious allegation.

I do not know what is happening in this country and how these Ministers are functioning. Unfortunately, none of them are here. If we say something, we do it. We do our part with honesty according to our conscience. It is an indictment on the Government. The Chief Justice is quite correct in what he says, from what you see happening around these days. He goes on to say that the judiciary does an excellent job. There is no doubt. The Chief Justice is doing his very best in order to do his job and his subordinates are following suit. Then, Sir, there are a few more comments that he has made. Another is, he has commented on the conduct of a Minister. You would have seen the other day, there was a lot of information in the newspapers. After a writ was served for messing around with an industrial project in some part of the country, a Minister had tried to instigate people to go and create some damage. The question that the Chief Justice raised was, "Is this Minister a Minister of Development or Destruction?" I cannot understand. He has given a very severe warning to this particular Minister. He has said that if any further complaints are made, he would have no hesitation in taking him to task. We have to appreciate the Chief Justice coming out with these types of comments. I mean never has there been to my knowledge or to my recollection, a situation where a Minister has been reprimanded to this extent. Then he goes on to talk about the police. He says, "The police is responsible for most of these abductions that took place in the past, failing to record statements and delaying the people who came to make statements." It is a very serious indictment. He also says that the police took money from some of these people who were residing in the lodges - you are aware of it - then evicting 300 Tamil people from Colombo and taking them back to the Northern Province. All this surfaced in the court. The courts are inundated today with either writ applications or complaints against violation of human rights. So these things surface daily. The Chief Justice has quite rightly come out with facts of what is happening in this country and which I say is a very sad situation. If the Chief Justice openly says that the Government is working in a shoddy manner or that the Government is telling untruths, I can understand what is going to happen to this country. What is going to happen to the citizens of this country? How can we move ahead, forge ahead as a nation? If the No. 4 in the country openly says that the Government is lying and doing a shoddy job, I do not understand what is going to happen to this country. Then, Sir, there is another serious problem that surfaced during the last couple of days. The Cabinet Paper that was presented at the Cabinet Meeting - the Hon. Dilan Perera is here - sought to re-introduce the Criminal Defamation Law. That was the substance of the Cabinet Paper. When the Cabinet Paper was circulated, the Hon. Dilan Perera was at the Cabinet Meeting but he objected to the Cabinet Paper. He said, " How do I know? I do not know. I have been sent here by the

2195 2196

[ ]

2197 2198

President. The Secretary never consulted me when this Cabinet Paper was put to the Cabinet". That is a very serious situation. Why should the Secretary have overlooked the Minister? After all, he is also designated as the Minister of Justice. He may not have the status of a Cabinet Minister, but the President has told him to go and watch the interest of the Justice Ministry at the Cabinet Meeting. The Secretary did not show him the Cabinet Paper. So, how can this Ministry function? What is the mechanism? The Secretary is bound to consult the Minister and the Cabinet Paper should have been prepared on the instructions of the Minister. He cannot prepare a Cabinet Paper of his own. He is not the Minister. He is not the peoples representative. He is only an executive officer who is in charge of the administration of a ministry. He is not the political arm of the Ministry. So, I felt very sorry for my Friend as he was placed in a very embarrassing situation and luckily for the people and the country, for the media and everybody there were some Ministers who objected to the contents of the Cabinet Paper. The Cabinet Paper was to re-introduce once again the Criminal Defamation Law which the United National Party Government repealed, did away and put aside during the term of the United National Party Government from 2001 to 2003. It was done in 2002. It is a very serious piece of legislation that they were trying to introduce. The worst thing is, having done that and brought in a Cabinet Paper and circulated it , the following day the Government spokesman, the senior members of the Government say, " No, no such paper was brought to the Cabinet. There was no attempt by the Government to re-introduce the Criminal Defamation Law which was taken away by the United National Party." Again an untruth. The Hon. Perera very categorically made a statement to the press and to some others saying that there was a Cabinet Paper that was drafted and brought with regard to the re-introduction of the Criminal Defamation Law which was taken out of the Penal Code during the time of the United National Party. So, these are all contradictory statements. On one side the Minister is kept in the dark. He does not know what is happening in the Ministry. On the other side, here they are trying to bring back that draconian legislation which the entire international community has condemned. Sir, I will read some of the comments that have been made by the international community with regard to the introduction of this law. I will quote a statement from the "Daily Mirror" of 29th June, 2006 by the Free Media Movement under the heading "FMM decries Govt. attempts to bring back defamation law which states: The Free Media Movement yesterday said it was shocked by attempts made by the government to re-introduce criminal defamation laws. So says Sunanda Deshapriya and he goes on to explain what happened to the country when this was invoked by the Chandrika Bandaranaike Government and the harassment that was meted out to journalists and the problems that they had to face. He goes further explaining the dangers of this.

Then, I will quote another statement from the "Daily Mirror" of 29th June, 2006 under the heading Editors Guild condemns attempts to re-impose criminal defamation laws" which states: "The Editors Guild of Sri Lanka yesterday vehemently opposed attempts by the government to re-impose the criminal defamation laws of yesteryear and said this would be a step towards 'stifling the free media in the country.' It further states, I quote : There are many ways to maintain checks on the media. One such method is through a Press Complaints Commission. So, there is the machinery for it. Now, what is the big idea in trying to bring back this legislation or re-introduce this Section 479 of the Penal Code that was amended. Now we would like to have a categorical assurance from the Government today. If there are no Ministers, the subject Minister, the Hon. Dilan Perera can give the assurance that he will not dare to touch the free media in this country by trying to re-introduce this legislation, this particular Section that was taken out by the United National Party Government at that time. I believe it is Section 479 of the Penal Code. I have the amendment here with me.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , . You have only one more minute.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I have half an hour. I was given an extra 10 minutes by the Opposition Whip. So the assurance that we would like to have from the Hon. Minister is that that Section 479 of the Penal Code which was repealed by us would not be brought back. Then, Sir, there are few other matters about the conduct of the Attorney-General. There were very serious comments made in the press, of statements made by the Commission that was appointed by the international community with regard to the actions of the Attorney-General. There were very serious comments made by the IIGEP. Justice Bhagwati who is an 84 year old former Supreme Court Judge issued his first public statement last week suggesting that the Attorney-Generals Department was partial in its conduct in cases coming before the Commission of Inquiry probing human rights volitions in Sri Lanka. That is one comment. Then again the Interim Report of the IIGEP raised concerns about the independence of the Attorney-Generals Department saying that they were faced with

2007 04 2199 2200

6 PL 002260 (2007/07)

serious conflict of interests. These are not comments that should come from an International Committee that has been appointed to look into the human rights violations in Sri Lanka. It also says that the Attorney-General does not defend persons accused of committing offences. Those are the powers of the Attorney-General according to the Sri Lankan law. He also has no right to investigate and so on. All these arose from the 17 aid personnel who were killed in the Mutur incident. I think, Sir, their allegation is that there was an attempt to cover up. There were very serious attempts by the Government to cover up the issue from the day it happened.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , . Hon. Member, please wind up. Your time is over.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I have half an hour.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) You had 20 minutes.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) They have given me an extra 10 minutes from our Partys time, Sir.

. . . , , . . , . . . , , . . , . . . Today is Americas National Day. We wish them well. The United States of America is a very important country for Sri Lanka. At the same time, Sir, I had a glance at the laws that are prevailing in the United States of America with regard to funding of terrorists, supporting terrorists, American nationals who are indulging in the funding of terrorism and also supporting terrorism and the penalties for those offences. It is very important. I think, we will have to take very serious cognizance of this legislation. If there is any American national in Sri Lanka who has been found guilty of attempting to fund terrorists, he falls within the ambit of this law and I think the punishment will be very serious. It goes on to state that not only they are liable for imprisonment but also forfeiture of property whether in Sri Lanka or in that particular country. So, Sir, I hope in regard to the independence of the judiciary we will not have this adverse criticism that was made by the UNHCR. We should get this record straight and prevent this type of treason in the future. Particularly, it is the duty of the Government and His Excellency the President to ensure that the Constitutional Council is put in place as per the Seventeenth Amendment so as to ensure that the the JSC, the Police Commission and all the other Commissions are independent in order to make sure that law and order and the rule of law is prevailing in Sri Lanka. Thank you, Sir.

, . , , . . . . , , I must also reply you, Hon. Sir. You are a Member of Parliament whom I really respect. I have been listening to your speeches since the day you came to Parliament. You were talking about some of the problems that you have in the North and the East. You raised a question as to whether the judges who will be appointed as high court judges will be suitable judges. I must tell you, Sir, that the power of appointing these judges according to the present law of the country lies with the President, but he has to appoint them after the Judicial Service Commission recommends them in consultation with the Attorney-General. So, that procedure will be followed hundred per cent and as most of the Members of Parliament today expressed lot of happiness, gratitude and saluted the Supreme Court, I am sure the learned Chief Justice who is the Chairman of the JSC will definitely nominate the most senior district judges who are suitable to become high court judges. I am sure the Attorney-General also, being a person who has had a long career in the Attorney-Generals Department, who has appeared for numerous cases and done a wonderful job at the Department, will see that suitable people will be appointed to those posts. I have one more thing to say. I was just told by the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle that at the Press Conference held a while ago, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe had given a categorical reply about the
