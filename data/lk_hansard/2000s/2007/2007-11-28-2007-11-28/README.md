( -

, ) (The Hon (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne-Minister of Construction and Engineering Services)

Hon. Speaker, the Regulations made by the Minister of Healthcare and Nutrition under the Medical Ordinance (Chapter 105), published in the Government Gazette bearing No. 1458/16 dated 17th August, 2006 was placed before the House for approval on 3rd October, 2006. As several Members of Parliament objected to various provisions contained therein, the debate stood adjourned. The Regulations were accordingly referred to the Consultative Committee on Healthcare and Nutrition of which I am also a member. The above Regulations were taken up for consideration before the Consultative Committee and the subcommittees of the Consultative Committee on a number of occasions and several discussions were held with the officers of the Sri Lanka Medical Council, representatives of the Attorney-General and also the representatives of the Legal Draftsman.

4 - PL 002766 - (2008/02)

At many of these meetings, the conduct of the President and the Registrar of the Sri Lanka Medical Council had been derogatory and amounted to contempt of Parliament. In fact, by letter dated 3rd October, 2007 I complained to the Hon. Minister of Healthcare and Nutrition of the conduct of the said two officers and requested him to take disciplinary action against them. I refrained from complaining against the said officers to the Committee on Privileges of the breach of privilege of Members of Parliament and contempt of Parliament in the expectation that the Hon. Minister of Healthcare and Nutrition would take necessary remedial steps. I table* as Annex A, a copy of a letter sent by me to the Hon. Minister of Healthcare and Nutrition. Thereafter, Dr. Nonis has called for my explanation on a purported complaint made by one Dr. Sivarajasingham Sivapriyan, which complaint was based on the matters discussed at the aforesaid Consultative Committee and subcommittees of the consultative committees. The actions of Dr. Nonis and Sivarajasingham Sivapriyan are clearly breach of the parliamentary privileges of a Member of Parliament. I table* as Annex B a copy of a letter received by me dated 16th November, 2007 by Dr. N.J. Nonis. As a member of the Consultative Committee on Healthcare and Nutrition I am duty-bound, in terms of Standing Orders 109 and 113 to report to Parliament. The President of the Sri Lanka Medical Council and its Registrar, Dr. H.H.R. Samarasinghe and Dr. Nonis and also Dr. Sivarajasingham Sivapriyan are guilty of the following offences that fall under Part B of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act, No.21 of 1953 as amended and are liable to be punished by Parliament: 1. Dr. H.H.R. Samarasinghe and Dr. N.J. Nonis, at the Consultative Committee Meeting held on 27th September 2007, in the precincts of Parliament, committed the offence of disrespectful conduct by walking out of the meeting and refusing to answer the questions raised by Members of Parliament. 2. Dr. Sivarajasingham Sivapriyan has committed the offence of willfully obstructing a Member of Parliament in Committee and or interfering with the lawful duties of a Member of Parliament and or attempting to intimidate a Member of Parliament and a member of the Consultative Committee by requesting the Medical Council to initiate an inquiry or take disciplinary action against a Member of Parliament based on the matters discussed at the said Consultative Committee and the subcommittee meetings.

3. Dr. N.J. Nonis has committed the offence of willfully obstructing a Member of Parliament in Committee and/or interfering with the lawful duties of a Member of Parliament and or attempting to intimidate a Member of Parliament and a Member of the Consultative Committee by calling explanation from a Member of Parliament based on the matters discussed at the said Consultative Committee and the subcommittee meetings. In the aforesaid circumstances, I request the Hon. Speaker to deal with the above officers for breach of privilege of Parliament. Thank you.

Minister, we know that your heart is in the correct place. You have a good team as well. But your Government is way off the mark. They are looking at Bombay and hitting at Calcutta. That is the problem. So, how can you afford to bring in confidence? Business confidence is the most important aspect that needs to be created. So, in a country where the economy is in chaos, where there is no leadership that is able to understand what "chaos" means, and where there is no way that you can internally reduce the cost of living that makes the cost of production go up, we become uncompetitive. On the other side when the value of the dollar is going up, how on earth can you bridge the deficit? That is the problem you have. The fundamentals are not in place. When the fundamentals are not in place, the economy will not be in place and if the economy is not in place, you cannot provide solace that the people expect. So, Hon. Minister, I know this is a difficult time. But the most important thing you have got to do is ensure that you accept reality. The countrys economy is gone. We have got to succeed this economic war. If we lose the economic war we lose all wars. If you say that you want to win the war you have got to have a strong economy. What you are having is a war of attrition. You are only doing what Ethiopia did to create an Eritrea. Is that what you are going to do in the North and the East? We saw what you did at the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group Meeting. Your Colleague went to Uganda and kicked out the friends who helped us. He goes to India and says that they are too passive. Is this the way you try to lure the people? Hon. Minister, you can catch more bees with honey than with vinegar. You are an expert. According to your knowledge in the language you can convince and sell even fridges to Eskimos. But that is not happening. You are unable to attract investors because they do not have the confidence to invest here.

1267 1268

We are in the Opposition today. You are in the Government today and you may be in the Opposition tomorrow and we may be in the Government tomorrow. But there is one thing. Do not let us colourize the economy. So, on that particular basis you must have some policy. , . "" ; . ? . ? . . ? [ ] , .. , . ? . ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) . . [ ] ( ) (The Hon.

[.. 1.23] . . ( ) ( .. - , ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of Export Development and International Trade) Mr. Chairman, I would like to point out that the export sector has been one of the strongest growth areas of the economy of Sri Lanka. Indeed, it would be no exaggeration to say that the export sector is the lifeline of Sri Lankas economy today. During the first ten months of this year there has been a growth of approximately 13 per cent in the export sector. That is a considerable achievement and in some sectors the growth has been very much more. For example, the gem and jewellery sector, 37 per cent; food and beverages, 47 per cent; wooden products, 51 per cent; paper products, 46 per cent and the electronic and mechanical sector, as much as 84 per cent. All this has been achieved in the export sector. Then, if we look at exports countrywise, we have increased our exports to the United Arab Emirates by 912 per cent, almost ten times more than last year; 42 per cent is the increase in respect of Germany; 28 per cent for Belgium; 64 per cent for Italy and 21 per cent for France. Mr. Chairman, I would like to make this point very emphatically. One of the main objectives of my Ministry has been to increase export earnings. The country requires it. But that is not the most important objective. We are not satisfied with that. In keeping with the economic and the political philosophy of the Government, we are very eager to ensure that these benefits percolate down to the grass roots level. That is a very important aspect of the objectives of our Ministry. Not only must we earn more but we must ensure that those benefits are enjoyed across the board, particularly the poorer sections in the more distant regions of Sri Lanka. Mr. Chairman, we are very proud of the fact that Sri Lanka is no longer classified as an LDC. We are not a poor country. We are classified as a middle income country. But we do have a problem. That problem relates to significant disparities with regard to the distribution of income and resources within Sri Lanka. The per capita income of the District of Colombo is approximately seven times what it is in areas like Monaragala, Hambantota and Polonnaruwa. That is the problem that we need to address in earnest. That is why the Ministry of Export Development and International Trade has placed particular emphasis on the development of export promotion villages in different parts of the country. In the Anuradhapura District, in Tambuttegama area, we have invested a great deal of energy and resources in developing projects for the cultivation of fruits and vegetables. That has been a tremendous success. In the Polonnaruwa area there is a great deal of interest in aquarium fish. In Kolonna, there is a juggery project and

[ . . ]

2007 28 1309 1310

in Embilipitiya, a plantain project. These are being developed in different parts of the country to ensure proper linkages. That is, the farmers must benefit to the fullest possible extent from their labours. We are therefore trying to link up these export promotion villages with the larger companies in Colombo which are purchasing these products for the purpose of export. So, we would like to eliminate the unconscionable profits that are being earned by a series of middlemen to bring the consumer directly in contact with the producer and that is the concept that we have tried to implement in different parts of the country and as I said, Mr. Chairman, that has been a considerable success. One of the modalities which we have made use of for this purpose is the outgrower system, the outsourcing. I would like to take as an example the Tambuttegama project. We have set apart 100 acres for the cultivation of kiriala and we have arrived at a contract with Consolidated Business Enterprises, a company owned by Mr. Shanthi Wijesinghe and the farmer is protected to the fullest possible extent. He will be paid Rs. 46 per kilo. If the price falls, if there is a fluctuation in market conditions to the disadvantage of the farmer, he has the promise, the guarantee of a definite price. On the other hand, if there is an upward trend in the market, the farmer will benefit to the extent of 80 per cent of the price that is available in the Dambulla market. So, this way, there will be dissemination of prosperity in rural areas. The company will make available the seed material, the fertilizer and the know-how and when the product is ready, it will buy back the product from the farmer. This means that one is not investing just in a plot of land to develop it but the ramifications will be so considerable, so extensive as to result in the upliftment of economic conditions in very large parts of the Island. So, that is our commitment to the outgrower system which I think, will be very useful in achieving a high degree of rural prosperity. Mr. Chairman, it is my deep conviction that the key to prosperity in our economy is value addition. Different countries have different strengths. I know, not so much as a politician but as a Professor of Law, as a teacher who has taught two generations of students in the university system of this country that the quality of our human resources is Sri Lankas richest resource. Our people have creativity, imagination, commitment and value addition is therefore absolutely essential as one of the principal instruments that we propose to make use of in the development of Sri Lankas exports. Mr. Chairman, gone are the days when we were satisfied simply with exporting raw latex or bulk tea. That is not our approach at all. We are very proud of the fact that a Sri Lankan company, Loadstar today has captured 20 per cent of the world market in pneumatic tyres. So, instead of simply exporting the latex we add value, we add technology and the latex is converted into high quality pneumatic tyres which are of interest to the most

sophisticated markets of the world. We are manufacturing things like surgical gloves which again command a very lucrative and extensive market in North America and the Continent of Europe. Then, take tea which is Sri Lankas principal agricultural export. We are no longer interested in the export of bulk tea. We have to move away from that and we have to concentrate on tea bags and packeted teas and value added teas. Consider the progress which has been made by companies like Dilmah and Mlesna and these are examples of what can be achieved by having recourse to the expedient of value addition. This is also true of the gem and jewellery sector. Today, by far the most important sector, as far as exports are concerned, is the apparel sector. Mr. Chairman, the country earns almost US Dollars three billion, US Dollars 3000 million - I think, the exact figure is US Dollars 2875 million - from the export of our apparel products. Then, the next is tea which earns US Dollars 900 million and we earn about US Dollars 750 million from the export of our rubber products. I think that there are several other sectors of the economy which can be developed up to the one billion dollar level. Gems and jewellery is one such area. Again, we have to invest in new methods of cutting and polishing, setting the stones that we have. We must take the fullest advantage of branding concepts such as the Sri Lankan sapphire and there is a great deal of progress that is certainly foreseeable in that area. Mr. Chairman, Sri Lanka produces a very large proportion of the worlds cinnamon, and cinnamon that is produced in this country is of the highest quality. My Ministry has invested considerable energy in improving methods of cinnamon peeling and for this purpose we have worked in collaboration with the GTZ which was put at our disposal, funds which are derived from German sources. We have also played a major role in developing the handloom industry which is one of the traditional industries that are strong in this country. So in this way, we have resorted to value addition which I think, is particularly important from the point of view of employment generation that is going to provide large numbers of jobs for the youth of our country. Now, the Export Development Board has been organized in the form of sectoral committees and we have a continuing dialogue with the leaders of industry in these different sectors. It is not a top-down approach. We ascertain from these different industrialists what their requirements are and then we put in place a programme that is intended to assist them paying particular attention to the priorities that they have indicated in their discussions with us. The other major aspect of our

1311 1312

activities has to do with international trade and we have to derive the maximum possible benefit from the Free Trade Agreements that are already in force between Sri Lanka and India, and Sri Lanka and Pakistan. I am happy to tell you, Sir, that at the moment 4,235 products are entitled to duty-free entry into the markets of India under the Indo-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement. Now this is a source of greater attraction for our country. When we sell Sri Lanka abroad, we tell foreign investors, we tell foreign entrepreneurs that they must not look at Sri Lanka merely as a domestic market of 19 million people. On the contrary, Sri Lanka must be seen as a gateway, as a point of entry into the markets of the entire subcontinent of India. The Free Trade Agreement which was entered into between India and Sri Lanka seven years ago has been a tremendous success. Today, the total value of trade between the two countries is in excess of US Dollars two billion. Mr. Chairman, it is our view that we have to progress still further. There is no room for complacency and now we are engaged with the Government of India in negotiating a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement which to our mind represents a logical extension of the Free Trade Agreement. In other words, we have to graduate from physical commodities to services. Mr. Chairman, Sri Lanka is very strong with regard to services. Our companies are doing very well abroad. About three weeks ago, the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne and I led a delegation of our leading entrepreneurs in the construction sector. We went to Qatar and I am happy to tell you that the first of the contracts that were negotiated during that visit will be signed on the 10th of December and work has to begin before the 1st of January. That is a US Dollars 80 million contract and the total value of the contracts that were negotiated during our visit to Qatar is in the region of US Dollars 500 million. The Indian Minister for Commerce and Industry, His Excellency Kamal Nath told me, during a recent visit of mine to Goa to meet the Indian Minister, that India is very proud of their business relationship with this country. Today, Mr. Chairman, investment is not coming only from India into Sri Lanka. It is not a one-way street. There is reciprocity with regard to that relationship. Minister Kamal Nath told that India holds up as an example a Sri Lankan investment by a large company called Brandix in Vishakhapatnam. That is a model project in the view of the Indian Government because it is going to enable 40,000 Indian women to graduate out of poverty. So, we have to concentrate more and more on the services sector and we have to pay particular attention to training and skills development. So, these are some of the achievements of my Ministry with regard to international trade.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Minister, you have only a couple of minutes left. . . ( .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Then, Mr. Chairman, we have undertaken a comprehensive review of the Free Trade Agreement with Pakistan and I was able to persuade the Pakistani Minister for Commerce, Mr. Humayun Akhtar Khan to give us several benefits which we did not have earlier. For example, I persuaded the Government of Pakistan to do away with the upper limit with regard to the export of betel leaves from Sri Lanka to Pakistan. There was an upper threshold operating at the level of 1,200 metric tons. I persuaded the Government of Pakistan to do away with that ceiling and this results in very considerable benefit to betel farmers in three districts of Sri Lanka, Kurunegala, Kegalle and Gampaha. Because time is short, Mr. Chairman, I will refer only to one other matter. That is the work that is being done by SLECIC, which is an institution under the control of my Ministry and the work of SLECIC is particularly relevant for people who are going abroad in search of employment. The APARA scheme is a scheme that we are very proud of. It is operated by us in association with banks, both in the private and State sectors and the objective of that programme is to put at the disposal of people who are going abroad in search of employment, money that they need to settle down in those countries and resources which we require for their immediate needs. There has been a considerable expansion of that programme and I am certain that will be of very considerable benefit to people who are going abroad in search of employment and who have brought this country almost US Dollars 2700 million. So, that is the summary, Mr. Chairman, of the work that has been undertaken by our Ministry and I ask the House for its support with regard to the implementation of this programme. I thank you, Sir.
