( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) Please, switch on the mike. Sir, 45 bus loads of Tamil people have been sent back from Colombo to the North-East. We, the Tamil Parliamentarians are here. We are

prepared to go back to the North-East. There is no need to sit here. If the Government gets back their forces from the North-East, if they feel that the North-East is the homeland of the Tamils, we are prepared to go back. We are prepared to stay in the North-East if they are sending the Tamils from Colombo to the North-East. So, actually this is a fundamental problem. You ask the forces to get back from the North-East. This is what is going to happen. So, actually now we do not want to continue with this Debate. First of all you must tell us categorically whether the Tamil Parliamentarians have to go back. We are prepared to go back. You tell us that. Otherwise, call the 45 buses back to Colombo -[Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . [ ] , . . [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) If you feel that Sir Lanka is one country, call back the 45 buses. Otherwise, we are prepared to go. Let us know whether you want us to go back or not. Let us know now whether you want us to go back or whether you will get back the people to Colombo. Otherwise, we will not allow this Parliament to function today. We are not going to allow it, Sir, because this is a fundamental problem. Are we the citizens of Sri Lanka or not? This is the problem. Do you understand that? We are not going to allow it. You Sinhalese have dominated all the time. You have to understand that. Do you think that we all are fools? Do you think that we have to accept everything? No, we are not going to do it, Sir. We are not going to allow it. Call back the buses. Otherwise we, the Tamil Parliamentarians, are prepared to go back. Are you ready to send us back? We are prepared to go. Sir, are you prepared to send us back? You should give us a reply now. We are not going to - [Interruption.] [ .] [ . ] [ At this stage the Members of the TNA walked into the Well of the House and created an uproar.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) ? .

( . ) (The Hon. T. Maheswaran) . .

( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Sir, may I make the position clear? As far as the Members of the ITAK and the other Tamil Members like the Hon. Mano Ganesan and the Hon. Maheswaran are concerned, I do not have the slightest doubt that there are many other Members of Parliament also who share our views. This has been a very, very serious violation, a blatant violation of the fundamental human rights of innocent Tamil people. From one part of this country - that is the Capital City - they have been transported like cattle to the North and the East against their consent. This is totally unacceptable and that is why our Members decided in the morning to stage their protest against this inhuman, not really illegal, I would say "inhuman act" on the part of the Government. The Government cannot say that it has been done by the security forces for security reasons. No, the security forces are under your command. If they are not under your command you must say that you have no control over the security forces. That is our view. At the Party Leaders Meeting, discussions took place, Ministers were in touch with the security forces and what transpired was that - whether they have been taken in 45 buses or 25 buses or nine buses or seven buses - some people have been taken in buses. There is no question about it. And, these people have been taken not for the reason that they have committed any offence. If they have committed some offence or if they have been suspected of some offence, they could have been taken into custody and investigated. We have no problems in regard to that matter. These people have on

2007 07 1067 1068

4 PL 002196 (2007/06)

been taken without any valid reason. There is no question about that. That matter became perfectly clear in the course of the views expressed by Members and statements made by Members after they talked to the security forces at the meeting held in your Chambers. Therefore, we want a debate on this question and our Members of Parliament will like to speak on it. But, at the same time our Members of Parliament are also keen that there must be a debate on the National Institute of Language Education and Training Bill which the Hon. Minister of Constitutional Affairs wants to take up. He might take up that Bill and may be Members will speak on that. At the same time there must be a debate on this question and we are prepared to extend our co-operation to you in that manner and we would request the Government not to create difficulties. This is a very serious matter. This is indicative of a trend in this country. There may be a war, there may be acts of terror that are being committed on all sides by different players in this war. But that does not mean that innocent people whether they are Sinhalese, Tamils or Muslims can become the victims of this situation. This situation prevails because this country, the Sri Lankan State has failed miserably, failed to find an acceptable political solution to the Tamil question for the past 50 years. That is why this situation prevails in the country. And, therefore we cannot be a party to keep quiet, to be really being observers of the illegality committed by the Government, the inhuman act committed by the Government in taking these people. Therefore, we would request the Government to co-operate with regard to this matter, to have a debate on this question and also if the Minister of Constitutional Affairs, the Hon. Dew Gunasekara would like to make a statement in regard to this Bill, some of our Members who would like to speak on that matter must also be given the opportunity of speaking. And of course the other matter pertaining to some regulations can even be taken up tomorrow.

2007 07 1071 1072

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Can you please sit down, Hon. Member ? [Interruption.] Hon. Speaker, I do not think there is enough time to debate the Bill and to debate this issue. Therefore, what we suggest is that we pass the necessary Bills without debate. My view is that we have to debate this issue. For me this issue is a matter of importance. For a person who believes in a Sri Lankan identity, this is a sad day. We have to protect this country from people who come as terrorists or bring in bombs. We have been doing that for the last 12 years to 15 years.

( ) (The Hon. Sivanathan Kissor) Thirty years.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Let me speak. If you suspect anyone, the best thing is to take him before a magistrate and have him remanded. Then you can check on him and if he is found guilty, you can remand him further. Otherwise, you can release him. I do not think the answer to this issue lies in taking people out. If they are suspects, they come back. How are you going to stop them? . .

( . . ) (The Hon. A. P. Jagath Pushpakumara) .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) .

( ) (Mr. Speaker) !

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, even a ganja man has his rights. We cannot take a ganja man out of his House - [Interruption.] We want a debate on this for the simple reason that it violates Article 11 of the Constitution. Article 11 states, I quote: No person shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Secondly, according to Article 14(1)(h) anyone has the freedom of movement and of choosing his residence within Sri Lanka. Are we going to be like South Africa?

In the apartheid era when people were taken away, the Blacks were sent out by force. Are we going to be like how the Jews were sent out of Germany? Are we going to be like how some of the Arabs were forcibly evicted from parts of Palestine? Is that the reputation you want when just two days after we have to debate this matter in the European Parliament? Are you going to bring shame to our country? Why are we so afraid to speak out? If the police says there is evidence that the people who were involved with the LTTE stayed in the lodges, I would like the Chief Opposition Whip to be informed of it. Let us satisfy ourselves, because we know that none of the people who were involved with the LTTE had stayed in the lodges. They have stayed in other places. We are also concerned about security. But this will not ensure the security of Colombo. If there is a suspect - [Interruption.] Yes. He will come back. On the other hand, you are driving a lot of people into the hands of the LTTE and certainly some of them will return in anger and explode bombs in Colombo. We agree to pass this Bill without a debate and then we will take up for debate the Adjournment Motion on this issue.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) We are very confused about this situation. You are saying the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe is advocating the cause of the LTTE but what we read in the media is that the LTTE stopped the Tamil people from voting for him.

. Sir, I am just asking whether there is any law in this country where a citizen of this country has got to say why he is standing, why he is living or why he staying in a lodge. Has he got to say that? Why should he say that?

.

.

.

Sir, my son was detained by a police officer for about three hours. He was not even allowed - my own son - to give a call to me from his mobile phone. After about two hours, he was allowed to give me a call and he has told the police officer that he is so and so. I wanted to speak to that particular police officer, but he refused to speak to me. Then, I had to speak to the Nuwara Eliya Police because this happened in Colombo while he was going to buy his dinner with his younger brother. I spoke to the Nuwara Eliya Police and requested them to tell the Narahenpita Police that my son has been detained for three hours for nothing, just for the fancy of that police officer. My son has more Sinhala friends than Tamil friends because of his school. That is the situation in this country. If that happens to him, I can realize how difficult it would be for the people who come from the North and the East.

,

, ,

. Some Members also spoke about the JVP era. One Member said that the JVP leader, Rohana Wijeweera was acting like a superintendent of an estate or as an estate owner living in the Nawalapitiya area for several years and nobody could identify him. I will tell you why. They could not identify him because he was a Sinhalese. If it was a Tamil person, they would have identified him easily. That is the situation in this country. So, we are trying to support the Government. We are in the Government. We do not belong to any racial organization. I, particularly do not like to be a racialist. I do not speak like that. But when the Tamil people are treated this way, we are pushed to think that we are harrassed because we are Tamils. I used to always say that till I came to politics, while I was in school I did not

2007 07

know that I am a Tamil. We did not know the difference because we were living together. We had Sinhala friends. We had Tamil friends. We have everybody. We lived together. We spoke the same language. When I came to politics, my own political party which I joined, when I contested the election for the first time, said, . Then only I felt that I am a Tamil. So, this is the situation. , .

DR. JAYALATH JAYAWARDENA MBBS, FICS, MD Member of Parliament Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka

May 24, 2007 Fax No. 001 212 963 4879/371 4360

Mr. Ban Ki-Moon Secretary General United Nations Office of the Secretary General N.Y. New York 10017 USA

Dear Secretary General

URGENT APPEAL TO PROTECT A MOST RESPECTED PLACE OF WORSHIP IN THE WAR TORN AREA OF SRI LANKA I write this letter to draw your kind and urgent attention to seek your assistance to protect one of the most revered and hallowed Shrines in Sri Lanka situated in the war torn areas of the Wanni district. The Shrine of Our Lady of Madhu is so dear to us as Catholics and for many others.

(A) The Madhu Shrine has always remained a neutral place and an extraordinary center of spirituality, besides being also a center of refuge in conflict situations for thousands of innocent civilians of Sri Lanka. The miraculous statue of Our Lady of Madhu extraordinarily manifesting to us the special presence of the Mother of Christ has been attracting large crowds of people from all religions and all walks of life, from every part of Sri Lanka.

Unfortunately, due to the escalation of civil conflicts in Sri Lanka, this most respected Catholic Church has become vulnerable to attacks by both parties who are engaged in a civil war in Sri Lanka. As you are aware, the security forces of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), are engaged in a civil war. The situation has grown bad to worse after 2005, when both sides are on the war path.. The sacred Shrine of Madhu situated in the Mannar district had been always kept out of bounds by the Church Authorities for all types of political or any other activity other than those of a religious nature. Unfortunately now, due to the present escalation of armed conflict in this area, its neutrality and peacefulness have come under serious threat. If any military offensive is staged by any of the parties of the divide here, it is more than certain that this hallowed Shrine and center of refuge well known also to the UNHCR, will be literally razed to the ground. Under any circumstances, there should not be any damage to the Shrine and to the miraculous statute of Our Lady of Madhu.

Therefore, I, as a Member of Parliament who has been elected by the people of Sri Lanka and as a peace lover and a humanitarian worker, earnestly request you to take whatever steps deemed appropriate by you as the Secretary General of the United Nations to protect this Sacred Shrine well known to the world as a haven of refuge. You may agree with me, that according to the principles of humanitarian law and customary law, places of religious worship in any conflict area should be protected. It is imperative that the Government and the LTTE strictly adhere to these principles. In oder to preserve the sacred and humanitarian character of this very special place of worship and bequeath it to our future generations, is is seen imperative that this special Shrine be declared as a Zone of Peace, a conflict free area.

(B) Dear Secretary General, I trust that you will seriously consider this request and take whatever necessary steps you could, as early as possible, to protect the Shrine of Our Lady of Madhu, so dear to our people as a centre of spirituality.

Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of the Democritic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka Presidential Secretariat, Colombo. Your Excellency, Sub : Gazette Declaration of the Shrine of Our Lady of Madhu as a Neutral area and a Zone of Peace. We the members of the Catholic Bishops Conference of Sri Lanka (CBCSL) gathered here at the National Seminary, Ampitiya, for our plenary session, wish to express to you our deepest sentiments of gratitude for your concern and love for the Shrine of Our Lady of Madhu which si so dear to us Catholics and for many other. Madhu Shrine has always remained a neutral place and an Extraordinary centre of Spirituality besides being also a centre of refuge in conflict situations for the innocent civilians. The miraculous statue of Our Lady of Madhu, extraordinarily manifesting to us the special presence of the Mother of Christ, has been attracting large crowds of people from all religions and all walks of life, from all parts of the country. The Church administrate on has been ever maintaining the Shrine Area, purely as a religious place of worship besides being a neutral and a non-conflict area. As such the Church reservation area as gazetted by the Government, was kept out of bounds for all types of armed or military presence. It had been also kept our of bounds for all types of political or any other propaganda other than those of a purely religious nature. Unfortunately, now due to the present escalation of armed conflict in the area, its neutrality and peacefulness have come under threat. In order to preserve the Sacred character of this very special place of worship and bequeath it to our future generations, it is seen imperative that this Sacred Shrine be declared by the government by a special gazette notification as a Sacred Place of Religious Worship and also as a Zone of Peace where innocent civilians can find safe haven in any situation of armed conflict or war. Your Excellency, we trust that you will seriously consider this request and take necessary steps as early as possible to appoint a committee of concerned and capable persons to study this issue along with some representatives of the Catholic Bishops Conference of Sri Lanka who have been briefed on this matter. We have also appraised the Deputy Minister of Religious Affairs, Hon. Mr. Pandu Bandaranaike on the same subject, when the CBCSL met the said Deputy Minister during its plenary session. With kind regards and assurance of our prayers we remain, Yours Respectfully, +Most Rev. Dr. Vianiney Fernando, President of the CBCSL 0814471601 0812222300 +Most Rev. Dr. Norbert M. Andradi OMI Secretary General of the CBCSL 025-2222503 0716811063

We are not going to change. The Government always takes this stand. We are not going to change that. And those countries are free to decide whichever way they like. That much I can tell. I do not know what they are going to do. But since you all are very friendly with some of these embassy personnel tell them to find out from their respective foreign Ministries and they can let you know by the end of next week whether we are getting aid next year or not. We will manage without aid. We can manage without aid. We will do that. We have other plans. So do not think that dancing around with the ambassadors and all is going to get you anywhere. In fact you may be an embarrassment to some of them. That is not our problem. , : You are going around trying to make human rights..... , . You are going around trying to make human rights an issue. You go to embassies. You are trying to get some tickets to go abroad. This is politics that you are playing. You are entitled to do that. I am not disputing your right to do that- [Interruption] I am not disputing your right on that. You can do whatever you want. You can make charges against us. You can call us murderers, anything It further states, I quote: Politics you can shout. You can call us murderers, you can call us angels, you can call us anything you want. We are not worried about that. You are accusing the Government of murder and killings. I say, go to the country and do it. You can do that. You can have your mothers front, your sons front or any front, or back front, anything. We are not worried about that. . ? , . [ ] Finally, I would like to say, , . , . Human rights .

( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) How many Sinhalese were deported at that point of time when the leaders of the JVP whom you just mentioned were in hiding? That is the question I am posing.

( ) (The Hon (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Correct. That is what I said, Hon. Sri Kantha, first of all the hub of terrorism is Colombo. It is not that they are being chased out to their villages. So the Governments strategy, whether correct or not, is to clear out the hub of terrorism, to be cautious here. That is the reason.

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) Does it mean all the Tamils -

( ) (The Hon (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) No, no. That is why I told you, Hon. Suresh -

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) Does it mean all the Tamils are potential LTTEers?

( ) (The Hon (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) No.

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) That is what they are doing?

( ) (The Hon (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) No. That is 302 out of 15,000 to 20,000. But I do not know whether you can name the terrorists or you can identify the terrorists from among these 302. That is a different matter. You never know. , . . . , . - .

( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) Out of the 263 Tamils, according to you -

( ) (The Hon (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) No it is three hundred and two. .

( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) Three hundred and two. I am thankful to you. The number has increased now.

( ) (The Hon (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) It is 260 plus 42. I told you that in the morning. .

( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) I am thankful to you, Hon. Minister.

( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) Out of the 302 Tamils including elders, middle-aged men, ladies, children, kids and all, there may be one or two people whom you may charge as one -

( ) (The Hon (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) I do not charge - .

( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) No, anybody concerned is entitled to say, has some allegiance or connection with the LTTE. Let us assume so. Do you say for that matter, just because out of 302, there may be one, two or three, the others deserve this treatment? That is the concern we have.

( ) (The Hon (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Shall I tell you the same thing? .

( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) Yes.

( ) (The Hon (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) I will give you the answer. [Interruption.] .

( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) It should be investigated according to the law.

( ) (The Hon (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) I will give you the same. Now, they suspect one or two fellows in Wellawatta but they search the entire Tamil population in Wellawatta. Do you think the entire Tamil population can be called terrorists? No. , . , barrier . ? ? ? . uniform , " "
