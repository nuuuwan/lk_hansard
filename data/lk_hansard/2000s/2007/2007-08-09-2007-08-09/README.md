5 PL 002406 (2007/08)

Sir, the role of Sri Lankas Foreign Service today is not only to maintain bilateral relations, but also to espouse the need for us to have a cohesive arrangement towards which we can combat terrorism and make our country free of this menace, as much as the international community is consciously approaching an agenda towards the elimination of terrorism from our soil as well as from the region and that of the world. I would like to highlight during my speech, the efforts of President Mahinda Rajapaksa towards achieving this during the last six months alone. That is how we are looking at the issue that has confronted us during the last three decades and how we are meeting that challenge today as a Government along with the Sri Lankan diaspora and all political parties associated in Sri Lanka and the consensus-building measures that we have now adopted, as much as our efforts outside Sri Lanka. I have brought along with me details of atrocities committed by the LTTE during the last 30 years in Sri Lanka against the people of this country, against the Tamil community of this country, against the Tamil political leadership of this country and against internationally reputed leaders such as Rajiv Gandhi and others associated with Sri Lankas interest and that of world politics. In Sri Lanka our efforts have yielded great results during the last six months, the main thing being the freeing of the Eastern Province of our country from the LTTE menace ending up the subjugation of the Tamil community and all other communities living in that area. Only yesterday I had talks with Sir John Holmes, the United Nations Under Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs. He visited Jaffna yesterday, and the day before yesterday he visited Batticaloa. I asked him last night as to what his own impressions were. He said, Yes, people are now getting back to their cultivations and they need fertilizer and seed material. It is a very progressive statement because here in the post-conflict scenario, people are getting back to pursue their own livelihoods for which the Government of Sri Lanka is committed to encourage. Then, I asked him about the need for development of the fisheries sector in the Eastern Province. He said, Yes, we accept that. It is a need of the fishermen". When I asked what they need, he said "fishing boats. He himself conceded the fact that fishing boats that were distributed during tsunami have also been damaged by the LTTE during the time they were trying to hold those areas. Then again, there are certain concerns, as my colleagues from the TNA stated - about the security aspect. Greater development of interactive mechanisms towards which every community feels in whatever parts they live in, the semblance is no longer there, but there is real term security for all people. That is something that we are addressing. The trust and confidence- building measures to be extended; Tamil-speaking policemen to be around, so that their issues can be better dispensed, better understood, better worked on and solutions found at the locality itself.

I asked the Under Secretary-General as to what his impression about Jaffna was, when he visited the day before yesterday. He said that there again the food distribution is improving, but there need to be greater efficiency in the distribution channels. More discharging and more loading facilities and improvement of logistics have to be there in Jaffna. The fisheries sector has to be developed with access to waters for the fishermen to do their fishing. These were the concerns and again the security aspect, where people should feel there is confidence in terms of security. The highlights are that the schools are functioning, children wear uniforms given by the Government, the universities are functioning and people are pursuing their agendas. We need this. At the same time, there is a conflict in some parts of the country and we need to address that in a very cohesive manner, which we have been doing as a Government in this country with the greatest responsibility whilst having certain military engagements in order to counter terrorism in all parts of Sri Lanka.

We have also taken this message strongly to the world fora and we got very favourable responses from the world community as seen during my last visit to Manila to become a member of the ASEAN Regional Forum, the ARF. For the first time, Sri Lanka has been admitted as a member of the ARF. What did we say there? Who are the members of the ARF? The United States, Canada, Japan, China, Russia, the Peoples Republic of Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, India, Pakistan, the topmost countries in the world, and the European Union. We are one of them today. For the first time, in 2007 we have been admitted as the 27th member. There again, the entire endorsement was on countering terrorism the world over in all its manifestations and condemnation of the acts of terrorism. Has Sri Lanka ever had this type of opportunity to highlight the effects of terrorism on our own society, its dimension regionally and how it affects the world community? Today we have become recognized because we stood firm that there is terrorism in this country; we did not hide that fact. Under President Mahinda Rajapaksa, under his regime, we have been highlighting the fact that there is terrorism. The need is there for us to come together, for all communities and political parties to counter this, address this with a political solution brought about through dialogue and negotiations and make a cohesive approach in bringing this conflict to an end. There should be a constitutional process towards which we must address ourselves as a responsible, civilized State in the world.

There were certain concerns expressed by my Friends, the Members of Parliament from the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna. They questioned as to what stand we take on matters they perceived in their own minds, to be interferences coming from certain agencies and on certain visits made by eminent persons the world over to Sri Lanka sometime back to commemorate certain issues and incidents. I address these things at the Consultative

1159 1160

[ ]

Committee and our position is that whatever the world opinion is, it is our responsibility to counter that. We want to be transparent and we want to make Sri Lanka accessible because there is nothing to hide in Sri Lanka. We are a sovereign nation. We stand for what the people reflect, respond to what they want us to and represent them where they want us. Our people have responded well. We believe in countering terrorism; we need a democratic agenda; we need pluralism in all parts of Sri Lanka and in that context, we like to pursue our goals in bringing just solutions to the issues that have been confronting not only our Government, but the country as a whole for 30 years. It is the country, it is the people that come first and the political divide has to get out of its way. We should come together in addressing this. This is the purpose for which our agenda has been pursued. We have always been saying that the threat of terrorism lies not only in having arms and cadres, but also the support the foreign soils extend to the LTTE. Towards that, what steps have we, as the Foreign Ministry of Sri Lanka, taken? World capitals and important nerve centres in the world, where decision-making takes place and those decisions get translated into real term results, are where we have been canvassing and seeking support and I have been pursuing those locations with great vigour during my tenure of office. With that emphasis, we have looked at Washington as an important nerve centre where counter-terrorism has to be canvassed for Sri Lanka while it advocates a regime of counter-terrorism worldwide. We have to benefit out of that and we have now yielded results in that connection, which I will narrate to you.

In the UK, there were concerns when the House of Commons debated the issues concerning Sri Lanka. At that point, I said, Yes, the House of Commons is debating the issues in Sri Lanka". At the same time, the Government of the United Kingdom will have to stand against terrorism and today they are taking all possible measures and we have benefited out of the actions taken by the United Kingdom in relation to terrorism in Sri Lanka as well. In Canada, France, Indonesia, Australia and Malaysia, measures have been taken for fund-raising, a major area that concerns counter-terrorism. Funds were being raised from the Tamil diaspora under threat, by intimidation practices and on demands and we have been able to counter it. How did we do that? We had to get international co-operation in that regard. International co-operation has been extended to us because they strongly believe that in Sri Lanka there is terrorism; that there is a need to counter it, to assist the Government of Sri Lanka and assisting the Government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa in that connection is vital. It is in that sense, as the Foreign Minister, I have been able to seek the co-operation of all these nerve centres in the world, the important places where we can advocate counter-terrorism and from which we can expect results.

There were concerns expressed in terms of our human rights record. When engaged in military operations and security enhancement, there are certain areas that get highlighted: human rights, law enforcement capability, pursuance of action against criminals, persecution and prosecution that has to be brought about in order to arrest these criminal activities and improve the conditions for the people. Each of these things has a dimension - how these acts get reflected in the eyes of certain interested groups. Sometimes the LTTE propaganda machinery is strong and at the same time try to become effective with distortion and half-baked stories. How do we counter that? That again is an agenda that we have to pursue. It is not easy. We have to substantiate it; we have to explain these matters to the world community; we have to convince them as to what we stood for and how we looked at matters. That is why we have been responsible for bringing in several commissions of oversight like the International Group of Eminent Persons, a body that oversees the work of the commissions that we have created in Sri Lanka, to go into some of these allegations that have been made against us. It is important for me to-

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, your time is up. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) I need five minutes more, Sir, from the time allocated to the Government benches. I will then move onto the main areas that I have been waiting to cite. That is about the actions the international community has been able to take and the support extended to us. As for the United States, on 25th April 2007, the US based leader of the LTTE, Karunakaran Kandasamay alias Karuna and four others were arrested by the Joint Terrorist Task Force of the Federal Law Enforcement Agency in the New York suburb of Jamaica, Queens on the charge of providing material support for the LTTE by fund-raising. Earlier, a sting operation launched by the FBI in August, 2006 not only nabbed a number of key LTTE activists, but it also unearthed a wealth of information regarding the modus operandi of the organization in that country. Thirteen persons with close links to the LTTE, including Waterloo Suresh alias Suresh Skandarajah, were arrested from Buffalo, New York, San Jose, California, Seattle, Washington and Connecticut following the Royal Canadian Mountain Police - RCMP - and FBI probe into allegations that LTTE sympathizers in North America were seeking to purchase surface-to-air missiles, missile launchers, AK-47s, and other weapons to be used by the LTTE against the Sri Lankan military missiles and were collecting terror funds. They are also accused of attempting to use LTTE front organizations, including the Tamil Rehabilitation Organization to bribe State Department officials for

2007 09 1161 1162

obtaining classified documents containing information relating to the organization. Among those arrested was a British doctor, Murugesu Vinayagamoorthy alias Dr. Moorthy, and a senior LTTE intermediary was also arrested from New York for aiding the LTTE by facilitating the purchase of American rockets and British submarine technology. At the same time, in a case filed by the US Government in Baltimore, four LTTE agents including three foreign nationals were arrested for seeking to provide material support to the LTTE, a designated foreign terrorist organization in the United States. Of them, on 5th April 2007, a Singapore national, Haniffa Bin Osman, pleaded guilty for conspiring to provide material support to the LTTE while Haji Subandi and Erick Wotulo, both Indonesian citizens, pleaded guilty for attempting to illegally export arms for the LTTE. On 10th May 2007, Thirunavukarasu Varatharasa, a Sri Lankan citizen, pleaded guilty in a US court for conspiring to provide material support to the LTTE and attempted export of arms and ammunition. According to the plea agreement, from April to 29th September 2006, Varatharasa conspired with Haji Subandi, Haniffa Bin Osman and Erick Wotulo to export state-of-the-art firearms, machine guns and ammunition, surface-to-air missiles, night vision goggles and other military weapons to the LTTE. US based INTELSAT terminated the illegal use of its facilities by the LTTE to broadcast the LTTEs so-called official TV channel, "National Television of Tamil Eelam" - NTT - launched in 2005, which was originating from northern Sri Lanka and beamed across the Europe and Asia. Mr. Deputy Speaker, as for the UK, on 28th June 2007, Arunachalam Chrishanthakumar alias Shanthan, the LTTE leader in the UK and President of the British Tamil Association and the head of finance, Golden Lambert were charged by Scotland Yard under the Terrorism Act 2000 for providing support to the LTTE, which is a proscribed organization in the United Kingdom. Shanthan has been charged for being a member of the LTTE, a proscribed organization, arranging a meeting in support of the LTTE, encouraging support for the LTTE, receiving funds to be used for the purpose of terrorism, possessing a quantity of literature and manuals including underwater warfare systems and a piece of ballistic body armour intending that they be used for the purpose of terrorism. Lambert was charged for managing a meeting to support the LTTE, a proscribed organization. On 5th July 2007, a British court froze all bank accounts of Shanthan and his wife. On 6th May 2007, the BBC reported that the Armulmihu Hindu Temple in Tooting "has had its assets frozen pending an investigation into alleged links with the UK banned Tamil Tigers". Earlier in April 2007, the UK commenced investigations into a global credit card scam involving LTTE operatives who were skimming credit cards at some 150 petrol stations

across the United Kingdom and transmitting the information to operatives across the globe. They were able to withdraw large sums of money from unsuspecting customers. In France, on 5th April 2007, 14 persons of Sri Lankan origin suspected of being linked to the LTTE have been placed in judicial custody and one person was issued a conditional release under judicial supervision, a preventive detention order after being produced before a special counter-terrorism tribunal in Paris. The group, which is believed to include Nadaraja Matheenthiran alias Parithi alias Regan, LTTE branch chief in Paris, are charged with multiple charges including extortion, physical violence and illegal confinement of Tamils settled in France. They were also charged with financing terrorism and criminal association with a terrorist enterprise. The extent of the LTTEs propaganda operations has also drawn international attention and the group has suffered heavy blows in recent months. The closure of the Tamil Television Network - TTN - by the French authorities, which operated out of Paris through the satellite service provider Globecast, has further exposed the complex tentacles of the LTTE spread into modern communication methods. In Australia, on 1st May 2007, the Australian Federal Police arrested two LTTE agents in Melbourne, Sivaraj Yathevan, the Tiger agent in charge of "Eela Murasu", a Tamil community paper and Arooran Vignanamoorthy, and they were charged with terror offences after unearthing a massive fraud and criminal operation that diverted money collected from the Australian public in the name of tsunami relief into the coffers of the LTTE. The arrests were followed by raids on several homes and businesses suspected to be those of LTTE front organizations across Melbourne eastern suburbsby Federal and State police. Further, on 11th July 2007, Australian prosecutors accused accountant Arumugam Rajeevan who is alleged to have worked for the LTTE, of overseeing the dispatch of Australian Dollars 600,000 for terrorist activities in Sri Lanka and visiting the terrorist leader Velupillai Prabhakaran for related purposes. In Canada, on 23rd August 2006, two Tamil Canadians, Ramanan Mylvaganam and Piratheepan Nadarajah were arrested in an alleged conspiracy to buy weapons for the LTTE. In India, on 19th January 2007, G. Elango, an LTTE agent carrying a British passport, was arrested by police in Chennai along with 28 ATM cards. Elango illegally withdrew over Indian Rupees 30 lakhs from the ATMs and later sent it to the UK through unauthorized channels. Elango, hailing from Middlesex is reportedly a shareholder in "Thamilini" - a cash and carry grocery shops chain operated by the LTTE in the United Kingdom.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, these are the lines on which we are currently exposing the LTTE activities and seeking the international co-operation on a continuous and daily basis. In fact, shortly we will be having an international conference on counter-terrorism in Sri Lanka attended by world eminent persons in order to highlight the atrocities and activities of the LTTE that has been launching against democracy, against people and innocent lives in Sri Lanka coming from all communities. These are the efforts we have been highlighting today. We have been acting and operating as a responsible Government, once again establishing pluralism and bringing democracy and security for all our people and sustainable peace to Sri Lanka. Thank you, Sir. [.. 12.19]

( - ,

) (The Hon. Dew Gunasekara -Minister of Constitutional Affairs and National Integration) Mr. Presiding Member, in view of the time factor I am compelled to make a very brief intervention. I stand here on behalf of the Government, and representing the Communist Party of Sri Lanka to support the extension of Emergency. The reasons why we do so are understandable and very clear. They need not be repeated over and over. The situation still demands an extension of Emergency.

The peace process originally came to an abrupt halt in 2003 when the UNP was running the cohabitation administration. You would recall that, when the present President Mahinda Rajapaksa took over the administration in November 2005, he offered the hand of friendship to the LTTE. However, within ten days of the new administration, the LTTE resumed its terrorist activities. The LTTEs intransigence and belligerence was revived and repeated. However, the Government on its part had the patience to revive the talks held abroad. The LTTE once again walked away from the talks. The LTTE did this in 1995, repeated it in 2003 and again in 2005. Even the new administrations were not given a chance. The LTTEs military offensive recommenced with Mavil Aru in July, 2006 and so followed the retaliation by the Government. The rest of the story till the final capture of Thoppigala is still afresh in our minds and hence need not be repeated. All what has taken place during the whole of last 12 months was a reaction to the LTTE's intransigence and belligerence. They will have to blame themselves for the loss of life and wanton damage and destruction caused. This is the sad story of the LTTEs strategy since 1983, being repeated over and over.

The LTTE refuses to abandon its Eelam project and continues to do so and opt for a military strategy. The LTTE still believes that it is a winnable war and that Eelam project is achievable. It is not a winnable war and can certainly be an endless war. It is never too late for the LTTE to opt for a political strategy and an alternative political solution. This is precisely what the majority of the Tamil people need and demand. Sir, as a representative of a party which consistently demanded a political solution and which stood steadfastly for the cause of the Tamil people and in fact the Tamil-speaking people, we supported to the hilt the Thirteenth Amendment undeterred by defeats, setbacks, repressions and assassinations. It is an undeniable fact and an unfortunate turn of events that the benefits of the Thirteenth Amendment never reached the Tamils or the Tamil-speaking people and in particular, the people of the North and the East. Neither the North nor the East benefited. Given the advantage of the new situation in the East, it is necessary to see even after 20 years that the benefits of the Thirteenth Amendment accrue to the people in the East. The resettlement and rehabilitation should take precedence over the restoration of civil administration. Hence the 180 days programme of work is an immediate need of the people as an immediate measure of relief. The Eastern Province accounts for only 5 per cent of the total GDP. In fact, the conflict zones (North and East) account for only 8 per cent of the share of the total GDP. Even the adjacent provinces - the North Central Province and the Uva - each account for only 4 per cent of the GDP. This whole region is the poverty belt of the Sri Lankan economy despite their rich natural resources, mainly due to the on-going conflict and its fall out. Sir, if the LTTE is not prepared to abandon its Eelam project and opt for an alternative political solution, then the peace talks are a distant dawn. How long can the Tamil people continue to suffer? The international community should understand the reality of the ground situation. What is necessary for them is to exert pressure on the LTTE and call for sanity. Now we must offer what the Tamil people need regardless of what the LTTE demands. It is unfortunate that the political culture in our country is back again on the decline with the UNP resuming a path of confrontation with the Government changing its tactics as well as strategies. Sir, on behalf of the Communist Party of Sri Lanka and also on behalf of the Socialist Alliance of which it is a constituent member, it is imperative that a collective effort is made to bring about a consensus on this vital national question. No national question has ever been solved in any part of the world without a national consensus. Our post-independent history is a history of

2007 09 1221 1222

missed opportunities in the absence of such a consensus. Two generations have failed to achieve such a consensus. We cannot afford to allow their problem to be passed on to the next generation.

Once again divisive forces have emerged from the back seat and begun to be active disrupting the emerging consensus. I call upon all the political parties for sanity at this crucial moment of our countrys history and urge them not to disrupt the emerging consensus. History shall not absolve them.

Mr. Presiding Member, in conclusion I would like to say that there are three options before us. The first ideal option would be for the LTTE to give up its Eelam project and talk with the Government and other political parties and agree to an alternative political solution acceptable, reasonable and feasible.

The second option would be for the All Party Conference together with the Government to offer a solution to the Tamil and Tamil speaking-people but this also needs a consensus.

The third option would be, if everything fails and if the UNP, the major Opposition Party does not co-operate with the Government at this crucial moment and opt to play the truant as it always has done, then of course the Government should do what is possible and that is to implement effectively and vigorously the Thirteenth Amendment. Thank you very much.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Thank you, Hon. Minister.
