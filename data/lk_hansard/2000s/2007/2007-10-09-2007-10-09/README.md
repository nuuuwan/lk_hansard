: : Determination of the Supreme Court : IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA In the matter of a reference under Article 122 (1) (b) of the Constitution A Bill titled the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act S. C. Determination No. 3/2007

Present : C. N. Jayasinghe, Judge of the Supreme Court N. E Dissanayake, Judge of the Supreme Court J De S Balapatabendi, Judge of the Supreme Court Counsel : P. A. Ratnayake, P. C., Additional Solicitor General, with Shavindra Fernando, Deputy Solicitor General, Nerin Pulle, Senior State Counsel and Mahen Gopallawa, State Counsel for Attorney General Court assembled at : 10.00 A. M. on 27th September 2007 A Bill titled The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Act has been referred to His Lordship the Chief Justice by His Excellency the President in terms of Article 122(1)(b) of the Constitution for a Special Determination by this Court, as to whether the Bill or any provision thereof is inconsistent with the Constitution. The Bill bears an endorsement under the hand of the Secretary to the Cabinet of Ministers to the effect that the Cabinet of Ministers has decided that in its view, the Bill is urgent in the national interest. The Bill seeks to confer statutory rights to give effect to those civil and political rights referred to in the International Covenant on civil and Political Rights for which no adequate legislative recognition has yet been granted. Clause 2 of the Bill recognizes the right of every person to be recognized as a person before the law. Clause 3 of the Bill provides that no person shall propagate war or advocate national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence. Clause 4 of the Bill provides for the entitlement of a person charged of a criminal offence under any written law. Clause 5 of the Bill provides for the rights of Child. Clause 6 of the Bill provides that every citizen to have the right and the opportunity to - (a) take part in the conduct of public affairs, either directly or through any representative; and (b) Have access to services provided to the public by the State Clause 7 of the Bill vests in the High Court jurisdiction over the enforcement of the human rights recognized by this Act. Clause 8 of the Bill provides for regulations to be made by the Minister for the purpose of giving effect to the principles and provisions of this Act. In the course of submissions the Learned Additional Solicitor General adverted that the objective of this Bill was to advance the rights of persons as mandated by Article 4(d) of the Constitution, however the following inconsistencies were pointed out to Learned Additional Solicitor General who undertook to suggest the following amendments to the Bill; 1. the words public affairs in clause 6 (a) of the Bill would be given a specific interpretation in order to ensure that there would be no interference into the conduct of statutory functionaries. 2. Clause 7 of the Bill would be amended to provide an aggrievd person with right of appeal against any order of the High Court with regard to the exercise of its jurisdiction under this Act. We also observe that Clause 7 of the Bill would be inconsistent with Article 126 of the Constitution which vests the sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine any infringement or imminent infringement of any fundamental rights provided for in Chapter III and IV of the Constitution, in the Supreme Court.

701 702

However, the said inconsistency would cease if the jurisdiction conferred on the High court to hear and determine petitions on an alleged infringement or imminient infringement of rights referred to under section 2, 4, 5 and 6 is amended, whereby the said jurisdiction of the High Court is limited to adjudicate residual rights that are not within the ambit of Chapter III and IV of the Constitution, in respect of which the sole and exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Supreme Court under Article 126 of the Constitution. In the above context Learned Additional Seolicitor General agreed to amend Clause 7 of the Bill in order to ensuer that there would be no contravention Article 126 of the Constitution. Learned Additional Solicitor General further agreed to amend Clause 7 of the Bill by providing a procedure fo the High court to hear and determine the rights Onferred by Clauses 2, 4, 5 and 6 of the Bill. Subject to the foregoing the Bill is not inconsistent with the Constitution. We make our determination accordingly. C. N. Jayasinghe, Judge of the Supreme Court Sgd. N. E. Dissanayake, Judge of the Supreme Court Sgd. J. De S. Balapatabendi, Judge of the Supreme Court

Excellency the President of Sri Lanka, the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the incident. As instructed by His Excellency the President, the Deputy High Commissioner engaged a law firm, namely AUM Associates, Advocates and Consultants, to assist the Mission in the investigation of the event. Mr. Fernando had visited the Madurai Central Prison in connection with the release of four Sri Lankan fishermen who were arrested by the Indian Coast Guard on 30th June, 2007. At the time of the incident, Mr. Canicius Fernando was in possession of a valid passport, a visa and an authorization letter from the Sri Lankan Deputy High Commission in Chennai to facilitate the four fishermens release in his capacity as the representative of the All Ceylon Trade Union for Migrant Fishermen. The Deputy High Commission had handed over a letter of concern to the Office of the Chief Secretary of the Government of Tamil Nadu requesting necessary judicial investigation to be conducted. The Chief Secretary of the Government of Tamil Nadu telephoned the Deputy High Commissioner and expressed regret and said that this incident should not have happened and assured that the culprit would be brought to book through proper investigation. The Deputy High Commission had also sent a Third Person Note to the Public Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu requesting a judicial inquiry and permission to allow representatives of the Sri Lankan Government to be part of the investigation process. The Deputy High Commission arranged the transport of the remains of Mr. Fernando on 8th October to Sri Lanka. The cost of transport was borne by the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources as instructed by the Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, the Hon. Felix Perera. The High Commission in Delhi had expressed Sri Lankas concern to the Indian Ministry of External Affairs on the unfortunate incident and requested that an appropriate judicial investigation at central level be initiated to establish the truth that led to the incident. The Indian High Commission at the request of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs facilitated issuing emergency visas on Saturday, the 6th of October to the family members of late Mr. Fernando to visit India for this purpose. The District Collector of Madurai passed an order under Section 150/3 of the Police Standing Order that an inquiry be conducted by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate in addition to the inquiry already initiated by the Revenue Divisional Officer, RDO. The security guard who had allegedly shot dead Mr. Fernando has been suspended by the prison authorities in Madurai, Tamil Nadu. In this regard, I, as Minister of Foreign Affairs, had a discussion with the Indian High Commissioner, His Excellency Alok Prasad at the Ministry on 8th October

( - ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama - Minister of Foreign Affairs) , . , . . . Hon. Speaker, I make this Statement on the death of Mr. Canicius Fernando, representative of the All Ceylon Trade Union for Migrant Fishermen, at the Madurai Central Prison on 5th October, 2007. The Deputy High Commission was informed over the phone by the Public Protocol Department of the Tamil Nadu Government on 5th October at 1910 hours that a Sri Lankan national, namely Mr. Canicius Fernando, the holder of passport number N 1289953 who had visited the Madurai Central Prison to meet four Sri Lankan fishermen prisoners was shot dead by a prison guard. It was also informed that he was taken to the Government Rajaji Hospital, Madurai and pronounced dead at 1525 hours. Subsequently, on the same day our diplomatic Mission was informed by the Tamil Nadu Prison Department in writing that Mr. Fernando was shot by a guard as he did not respond to the orders to stop. The Deputy High Commissioner immediately despatched an officer to Madurai and informed His

and expressed shock and grief over the killing of Mr. Fernando in Madurai and requested that a judicial investigation at central level be conducted on this incident. The High Commissioner regretted the incident as "very unfortunate" and assured all measures would be taken to investigate this in a proper manner. In the meantime, yesterday a magisterial inquiry and a further autopsy were ordered by the Magistrate of Negombo when the body was brought to Sri Lanka. The investigations are currently proceeding and the Indian authorities have assured that an impartial and independent investigation, a magisterial- level inquiry and a judicial inquiry will be held in this connection. I must place on record my appreciation for the then Acting Foreign Minister, the Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila, who, during my absence had taken all the necessary steps in order to mitigate the effect of this unfortunate incident, co-ordinate action between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and our Mission in Chennai to have the body brought back to Sri Lanka and also ensure that the due process of law takes its course. I must also place on record the efforts of the Hon. Felix Perera in facilitating the needs of the family of the victim and providing funds for the body to be brought to Sri Lanka instantly. Also, I must mention the efforts made by the Deputy Minister of Aviation, the Hon. Sarath Gunaratne in taking necessary steps to facilitate the process of bringing the body back to Sri Lanka and mitigating the difficulties faced by the family Members of this victim. Further action in this regard is currently proceeded with and I would like to keep the House informed of the progress in due course. I thank you for the opportunity extended to me in this connection. . ( . ) (The Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera) , . . , , , , , , . , - ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) . . 12

: 2007 02 : 2007 02 PRIVILEGE: ACCUSATION BY HON. BANDULA GUNAWARDANE AT GOVERNMENT PRESS BRIEFING ON 2ND OCTOBER 2007 ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Speaker, I thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to make a correction on a very serious allegation, a baseless accusation that has been made by some Ministers of this House. I am sure that you and the Hon. Members of this House are well aware of the accusations that have been made against me by the Minister of Trade, Marketing Development, Co-operatives and Consumer Services, the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane at the Government press briefing held on the 2nd of October, 2007 to which wide publicity has been purposely given. At this press conference, the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane had directly accused me of surreptitiously smuggling in Clause 77 to the Consumer Affairs Authority Act, No. 9 of 2003 with the sole intention of protecting Prima Ceylon Limited against legal action for increasing the price of flour. It is pathetic to see Ministers trying to take cover of their incompetence by uttering falsehood. It is sad to see him falling into the same levels as some of his current Colleagues who are suffering from about of amnesia. It is my duty to place before this House the correct facts as it holds the supreme power of legislation. Hon. Speaker, this piece of legislation was first presented to Parliament by the Hon. Rauff Hakeem as Minister of Internal and International Trade and Commerce of the People's Alliance Government in June 2001 as the Consumer Protection Authority Bill. The Bill was gazetted and presented to Parliament on the 7th of June 2001. The second reading of the Bill was taken up on the 18th of June 2001 and nearly 16 Members from both sides of the House spoke on that occasion. If the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane had taken some time to study this issue before he made wild allegations against me, he could have refreshed his mind on what he said when he sat with me at a couple of press briefings in 2004 and 2006, where he exposed the Prima Ceylon Limited Agreement signed by former President, Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and the Secretary to the Treasury, Dr. P. B. Jayasundera. Sir, I table* these documents marked A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-4.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, he cannot raise a point of Order. Sir, I am on a Privilege issue. There is no Standing Order that debars me from speaking. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) ? . ? ( ) (The Hon. Bandula Gunawardane) , . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . , . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Speaker, this so-called draconian clause was not introduced by me. It was in the Bill that was presented to Parliament in June 2001. The provisions referred to in Section 77 of this Act No. 9 of 2003 were reflected in Clause 81, page 56 of the Bill dated 7th June 2001. Furthermore in May 2001, a Dubai based company named Serendib Flour Milling Company was given the same exemption and protection clauses from the Consumer Affairs Authority. This was also done during the PA Government. It has nothing to do with the United National Party. Among the Members who spoke on this Bill were the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama, Hansard of 18th June 2001, Columns 828 to 832 refers. I thank him because at that moment he was on the correct side. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) I am always on the correct side. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) He has basically said that Section 81 is inimical. I table* Column 832 marked A-5.

Then, Sir, there was the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya who referred to this - Hansard of 18th June 2001, Column 850. The Hon. Sunil Handunetti also referred to Section 81 - Hansard of 18th June 2001, Column 838. The Hon. Daham Wimalasena, Column 872 of the same Hansard, specifically highlighted the ramifications of Section 81. I myself concluded for the United National Party and said the same thing. In fact, a letter sent by the Chamber of Commerce dated 9th May 2001, raising concerns on this Clause was tabled in Hansard, Column 878. But the strangest thing is that the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane who was in Government and spoke on this occasion was strangely silent on this Clause. I table* his entire speech, Columns 833-836, marked A-6. After a full debate, this Bill was referred to a Standing Committee by the then Prime Minister, the Hon. Ratnasiri Wickramanayake. The Hon. Prime Minister is here. However, with the dissolution of Parliament the Bill failed to become an Act. After the General Election of December 2001, I assumed the office of Minister of Trade, Commerce and Consumer Affairs and we referred the matters raised by the Members of Parliament at the debate to the Attorney-General seeking his advice on deleting Section 81. His opinion on this matter was sent to my Secretary, Mr. Harsha Wickramasinghe on 22nd May, 2002. I table* that letter marked A-7, sent by the Attorney-Generals Department dated 22nd May 2002, signed by Mr. Nihal Jayawardena. I am quoting only the relevant lines as to why we could not take Section 81 out. In his opinion to the Secretary on 22nd May 2002, he stated: Deleting Section 81 in its entirety would certainly have some adverse international repercussions. However, the ambiguity as to the possibility of extending of such Agreements after the Act coming into force could be avoided in two different ways. This is owing to the Agreement signed between Prima Ceylon Limited and the Government on 26th of April, 2006. All I did in this issue was to follow the AGs advice and re-present the Bill in 2003 as the Consumer Affairs Authority Bill wherein Clause 81 of the Bill of 2001 became Section 77 in the new Act. We brought the service industry as well into this. Mr. Speaker, the primary issue here is the Prima contract. It is therefore vital that I place the true story before you.

In 1978, the Agreement between the J.R. Jayewardene Government and the Prima Ceylon Limited

was to establish a flour mill in Trincomalee on BOT terms valid for a period of 25 years. At the expiry of this Agreement, the Sri Lankan Government had the buyback option for a sum of one rupee. The Prima Ceylon Limited could have been bought by the Government for a sum of rupees one. Instead, what happened? The Government of which the majority of the present Ministers were members opted to sell the factory as well as the rights to Prima Ceylon Limited for US Dollars 67 million. In rupee terms it is only Rs. 6,700 million. According to this new Agreement that was hastily put together by the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and Planning, Dr. P. B. Jayasundera, the right to decide the price based on Kansas price formula (basis of a price variation of 25 per cent whether it is wheat flour or grain ) was given to Prima Ceylon Limited. That was the benefit that was given to Prima Ceylon Limited. By this Agreement, Prima Ceylon Limited got the full ownership of 28 acres of land, factory, pier and around four acres of prime land in Kotte as well. Though the original Agreement was to expire only on 1st of January 2003, the Government of former President, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was in a mighty hurry to conclude the deal and they signed the new Agreement on 26th of April, 2001. In the new Agreement, Sir, they brought in another clause. From that clause the wholesale distribution of flour which was done by the CWE was taken off and given to Prima Ceylon Limited causing the CWE another turnover loss of rupees four billion annually. This is besides the loss caused first by selling a loaf of bread at Rs.3.50 and creating a problem for the CWE. People will now understand as to why the CWE is almost dead and gone.

Mr. Speaker, after the Hon. Bandula Gunawardanes accusation that I was responsible for this treachery, there was a television programme on "Derana" on the night of 4th October where the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage participated on behalf of the Government. During this debate, Sir, he said that Prima Ceylon Limited had paid rupees one billion to get this clause included in the Act insinuating that I had something to do with it. He pulled out a paper and waving it around claimed that that was proof of the deal. Mr. Speaker, this is a serious matter. If someone has taken this money in order to smuggle in a clause to a piece of legislation that is passed by Parliament, it constitutes a grave offence. This had happened during their term of office in 2001 when the United National Party was in the Opposition. I urge you to request the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage to table that evidence and also to hand that over to Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption so that this matter could be dealt with more comprehensively. The spineless guys do not mention it. The Island newspaper of 5th October, 2007 reported that the Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa too had joined the bandwagon and repeated the same accusation. This was followed by the editorial in The Island of 6th October, 2007. Several newspapers, especially the Government-

owned newspapers reported this in their editions as well. Mr. Speaker, let me tell you that unlike the present Minister of Trade, Marketing Development, Co-operatives and Consumer Services and some of his Colleagues who are competently playing the role of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, I, when I was the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs did not meet any person represented by the Prima Ceylon Limited during my tenure of office. That was for about 26 months. They never got one single appointment to meet me. All this has happened because of the Governments incompetency and inefficiency. They have no mechanism to control the skyrocketing prices of essential commodities. Let me tell you that even after the new Agreement with Prima Ceylon Limited came into effect, we managed to maintain the price of flour at Rs. 22 during the United National Fronts regime. It is noteworthy to mention that since Independence in 1948 up to the time the UNP handed the country over to the SLFP-JVP-Jathika Hela Urumaya Government on 2nd April, 2004, the price of flour was only at Rs.22. Within 40 months after this Sandhanaya Government came into power, it has gone up from Rs. 22 to Rs. 63. It is an increase of 310 percent caused by this incompetent and corrupt Government. - [Interruption.] The Hon. Bandula Gunawardane and his Colleagues have stated that they are going to request a Select Committee to find out as to how this dubious clause was introduced without the knowledge of the Cabinet. That Cabinet was Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas Cabinet. I welcome them to do so as it involves a billion-rupee payment and we await eagerly to find out who the recipient is. As for the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane, I am sorry to say that only his ignorance will be the outcome. Finally, because of this issue it is my reputation that has suffered from such wild and irresponsible statements. The Hon. Bandula Gunawardanes statement as well as those of the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage and the Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa were given wide publicity by print and electronic media.- [Interruption.] Therefore, Sir, I would like to say in conclusion that I have initiated legal action against those who have made these baseless character-assassinating statements, suing them for Rs.3000 million per person and per institution that has defamed me. Hon. Speaker, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity. Sir, I would also like the same publicity to be given by all the irresponsible Government media to this particular statement made by me. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon.
