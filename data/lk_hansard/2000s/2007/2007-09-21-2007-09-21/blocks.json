This is in relation to the inquiries that are going on by the COPE and the subcommittee of COPE. I have been asked to file an answer. This is the problem I have. Eve-rything in this petition is under investigation by the COPE. I will send copies of the petition to you. If you read the petition, paragraph 21 of 33(b) says that a true copy of Hansard Columns 358 to 362 of 12.1.2007 is annexed hereto marked P35, pleaded as part and parcel thereof. Then, in 34 (e), he says that he became aware of the despicable, deplorable and shameless transaction in issue, only through recent media reports on investigation by COPE, a Parliamentary Committee. Then in 33 (b), he says that Hansard of 12.1.07 con-tains a report by COPE on several investigations carried out by it, including an Interim Report on the transaction in issue in its Columns 358 to 362 as quoted below. I will not quote it at length but this whole case is based on Hansards of Parliament; what has been said in some Hansards and the COPE Report. The investigation is still on. I asked some of the Members of the COPE but they have not concluded this inquiry. In the meantime, a case has been filed and I am asked to file an answer. If I file an answer, then I am subjecting the COPE inquiry to court. There is one reference especially to me which says the second respondent has made a public statement that the said transaction among other transactions had been given effect under the direction of the Economic Affairs Sub-committee of Cabinet chaired by the third respondent, then as Prime Minister. Such a statement was made in Parliament by the second respondent. Subsequently on 6th March 2007, starting from Column 1169 and again in Hansard of 21st August, Column 1421, I clarified the position. In fact I asked the COPE to go into this whole transaction which was done when I was the Prime Minister. I also stated in the House and again repeated on 21st of August that this matter was not taken up by the Economic Affairs Subcommittee for the simple reason it has been authorized by the previous Cabinet. We gave the go-ahead and the Cabinet Paper came straight to the Cabinet. Therefore, this is a matter which is now being investigated by the Subcommittee of the COPE. It will come to the COPE and come to this House. I do not want to say anything more about the matter. It is under investigation and inquiry by the COPE. How am I to an-swer these? Because if I file an answer, I will be bring-ing to courts the matters that are now being investigated by the Committee on Public Enterprises. Secondly, I asked them to go into this matter. As Prime Minister and as Members of the Cabinet, we are collectively responsi-",

This goes for the other matters in the COPE Report that are covered during the period when Mrs. Kumaratunga was President and the Hon. Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka was the Prime Minister. Then, when she was the President I was the Prime Minister. When she was the President, the present President was the Prime Minister and with the present President, we are answerable to the House. If you go to courts, what is the responsibility of this House? You have a matter clearly under the jurisdiction of this House being investigated by the House. Then, one person files action and we are asked to file an answer in court. We have to avoid a clash between courts and Parliament. Recently there was an instance regarding the Sri Lanka Telecom. We raised this in the House. One Member went and filed action and the court gave a stay order. They had a right to give a stay order. We wanted to take action in Parliament. So we put it aside because he had gone to courts first. In this instance, this is a matter which the COPE, the Parliament had discovered 3 to 4 years after it took place. One of the issues raised by the COPE is that the Cabinet Paper was put up on 21st June, 2002 and was approved only on 21st August 2002. We all know the cor-respondence that took place between the then Minister and the then President on this privatization transaction. These are matters that must come out in the COPE and has to be discussed here in Parliament. If I file an answer I may bring Parliament before the jurisdiction of the courts. We have to build up on the Ruling given by the Hon. Anura Bandaranaike as the then Speaker. I want to bring this to your notice. I will send copies of the petition to you, to the Leader of the House and to the Chairman of the COPE. We have to take some decision and lay down guidelines. Otherwise, you find counsel who run to court and take up matters which are already being investi-gated by Parliament. If there is something new, that is a different matter. I thought I should bring this to your at-tention. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) .",

Monty Gopallawa. I met the late Hon. Monty Gopallawa at the University of Peradeniya in the early 1960s and I was his senior at the University of Peradeniya. The friendship which we struck as undergraduates at the University of Peradeniya remained a strong bond of friendship for more than 45 years. Monty, at the University of Peradeniya, was a unique person, a unique character; he was unique because of his fame. He was a son of a famous individual of this country. His father, Mr. William Gopallawa, at that time, was the Governor-General of this country who later became the first President of Sri Lanka whose position came to be described as the \"Dignified Nominal Executive of Sri Lanka.\" In fact, Venerable Sir, I wrote an article under the title, \"The Dignified Nominal",

He was there for a short time and which position he gave up later to take to active politics. As my good Friend, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella said, he selected Laggala as his electorate. Laggala is from his own traditional district, Matale. He selected this backward electorate in the Matale District where Gopallawas had a base. The Gopallawas had their own base in the District of Matale. Therefore he selected Laggala Pallegama as his electorate. Laggala, Venerable Sir, from the point of view of its geography and terrain is one of the most difficult, one of the most backward electorates in this country. Therefore he chose a very backward electorate for electioneering and doing his politics as a novice in the area of parliamentary politics. Laggala Electorate is much more difficult than Mahiyanganaya from the point of view of geography and terrain. It could be described as an inaccessible electorate with all the natural obstacles like jala durga, giri durga and vana durga. All these three obstacles were there at Laggala. - [Interruption.] Yes, it was one of the most backward, undeveloped electorates in the Island. I have visited the place on a number of occasions and even at the 1970 General Election, we went from the University to help Monty to win the electorate. Such difficulties, as we all know, interfere with both electoral and political activities for a young Member of Parliament but Monty, with remarkable ability and agility, came to terms with such conditions and established himself as the champion of the down-trodden peasantry of Laggala. He was the champion of the down-trodden peasantry of Laggala. He was the champion of the impoverished peasantry of the Kandyan hills. We know that in Sri Lanka, the formation of public policy to a great extent is influenced by constituency-politics and constituency-needs. Monty Gopallawa as a very young Member of Parliament understood this fact and acted accordingly. The celebrated and famous English writer Edmund Burke, for instance, saw the representative as the representative of interest and Monty was truly a representative of constituency interest. He had an intimate knowledge of his own constituency and this was the ideal role of the legislator which unfortunately had been demolished by the introduction of the Proportional Representation system. Monty was a great politician of that sort. Monty, as an elected Representative of a backward rural constituency, falls into this particular mould and he, throughout his parliamentary career, tried to articulate the constituency interests with a view to taking public policy decisions to satisfy their needs because he represented one of the backward electorates in the country. Therefore, he was articulating the need to formulate public policy on the basis of the constituency interests and constituency needs. The Hon. Monty Gopallawa in this form, became the constituency grievance man of Laggala. Whenever he met a Minister or a Deputy Minister, the first thing he did was",

    "text": "Executive\" to the Gopallawa Felicitation Volume which Monty Gopallawa arranged when he was a Member of this august Assembly. As an undergraduate at the University of Peradeniya, he specialized in Philosophy. He became a very popular undergraduate because he was able to mingle within the undergraduate community without any inhibitions. He, forgetting the fact that he has a famous father, forgetting the fact that he was a famous son of a famous father, got himself involved in undergraduate activities at the university. He had a scooter I can still remember which, on many an occasion, was used to take messages to different halls of residence in order to encourage students to enter into different political activities, of course, of his own political persuasion. It was his amiable personality and pleasant ways which made him very popular among the undergraduates at the University of Peradeniya and he, as many of us, began to experience a new youth culture at the University. Venerable Sir, the University of Peradeniya was a different University of the 1960s. Though Monty came from an exclusive elite social background, he was able to identify himself with the student politics of the period in which we saw an intellectual commitment to serious economic and political issues. It was a period in which the student community got themselves involved in intellectual debate and argument. He read Philosophy. Venerable Sir, Philosophy is a very difficult subject. He read Western Philosophy. But he was able to get a good Second Class pass at the final examination. Venerable Sir, Western Philosophy, was a special area of study and it gave him a broad vision, broad outlook which remained with him throughout his life and throughout his political career. His outlook was that of an intellectual with a broad world vision which helped him to adjust himself to the needs and aspirations of the Kandyan peasantry. Monty, with this kind of innate ability, was able to adjust himself to the needs and aspirations of the undergraduate community, most of whom were Sinhalese-speaking and of rural background. They were looking for a new kind of leadership capable of articulating their grievances and aspirations. It was Montys involvement in undergraduate politics which, in the end paved the way for the formation of a Sri Lanka Freedom Party Student Organization at the University of Peradeniya. It was the first Sri Lanka Freedom Party Student Organization which was to be formed at Peradeniya which, within a short period of time broke the hold on the student community by the Marxist groups which dominated student politics since the 1940s, since the establishment of the fully-fledged university in 1942. It was through undergraduate political activism that we ourselves, including myself, got socialized into active politics. It was through student undergraduate political activism that Monty Gopallawa got himself socialized into active Parliamentary politics. Monty too came via that particular route. For a short period of time, my good Friend, my dear Friend, the late Hon. Monty Gopallawa served the University of Peradeniya with a few of us as an Assistant",

    "text": "[ . . ] [.. 11.37] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Venerable Sir, for giving me this opportunity to speak on the Vote of Condolence of a Friend with whom I started my political career during the DUNF days. The late Hon. Monty Gopallawa was a politician whom we all looked up to. His unassuming role and modesty ensured that he got more friends than enemies. Monty first represented Laggala in Parliament in 1970 and thereafter, he served the people irrespective of whether he was in Parliament or not. He was a product of St. Thomas Mount Lavinia and that spoke for the gentleman he was. He graduated from one of the finest universities in Asia, the Peradeniya University and his ability was proven from there onwards. I came to know Monty at the time the DUNF was brought into existence. My Colleague Lakshman who is here and I, associated with him at that time owing to the political culture that was prevailing in this country. We never knew that he was a son of a former Governor General because he acted in a very modest way. It is only when we got together and spoke about the calibre of people who need to represent the masses that we came to know the calibre of person he was. Venerable Sir, as you know, my political guru, the Hon. Lalith Athulath Mudali and the Hon. Gamini Dissanayake formed the DUNF under trying circumstances. At the time it was brought into being, the Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne, the late Hon. Lalith Athulath Mudali, the late Hon. Gamini Dissanayake, the late Hon. Monty Gopallawa, the Hon. Kalugalla and all of us gave a lot of emphasis and force to the DUNF. Thereafter, with the untimely death of the Hon. Lalith Athulath Mudali and the Hon. Gamini Dissanayake, there was a necessity to realign and work along with a political force to bring about a cultural change. The Hon. (Mrs.) Srimani Athulath Mudali, who led the Lalith Front and had our support, the Hon. Monty Gopallawa, the Hon. Kalugalla and all of us came to Parliament in 1994. From there onwards, it was in a political society that had been degregading by the day that we were trying to see how we could swim against the tide and at times Monty used to come and ask in Parliament, Are we not ashamed to represent ourselves in Parliament owing to the absolute low-grade activities that are taking place? We were trying to upgrade the political culture and he was a tower of strength at that moment. Thereafter, in his pursuit to do so, he became a Deputy Minister, graduated himself to a Minister and then ended up as a Governor. But at all times, his aim was to ensure that he represented the people, not to fulfil his personal interests. His intention like ours, was to serve and did not expect to be served. Even the ministerial office he held was used not",

    "text": "to request some kind of assistance for Laggala so that Laggalas social and economic status could be developed. He became the champion of the oppressed and the neglected peasantry of Laggala. In the politics of Sri Lanka, Venerable Sir, there is a close relationship between the interests of the Representative and the promotion of constituency interests. Monty, in the course of his illustrious career as a Member of Parliament, was engaged in the promotion of constituency interests. Under the single-member constituency system, a Member of Parliament could successfully articulate the interests of the constituency, which the Hon. Gopallawa did with excellent form and ability. Monty was such a Representative who always looked at issues from the angle of his constituency, from the angle of his voters. He held several positions as a Minister. We were Colleagues together. He was Deputy Minister of Labour and Vocational Training, Deputy Minister of Public Administration, Home Affairs and Plantation Industries, Deputy Minister of Buddha Sasana, Cultural and Religious Affairs and a Cabinet Minister in charge of cultural affairs. Whatever the office he undertook, whatever the office to which he was appointed, he was able to shine in it as a capable and committed worker.",

He was very popular in this office to which he gave a meaningful role. In the provincial council set-up, the Governor has a role, but it needs to be properly expressed; it needs to be given a proper, meaningful expression, which the Hon. Monty Gopallawa did with ability and responsibility. His untimely death - he died after a brief illness - was a great loss to the people of this country because he was an outstanding politician. He was an honest politician. As my learned, good Friend, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella said, he never made money. He made use of his wealth to develop his own electorate. He was an honest politician. He was a rare person. He served the country, primarily the peasantry of the Kandyan hills. With his death, we lost a very dear Friend, a Friend who was a famous son of an equally famous father. His wife is a Kobbekaduwa, whose father was the late Hon. Hector Kobbekaduwa, yet another famous, illustrious politician of this country who nearly became the President of this country. Montys daughter Shanika and son Mahen have lost an excellent and loving father. This country lost an outstanding politician of a rare calibre. I have lost one of my dear Friends with whom I kept a friendship for more than 45 years, from my undergraduate days. Good Bye Monty! May he attain Nibbana! Thank you.",

    "text": "to harm anybody, but to serve everybody. So, I think he was a wonderful personality who needs to be emulated. I think in this society where political degradation is taking place, we must ensure that we change that culture and bring back the situation we had in the good old days, which we admire. So, I guess at a time when the country is at the crossroads, we must ensure that such people and that type of service are looked at and emulated by the future generation. Venerable Sir, all I could say is that we have lost a Friend and a Colleague in Parliament. I request that these sentiments be conveyed to his family. May he attain Nibbana! Venerable Sir, I want to digress at this particular moment - I spoke to the Hon. Speaker just before he left - and refer to an issue that was raised yesterday. As you know, we, as Parliamentarians have certain Privileges in this House. But misusing those Privileges to defame certain media institutions is appalling and I guess what happened yesterday was such a thing. The Members of Parliament have certain Privileges and misusing those only puts us into a worse situation. Yesterday, the Hon. (Dr.) Mervyn Silvas behaviour eroded the dignity of Parliament. His behaviour has become notorious and just because of his behaviour, the rest of the 224 Members should not be put into jeopardy. He stated in Parliament yesterday that the MTV referred to his character saying that he had gone to the Canadian Embassy, brandished his pistol and tried to enter, a thing that was never reported by the MTV. We read this in the newspapers, but it was not reported in any other media. He also stated that the MTV reported that he had threatened the Magistrate. Once again, that is incorrect. So, all we want to say is that using such Privileges to defame media institutions should stop. Otherwise, it reflects badly on the society and the way we act. If such media institutions, whether it is MTV - the very institution to which the Hon. Dullas Alahapperuma gave an award for its neutrality and impartiality in reporting - or any other private media institution, are taken to task by this very Assembly, then what would be our future? As there was no time to respond in the morning, I asked the Hon. Speaker to allow me to raise this matter. Just because of one persons unbecoming act, please do not let the rest of the 224 Members suffer. Correct yourself; turn the searchlights inwards. Otherwise, the State media would make use of this and try to tarnish the image of certain media institutions. So, all we say is, please ensure that the Privileges are not misused just because we have them. Turn the searchlights inwards instead of defaming media institutions, especially when Ministers like the Hon. Dullas Alahapperuma have given awards for impartiality of such stations. I thought I would mention this. Otherwise, this type of culture would go on and have a very bad impact on us in the future. Thank you.",

    "text": "( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) I rise to a point of Order, Venerable Sir. Today, we are in the process of discussing the Vote of Condolence on the demise of the Hon. Monty Gopallawa. If the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake wanted to raise an issue about another Members behaviour, this is not the time to do it. There is a lot of substance in what the Hon. Karunanayake said. Also there would not have been substance. That is a different matter. The Hon. (Dr.) Mervyn Silva is not here and it would have been very pertinent if this was raised when he was here. When we are discussing the Vote of Condolence of the Hon. Monty Gopallawa, it is an insult to him to raise it. I am only urging you, Venerable Sir, to see that anything that is not in accordance with the Standing Orders uttered by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake is expunged from Hansard for the simple reason that the Hon. Minister he referred to is not present in the House. Thank you. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , ; , . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Venerable Sir, I very clearly spoke on the Vote of Condolence of my good Friend Monty and I excused myself and referred to the other matter. That was the time I could take it up and I spoke to the Hon. Speaker. So, it was not misusing the opportunity. Though the relevant Minister is not here, there have been many instances ( ) (The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne) With respect to you, Hon. Karunanayake - whether I am on this side or that side is immaterial - it is the decorum of the House. - [Interruption.] I am still with you. What I am trying to say is, if you had asked for permission from the Hon. Speaker, you should have made a statement in the morning without using this opportunity. While speeches on the Vote of Condolence are being made, we must not drag these things, which are not relevant to what we are discussing. So, Venerable Sir, I beg you, please expunge it from HANSARD. With respect to the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, he can get permission from the Hon. Speaker and make a statement in the House.",

    "text": "Take it as a challenge and try to do something. This is the only Government factory in my district as far as industries are concerned. It was established in 1952 by the late Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam. No renovation or updating has taken place since then. It is the same machinery that was installed in 1952 which is still in use. There were 2000 employees working at the factory but now it is about 300 to 325. I have been discussing this matter with you, Hon. Minister. Find some markets for our own products instead of importing large amounts of paper from other countries; do something. Please look into the welfare of the employees. They have worked there for 25 to 30 years. They have a fear that when this happens one day they may not get compensation. A number of employees have got compensation and have left the factory. So you have to do something beneficial to them. You close down the factory and let some private firm or a BOI project employ these people before retirement. Then you can give them compensation and they will be quite happy. There is a potential for paper production in our country. We have enough straw in our area because our main livelihood is paddy cultivation. Therefore, Hon. Minister, kindly give more emphasis on this matter and try to help the employees. We also like to have at least one factory in our district. If not, it would be a discrimination against us. That, I have to say. I have visited the Valaichchenai paper factory a number of times; even after the election I went there. What the employees say is that it is the same old machinery that is still in use and there are leaks in them which they have covered with plastic materials. I was highly worried about this situation. Hon. Minister, you are a very efficient Minister. I know that very well. Please do something on this matter. I thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for giving me five minutes' time to speak on this matter.",
