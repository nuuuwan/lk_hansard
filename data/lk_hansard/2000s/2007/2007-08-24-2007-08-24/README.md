. . . . . , , . : .. 300 .1,000 .50,000 . . *( , , 9 22) Importance of Rainwater Harvesting Water is the most basic resource in the world. It is also one of the most essential substances for the biotic environment. Water is important for all metabolic activities of living organisms. It is necessary for crop and animal production and also for various other activities essential for the livelihood of animals including man. It is necessary for various physical and chemical reactions taking place in the nature. For example, in the absence of water, rocks will not weather and development of soils will be retarded. Although Sri Lanka is a tropical island getting and annual rainfall of around 1500 mm, there is a severe shortage of water in some Districts of the Dry Zone of the country such as Anuradhapura, Hambantota, Puttalam, Mannar etc. during some months of the year. As a result, people living in these areas have to face immense problems in their day to day household activities and also in crop production. The earliest agricultural settlements were in the river valleys in the northern and south-eastern plains and the main crop cultivated was paddy under rain-fed condction. Hence, farmers were unable to cultivate crops during the dry periods, which is about 4-5 months. In some years the rains would fail resulting in crop failures. This situation promoted our ancient kings to build large reservoirs and construct cannal systems to divert water to the fields. The dry zone is studded with thousands of ancient tanks of varying capacities. King Mahasen was instrumental in constructing the first giant reservoir, the Minneriya reservoir which covered nearly 1,900 ha. Other large tanks such as Parakrama Samudraya, Mahakanadarawa Tank, Kala-wewa etc. were constructed to collect rainwater for crop and animal production and various domestic uses. The storage reservoirs, swimming pools etc. in the 5th century, rock fortress of Sigiriya were dependent on rainwater.

2007 24 1977 1978

However, at present most of the tanks have got silted and people living in the dry zone have to face immense problems in obtaining adequate water for normal domestic activities and also crop production. Crops in these districts fail causing considerable loss to the farmers and seriously affecting food security in the country. Even in the wet zone, there is a water shortage during some months of the year causing severe hardships to the inhabitants of cities.

Water was considered a plentiful resource in most areas but with increase in population, urbanization and modernization, water requirement has-increased considerably. Exacerbating this situation is the climate change which has resulted in a decrease in average rainfall in many countries including Sri Lanka. For example, according to meteorological data, the annual rainfall in Walawe has decreased from 2000 mm in the year 1901 to around 1800mm in the year 2000. Soil degradation followed by desertification in many parts of the world including Sir Lanka also has caused water shortages causing considerable problems to the people inhabiting these areas. For example, in Ethiopia, large tracts of land in the low country have become desserts and plants of animal life can hardly thrive in such environment. According to the International Water Management Institute, nealy 1.4 billion people, amounting to almost quarter of the world population will experience severe water scarcity within the next few decades. Numerous data indicate that the world is running out of freshwater and our demand for freshwater far exceeds its availability and millions of people are forced to undergo problems.

Coming to our own country, the economy and the society had been dependent on water since time immemorial. Our own culture was built upon a hydraulic civilization. Rain water is the main source of water in Sri Lanka. Rain brings down about 100 billion cubic meters a year to the island, but about 60% of it, ie. Around 60 billion c.m tend to run off finally ending in the sea. Hence, collecting of rainwater, usually called harvesting of rainwater is extremely important from the point of view of water supply for drinking as well as well as for other purposes. Rainwater harvesting increases the water supply to the people, and also reduces the power needs to pump water which is getting expensive almost daily. By rainwater harvesting in the dry areas, and storing then in tanks, people would be able to obtain an adequate supply of water.

The rainfall in Sri Lanka is bimodal and the average annual rainfall is around 1700 mm which is considered high when compared with the rainfall of many other countries. In the wet zone, which covers about one-fourth of the country, the average annual rainfall is around 2400 mm, and in the dry zone, it is around 1450 mm. Some parts of the country such as Hambantota District (arid zone) receives only around 1000 mm of rain annually. Even that is received only within 2-3 months of the year, and there is hardly any rain during the other months. In some parts of Sri Lanka, even the water that is available cannot be used for drinking purposes because it has a high fluoride content or a high salt content. Thus, water tends to be scarce in many areas of the country.

Population growth and better infrastructure facilities have resulted in people migrating to towns, a process called urbanization. Thus, the population density in urban areas is mush higher than the average for the country. Fur example, in 2001, the population density in Colombo was 3,305 per sq. km although the average for the country was 300. Urbanization has resulted in an increase in demand for water for domestic purposes. The population density in the urban areas has increased considerably during the last two decades. For example, the population density in Colombo and Kandy were, 1,089 and 446 respectively in 1963. Within 30 years, it has incrased to 3,084 and 665 respectively. The increasing in population in the urban areas and more sophistication has caused an increase in demand in water in the urban areas. For example the present annual water consumption in Colombo City is around 100 million cubic meters. In was 97.7 million in the year 2000. Thus within period of five years, the consumption has increased has increased by almost 2 million cubic meters. The total rainfall received in the country is around 100 billion cubic meters, and about 60% of the rainwater goes waste, At this juncture the famous dictum of King Parakramabahu I, comes to my mind. He has said that Let not even one drop of water that falls on the earth in the

form of rain be allowed to reach the sea. Therefore, collection of rainwater is extremely important. It saves water which otherwise ends up in sea. It is also a cost saving measure, as water in urban areas has to be paid for. It will also reduce flooding and saves purified water. Rainwater is the most pure from of water, It collected properly, it can be used for all domestic purposes including drinking. Some factors such as population by extraneous matter (eg. Bird faecal matter etc. on roof surface may affect the quality of rainwater collected). However, even tap water tend to have such material and hence, comparatively roof-rain water is satisfactory. The rainwater that falls on the roofs of extensive buildings such as hospitals, schools, housing complexes etc. in urban areas can be collected in tanks in the premises itself. Water thus collected could be used for numerous domestic purposes. This wall reduce water bills, save purified water, which can be used for drinking purposes. For centuries the world has relied upon rainwater harvesting to supply water for household, landscape, and agricultural uses. Before city water sistens were developed, rainwater was collected (mostly form roofs) and stored in cisterns or storage tanks. Today, in many countries such as China, India, Australia, Canada etc. rainwater is collected for domestic purposes. In many Caribbean islands where rainwater is the most viable water supply option, public buildings, homes, and resorts all collect rainwater to supply their needs. In Hong Kong, rainwater is collected from skyscrapers to supply water needs. In Sri Lanka too, rainwater can be collected for domestic use in urban and rural areas. At present, there are about 14,000 rainwater-harvesting systems mainly in the rural areas. In view of the increasing demand for water there is an urgent need to resort to alternatives and one of the most feasible is rainwater harvesting.
