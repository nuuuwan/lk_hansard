Mr. Speaker, I also wish to speak on the same issue. The issue relating to the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution and non-appointment of members to the independent Commissions has also been entertained by the Supreme Court. But that is no bar for the Select Committee to Look into the Operation of the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution to function. Since we have come to some conclusion the report of the Select Committee, anyway, has to be submitted to Parliament. Then even the Supreme Court will be possessed of what Parliament has already done. So much of valuable work has gone into it. But, yet the report has not been submitted. If the Chairman of the Seclect Committee could respond ( ) (The Hon. Dew Gunasekera) , , . . , .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

May I say this Mr. Speaker? Now, you yourself have also been cited as a respondent in the case before the Supreme Court. So in your submission you may have to say what is happening in Parliament.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , - ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

You see, you will also be called upon to say as to what is happening to the Select Committee because these are matters pertinent to the case also. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , .

Hon. Speaker, I got up to raise another issue. . . . Committee on High Posts - ( ) (Mr. Speaker) ! - ( ) ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

This is as relevant as what we have been discussing in the morning. Now I will come to a matter that is more relevant in that case. Last Sitting week I spoke about the Mid-Year Fiscal Position Report that had been tabled in Parliament. Hon. Speaker. According to Sections 12 (a), 12(b), 12(c), and 12(d), of the Fiscal Management Responsibility) Act, No. 3 of 2003, it is very clearly stated that there is a requirement or display of cash flows et cetera, why money in being used and how shortages are going to be looked after. Unfortunately, the Secretary to the Treasury Through The Deputy Minister of Finace has tabled in Parliament a document which is irrelevant, concealing and misleading. So, one of the first things we would like to do is to have a clear position . After all, the Secretary to the Treasury today has been indicted by the Supreme Court. Parliament has been misled by a statement that we, Ion Parliament, have wanted it legislated. So, Mr. Speaker. The first point that we need to raise is with regard to the Secretary. The Supreme Court has passed strictures on this Secretary and it has been proved that on 21 instances he has acted completely of his own volition. Next one is, whether such a person who is still in service would be brought before the Committee on High Posts. Next one. Mr. Speaker. That is relevant as matters like The Select Committee to look into the Operation of the Seventeenth

Speaker, it was at the last moment that the mistake was rectified - just before the Summit commenced. I would also like to mention to the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs that when the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and I were on an official trip to the United Kingdom, the Sri Lankan Embassy in the UK had been instructed by the Foreign Ministry not to accord diplomatic status to the Hon. Leader of the Opposition. That is the situation. I brought up this matter in this House on an earlier occasion too. You did not have the courtesy even to respond to that. I mentioned this fact to support what the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera just stated. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, can you tell me the name of the person who told you that no diplomatic status would be accorded to the Hon. Leader of the Opposition? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes. There was no High Commissioner at that time. We were on an official trip to pay a visit to Lord Malloch - Brown. The First Secretary who came to the airport told us that instructions had come from the Foreign Ministry in Colombo not to accord diplomatic status to the Hon. Leader of the Opposition. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) If we did not allow that officer of the embassy to come to the Airport, how did he come?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Well, that was exactly what was told. He said, I was told to pick up the Leader of the Opposition from the Airport and after that- [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Did he come on his own without the approval of the Foreign Ministry? This is the normal practice. No one has to sanction the Hon. Leader of the Opposition's visits like that of any other Ministers'. When such a visit is notified to the Foreign Ministry the relevant Missions are informed of his arrival and the normal courtesies are extended. There is nothing more than that. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, I am telling you what went on. The First Secretary of the embassy did mention that. Accept that such mistakes are made by the Ministry. This was specifically mentioned in this House earlier as well.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Never. I deny those allegations. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You deny everything. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) I deny that such a thing has happened. We maintain the highest type of protocol. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) We mentioned the other day how even the Leader of the House has said an untruth before this House on the 11th of July, 2008. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . . . ( . ) (The Hon. M.

( - ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama - Minister of Foreign Affairs) Venerable Presiding Member, I would like to join the Debate on a very important piece of legislation that has been submitted to this House, by my Colleague, the Hon. Minister of Environmental and Natural Resources. I must compliment the Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka

2481 2482

[ ]

for having brought in this far-reaching legislation. This is vital in the context of Sri Lankas future, both domestically and regionally. This has a international dimension too. Today, we are looking at this Bill which is to provide for the prevention, control and reduction of pollution in the territorial waters of Sri Lanka or any other Maritime Zone and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. Now, the Foreign Ministry has become a very important contributor towards the process where we are contemplating to bring in far-reaching legislative measures as incorporated in Clause 7 of this Bill. I may quote Clause 7(a) of the Marine Pollution Prevention Bill. It says: 7. The Authority may exercise all or any of the following powers:- (a) to effectively safeguard and preserve the territorial waters of Sri Lanka or any other maritime zone from pollution arising out of any ship based activity or shore based maritime related activity; Now, this is a very important piece of legislation whereby we look at additional areas that may come within the authority, jurisdiction of Sri Lanka as a sovereign State. We have at present the area that we are now terming as Delimitation of the Continental Margin of Sri Lanka. The Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka went on to mention the additional area that comes from the sea to island states like that of Sri Lanka where we have access to eight times the current land area of Sri Lanka in terms of the continental shelf or the abating sea-shores or the waters. Here is where I would like to explain to this House the current progress Sri Lanka has made in relation to the Delimitation of the Continental Margin of Sri Lanka. The United Nations Convention on the Law the Sea requires States Parties to submit geological and scientific data and other material pertaining to the establishment of the outer limit of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, which is termed as CLCS. National submissions containing in such data and other material were initially required to be submitted to the CLCS - the definition of which I have already given - by 13th May, 2009. The Cabinet of Ministers approved the setting up and the commencement of functioning of the project on the Delimitation of the Outer Edge of the Continental Margin of Sri Lanka which is called the "DEOCOM" in October 2003, with the objective of acquiring, processing and interpreting the requisite geophysical data for its national submission to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. As I have indicated, the submissions and the application proper has to be deposited by 13th May, 2009 and I am happy to state in this august Assembly that the work is currently underway and we are very much within

the time. Most of the work has now been completed and data has now been collected in order to submit the requisite application. The first two phases of the project concerning the collation of data relating to Sri Lankas continental margin, which is being done as the Desktop Study Phase, and the acquisition of seismic data have been completed. Seismic survey of the adjacent sea bed was commissioned on the 14th of July, 2007 and completed on the 5th of October, 2007. Venerable Presiding Member, that phase has now been completed within the time limit that was allocated for the first phase. The project has now entered the final and the crucial phase which relates to the processing and analyzing of seismic data and the preparation of Sri Lankas submission, both legal and technical, to the CLCS. In this regard, a committee has been appointed to report on the DEOCOM project and to assist the Presidential Secretariat to supervise the submission of data and other material by Sri Lanka to the UNCLCS. The CMBC functioned as an apex body which superseded the existing committees including the High Level Task Force jointly headed by the Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Secretary to the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources. However, since October 2007, the process has been in the concentration and finalization phase of the seismic data. Notwithstanding the withdrawal of the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, NPD, in March 2008, the Norwegian Embassy has assured the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that funds are available for Sri Lanka for the acquisition of necessary hardware and software for the processing and the interpreting of the already acquired seismic data, provided a proposal with regard to the national submission of Sri Lanka is submitted to the Norwegian authorities at the earliest. The proposal initially submitted by the DEOCOM project was withdrawn by the CMBC and a new proposal was to be submitted to the Norwegian Embassy by the CMBC. This has not been done by the CMBC to date because we have got various other alternatives that we have looked at. There has also been a proposal coming from one of the Co-chairs of the CMBC, Dr. Hiran Jayewardene, to bring in the Southampton Oceanographic Institute and the Commonwealth Secretariat in the United Kingdom for processing and analyzing data. However, since there is no assurance at this stage that this could be accomplished, we are of the view that we should make every effort - this is the course the Government is following - to utilize available local resources with Norwegian assistance to complete the technical part of our national submission for the following reasons: one, it is important to build up our own resources and expertise and two, the Norwegian Embassy has assured that the funds are already available for this purpose.

2008 05 2483 2484

Initially, the time line for submission of national claims by the relevant States Parties was scheduled for the13th of May, 2009. However, as a result of the extensive discussions held at the States Parties meeting on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in New York in June, 2008, the following decision was taken to overcome the difficulties faced by many States, particularly developing States, in meeting the time line. I will quote the outcome of the said meeting. It states, (a) It is understood that the time period referred to Article 4 of Annex II to the Convention and the decision contained in SPLOS 72 paragraph (a) may be satisfied by submitting to the Secretary General a communication containing preliminary information indicative of the outer limits of the Continental Shelf beyond 200 nautical miles and a description of the status of preparation and intended date of making a submission, in accordance with the requirements of Article 76 of the Convention and the Rules of Procedure and Scientific and Technical Guidelines of the Commission. (b) Pending the receipt of the submission, in accordance with the requirements of Article 76 of the Convention and the Rules of Procedure and Scientific and Technical Guidelines of the Commission, preliminary information provided pursuant to paragraph (a) above, shall not be considered by the Commission. Accordingly, the May, 2009 time line will not apply to States Parties that will not be able to complete their final submission to the CLCS by May, 2009, provided such preliminary communication is sent to the Secretary-General by a State Party before the aforesaid date. Sri Lanka, I am happy to state, will however make every endeavour to prepare and finalize its national submission to the CLCS at least in time, that is much before May, 2009 in order to avoid joining the tail end of the queue. The reason why we say that is, because there are 192 parties or more that may try to seek benefits from the delimitation process of the continental shelf margin and we want to be ahead of many a State that may also be seeking to make their applications. It is in that context that today our Ministry has been empowered as the sole authority of getting the submission ready in time, which responsibility will be discharged to the satisfaction of this House and in line with the priorities that we have set in terms of the development of the continental shelf of Sri Lanka. Stating that, I would now like to get more on to the factual position of the benefits that a State stands to enjoy by getting additional jurisdiction both over economic and other purposes when the continental delimitation process is decided on. We are looking at a country that is poised in the Twenty First Century to make headway with its economic agenda. Today, Sri Lanka has got graduated into a visibly high profile country within the international community. At present, we also Chair the SAARC which represents 23 per cent of the total world population and we are also a part of a region that is thriving on its pursuits; both political and economic. It is an area which we term as the powerhouse of the world because the driving economies associated with SAARC are today becoming a world attraction for investments and

economic growth. In that context, Sri Lanka has a major role to play. Sri Lanka cannot act in isolation. Sri Lanka has to join its strength with the synergies that are found within the SAARC region and also we should get graduated into a very important destination for economic activities. Today, our economic activities are largely confined to the shores that we have currently defined in terms of our landmarks. We have not found what lies in the seas surrounding us because there has been only our traditional area of pursuit: the fisheries sector and the fisheries sector only. We have not sufficiently concentrated on even promoting tourism associated sectors within the waters surrounding us. We have not concentrated on the deposits that are lying beneath the seas which are our territorial waters. We have not looked at the additional benefits we could generate from the energies we can find in the water base of the country. So, this is a new dimension to Sri Lankas profile, Sri Lankas activities, Sri Lankas future and Sri Lankas security. Sri Lankas security lies both in economic empowerment and the political strength; Sri Lankas strength lies in our people, which is 20 million today and is growing annually and is getting empowered with their pursuits. We are happy that we have got the fundamentals in place. We have got a good literacy rate which is over 94 per cent. We have got a good health index where the life expectancy is at 75 years, which is comparable with that of the most developed countries in the world. We have got child welfare schemes; we have got free education, free healthcare facilities and we have got a social net to secure the well-being of our society. But, at the same time, the per capita income is still low and it is not enough. The income level with which our people could harness the best of their lives is still limited; we have to improve it. We also have to look at how best we could ignite the strengths within our people. We have seen the potential of Sri Lankan skills; we have seen our human resources associated with our society; we have seen the ground-related resources and the need for greater enhancement; we have seen that the industrial products of Sri Lanka need greater value addition. These are areas that our Government headed by His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa is concentrating on. Today, as I said earlier, I am happy that there is another dimension to Sri Lankas profile. A sea territory eight times the size of Sri Lankas ground area or the land area is getting added and that is what we term as a very important juncture in Sri Lanka's future. In that regard, the continental shelf that we are discussing and the margin associated therewith need to be given high priority by our Government. The President has decided that that responsibility should lie with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for which we have now brought the Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to chair a Committee in order to see that the facilitation and the immediate processing of this application takes place. A

2485 2486

joint committee was set up along with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources and the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and other agencies associated with the Government headed by the Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Secretary to the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources in order to assess the initial phase. That Committee is being co-chaired by Dr. Hiran Jayewardene and Mr. Chris Pinto. We are trying to put it into high gear because we have now come to the final phase where the data collected will get processed into the application state. I must assure this House that everything will be done in order to meet the time frame which is set for May, 2009. But much before that, we will be processing and submitting this application to the authorities that matter, namely the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. I must associate myself with the Hon. Minister of Environment and Natural Resources. He has brought in a very timely piece of legislation that includes areas for the future. The additional sea area or the oceanic area that comes within our territorial waters and adjacent to that will also become a base for maritime related activities for Sri Lanka to pursue. With these words I would like to thank the Hon. Minister of Environment and Natural Resources for a very timely move of bringing this legislation and for matters connected therewith so that we could always look at Sri Lankas future associated with the highest level in the international affairs in terms of our pursuit on economy and political affairs. I also must welcome the contribution that has come from the Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources through the joint Committee that has been set up and I will continue to associate with my Colleagues in the pursuance of its application in time. Thank you. [..11.50]

( . . . - , ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie - Minister of Petroleum and Petroleum Resources Development) Mr. Presiding Member, as a one-time Minister of Environment and Natural Resources and as the Minister in charge of the subject of Petroleum and Petroleum

Resources Development, I am thankful to you for the opportunity given to me to speak a few words on the Marine Pollution Prevention Bill which seeks to set up a Marine Environment Protection Authority. It has been proposed to embody necessary provisions in the proposed Bill to establish a Marine Environmental Council too. The envisaged law is supposed to provide more authority in dealing with the protection of marine environment. My Ministry is also being looked upon as a body that may have to take the major share of blame particularly when it comes to oil spilling into the sea. I know that there is a potential risk of oil spilling due to the large number of ships passing through our maritime waters. Ships that are transporting over two million tons of crude oil per year to our country pose a grave risk of accidental oil spilling and the consequences can be devastating. Nearly 350 vessels a day queuing down at Hambantota is yet another imminent threat of catastrophic oil spilling which may occur at any time without any forewarning. There is an International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund established in 1992 to cover the payment of compensation to the people, business or organization who suffer losses due to pollution caused by persistent heavy oil, crude oil and fuel oil from oil tankers. Sri Lanka is a member of this international body and its last meeting held in London in June last year was attended by Sri Lanka. Ninety Eight states are members of this body and it is financed by contributions paid by any person of the member states of the Fund who have received in excess of 150,000 tons of crude oil or heavy fuel oil in ports or terminal installations by sea in the relevant calendar year. Chances of further risk are increased by increasing number of ships call on our ports for bunkering, accidental discharges and deliberate dumping of oil. Feeder streams that carry industrial wastes and chemical rejects from factories flow into the sea through rivers have also been contributing to land-based marine pollution activity. I know that the existing Marine Pollution Prevention Act and the mechanism are rather obsolete and inadequate in handling marine pollution prevention. Stricter regulation and stringent measures, therefore, become very vital in this circumstance. I am happy that the new law seeks to strengthen powers and functions of the Marine Pollution Prevention Authority and incorporate offences hitherto not covered by the existing law. I note that one of the new areas included in the proposed Bill is petroleum exploration. While I agree with the envisaged law, I wish to state that adequate care has been taken by my Ministry to incorporate necessary precautionary provisions in the Petroleum Resources Agreement for oil exploration in order to ensure marine pollution prevention.

2509 2510

The Petroleum Resources Agreement requires that the contractor shall, prior to conduct any drilling activity, prepare and submit for review and approval by the PRDS, a contingency plan dealing with any oil spilling, fire, accident and emergency, designed to achieve rapid and emergency response. The contractor is also bound by the Agreement to implement immediately such contingency plan in the event of such an emergency. The oil exploring company is also required to remove all installations erected to carry out petroleum exploration or gas exploration and perform site restoration in accordance with modern oil field or gas field and petroleum industry practices using the modern technologies. Article 14 of the Petroleum Resources Agreement covers a comprehensive area of environment protection including prevention of marine pollution. I would, however, wish to extend my fullest support and co-operation for the implementation of the new law by subjecting oil exploration activities to conform to the new law. Thank you.

Thank you, Ven. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity to speak on CEPA which, I think, is a very important matter and I appreciate the Motion moved by Hon. Wimal Weerawansa and the reflections made by Dr. Sarath Amunugama on that.

I am rather perplexed as to the origin of it and the defence of it, because as former Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, I must say CEPA is a very important matter and I would not like to take this Debate lightly. We certainly like to reflect on some matters which have led to this Debate. I agree with Hon. Wimal Weerawansa that the Government was trying to surreptitiously sign the CEPA. When matters of importance like this and as a matter of fact- . . , . I think, these are matters that need to be debated in depth. Hon. G. L. Peiris, as the Minister of Export Development and International Trade, has a very difficult task of balancing certain matters with a very heterogeneous alliance of a government, an introverted government, which has to now defend certain external trade relations. As you know, Prof. G. L. Peiris and I, when we were in Government together, resurrected an economy that was dead, which had a negative growth and we brought it to a level where the international world accepted Sri Lanka as a very important trading partner. Now, the matter under discussion today is certainly an extension of the SAPTA to SAFTA, to the Free Trade Agreement and then, going onto CEPA. We certainly are not saying that this should be opposed. But, the manner and the way in which it has been brought in to be signed is very very surreptitious. That is what needs to be looked at. Hon. Minister, we would like to know, first of all, before you bring in new agreements into the country, external agreements like this, they need to be vibrantly debated in Parliament and the entire Chambers - the businessmen have to be given an opportunity to see what is coming in. The same thing happened when this Government signed the ACSA agreement with the United States of America on acquisition and cross servicing. It was stealthily brought in. We did not know for what it was signed. Subsequently, when there was a Debate only everything was highlighted. CEPA is not something on which you have to get into a debate or you have got to sign stealthily. You can be very open. I was the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs. I must say that we initiated the CEPA as the Indians wanted it because we were having a TIFA and moving on to a Free Trade Agreement with the United States of America. The Hon. (Prof.) G. L. Peiris is very well aware of that. When the Indians saw that we were heading towards a Free Trade Agreement with the United States of America they thought that this was the best launching pact to go into America by having a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement with Sri Lanka. When the governments changed and when the Free Trade Agreement reduced its value to TIFA and they brought it down to almost to just a talk shop, then only the problems started to react in Sri Lanka. Obviously the CEPA is meant for expansion of markets. It is an export

2541 2542

diversification process. But before doing that you must ensure that our people are able to compete with a giant like India as the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama mentioned. Your intentions are very pure. But you are not leading the investors in this country to fight with mega India and put us in an even playing field. You mentioned that you are looking at India as a huge trading partner and I wonder as to whether you yourself and the Hon. (Prof.) G. L. Peiris himself are doing something which is against the Governments intention, because they are looking introverted. When we left office we had the US Free Trade Agreement in place; talks over the European Union Free Trade Agreement were in process; Free Trade Agreement with Pakistan was there; Free Trade Agreement with Malaysia was there and then you had the Bangladesh Free Trade Agreement too. All those were in motion, because we believe that little Sri Lanka must be integrated into a bigger world. But we have to do that with the concurrence and with the belief of the investors in this country that they can compete with the rest of the world. That is why we got hammered. Even at that time the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa of the JVP had a different thinking. That may be different. But they hammered us for the Free Trade Agreement. When I went to represent Sri Lanka at the WTO meeting in Cancun what was told? They said that I was a Tamil politician going around and selling the sole sovereignty of Sri Lanka to the world. But, today the world has realized that the steps we took then were in the right direction. This is always the case. The United National Party reads the writing on the wall ten to fifteen years early. The laggards hit the United national Party. The damage is done and then we have got to come and compound that damage. That is what the Hon. Dr. Sarath Amunugama so aptly stated in a very professional manner that, this should have been done ten years ago. That is what the United National Party did. But, even then we always had discussions with the Chambers - we did not have the officials. .. , ? . . . "" 24 . 19 . .. . , , . So, on that particular basis, certainly, market expansion is necessary; export diversification is necessary. India and we are best of friends. We do not say one thing in the morning and another in the evening. We are a party that is consistent. Our Leader and our Party have been maintaining a very consistent policy with India. Unfortunately, that has been shaken to such an

extent that today India looks as if they are being cheated. India basically acted upfront. The Secretary to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry of India came to Sri Lanka and said, We will give in to certain concessions that you want. But ensure that we sign this before the SAARC Summit or at least during the SAARC Summit. Is that not correct, Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris? So, if that is the case, I am asking you, officially did the Cabinet give you approval to go ahead with CEPA discussions? If that is not the case, why did the Secretary to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry of India come here and approved certain matters? Then, you said, Yes, we are ready to go ahead with CEPA. I do not find fault with you at all on that. Obviously, you would have got the concurrence. Then, if that is the case, when everything was over, why did the Cabinet two weeks ago say, We are sorry. We do not know what is going on? Why did the Minister of Ports and Aviation, the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa, say, Why have we given too much into the shipping industry? Why did the Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources say, We have not been consulted? Then, the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa who formed a new political party opposed it. The JHU jumped and opposed it again. These are parties that are giving you absolute support. So, when this type of political parties oppose it, India may be looking at it and thinking, Sri Lanka is whacking us again." The issue on the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution was one such instance. They were taken to the cleaners then and again they have been taken to the cleaners by saying, "Let us do everything and go ahead" and at the last moment the Cabinet saying, "We do not know what the hell is going on." While you are talking about a CEPA with India, you are also talking about a CEPA with Pakistan. The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe and I had the opportunity of meeting the Prime Minister of Pakistan. Quite rightly, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, the Minister of Export Development and International Trade, has initiated this. We feel that the SAFTA is a very important agreement. As a matter of fact, when I was the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, I spoke with Mr. Maran, along with the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris ably assisting me at that moment. Then, also Mr. Chaudhary Ahmad Mukhtar, Minister of Commerce of Pakistan, the Minister of Commerce and Industry of Bangladesh and Mr. Arun Jaitley, the subsequent Minister of Commerce and Industry after Mr. Maran passed away. He was saying, Let we, the SAFTA, get together and challenge the rest of Asia and take the world on. Let not India and Sri Lanka compete. But, we were hammered out of shape, saying we were selling the sovereignty of Sri Lanka to India. No, we always allowed the Chambers to take the decision. We were politicians who were businessmen. We knew how the businesses were going on. But that is not what is in existence now. You have officials who do not understand business. You are making India compete with us. The Hon. Wimal Weerawansa quite aptly mentioned that 33.

4 11 . ? , 24, 27. 2 4, 5 . ? Did the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris think of this? Hon. Minister, I would like to table* an article that appeared in the print edition of Times Online dated 05th August, 2008, which states, I quote: CEPA signing to be delayed, Minister G.L. Peiris One week ago you said, We are ready to sign CEPA with India. Let us go ahead with it. Did the Cabinet give you approval? If not, why? On the basis of your saying that we need to expand markets, what have you done with the WTO agreement that is on? What have you done with TIFA? What have you done with the European Labour GSP Plus Plus? Why are you losing markets? You are trying to go into new markets. Why do you not protect the existing markets? Remember, just the signing of an agreement does not mean that you have access to the Indian market. They will look at whether paratariffs are coming in; whether the Constitution is being upheld. You are not doing that. The Seventeenth Amendment is not being adhered to.

Then you have to ensure that you have an even playing field because you are basically telling the Indians that they have to come on certain conditions but then the Sri Lankans cannot go on reverse course to India on the same conditions - I mean on non tariff barriers. So when you do those types of things you are not protecting the interest and the ability of our Sri Lankan investors who are going to compete with the Indians. In India, the critical mass is so great that internally their markets are much bigger than what Sri Lankans can capture. So for us, yes, it is a huge opportunity.

As for India, they do not care whether Sri Lanka exists or not. That is why we then moved from SAPTA to SAFTA and then to the Indo-Lanka Free Trade Agreement and then to CEPA. We wanted to get something for Sri Lanka. But, we made our businessmen go and make that decision; we made our Chambers make that decision. But, Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, you have not allowed that to happen this time. I am tabling* another article that appeared in the online edition of "Sunday LAKBIMA news" of 20.07.2008 and I want it included in Hansard, Venerable Presiding Member, so that people would realize how we have debated this issue. * . * . * Produced at end of speech.

It states, I quote : 'India said CEPA or interference?" * PACT SHELVED OR PUT-OFF * HEAVY PRESSURE FROM JHU ETC, This has been mentioned by the Indians. They are astonished. On the very day the Cabinet said, We are sorry. This is going to be delayed, postponed, adulterated.." et cetera, the Indians were horrified as to what type of a Government they have been dealing with; the Government that they have assisted and bailed out very many times. Why had the Secretary to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry of India got to come here, give his approval and then be told, "Sorry, we have not got Cabinet ratification"? Hon. Minister, we are not dealing with a family or a town or a village or a province. This is Sri Lanka dealing with India. So, you must give an acceptable explanation to this House as to why the Cabinet said no to you when you had discussed this matter. I am sure, with your erudite knowledge, you would have got the approval . Then who torpedoed this at the last moment? Why has Sri Lanka been put into an embarrassing situation when India is our closest of friends? When the SAFTA was signed during former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga's time, you moved away allowing Sri Lanka to be exploited. You had a 1:10 export ratio when it was signed. When we left, it was 1:3. We allowed our exports to go to India. It is right that Vanaspathi is one of the items. It is right that copper is another such item, but that was being handled by your Foreign Minister. That was not our area. We developed product diversification. We had textiles, tea, fisheries, all that were sent there - unthinkable items. Even though Jayalalitha was protecting India from non-tariff barriers, we fought the system. At this particular moment we must not be blind to what is being done. As I said, the Indian officials are doing what is good for them and if our officials are also doing what is good for India, then who is looking after Sri Lankas interests? That is what we have got to look at. Hon. Minister, you mentioned about Al-futtaim buying 71 per cent of shares of AMW. . . ? , . 33 , 24 . " , 25 , 25 " . CEPA . CEPA . LIOC . oil exploration.

An article in the "Daily Mirror" online edition of Saturday, July 19, 2008 states, I quote : CEPA to expand on Indo-Lanka trade ties The Chambers are very unhappy with what is going on. Hon. Minister, I told you about this unofficially when I met you. Mr. Micky Wickremasinghe of Munchee, one of the first people to go across the shores, across the Palk Strait to India and invest there, was saying that they were having insurmountable problems. They were being taxed when going from one province to another. They were being looked at as if they were coming to attack the Indian industry; but he weathered the storm. He is one of the biggest manufacturers there, but that is not available for the rest. Now, look at MAS. At one of the meetings of the Chambers, you have spoken very eloquently, but one fact that you lost sight of was, during our Free Trade Agreement discussions, we were able to open up for six million pieces to be sent duty-free to India. But, there

was not even 250,000 pieces exported because you cannot compete with India on that basis. But, look at what has happened. You have MAS, one of the biggest groups operating here, and Brandix, another leading group here, going and investing in Ahamadabad. So, if that is the case, when you say, "We have the entire textile industry opened up", what does that mean? Nothing. So, Hon. Minister, in that case, what is the export diversification that we have been permitted to do? If Vanaspathi is being stopped, if copper is being stopped, if ceramic is being stopped, if the fisheries industry is being attacked, if the textile industry is being relocated in India, what are we opening it up for? But remember, during our tenure of office - I say this, because being in business like the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, we had hands-on experience and we knew what was going on - we ensured that it was stopped and we were able to go to the Indians and say, Sorry, we cannot give in to these types of things. That is the difference. I guess everybody cannot be a businessman and I do not expect the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris to be one; but his erudite knowledge can be utilized to see through the process. Why was it that 19 meetings held on CEPA were inactive, absolutely passive and then the last five became very active? Because, the Indians saw that there was a necessity to capture. While opening up the markets - we have absolutely no problem - this must be looked at from the point of view - ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , 30 .

Then you look at the service sector and the Chambers. The accountants have said, "We are opposed to this. The banking sector has said, We are opposed to this. The lawyers, whom you aptly represent, are saying, "You are not giving us equal standards. Our Bar standards are very much higher than theirs." So, when we try to integrate, we will never get anything coming from them. Then, advertising. Your daughter will vouch for that more than anybody else, Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama. So, when you talk, look at the - ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) They will go to India. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Your daughter has captured the Sri Lankan market. So, why should she go to India? We appreciate that. I know that the father is not helping the daughter, but the daughter is helping the father. Do not allow us to lose our market share. So, all what we want to say is, ensure that the inherent talent of the Sri Lankan is not lost. Our strength is that we are able to compete with anybody in the world. But, ensure that we have an even playing field. Inflation must be brought down. I was absolutely stunned when His Excellency the President said, "Let us have a common currency". How can you have a common currency when you suddenly say, today we are increasing taxes by 20 per cent, we are having paratariffs at 25 per cent? You are not bothered about inflation. The Central Bank prints money everyday; borrows from the Bank of Ceylon and commercial banks. So, how can you do this? ( ) (The Presiding Member) . . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , . So, on that particular basis, all what we want to say is, remember, even if you open up the markets, the Constitution must be upheld. If India basically says that you are flouting the Constitution of this country, they can stop any agreement that is in place. Today, the Seventeenth Amendment is not being implemented. So, Hon. Minister, these are the matters that have got to be looked at. You cannot take it up excluding these factors. You cannot say, "Do, what I say, but do not do what I do." That is what Sri Lanka is telling the rest of the world.

You had the SAARC. We know that SAARC is a wonderful regional grouping of the poorest of countries. It is a talk shop. That is what Dr. Manmohan Singh mentioned: we have been talking, doing nothing. Tell me one important move that had been made at the SAARC. It is well and good; you had your carnivals. Now it is time to pay for it. There is a 2 per cent environment tax coming in. Today, this is basically what is happening. Today, people are losing confidence in the economy. That is why the Government says, let us open up the economy. That will create a short-term livelihood for the exporters and a long-term interest for the Indians to come and acquire our economy. Then, what are you going to say? So, all what we want to say is, let us ensure that we do what is good for Sri Lanka and let the Indians do what is good for India. There should be a meeting point somewhere. That is why we are not opposing CEPA. But, make it public. Let us see what is in the CEPA document. While you are talking about CEPA, also protect the European Labour GSP Plus Plus. You had the European legislators coming here and saying, we are sorry. You are not going to get that. The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris owes a duty to inform this House as to whether the Labour GSP is on record or not; whether you are going to get it or not. MAS and Brandix have left Sri Lanka and gone to India because they would lose the Labour GSP before too long. So, please ensure, before you look at new markets, that you protect our existing markets. With that, all we can say is, let us work together. Never colourize the economy. That is why we once again say, keep foreign affairs and international trade apart. Let us work together for the common good of Sri Lanka. Thank you. : : Documents tabled : PRINT EDITION Sunday Times News Editorial Columns Sports Weekly issues Mirror TV Funday MediScene Services Times Times TIMES Online Tuesday, August 05. 2008 3:06: 38 AM Home Videos Cartoon Blog Poli CEPA signing to be delayed, Minister G.

L. Peiris said today. There will be a fuller, broader discussing before the signing of the agreement, Minister Peiris told reporters at a press briefing. He said that negotiations on the agreement had begun in August 2004 and even though there had been a great deal of discussions, strong opposition has emerged during the past two weeks from the chambers commerce, industrialists and others and the government wants to give more time for a even border discussion before finalizing matters.

India said CEPA or interference? * PACT SHELVED OR PUT-OFF * HEAVY PRESSURE FROM JHU ETC., Mystery and talk of intrigue surrounds the CEPA (Comprehensive Economic Partnership) agreement signed during the forthcoming SAARC summit. The Government has now decided to postpone the signing or to call it off. Whats definite is that the signing of CEPA during SAARC. Reports are that the Governments coalition partners were angered trying to use CEPA as a bargaining chip to ensure Indian non-interference in the Governments forward Wanni. The army commander announced this week that his troops are poised now to march into Killinochchi heartland. Other sources said that though the Government agreed to CEPA, a free trade agreement with India, it has on this agreement due to pressure from the coalition partner, particularly the JHU, Earlier nationalists st Amarasekera of the Jathi Hithaishee Viyaparaya said CEPA was a secret agreement being foisted where Sri Lanka stands to lose badly due to unfavourable terms of trade. The Government trotted out a CEPA will not be signed as cabinet approval has not been obtained. However, CEPA was negotiated and about to be signed after the Government definitely decided to go ah this abrupt turnaround, sources say, was due to immense political pressure and the perception that Sri into India in order to secure certain conditions such as non interference on the war front. Earlier this month a powerful Indian delegation of three VVIP officials was in Colombo sparking specu were here to stop the armys march towards the Wanni. ( ) (The Presiding Member) . . ( ) (The Hon.

( ) (The Presiding Member) . . . . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Thank you Venerable Presiding Member. We are discussing today an Adjournment Motion pertaining to the contemplated Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement between Sri Lanka and India. I believe, Sir, there was some expectation that this Agreement would have been signed when the Prime Minister of India visited Sri Lanka a few days ago in connection with the SAARC Summit that was held in this country. But that did not happen. I believe Sir, it did not happen on account of some of the strident voices that were raised in this country against this Agreement. Some sections of people in this country Sir, I think, suffer from grave xenophobia. They are against any involvement with anything foreign and when it is with India, the xenophobia becomes "Indo-phobia". It is even more virulent than normally. This is a strange phenomenon, but it is quiet prevalent amongst certain sections of society in this country. I think that is the foundation of this Motion that has been moved in this House today. An atmosphere of hostility is built up; all sorts of harsh things were stated with or without substance, without adequate reason, without being able to substantiate the strength of these arguments with any irrefutable material and by this hostility that is built up, further progress is eroded, ended and the whole project comes to a stop - is terminated. This has been a part of the culture of this country in regard to many matters. This has been one of the reasons, I think, why this country is today in this terrible mess, that is; in regard to the economy, in regard to the national question, in regard to discipline, in regard to law and order, in regard to human rights and so on. Very strangely Sir, some of us are very strongly persisting with this attitude. Almost every country in the world, from whichever region, wants to have Economic Partnership Agreements with India. That is the reality. Sir, I have seen several reports in the media recently that many countries in Europe like France, Italy and even other countries want to have Economic Partnership Agreements with India in one sector or the other. Several Asian countries - take Singapore, take Japan, take even China - want to have Economic Partnership Agreements with India. In fact, one might see that there is sometimes competition amongst these countries to arrive at a partnership agreement with India in the economic sphere. Why is it, Sir? It is on account of the irrefutable fact that India today is a tremendous economic powerhouse. India is

[ ]

2008 05 2559 2560

making vast strides in economic progress in all sectors. In some sectors - for instance Information Technology - it is, perhaps numero uno - number one - in the whole world. Indias population is one billion. I heard the JVP Member, the Hon. Bimal Ratnayake, saying that a large number of people there are poor. But, I think, Indias economic progress is such that today that number is considerably diminishing. I think, today India has a middle class population of about - definitely more than 300 million - almost 400 million people, who are very affluent, who enjoy a lifestyle comparable with affluent societies in many Western countries. It provides a tremendous market. That, I think, is the reason why many countries the world over want to sign Economic Partnership Agreements with India, on account of the tremendous market that India has and on account of the tremendous progress it has made in the economic sphere, in the field of science and technology, in the field of industry and in the field of Information Technology, though some persons here may not agree. I think, world over it is accepted that India today is a very, very vibrant economy steadily moving forward and probably will be, before long, one of the most powerful economies in the world. But we, Reverend Sir, living so closeby and having all the opportunities to be able to forge alliances with India and utilize all the potential that is available in India for our benefit are not prepared to do it on account of this very very narrow mindset, thoroughly nihilistic approach that we have towards anything that is foreign and particularly even more so virulent when it comes to India. I want to read to this House Reverend Sir an advertisement published by the Damro Company in every newspaper in this country during the time of the SAARC Conference. I have seen several branches of this Company in various parts of Chennai during my recent visits there. This is what the advertisement of Damro Company says. I quote, Thank you India When we crossed the ocean from Sri Lanka and set foot on Indian Shore, little did we imagine the kind of welcome and acceptance that we would find in India. Today, Damro is a household name in India for home & office furniture that offers the best in price and quality. Our remarkable success in India would not have been possible but for the Government of Indias cooperation and assistance. We, at Damro, take this historic moment as an opportunity to render our heartfelt thanks to the Indian Government which allowed us to do business across India and make a success out of it. We also thank the Indian Public for choosing our products. This is what the Damro Company says. That is because they had the courage to face the challenge to take the opportunity and go across to India and do well. I have not the slightest doubt, Reverend Sir, that there are several other companies in Sri Lanka which are quite capable of doing as well as Damro Company has done or

even better. But there are some people in this country who do not want that type of interaction with any foreign country, any foreign power and certainly not with India. I want to raise this question on the Floor of the House, Reverend Sir. What section of the people in this country do these persons represent; who come here and make a big noise and raise objections of this nature and build-up hostility against many a project that can be useful to this country, that can take this country forward? So, I think, this is something that we should be very careful about and I think, this type of negative attitude must not be encouraged. It must be nipped in the bud. I think, if the Government takes the view that the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement is something that will benefit this country, then the Government must go across and without hesitation enter into the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement with India because after all India is a country that is progressing so much today in the world, which everybody in the world acknowledges, whether it be the United States of America, whether it be Japan, whether it be Russia or whether it be ASEAN countries or European countries. Even China acknowledges that. So I do not think we should miss the opportunity. Before I conclude, Reverend Sir, I want to just read a few paragraphs from an interview that Dr. Manmohan Singh, the Prime Minister of India gave the "Himal South Asian" newspaper recently, which was reproduced in the Daily Mirror newspaper of 2nd August, 2008. It states, I quote : India has always been aware that it cannot prosper and progress without its neighbouring countries also prospering, and progressing, in equal measure. That is if India is to progress, neighbouring countries must also prosper and progress in equal measure. Otherwise India cannot progress by itself. It further states, I quote : It is because of this that under Indias chairmanship of SAARC, we focused on strengthening connectivity in our region- physical, economic and of the mind..... .....As the largest country in SAARC, India will contribute to regional prosperity in a non-reciprocal asymmetric manner. " What the Prime Minister is saying is that, as the largest country in the SAARC region, India is even prepared to contribute in an asymmetric way and without any consideration of reciprocity. In other words, India is prepared to contribute to the progress of other smaller countries in the SAARC region in a much bigger way than it can benefit from those countries or through those countries. Now this is something which our people do not appreciate. After all if there is something of concern to you which you think needs to be addressed, which you think is having an adverse impact on your people, that is a

2561 2562

[ . ]

matter you can negotiate. That is a matter which can be settled through negotiations. That is not a matter which cannot be resolved. But what our people would rather prefer is that you keep India out; you keep the agreement out because that is their mindset - an attitude of total hostility towards India and really for that matter towards anything that comes from outside. They want to probably go back to the stone age and live in the stone age. They do not want to live in the modern world interacting with countries that are modern, that are progressing, that are developing because they have peace, they have stability. Some of the forces in this country do not like these developments and want to live in the past. There was another question asked from the Prime Minister of India. It states, I quote : The development of Sri Lanka-India economic links is held out as an example for other bilateral relationships in Southasia. What is so significant about this relationship? The Prime Ministers answer was, I quote: Since the entry into force of the India-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement in March 2000, our trade has grown rapidly. Sri Lanka is our largest trade partner in the SAARC region, and the total volume of our trade stands at almost USD 3.3 billion in 2007. India is the third largest destination of Sri Lankan exports while India is the fourth largest investor in Sri Lanka. We have close to 120 airline flights per week and tourist arrivals from India are the largest. It is my hope that the conclusion of the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement will further boost trade in goods and services, investment and economic cooperation. I hope we can extrapolate this win-win economic relationship throughout the region. It is an opportunity, Reverend Sir, which will give this country so many advantages. It will create more opportunity for employment. Many of our young people will find opportunities of employment. It will create opportunities for the people to develop skills and even invest in India as Damro has done quite successfully. These are opportunities, which I do not think should be missed. I do not think the Government should take too seriously these objections that have been raised by certain people who have a very very narrow mindset. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha)

Perverted mindset. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

My Friend says, Perverted mindset - perverse mindset. I think the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement between India and Sri Lanka is something that is going to be mutually beneficial and as per the statement of Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, whose honour and integrity I think is beyond question, India is prepared to be even quite liberal and not insist upon reciprocity and is prepared to make decisions on the basis of asymmetry to Sri Lankas advantage. I do not

think we should lose the opportunity. I think, we should go forward and ensure that this country is not deprived of that glorious opportunity. I thank you, Reverend Sir. . . ( ) ( () .. - , ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of Export Development and International Trade) Venerable Sir, I am glad to have this opportunity of responding to some of the issues that have been raised by speakers on the Opposition side with regard to a matter which is of undoubted importance to the economy of our country. The first point that I would like to make is that if we want to get at the truth, if we want to make an objective and dispassionate assessment, we have to consider matters rationally and not emotionally. One conspicuous characteristic of the debate which has occurred on this matter during the last couple of weeks is that every issue has been clouded and tarnished by emotion. There has been no clear thinking. We have used highly emotive imagery in order to whip up prejudices. That is the enemy of reason. I would like to give you some examples. I read in the media that some people have characterized this proposed agreement as a marriage between an ogre and a damsel, that is a marriage between a devil and a helpless young girl. It was also said in that media briefing that if this is signed, it is irrevocable. No power on earth can make any change at any time in the future; it is carved in stone. That is an absolute falsehood. This agreement is not carved in stone; no agreement is carved in stone. Indeed in this particular case, this specific intention is the opposite and this was articulated publicly at a seminar in which both the Commerce Secretary of India and I took part, we categorically said that every six months this will come up for review. Nobody can formulate a perfect agreement; any agreement will have infirmities and deficiencies. So, with empirical experience, as we go along we have to identify what the weaknesses are and take measures to address those weaknesses. That was provided for. So what was said to the public was simply untrue and it was intended to give the public a wrong picture and on the basis of a totally distorted and erroneous foundation to whip up irrational feelings. Then, Venerable Presiding Member, let us take another example. It was said that doctors, lawyers, accountants, architects, engineers and quantity surveyors are going to be out of jobs because droves of Indians, thousands of

2008 05 2563 2564

them are going to descend on this Island and grab the work that is being done by these professionals. Nothing could be further from the truth, Venerable Presiding Member. It is an absolute falsehood. This proposed agreement does not apply in any manner whatsoever to doctors, lawyers, accountants, architects, engineers or quantity surveyors. But, they all have got excited; people have got them excited on the basis of untrue, false information. It was also said that this was suddenly sprung on the public - it was a bolt from the blue; there has been no discussion; no consultation. I have here 62 pages containing minutes of meetings which have been held since August, 2004. There are names of people who participated from Government departments, Ministries, professional organizations and from business organizations. It occupies 62 pages. I cannot see how broader a consultation can take place. The charge that there has been no consultation is, therefore, absolutely untrue. It was said that with the glaring experience of the Free Trade Agreement between India and Sri Lanka staring us in the face, it was exceedingly foolish and irresponsible to enter into an agreement of this nature. Here again, I come back to my fundamental point that if we are interested really in serving this country, in doing what is best for the people of this country, we have to speak the truth; we have to ascertain the truth; we have to be rational and not emotional. There has to be a cerebral approach to matters which impinge crucially upon the heart of Sri Lankas economy. Personal insults have nothing to do with it. Then, if we look at the Free Trade Agreement, what was the history of it? The present Foreign Secretary of India, His Excellency Shiv Shankar Menon, who was at that time Indias High Commissioner in Sri Lanka was negotiating this agreement with the Sri Lankan Government. At that time, I was Deputy Minister of Finance in the administration of President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. So, I knew what happened at that time. There was a great deal of fear, apprehension. That is natural; that is part of human nature. It is the fear of the unknown. I would say, at that time, that since India has a population that is 50 times larger than ours and an economy that is 30 times larger than ours, there was naturally this legitimate apprehension that we would be swamped by India. But what is the empirical experience of the actual functioning of the Free Trade Agreement for the last ten years? It was entered into in the year 1998, but it came into operation only in the year 2000. Now it is not a question of taking anybodys word; it is a question of examining facts dispassionately, carefully and unemotionally. What are the facts? These are the facts. When the Free Trade Agreement with India was entered

into ten years ago, India was the 16th largest export destination of Sri Lanka. That is, there were 15 other countries that were taking in more exports from Sri Lanka. Today, India is the third largest exporter of goods that are manufacturing in Sri Lanka. Look at the magnitude of the change which has taken place. Is that bad for Sri Lanka or is it good for Sri Lanka? Then, consider, Venerable Presiding Member, the import-export ratio. These are objective criteria. These have nothing to do with peoples prejudices or hatreds or pet aversions. These are facts which can be established objectively. The import-export ratio is one such criteria. In 1998, the import-export ratio between Sri Lanka and India was 11:1. We were importing 11; we were exporting one. Today what is the ratio? It is 3:1. We are importing three from India and we are exporting one from Sri Lanka. So, the chasm, the gulf has narrowed down very considerably. These are facts, Venerable Presiding Member. This is not mere assertion on my part. Of course, any agreement will do some harm to somebody. There has been no agreement in the world, not from the dawn of history, which has been unreservedly good for everybody. But, how does a nation, how does a sovereign Parliament assess the utility and the pragmatic value of an international agreement? Obviously, it has to be done on balance. If you take it on balance, what is greater - the pluses or the minuses? It was asked whether we are in the Lok Sabha or in the Parliament of Sri Lanka. It does not matter, the facts are the same. One deals with facts; one speaks the truth and one does not dress up the truth to suit a particular constituency or a particular political objective. If you take this on balance - has the Free Trade Agreement been good or bad for us? - I do not think that on an objective appraisal of the Agreement, anybody can rationally conclude that it has been detrimental to the interests of this country. I also need to say this. It does not matter insulting people here. One does not come into politics if one minds that. But what is unfair would be attacks on officials. That is wrong. Officials are not here to defend themselves and that is contrary to the best traditions of parliamentary debate. There was no hurry on the part of officials; no official was pressurized. It is also very unfair and very untrue to say that the Government of India put pressure on Sri Lanka to conclude this agreement. I tell you frankly, Venerable Presiding Member, that India does not care one jot or tittle whether this is signed or not. The value of imports into India in the near future will be US Dollars 250,000 million. Their population is one billion. India has a middle class of 300 million. Everybody in the world is competing to have access to that middle class and to provide them with goods and services. The European Union is bending over backwards to conclude an agreement with New Delhi, as is the United States of America. It does not matter to them whether we sign this

2565 2566

[ . . ]

agreement or not. India is not going to spend sleepless nights. There was certainly no pressure exerted on me or any other representative of the Government of Sri Lanka to conclude this agreement. On the contrary, one needs to speak the truth even if it is unpopular and it does not matter that one is in the Lok Sabha or here. The truth is this. The Indian Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, said very clearly in Colombo and I quote him, I want Sri Lanka to move at a pace at which Sri Lanka is comfortable. I do not want to hustle this country; I do not want to exert any pressure of any kind. So, he wanted us to decide for ourselves what is best for this country and to act accordingly. The other point that is worth making is that India, from the beginning, conceded quite unequivocally - that there cannot be uniformity, symmetry or reciprocity in this situation because physically the two countries are so unequal - unequal in size and unequal in economic strength. Therefore, the Free Trade Agreement was also structured very much on that premise. There were large disparities. It was asymmetrical; it was certainly not symmetrical. These are the facts. India agreed to remove 114 items from the negative list whilst Sri Lanka offered to remove only 32 items from its negative list; 114 on one side and 32 on the other side. India offered commitments in 58 subsectors, whilst Sri Lanka offered only in 28 subsectors. What can be more unequal than that? That is exactly what they wanted. We did not have to fight for it. They conceded that from the very beginning. Also, the duty-free access granted to Sri Lanka under the Free Trade Agreement constitutes the largest tariff concessions extended to any developing country by India. Except for around 429 sensitive tariff lines, all remaining tariff lines spanning over 4,000 tariff lines were accorded duty-free access from Sri Lanka into India. This is in comparison to our negative list, which encompasses around 1,200 tariff lines. We have blocked 1,200; they have blocked only 429. I would like to indicate very briefly, since time is limited, what were the advantages that we were seeking to obtain. Here, I want to say that nobody wants to thrust this down anybody elses throat. If it is not wanted, so be it. But, there was the honest conviction that this agreement was going to serve the public of this country. I want to tell you, Venerable Presiding Member, that we are also not going to be quiet. We will also educate the public, not in emotional language, but we will place the facts before the public: this is what you were going to get; this is what you are now being deprived of. You make up your mind whether it is good for you or not. If you want it, we will go ahead with it. If you do not want it, certainly there is no compulsion, no duress and no coercion of any kind whatsoever.

These, very succinctly, are the advantages that were contemplated. First and foremost, we were aiming at a deepening and a broadening of market access into India. This is what everybody is earnestly wishing for. Here, we are being offered this on a platter and we are now having very considerable hesitation in responding to that offer. So, we wanted to broaden and deepen market access into India. The second advantage is the relaxation of the rules of origin. You are aware, Venerable Presiding Member, that in order to have access to the Indian market, we have to comply with the rules of origin. That is, the material that we use has to originate from this country and there has to be value addition to the threshold of 35 per cent. Sri Lanka is not an industrial country. We do not produce many of the things that we need for this purpose. Yarn, fabric, things of this kind, we do not produce. Bangladesh has no problem in complying with these criteria because they produce all of these within their country. We do not; we have a problem. The Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, as it was envisaged, was going to confer huge advantages on Sri Lanka with regard to relaxation and flexibility in respect of the rules of origin and value addition. When the Free Trade Agreement was concluded between India and Sri Lanka, we had access into the Indian market for eight million pieces of garments. Garments today are Sri Lankas largest export. It brought us US Dollars 3.2 billion last year. We were going to get access for eight million pieces into India. But, we had to comply with the rules relating to value addition and the rules of origin, which we found difficult to do. Then, we negotiated with the Government of India and they agreed in consequence of a specific request which we made to them that out of the eight million pieces, they would relax the rules of origin in respect of six million pieces - six out of eight. So, we can use fabric, yarn, raw material from other sources. That, Venerable Presiding Member, is the concept of regional cumulation. So, what we are left with are only two million pieces. With regard to even that residual two million pieces, they were prepared to move up the preference margin from 50 per cent to 75 per cent. That is a huge concession for Sri Lankas economy. It is not a death blow; it is not a marriage between a devil and a damsel. It was something that was genuinely beneficial for industry and for prosperity in this country. None of these benefits can now be enjoyed because they were to be contemporaneous with the implementation of CEPA. So, who was trying to do good? Who was trying to do bad? Let us consider this, cutting through all the rhetoric, the abuse and the emotion. One of the other advantages of the proposed CEPA is related to the removal of non-tariff measures. These are very common in trade agreements among countries. It is by no means unique to this particular experience. Non-tariff measures relating to the selection of ports of entry, rules relating to customs, clearance of goods, Certificates of Conformity- these constitute a whole array of non-tariff

2008 05

measures. The proposed CEPA contained a variety of provisions which conferred very considerable advantages on us because these non-tariff measures, these non-tariff barriers were going to be dismantled by India in the interest of Sri Lanka. That was an integral feature of the proposed CEPA. Then, huge fears were whipped up in this country about hundreds of thousands of people coming here. This is completely false, Sir. Absolutely and unreservedly false. CEPA had nothing to do with people coming in. In the parlance of this kind of treaty there are several modes; Mode 1, Mode 2, Mode 3 and Mode 4. Mode 1 is electronic communication; fax, e-mail, things of that kind. Mode 2 is consumption where our people go to India to be educated or for medical treatment; that is called consumption in a foreign country. Mode 3 is a commercial presence; an Indian company opening a branch here and doing business in this country. It is only Mode 4 that relates to the movement of natural persons across national frontiers. The proposed Agreement has nothing to do with movement of people except in two areas. I will explain what those two areas are. That is, Sir, one area is with regard to computer related industries. There, if a company invests US Dollars 100,000 and sets up a business here, they can bring in 10 per cent of people from India, of course those have to be very highly qualified. They must have CCIE or MCAP qualifications. Now, they come here, they open an office, 90 per cent of their employees are Sri Lankans. So, Sri Lankans are also getting employment, only 10 per cent are Indians with very high qualifications. Then, I came across material in a newspaper which is, again, absolutely false, something about ship managers coming from India to grab jobs from Sri Lankans - untrue, totally untrue. Nothing of that sort is contained in this proposed Agreement at all. What was contemplated has reference to maintenance and repairs of seagoing vessels. Now, Sir, how many of these critics are aware that 70 per cent of the work that is being done in Colombo in this field of ship building and repairs which is bringing in foreign exchange and which is providing employment for thousands of people in this country, is coming from India. The Indian Navy has placed orders. So, it is India that is providing that work. Now, the problem has arisen that there is a genuine shortage of skilled workers in particular areas like naval architects, welders, ship repair managers -not managers of shipping companies - repair engineers, automation engineers and so on. So, if they are coming here, if they are placing orders, if they are providing employment for our people, if they are bringing in foreign exchange, then where there are scarcities of personnel for particular types of specialized work then, subject to restrictions people will be allowed to come. What is wrong with that? Who benefits? Our people are benefiting. Cut it all out, throw it into the wastepaper basket by all means. Do it. Who

will suffer? Will India suffer? They will place their orders elsewhere. Can they not place their orders in Dubai or Singapore? One has to be rational about this. So, the people who claim to be ignited by patriotism and who are prepared to condemn everybody else as traitors should understand who are the traitors and who are the people who really love their country and who are trying to do a job of work in the interest of the country in the midst of a tidal wave of abuse and vituperation. Then, Sir, look again at the facts of the matter. We shut everybody out. Who suffers? People who are looking for employment in this country; the Sri Lankan exchequer which is looking for foreign exchange to support programmes like education, health, taking IT into the rural schools, poverty alleviation. You are cutting off all that. What is more, you are harming the local consumer because there is no competition. Why is Dialog bringing down their prices? Because there is competition from Mobitel, Airtel, from all the other companies. So, throw them all out. Then you have a monopoly, does the consumer benefit from a monopoly? Who, then, is talking sense and who is talking nonsense? We are very proud of the fact, Sir, that as a result of these developments, investment is not today a one-way street. Companies like MAS Holdings and Brandix are investing massively into India and Minister Shri Kamal Nath, my counterpart in the Government of India and his Deputy Minister Shri Jairam Ramesh have publicly acknowledged the value to the Indian economy of Sri Lankan investments. At one point when my Colleague, the Hon.(Dr.) Sarath Amunugama was referring to Damro, the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa asked him to give some other examples. There are plenty of examples, Sir, of Sri Lankan companies who have gone there and done well. Let us not suffer from an inferiority complex. We cannot be frogs in a well. We live in a global economy and it is a fact of life, whether we like it or not. Whatever obsolete anachronistic ideology we may subscribe to, the inescapable truth today is that a small country in proximity to a large country benefits from an economic spillover from the large country. It is true of the relationship between the United States and Canada on one hand and Mexico, on the other. It is true of the relationship between Australia and New Zealand. Look at the Sri Lankan entrepreneurs who have made good in India using their own talent, their capability and their inherent potential. We are proud of that. Now, these are among the companies that have performed exceedingly well in the subcontinent of India: Damro exports Pvt Ltd, Merbok MDF Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, CEAT- Kelani International Tyres (Pvt) Ltd, ACL-Kelani Magnet Wire (Pvt) Ltd, Dankotuwa Porcelain Ltd., Royal Ceramics Lanka Limited, Dip Products Lanka

2567 2568

Limited, MAS Holdings, Brandix. The list is long. I do not want to offend anybody whom I have not named but all these companies have done this country proud competing on their merits, not using a closed economy, not using a monopoly situation but facing open competition and achieving results which we, in this country, can legitimately be proud of. Just with a couple of other points, Venerable Sir, I will conclude on this note. This country, if it is to prosper cannot go backwards into the Stone Age. It must move forward. It must face the future with fortitude and confidence. We have every right to do so. Not just as a politician but as a university professor, a dean, a vice-chancellor who has provided education for two generations of Sri Lankan students within the university system of this country, I know the creative ability of our people. We must give full flowering and abundant scope for expression of those talents. That is what we are trying to do. Sri Lanka today is relying on a whole range of bilateral and multilateral initiatives. As for bilateral initiatives, since 2000, we have had the Free Trade Agreement with India. Since 2005, we have had the Free Trade Agreement with Pakistan. Side by side with those bilateral initiatives we have multilateral initiatives Venerable, Sir. There is SAFTA, the South Asia Free Trade Agreement. There is BIMST-EC of which we are a member. Then, perhaps, most exciting of all, there is the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement - APTA, the unique feature of which is that both India and China, the emerging giants are members. Sri Lanka is also a member, so are Bangladesh, Korea and Laos. The collective prosperity of these regions has a direct impact on Sri Lanka. We need those economies. We are a small country of nineteen and a half a million people. India has 100,000 million people. It is almost a continent. We need access for our goods into those markets. We need connectivity. The Hon. Sampanthan mentioned today that there are 100 flights between Sri Lanka and Indian capitals. That is correct. Today, the largest number of tourists are not

coming from Germany or the United Kingdom or Italy or France. They are coming from India. So, that spillover is going to make a difference. It is going to provide employment for our people. It is going to enable us to uplift economic conditions. When we achieved Independence from the British in 1948 we were way ahead of everybody else in terms of per capita income. What has happened today? Singapore is at about US Dollars 33,000 and we are at US Dollars 1,630. The solution, therefore, Sir, is not to close our doors because we are afraid of the world. That is diffidence; that is insecurity. It is an attitude that is unworthy of the Sri Lankan people. We are gifted; we are talented. Our professionals, whether it be doctors, engineers or legal academics, perform well all over the world. I know students of mine today occupy chairs in Canada, in Australia, in New Zealand, all over the world. We have no reason to be diffident. Let us open our doors. Let us let in the fresh air. There is no need to bolt our doors because we are afraid, diffident and insecure. However, that is for the people to decide. I accept that premise unreservedly. There is no need for us and there is no intention on our part to force anything on anybody. So, let there be a proper debate, not abuse, not name calling, not rudeness, not at all, let us engage in a proper debate. Let us put the issues fairly and squarely before the Chambers of Commerce and before the entrepreneurs and the public of this country and let them decide in their wisdom whether what is proposed to be done is to their detriment or in their interest. Thank you very much, Sir. , . . Question put, and agreed to.
