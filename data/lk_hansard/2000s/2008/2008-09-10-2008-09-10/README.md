Members who raised this matter of the Petroleum Resources Agreement thereby giving me the opportunity to clear out all fears, doubts and misinformation regarding this Agreement, which we have signed with Cairn Lanka (Pvt.) Limited for offshore oil exploration. Information regarding action taken on oil exploration had been made available to this House at various stages of the process and debated over a number of times. The Parliamentary Consultative Committee has been kept informed of this and the copies of the very Agreement have been circulated among the Hon. Members of this House. Had the Hon. Members actually studied that with an unbiased mind, they would have got a clear picture and would entertain no doubt, fear or suspicion. Yet, I listened to the speech made by the Hon. Bimal Ratnayake wanting to see whether there is any

2008 10 419 420

substance in the criticism levelled against the PRA. To my dismay, I find absolutely no substantive charges except that which fans anti-Indian sentiments and creates imaginary fears emanating from the India phobia. At the outset, I wish to clearly and categorically state that the Cairn India (Pvt.) Limited is a company based in the UK and 70 per cent of its shares are held by its parent company while only 30 per cent of the shares are held by Indian financial institutions. The actual Indian Government bid made by ONGC had not been successful. It is therefore futile to argue that India was favoured for whatever reasons. What if it even happened to be an Indian based company like the LIOC, which is already here? If we invite foreign investors with their technology, the only criteria of our selection would be based on how big our benefit package is going to be. I, therefore, wish to appeal to those political leaders who see India through coloured glasses to, at least from now on, desist from casting aspersions against India as it will be very much counterproductive to our country. Remember that India is our immediate neighbour and we have much to gain and learn from them. Coming back to the very subject of the PRA, I hope that the Hon. Members would not dispute the fact that there was a pressing need to launch this programme as the world fuel crisis has been entering into a critical stage. As you are aware, the global economic recession coupled with skyrocketing oil prices has already been causing adverse impact on the economies across the world as much as it is causing additional strain on the already burdened people of our country. We thank His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa who, with his foresight and wisdom, for the first time created a Ministry of Petroleum and Petroleum Resources Development with a view to launch oil exploration that Sri Lanka has been talking about for several decades. I am proud and thankful to the President for entrusting me with this important responsibility under the Mahinda Chintana to carry forward the country to economic prosperity. We were encouraged by seismic studies carried out over a period of time by an internationally reputed firm which has confirmed the potential for commercially viable accumulation of hydrocarbon in the offshore of the Mannar Basin. Our Government has already developed a comprehensive oil and gas regulatory system and established an effective organizational structure for the administration of oil and gas activities. Venerable Presiding Member, let me elaborate on the various steps taken by the Ministry until the signing of the Petroleum Resources Agreement with Cairn Lanka (Pvt.) Limited which, I hope will ignite the engine of development of the new era in our country. Through the Petroleum Resources Development Secretariat, we called for worldwide tenders for three exploration blocks in the

Mannar Basin. Before calling for tenders, adequate publicity was given through a well organized marketing strategy. This involved 5,000 e-mails, 200 faxes to exploration companies and three roadshows in London, Houston and Kuala Lumpur, each with a digital data room and a comprehensive website containing overviews, dates, venues, bid documents and background information together with a special data package containing historical exploration data. The closing of tenders took place on 31st January, 2008 at 12.00 oclock in the afternoon in the presence of the Bid Opening Committee appointed by my Ministry. Three international companies had responded and altogether there were six offers. The Hon. Bimal Ratnayake mentioned that 200 companies showed interest, but they did not bid. It maybe due to the political atmosphere. companies . . Block No. 1 received three bids from Cairn India (Pvt.) Limited, Niko Resources and ONGC, which is the Indian Government organization. Block No. 2 received two bids from Cairn India (Pvt.) Limited and Niko Resources and Block No. 3 received only one bid from Niko Resources. As only Block No. 1 received a sufficient number of bids, the Cabinet of Ministers decided to evaluate bids for Block No. 1 only. In the interest of the country, only Block No. 1 was evaluated. The balance two were knocked out and cancelled because their offers were not reasonable.

In order to evaluate the tenders and to make recommendations to the Government, a Technical Evaluation Committee and a Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee were appointed with the approval of the Cabinet. The TEC comprised men of eminence who have expertise in the relevant fields. The Ex-Chairman of the National Science Foundation, Prof. Ananda Gunathilaka was appointed as the Chairman of the TEC on a proposal made by Cabinet Ministers.

I wish to thank the Ministers, the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana and the Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka for the assistance given in this connection. The other members of the Committee were Prof. D. A. Thanthrigoda, Professor of Geophysics, Faculty of Applied Science, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Mr. M. A. R. Kularatne, Chairman, Marine Pollution Prevention Authority, Mr. K. D. Ranasinghe, Deputy Director, Economic Research Department of the Central Bank, Mr. Vijitha Pandithasekera, Department of Mining and Mineral, University of Moratuwa and Mr. D. Abeysuriya, Additional Director-General, Department of Public Finance, Ministry of Finance and Planning.

The CNAC was appointed in terms of Section 9 (2) of the Petroleum Resources Act, No. 26 of 2003 and it comprised of the Secretary to the Ministry of Petroleum and Petroleum Resources Development as the Chairman, Mr. D. Widhanagamachchi, Director-General,

The TEC was appointed as per the directive of the Cabinet of Ministers to assist the CANC in view of the highly technical nature of the subject. As part of the evaluation process, the TEC and the CANC did a thorough study of the model PRA from which the signed PRA was derived. The TEC assisted the CANC to evaluate the bids submitted for Block No. 1 and the CANC made recommendation to the Cabinet that the best proposal was submitted by Cairn India (Pvt.) Limited with the suggestion that the Petroleum Resource Agreement with Cairn India (Pvt.) Limited should be signed with the concurrence of the Attorney-Generals Department. ; . . . . . , " . . ." . . , . . . . . . seismic study . , , ; . The Attorney-General advised that the selected party, namely Cairn India (Pvt.) Limited, should incorporate a subsidiary company and the subsidiary company should enter into a PRA with the Government. Accordingly, a

company named Cairn Lanka (Pvt.) Limited was incorporated in Sri Lanka and this company entered into a PRA with the Government on 7th July, 2008. Thus, you will see that throughout the process, a maximum degree of professionalism and transparency had been adopted. Before signing the Agreement, care has been taken to analyze the PRA well and design it to ensure that the country gets the best deal through the awarded tender while, at the same time, it is attractive to prospective oil and gas exploration companies. If we are unable to attract oil and gas companies for reasons like high competition from countries that have already made discoveries and offer more lenient fiscal terms than ours, there would be no oil revenue for us to talk about. Attracting oil exploration companies to countries like Sri Lanka, where the acreage is in deep water and since there have been no premium discoveries, will be a difficult task because there is much acreage available in other oil producing countries. India just concluded the NELP VI Licensing round and 15 of their blocks did not get any bids. In awarding the tender to Cairn India (Pvt.) Limited, we had to take into consideration the company profile too. Cairn India (Pvt.) Limited has been in South Asia for more than a decade and has developed a good knowledge and understanding of the geology of the region. The company has made over 40 oil and gas discoveries in India, including the famous and world-class Mangala onshore oil discovery in the deserts of Rajastan in North West India. Cairn India (Pvt.) Limited, listed in the Bombay Stock Exchange, is now an autonomous company with a market capitalization of over US Dollars 11 billion. It is among the top 25 companies in India and Cairn Energy PLC of Scotland is a major shareholder of the company. It operates two processing plants, 11 offshore platforms and 200 kilometres of sub-sea pipelines. It has exploration interests in 14 blocks across India with a net operated production of approximately 75,000 barrels of oil and gas. We are lucky to have entered into this Agreement from which we stand to gain many benefits. I am happy to state some of the major benefits. We have already received one million US Dollars as signature bonus at the time of signing the Agreement. US Dollars 50 million as production bonus is to be paid at the time of commencement of commercial production. There will be a 10 per cent royalty on every barrel of oil and every cubic metre of gas produced. Tax will be on contractors profit according to the income tax law of our country. There will be a 15 per cent participation by the National Oil Company. We will have a National Oil Company and that will have 15 per cent participation. Also there will be a profit share to the Government that increases with time. Then, the next is the use of Sri Lankan goods and services. The country would benefit very much from their spending schedule which is

2008 10 423 424

expected to be around US Dollars 112 million. There will be employment opportunities and education and training in Petroleum Science for Sri Lankans. Technology transfer to Sri Lanka and funds to conduct environmental research are also expected. The company is bound to commence work in the next six months that follows the signing of the PRA. After all, it is a risky investment the company is making. It is akin to gambling. Nobody can say whether you will find a commercial quantum of hydrocarbon deposit. In India, bids were called for 152 blocks and there were discoveries only in 15 blocks, indicating a failure rate of 90 per cent. So, the larger the area of exploration, the better the chances of finding oil. Therefore, please do understand the amount of benefit we stand to gain by any chance of commercial discovery of oil in our first attempt itself. Be optimistic and join the whole country in one prayer and wish the best for the country.

I am proud that I have been privileged to activate the much talked about and much delayed oil exploration in Sri Lanka as part of the "Mahinda Chintana" to carry forward the country to economic prosperity. I am thankful to President Mahinda Rajapaksa for all the encouragement given to go ahead to achieve our determined goal. Thank you. , . . Question put, and agreed to.
