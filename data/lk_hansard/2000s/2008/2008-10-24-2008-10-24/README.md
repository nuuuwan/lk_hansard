Recommendations: Your Committee is of the view that Parliament being the supreme democratic institution of the State must exploit the advances of the information and communication technology to perform its functions more efficiently and effectively. Your Committee is also of the view that modern parliaments make use of these tools successfully, to facilitate Members of Parliament in their day to day functions, to facilitate the participation of the people in democratic processes and to make the parliamentary administration more efficient and effective. Accordingly, Your Committee strongly recommends that information and communication technology be introduced in Parliament at the earliest. Your Committee is of the view that ICTA set up under the Information and Communication Act of Sri Lanka is the rightful authority which is empowered by law to provide expertise, guidance and supervision to Government institutions in implementing information and communication strategies in their respective institutions. Accordingly, the Parliament has invited ICTA to be its consultant in this process and the ICTA has not only provided the above services but also has provided the funding to evolve an IT strategy for Parliament through an IT consultancy firm. The ICTA has also participated at all crucial decision making processes providing the necessary expertise to Parliament. Your Committee recommends that the partnership between the Parliament and ICTA be continued in the future as well. Your Committee having gone through the Report of the Auditor General, reports of the experts and other documentation did recommend that the balance portion of the information and communication infrastructure project be completed without any further delay. This decision was arrived at since the Financial Expert in his testimony before Your Committee was of the view that any reconsideration of the project scope at this juncture would cause a considerable loss to Parliament and the Panel of Experts have made a strong recommendation for the continuance of the project. In consideration of the recommendation of the Financial Expert, Your Committee has obtained a cost benefit analysis from Parliament which will be circulated among all the Members of Parliament for their comments and on receipt of same, the Committee will recommend, if necessary, any modifications or changes to be effected to the IT strategy of Parliament. The Committee recommends that a steering committee be properly constituted by Parliament with authority to carry forward the implementation of the ICT strategy in Parliament. This is also a recommendation of the Auditor General. Your Committee has gone through all aspects of criticisms that were levelled against this project, particularly in the media, in the aftermath of the audit by the Auditor General. The committee wishes to put on record that its thorough examination based on the Auditor Generals Report, did not reveal any evidence whatsoever to suggest that there had been any

financial or other irregularity on the part of any member of the Parliament staff of that of any other institution. Your committee also wishes to state that the project had been carried out by Parliament with the expertise and guidance of the ICTA and UNDP adhering to a high level of transparency. As recommended by the Auditor General, the Committee is also of the view that the budget for all projects be revisited again since the cost revision was effected in the year 2005 and the technology and related cost would have undergone changes over the period of time.

has taken special decisions to pay compensation. But, in the Anuradhapura bomb blast where Major General Janaka Perera, Provincial councilors and others were killed, their families have become destitute. What about Dr. John Pulle? Prior to that, his house was burnt down. There is a case pending. His entire family has become virtually destitute. The Cabinet can take a decision to pay a huge compensation at least in special cases like this.

Hon. Speaker, we have been following procedures. At 10.30 a.m. you stopped the question time and we went along with it. A Party Leader had given notice of our statement. I am surprised when the Minister says that he has not received notice of our statement in which case he must sort it out either with the office of the Leader of the House or the office of the Secretary-General.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) We are disgraced with what is happening here. If a Party Leader has given a statement, then he is entitled to get a reply or the Minister in charge of the subject must

ask more time. He should not get abused. You can not abuse people when they are following the Standing Orders. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) ; . [ ]

Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , ? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Sir, I am raising this matter under Standing Order No. 84 (iii) as well as Article 43(1) of the Constitution. The Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs two days ago in this House answered a Question relating to what has arisen in India over the situation in Sri Lanka and he gave an extremely good answer at that particular moment. But, today it has been highlighted that he has misled Parliament on two issues. At that time, when I very specifically asked whether the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs will be leaving for India, he said, "No". Then, I asked whether there will be a special foreign minister leaving for India and he said, "No" to that also. But we see a headline in today's Lankadeepa newspaper which states, I quote: " ." So, he has misled this House. We asked about some very specific information. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , ? [ ] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I would also like to say that in todays The Island newspaper - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , .

( ) (Mr. Speaker) ?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

I am raising this under Standing Order No. 84(iii), which comes under Rules for Members Speaking in Parliament. You can choose whatever you want from subsections (i) to (xii). The Rules for Members Speaking in Parliament are read in line with Article 43(1) and (2) of the Constitution. The collective responsibility of the Cabinet was discharged through a Minister and the Minister so happens to be the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He responded to a Question we asked in Parliament. Also, I quote a headline from todays The Island newspaper. It states: Sri Lanka does not have an ethnic conflict, only a terrorist problem - Bogollagama So, is that why the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs is not being sent and a special foreign minister is going there? - [Interruption.] We do not want Parliament to be treated as a joke, Hon. Speaker. ( ) (The Hon.
