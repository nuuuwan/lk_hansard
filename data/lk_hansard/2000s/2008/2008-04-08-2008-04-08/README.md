The other thing is, I would like to cite Standing Order - [Interruption.] Hon. Speaker, we have been deliberating on many matters this morning. We came to your Chamber and spoke to you but there seems to be a complete disregard to what we are speaking. So, on that score it is necessary that democracy prevails not outside the Parliament but inside the Parliament first of all. Now, when we take the Standing Orders which you are supposed to be upholding, Hon. Speaker, Standing Order No. 18(1) states about the Strangers present in the Chamber. So, we would like to ensure, first of all, that we comply with that particular Standing Order. So, Hon. Speaker - ( ) (Mr. Speaker) ? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) -

[.. 1.39] ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe)

Hon. Speaker, I must say that Mrs. Wijesekera from first getting her reputation as a member of the netball team of the university achieved being the sixth Secretary-General of this Parliament and she has really proved herself. When Mrs. Wijesekera was first appointed as the Secretary-General, a lot of people wondered whether a female could handle these duties because after all, out of the 225 Members, at least 215 or more are males and as you can see they are the most boisterous kind that you can find. Even the females themselves certainly could not have been in any way called the ones who restricted themselves just to saying a few words. So, how could a female handle this? But, Mrs. Wijesekera - [ .] [ ] [At this stage, Hon. Members in the Well of the House continued with their uproar] ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe)

Mrs. Wijesekera proved herself when she conducted the Election of the Speaker. I think that was a very crucial moment of this House. When we were keenly divided, many points were coming out as to the method of voting, how it should be exercised and it could have really gone into disarray. But Mrs. Wijesekera proved herself that she could handle the situation and fortunately we had an election and had you, Mr. Speaker, then elected to the Chair. So, that was one of the most difficult situations that was handled and without the experience that Mrs. Wijesekera had, it could not have been completed successfully. I must say, that from the time she entered this House, when she worked under both Mr. Nihal Seneviratne and then Mr. Bertram Tittawella, she had studied every issue. She had come in from the Ministry of Justice and from the Law Reform Commission earlier. There were times when she used to argue with me on different points. There were many instances where we did not agree but we learnt to respect each other's views. She would bring

2997 2998

up one point and I would come up with another argument. But that is the way in which she earned the respect of the Members of this House and of the staff. She was also very firm. She took her decision and said, As the Secretary-General I have to take this decision. I used to speak to her on some of the issues. People learnt to respect her. At least even if we did not agree with the decision, we knew there was no malice in it, that it was taken bona fide. She was the Secretary- General when in the last Parliament I was the Prime Minister. We decided to go back to the old convention of having the Chairman of COPE and the Chairman of PERC appointed by the Public Enterprises Committee and the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee from the Opposition. We also discussed about the oversight committees. But, unfortunately we have not adhered to that rule here in this Parliament nor have we taken up the issue of the oversight committees. But, Mrs. Wijesekera was one person who knows this well. She also helped to organize the SAARC Parliamentary Association Meeting in Colombo. So, she was a person who was behind the scenes, who really did not come forward to the limelight but she did her work. In this way, she has earned the respect of this House. The post of the Secretary-General of Parliament is an important one. It originates from the post of Clerk to the House. The whole battle between the king and the House of Commons was as to who controls Parliament. And, that was settled decisively when Speaker Lenthall said, I am here, Your Majesty, to speak what the House commands me, to hear what the House commands me and to see what the House commands me. It was also essential that if the Speaker was to carry out that duty, there had to be a Clerk to the House who was also of the same mind because the Speaker had to listen to the views of all Members of the House and then make his ruling impartially. This way, first the name of the Clerk to the House though appointed by the Queen, was cleared by the Speaker who put it to the Leader of the Opposition and to the Leader of the House. The Leader of the Opposition would discuss it with the other parties in the Opposition. This is the convention that was established. This is the convention which we have followed. When the Chief Opposition Whip raised a point of Order in the morning, he pointed this out. He said, . In Sri Lanka, we went beyond that when we brought in the Constitutional Council, and to have the Speaker, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. This was to carry on the high standard of office which was first held by Mr. Ralph Deraniyagala and then by the others. So, there is this high office and it requires the consent of Parliament. I just read some of the articles in the newspapers on the appointment of the Secretary-General and the Clerk to the House and I also was listening to what the Prime Minister said.

What the Prime Minister referred to was Article 41B and not 41C of the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution. I also checked it up. There is a Supreme Court case dealing with Article 41B, but the appointment here permanently or temporarily lies with Article 41C. Article 41C of the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution read with Article 65 (6) of the Constitution, states that the President can make an appointment when the holder of the office cannot discharge his functions. It does not talk of a complete vacancy. It is very clear in Article 41C (3). In the Sinhala version, it is very, very clear. The position which is confirmed in the Constitution is that the Secretary-General of Parliament has to be appointed by the President with the consent of the Constitutional Council and any acting appointment must be made when there is a vacancy. Now there has been no Supreme Court ruling on this. I also checked up for the simple reason that the Supreme Court adhered to the ruling of the late Hon. Anura Bandaranaike where this matter has to be determined by the House. Now we have not gone into what Article 65(6) or Article 41C (1) says, especially the Sinhala version, the official one. We have to look at those. Now this has not been taken up in this House. If we are to maintain the high traditions of the House, then we have to discuss it among the Party Leaders, either in open House or before you, before a final ruling is made. Now, this is what we have not adhered to and this is an issue which has come up now, because this high office of Clerk to the House cannot in any way be brought into disrepute. The person who holds this office must be able to say, "I was appointed with the consent of the House". If he is not appointed with the consent of the House, he cannot carry on with the Business of the House. So, the issue that has come up here is that Article 41C and Article 65(6) have not been gone into. Mrs. Wijesekera has written some articles about Parliament in journals and she has also written a book. I looked into the book also to see whether there is anything to that effect but that also does not refer to anything. It is an open issue which has to be decided by the House. The President can make an appointment, but in regard to those appointments other than the Secretary-General of Parliament, all others can be challenged in Courts. The appointment of the Secretary-General of Parliament or anything connected to Parliament can only be challenged in this House. The issue that has now come up is whether the Secretary-General is going to be appointed permanently or temporarily. It is not a matter concerning an individual. It is a matter of procedure. More than that, the matter is a right of this House. None of us were informed of this appointment; none of us knew of this except for a letter that was supposed to have been sent to the Speaker and today it is an issue that has not yet been resolved. I looked at it. There is no Supreme Court case

[ ]

2008 08 2999 3000

or any decision on Article 41C read with Article 65 (6). Then, we in the House have to determine this issue and the basic principle here is that the Clerk to the House requires the consent. A Clerk cannot function otherwise. It applies to the Secretary-General. This is an issue that we are still talking of while appreciating the service and recording our thanks for the work that Mrs. Wijesekera has done. But this is an issue that has to be resolved because she upheld that office for which we are proud of. She succeeded Mr. Kitulgoda who gave up that office when he became the Secretary to the Constitutional Council because we held that one cannot hold both the appointments. So, if one cannot be the Secretary to the Constitutional Council and be the Secretary-General on a permanent basis, then how is he qualified to take it up even on an acting basis? If he is not qualified, he is not qualified. If he is not qualified on an acting basis, he cannot be qualified on a permanent basis. The Government itself has brought in this whole issue of conflict of interest. Now the only way out is for the appointment of Mr. Mayadunne and the other Members because this House has to function. Mrs. Wijesekera has laid down rules to it, she has upheld this and whoever who is going to be the Secretary-General to this House must be appointed through the Constitutional Council. This is the major issue that we have. All the other appointments can go to Courts. They can question about the Public Service Commission. But there are issues that have to come here which we think will be debated in other Parliaments and in the Inter-Parliamentary Union. This is the point that we have taken. Can there be an appointment without the consent of the Opposition? All the Members of the Opposition have placed on record the fact that this principle must be upheld. They are not looking at the individual. There is a principle to be upheld and we have to work on it. We cannot in any way ignore it. This question will not fade away and the best present we can give Mrs. Wijesekera when she retires from office is to ensure that there is a properly appointed Secretary-General of Parliament. When she was appointed, she was given a temporary appointment, an acting appointment. It went on for some time. At least, the Party Leaders agreed that she should be appointed. On that, there was no dispute. It is the procedure. The Speaker took it up with the then President and she continued with it. Then I looked up the law and pointed it out to her, she accepted it and the permanent letter of appointment was sent. I am rather surprised if any one in the Attorney-Generals Department says that this is legal. It cannot be legal. How is the House going to discuss this issue? Firstly, there must be a free airing of this before a final decision is made. That certainly is the precedent that we have set here. Even tomorrow and the day after this can be a continuing issue. We should not have that. We should have a permanent resolution to this issue. That is why I raised it one month ago as to what we are going to do

when Mrs.Wijesekera retires; firstly your decision as to who is going to be there but before that, has to be the appointment of the Constitutional Council. We cannot run away from the Constitution because all of us have taken the oath to uphold the Constitution. We cannot do anything here which violates that and violates the Seventeenth Amendment which we have passed in this House unanimously. We cannot in any way do that. Of course, in the House of Commons there are traditions; Members get up and Members speak. That is why they do not have 630 seats. There are about 300 Members in the House of Commons who perhaps come in, make a clown of themselves and go out. I am not in any way making a comparison between the House of Commons and the Parliament of Sri Lanka. In the House of Commons that has been the practice. But one thing in the House of Commons is that they have never laid wreaths. These are things that we have to look at. People are laughing at the Parliament. They are asking, "What are the values, what are the ethics"? If you cannot hold this in a moral position, then what are you going to do? These are major issues? If we cannot follow the law in respect of ourselves, how can we follow the law in respect of others? That is the major issue we have raised in this House. I thought I will bring this to your notice but at the same time I must again commend Mrs. Wijesekera for all the work she has done and I hope her advice will be available to us in her capacity as retired Secretary-General like the others - [Interruption.] Members of the Government want me to keep speaking. Okay. I will do that. I will get back to Article 41C of the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution - [Interruption.] Okay. If you want me to speak I will speak - [Interruption.] 41. (3) : " , , ." . It is very clear that you have to decide on this issue. Until then, any Member can get up and raise the question of a "stranger" in the House. A "stranger" in the House is the main issue. That is what the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake has raised here. It can be debated continuously; it can be debated regularly. We can debate it in different ways. Even a kabaraya can come and debate it or even anyone else - [Interruption.] That is a matter that can go on day after day, from minute to minute. It is a continuous breach of privilege. So, this issue is one which has now been raised today and we have to resolve it. You cannot allow Parliament to be in chaos. You cannot have the good work done by

3001 3002

Mrs. Wijesekara falling apart because the Members of the House are not allowed to express their different views and a final decision to be taken. So, I would like to point out that just as much as I explained the background of the decision on the Constitutional Council, there has been no ruling on Article 41C of the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution and Article 65(6) of the Constitution. So, in regard to Parliament we have to do this. We cannot follow what the Supreme Court has said. We have to do this. There has been no other appointment like this, not even an acting appointment. On the earlier occassion we pointed this out and the then President corrected it. So, this issue has to be resolved so that the successor to Mrs. Wijesekera can get on with the work of Parliament. The people of this country will respect us because at least we have upheld the law and its spirit, the Constitution and the principles on which it has been based. If we do not do that we will become the laughing-stock of the country. Thank you. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)
