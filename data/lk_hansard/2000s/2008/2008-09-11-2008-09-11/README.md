: : OWNERSHIP OF KACHCHATIVU ISLAND : STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama - Minister of Foreign Affairs) , .

2008 11 477 478

. . In response to the statement made by the Hon. Anura Dissanayake on 9th September, 2008 in Parliament on the important issue of Kachchativu, I wish to place before this august Assembly, facts from the point of view of the Government of Sri Lanka, for the information of the Hon. Members of Parliament. Kachchativu is a barren Island that lies about 15 miles North-East of Rameshawaran and approximately 14 miles South-West of Delft Islands. There are no permanent inhabitants or any permanent structures on the Island other than a Roman Catholic Church, administered by the Bishop of Jaffna as part of his Diocese. What makes the island attractive is the richness of the surrounding seabed around Kachchativu with prawns, chank shells, pearls, oysters and corals. The Government of Sri Lanka had always maintained a consistent policy founded on historical facts on the issue of the ownership of Kachchativu. Sri Lanka consistently and regularly exercised jurisdiction and control over Kachchativu. In this context, Sri Lankas claim to Kachchativu was listed in 1924 in a correspondence stating that the survey officers of the Government of India treated the Island as a part of then Ceylon as far back as 1876. Moreover, Kachchativu Island has been under the jurisdiction of Sri Lanka since the time of the Portuguese and later the British rulers of Sri Lanka (then Ceylon). The issue of Kachchativu first arose in 1921 at the conference to demarcate fisheries line between India and Sri Lanka and was followed by series of bilateral discussions relating to Maritime Boundary demarcations and related matters. However the two parties were able to reach an agreement for the first time in 1974. The 1974 Agreement regarding historic waters between Sri Lanka and India in the Palk Straits and the Palk Bay formally confirms Sri Lankas sovereignty over the Island. Article 4 of the Agreement stipulates that each State shall have sovereignty and exclusive jurisdiction and control over the waters, the islands, the Continental Shelf and the subsoil on its side of the Maritime Boundary in the Palk Straits and Palk Bay and Kachchativu Island was determined as falling within Sri Lankan waters. Article 5 of the 1974 Agreement provides that "Subject to the foregoing Indian fishermen and pilgrims will enjoy access to visit Kachchativu as hitherto and will not be required by Sri Lanka to obtain travel documents or visas for these purposes." Article 6 of the Agreement states, "The vessels of India and Sri Lanka will enjoy in each other's waters such rights as they have traditionally enjoyed therein."

By this Article only navigational rights of the vessels of both Sri Lanka and India over each others water's have been preserved. The preparatory notes leading to the finalization of the rights of the two parties clearly manifest that the right of pilgrims under Article 5 were restricted to attend the annual feast of the church and the rights of access of fishermen were restricted to dry their nets and catch. Therefore, the provisions in Articles 5 and 6 taken together do not confer any fishing rights on the Indian fishermen or vessels to engage in fishing in Sri Lankan waters. As a follow up to this process, an Agreement between Sri Lanka and India on the Maritime Boundary between the two countries in the Gulf of Mannar and the Bay of Bengal and related matters was signed in 1976. This Agreement further clarifies the position established by the 1974 Agreement between Sri Lanka and India. Article 5 of 1976 Agreement stipulates that : "1. Each Party shall have sovereignty over the historic waters and the territorial sea, as well as the islands falling on its side of the aforesaid boundary 2. Each Party shall have sovereign rights and exclusive jurisdiction over the Continental Shelf and the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) as well as over their resources, whether living or non-living, falling on its side of the aforesaid boundary. 3. Each Party shall respect rights of navigation through its territorial sea and exclusive economic zone in accordance with its laws and regulations and the rules of international law." The 1974 and 1976 Agreements taken together with the Exchange of Letters that was signed between Mr. Kewal Singh, the then Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and Mr. W.T. Jayasinghe, the then Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka have put the question of fishing rights beyond doubt. Paragraph one of the Exchange of Letters very clearly rules out any fishing rights for the fishermen of the two States in the waters of the other State. It reads as follows. I quote: Fishing vessels and fishermen of India shall not engage in fishing in the historic waters, the territorial sea and the EEZ of Sri Lanka nor shall the fishing vessels and fishermen of Sri Lanka engage in fishing in the historic waters, the territorial sea and the EEZ of India, without the express permission of Sri Lanka or India, as the case may be. Therefore, you would observe that with the signing of the 1976 Agreement and the Exchange of Letters, the maritime boundary between Sri Lanka and India stands settled, and the Letters of Exchange clearly prohibits fishing vessels and fishermen of one country fishing in the other's waters.

[ ]

Subsequent to the conclusion of the Agreements, the question of fishermen inadvertently straying into each other's waters has been discussed at several bilateral meetings between the officials of the two States. On several occasions, the Sri Lankan Navy has been accused of involving in alleged attacks on Indian vessels near Kachchativu Island. The Sri Lanka Navy has categorically denied any involvement in such activities as they do not venture out of Sri Lankan territorial waters. In fact, contrary to the allegations, the Sri Lanka Navy has on a number of occasions assisted and continues to assist the Indian fishermen in distress. Meanwhile, several personalities in the Tamil Nadu State have recently raised the issue of Kachchativu, making proposals based on their own perceptions without any apparent valid legal basis, pertaining to the rights of Indian fishermen. In fact there has been a case filed by the former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Ms. Jayalalitha at the Indian Supreme Court. However, a decision given by a court of law in a jurisdiction outside Sri Lanka would not be binding on Sri Lanka. Any such court order or judgment will not alter or have an impact on a bilateral treaty concluded between two sovereign States. In conclusion, I would like to reiterate to the Hon. Members of Parliament that Kachchativu has always been the territory of the Sri Lankan State according to historical evidence and records of exercise of jurisdiction. This has been cemented by the Agreements of 1974 and 1976 and the related Exchange of Letters. , . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . , . . ( . ) (The Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera) , . " " .

The report states, I quote: " In that period the country lost more than 35 % of its old-growth forest cover, ..." 35 18 . Just imagine! Most of the worlds number one endangered tree species are in Sri Lanka. I am bringing this to the notice of the Minister of Environment and Natural Resources. The report further states, I quote: - while total forest cover was diminished by almost 18 %. Worse, since the close of 1990s, deforestation rates have increased by more than 25%. We can take Mahaweli, the rapid development programme as one of the reasons. It was a 32-year programme. Hon. Ministers, you, the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne and myself, we all participated and put in all our resources. We achieved our aim in eight years. It is the biggest development project in the history of Sri Lanka. Other than that, what development projects have you completed since 1994, I ask ? What is the rapid development that you have achieved in this country, I ask you ? Ask your officers, the Chairman of the UDA and others. Hon. Minister, not a single! The Minister of Environment and Natural Resources is here. There are no Deputy Ministers here. . What development work have you done? What have you done to 25 per cent of the forests? What has happened? Stooges! I curse in the name of the history of this country. I curse all of you. Please forget politics - petty-minded politics. Do what is right according to your conscience and save this country. . ; . 25 . . . . . . . . . . [ ] ? . . ( ( ) ) (The Hon (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) ? ( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) . . . I am reading from this report, Hon. Ministers. It further states, I quote: The nexus between the corrupt politicians bureaucrats, businessmen and policemen bring immense destruction to the forest.

. endangered species ? ; . What action are you taking? . I am going to ask you at the Consultative Committee. You submit the report, the plan. I have done more than you as a Chief Minister and as a District Minister. I am telling you since 1994 up to now, I have done a lot to Wayamba. I have done all that. I am telling you. I feel sorry for the country. That is why I say that I feel sorry to be a Member of this House. You ask your own conscience. Your officers and all of you are responsible for this. What you are doing is, you change the policies with the change of politicians, the Ministers and the governments. No, do what you have to do. Have a national policy like in India. We did it for 17 years. Have a national policy and a master plan and stick to that. Do not allow the politicians to interfere. Tell the politicians that this is our national policy. That is not what you are doing. I feel sorry, because I love this country as a citizen. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) Not only you, we also love the country. ( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) Yes, I know that you love the country. My Friend, the Hon. Minister of Mass Media and Information has come suddenly and is speaking. I do not know whether he knows what I am talking about. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) Yes, I listened to you. ( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) Very good. Then, you will have to implement this. - [Interruption.] I will continue my speech, because time is limited. Time is a factor. If I give you some minutes, I will have to get it back from the time allotted to your side. That is what I will have to do. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) Are you talking on the line of a National Government? ( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) No, Hon. Minister, I did that Kapukama once. - [Interruption.] Hon. Minister, do you want me to speak on that subject? Ask your own conscience. I will keep
