ADJOURNMENT ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) , " " . . . Question proposed. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . FUTURE OF SRILANKAN AIRLINES AND VIABILITY OF MIHIN AIR ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to move the following timely Adjournment Motion. Sir, I move, The countrys aviation industry is one of the vital industries to an island nation. Sri Lanka has two airlines, namely SriLankan Airlines which has been privatized and seventy five days more for the agreement

2008 10 327 328

to lapse and Mihin Air, a so-called budget airline. We are informed that Mihin Air has run into serious financial problems and SriLankan Airlines, which has another seventy five days for their agreement to lapse, is not sure as to what their destiny would be with the Government. JVP, Hela Urumaya, Sri Lankan Government not accepting privatization as a way forward, we like to know as to how or what the future of SriLankan Airlines and the ongoing viability of Mihin Air would be. The aviation industry is very important for this country and once again, it has become an industry that does not seem to be taken full care of by the Government at this moment. Sir, at a time when the country is in economic chaos, at a time when the economy needs to be depoliticized and at a time when we need to have our economy strengthened so that we can have other vicissitudes covered, we do not see that displayed in the field of aviation. The Hon. Minister is an amiable person with a generous disposition, but the staff that works for him does not seem to be competently guiding him to take this field towards a better tomorrow. Sir, we are now speaking on two matters: one is the aviation policy of this country and the other is the two national carriers - the SriLankan Airlines and the Mihin Air - that are being guided by that aviation policy. At present, both these airlines are in serious jeopardy. The SriLankan Airlines has seventy five days more before its agreement gets cancelled and the Mihin Air is losing almost Rs. 7 million to Rs. 8 million a day. In a country where the Government is unable even to provide a decent cost of living to the people, we have some officials who live in luxury that is not even seen in America. Sir, as you know, the logistics of our aviation industry is worth about US Dollars 250 billion. The total logistics of the aviation industry of the world is worth about US Dollars 1 trillion. Today the aviation cost has moved up from about 3 per cent to 15 per cent during the last three or four years, which is nobodys fault, but owing to the fuel cost that has been going up. That is all the more reason for us to ensure that every penny or every rupee is saved so that we would be able to maximize the benefit we get from the limited resources we have. Sir, we have got to ensure that people are able to travel to and from an island nation. If the shipping industry does not help to bring in tourists or people into the country, then, the aviation industry is the next most important industry. Is it happening? We have a tourism industry. During 2001 to 2002, we increased the number of genuine tourists to almost 500,000. Now we are unable to attract even 300,000 people into this country. Why? Due to the present security situation in this country. It is something which has got to be mentioned. If you take Dubai, they are partners of the SriLankan Airlines, in 2001, there were almost 10 million tourists criss-crossing Dubai. In the year 2006, it increased to 18.5 million tourists and the projection, the prognosis for the year 2010 is roughly 30 million tourists.

In Sri Lanka, in the month of March in 1998, very vigorously defending, we gave the Air Lanka to the Emirates Airlines, saying that our tourism industry would improve; our economy would improve and the little Air Lanka we had then would become a mega international airline. Various tall stories were told. We, at that moment, with hands-on experience, did tell the incompetent Government at that time led by Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga that it would not be the case. We did mention that it would be an absolute disaster; that it is not privatization or commercialization, but "giftation". That was the word I used. Instead of selling it, we gave it to Dubai. If we gave it as a gift, I think, at least there would have been reciprocity between Sri Lanka and Dubai. But that is the history. When we talk of Sri Lanka, we say it is an island of prosperity in an ocean of poverty. But, today we are talking of an island of poverty in an ocean of prosperity. That is what has happened to Sri Lanka. Everybody is adding more to that poverty, making this little country war-stricken, economically derelict and the people are suffering. It has made a bad case worse. The partner of the SriLankan Airlines has officially given notice, saying that they do not want to continue with the saga in Sri Lanka. We did mention this in 1998 when it was going to be commercialized. We did tell them that it is a marriage of convenience entered into only for Emirates' purposes. We were ridiculed by the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle. We were ridiculed by the Peoples Alliance Government. But we stood our ground. The United National Party and I did speak of the consequences, of what would happen. Hon. Deputy Speaker, today we can see that every single thing we mentioned has come to pass. That is why we call upon the Minister to please ensure that what is spoken is spoken for the benefit of Sri Lanka and not for any personal benefit or political animosity. Today, the ground handling and catering are bringing profit to the SriLankan Airlines. The SriLankan Airlines had a loss of almost US Dollars 300 million in the flying arena. The main core business, which is flying, has reported a loss of US Dollars 300 million over the last 10 years. Then the ground handling in the SriLankan Airlines and the SriLankan Catering Services (Pvt.) Limited, which had nothing to do with the Emirates, were just handed over to them and became a cash cow of this airline. So, with the help of other airlines coming to Sri Lanka using the hub over here, the SriLankan Airlines made a marginal profit. Just before it was commercialized, the then Chairman of the SriLankan Airlines, Mr. Harry Jayawardena ensured that they pay Rs. 3.2 billion as dividends. Since then to-date, we have got only about Rupees seven billion as total dividends. Now even if we maintained the airline as it is, I do not say it would have been any better, but it cannot be worse than this. Today, we are left with a most pathetic situation. Has the tourism industry in this country improved just because the SriLankan Airlines was given over to the Emirates? They used our fleet to carry their passengers. They made

329 330

[ ]

us to do the bullwork and the profits went to them. Now what has happened? They have terminated the contract owing to the political interference that seems to be taking place these days. You have been kicking the CEO instead of telling him, Here, you did this. Why did you not give me the tickets? The CEO was unceremoniously chased out of the country. The resultant situation was that, even before the Government decide and say, Go to hell", they gave notice and said, We do not want to extend this contract. See the ramifications, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Today, the Emirates is having 49 per cent of shares in their hands. They have the right to have three directors on the board. So, our national carrier is being strongly led by a shareholder which has no interest in this country except commercial interest. It basically, has been running a competitive course with the SriLankan Airlines. There are about 40 destinations to which the SriLankan Airlines fly and of them, there are about 12 to 13 destinations where Emirates and SriLankan Airlines have merged their operations. So, now that they have given notice of termination, how are you going to get your right back again? Within 75 days can this be done? We want to know that from the Minister. What is the action that you are proposing? At this particular moment, the IT systems that are operative on airlines are handled by Mercator which is owned by Emirates. If they suddenly pull the plug and say, Sorry, we are going to increase the charge from US Dollars three million to US Dollars 10 or 15 million", and if the new management of the SriLankan Airlines that would take over from 1st April

says, "We are not interested in doing so", then what type of a situation would the country be plunged into? In a country where they cannot even run buses, Mr. Deputy Speaker, they are trying to run airbuses. That is the irony. Leave alone the SriLankan Airlines. Take Mihin Air. Has there been any success in this particular area? The only redeeming factor is, there is a tough Chairman, Mr. Harry Jayawardena. I do not know how he is going to resurrect an airline that has been running by Emirates which suddenly gave 75 days notice, in a fashion and manner that they want, as a commercially viable airline in the Asian region. They tried to live beyond their means. That was always the situation with the Sri Lankan Government. When the SriLankan Airline was given to Emirates, we asked as to what would be our fallback plan and this Government has displayed that it just does not have a roadmap as to what to do. It just does not know how to take the industry forward. SriLankan Airlines is a classic case. Hon. Minister, unfortunately you sat in that chair not knowing that this would come to you during your tenure of office but you need to resurrect the SriLankan Airlines so that it would be able to play the pivotal role that it is expected to play. Now when tourism is expected to bring in revenue to this country, bomb explosions are preventing it and if the national Airline is not going to do the necessary justice,

what is going to happen to this country? Almost 40 per cent of tourists who flew on SriLankan Airlines were Emirates-controlled but hereafter that is not going to take place. Where are you going to bring tourists from? Is it from Iran, from Cuba or from North Korea? What are you going to do? This is going to be one of the biggest problems. You need roughly Rs. 300 billion a month to run this industry. How are you going to invest the capital that is required when you are unable even to reduce the price of milk powder? . . . . SriLankan Airlines ? So all we want to know at this particular moment is, how are you going to resurrect the SriLankan Airlines and back with a spine? The offices that have been amalgamated with the Emirates have got to be started once again. Who is going to give the start-up cost? Has the Government allocated money for the SriLankan Airlines now that they have got to take it back, Hon. Minister? Or, are they going to go again to the HSBC and say, "We want another loan" and make the people of this country further impoverished in order to satisfy their ego of telling the CEO to go to hell? Hon. Minister, that is the reason why, I think we have got to look at the countrys economy devoid of politics. We have always been mentioning that if you colourize the economy, that is the starting point of the ruination of this economy and unfortunately this has been done for 14 years under the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Government ably assisted by the JVP and the Jathika Hela Urumaya, being the curse of this country. Now what has happened has happened. Poor Minister, I know you may be having not one headache but ten headaches. But all we want to say is, let us resurrect this industry. When SriLankan Airlines has given notice in this manner how are you going to get a partner because the policy of JVP and the Jathika Hela Urumaya is, "no privatization". You have been conning and you might con again. You have said that you will give a cost of living allowance, that you will reduce the prices of goods and that you will ensure that subsidies are given. You have broken all those promises, so breaking another promise may not be difficult for you. But we want to know what is going to happen because your policy is, "no privatization". Now that SriLankan Airlines have been told by the Emirates management that they are not interested in pursuing, you have got to explore the possibilities of how you are going to run this airline. Hon. Minister, while we talk of the SriLankan Airlines, in a further pathetic situation is the Mihin Air. Mihin Air which was incorporated a year ago has brought absolute disrepute to this country and incurred huge losses.

2008 10 331 332

You are concerned about the Rs. 25,000 misuse by the Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi. He went to courts and the case was thrown out. Now again you are harassing him for this Rs.25,000 misuse of a vehicle even though it has not happened. What is the action that you are proposing to take against officials who are running amok with this airline? There is Rs. 420 million outstanding on fuel and US Dollars 1.1 million, which is Rs.110 million outstanding to SriLankan Airlines for ground handling. How are you going to ensure that this is done? Hon. Minister, I know that you are not the creator of this but, certainly you have been in the Cabinet ably assisting the creation of Mihin Air and now Mihin Air has 200 staff members. A capital of Rs. 250 million was paid up for authorized capital of Rs. 500 million. The Lankaputhra Bank is giving Rs. 250 million to this airline through a debenture . So the father, the fathers bank has given people's money to the sons airline without due diligence. Is this business? Is this economic sense? Is there a cost benefit analysis done? When this country does not have a proper transportation system, when you cannot even run buses in this country, what a heinous crime are you committing, Hon. Minister? Now, when we say this, ? ? ? . Hon. Minister, Rs. 110 million is outstanding to SriLankan Airlines. Is that being contradicted? How are you going to pay this amount? Today, you have brought disrepute to Sri Lanka by not paying the bills and as a result, our airlines are being pushed. start . , ? Mihin Air ? You are unable to fly Trevandrum because you have not paid the bills. You are getting the pilots to carry US Dollars 20,000 in a suitcase to pay the bills. , ? ? ? , ?

We want to know as to how the recapitalization of the SriLankan Airlines is going to take place? Hon. Deputy Speaker, how much more time do I have? ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You have about seven minutes more. I think, the Hon. John Amaratunga is seconding it. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, I will take a minute more. I would like to know as to how the recapitalization of the SriLankan Airlines is going to take place because public finance is involved. We do not want the SriLankan Airlines monies to be allocated to a Head under the Department of National Budget, so that it can be transferred to any other Head by an Order of the Secretary to the Treasury, which has been stealthily done over the last two years without the approval of the Parliament. Money is siphoned off to relevant areas. We would like to know as to how that money is going to be funded. You would know that it has been highlighted; that the last budget has a deficit of Rs. 70 billion. Who is going to pay for that? Is it the innocent people? Everything is happening today under the guise of the war. Where is the war? You are saying that the East is captured. In that case, how was Maheswaran killed in a Kovil in Colombo? I like to mention his name because it is his birthday today. My Colleague, the Hon. Maheswaran would have celebrated his birthday today if he was alive. His absence will be felt for life, and at this particular moment I thought it is nothing but right to make mention of him. The Government must be held responsible for the fact that his security was reduced. When he was killed, the IGP on the following day says that they have caught the assassin who is a LTTEer. Today, he is supposed to be brought before courts officially. Yesterday, he was taken for the identification parade but the poosari and the officer who were there were unable to identify him. So, how is that the IGP, who pronounced, " Here, is the accomplice", today changing his stand? Is there a political coup behind that? Look at the threat that is coming in? They are using Sri Rangas "Minnal" Programme in ''Shakthi TV" and trying to show that that was the cause for his death. Then, what happens? A Minister is using his unwanted powers and trying to say something else, which is a contempt of Court when the Court has asked to take the "Minnal" Programme as the basis to what has happened. The Minister gives directions otherwise. The Hon. Maheswaran is not here. If he had been here today, I am sure, he also would have joined us in seconding this Motion because he also had a knowledge in shipping though aviation was not alien to him.

So, once again I want to tell the the Government that they must do what they have got to do. They are unable to run airlines. They were unable to provide security to Maheswaran. Now, some Ministers are trying to intimidate and use Sri Rangas "Minnal" Programme as the cause for his death, which has been so much popular in the hearts and minds of the Muslims and Tamils. But, the other programmes that were telecast on BBC, "Derana" and "Max TV" which had very articulate interviews with Maheswaran are not being mentioned. So, is there an orchestrated move by the Government to bring pressure on Sri Ranga and to the "Minnal" Programme and try to close that down? These are matters to which we want an answer. So, Hon. Deputy Speaker, while giving way to my Colleague, the Hon. John Amaratunga to give his knowledge on this, we want you to ensure that the SriLankan Airlines is protected. The Government said that no privatization can take place. How is it going forward now? What is the way forward? What is the road map? What is the prognosis to the Airline? How are they going to protect and take forward Mihin Air which is bankrupt? Mr. Deputy Speaker, we want a responsible answer in this House and we will take this forward if the proper answer does not come. I thank you, Sir.

FELICITATION OF SRI LANKAN CRICKET TEAM ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , , , , 709 - 1996 2007 , . . (, , , )

( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, we join you in felicitating Muttiah Muralitharan and the rest of the Sri Lankan Cricket Team.

For our country, it is an honour that Sri Lanka has gained its fame in cricket over the last two decades. It has been in a very short time. If you look at how we became world famous, two decades is a very short time in the history of cricket, but, nevertheless, this team and their predecessors have all contributed to putting our name on the cricket map, on the world map. Not only countries that play cricket, not only those who follow or know about cricket, but there are also many others in other parts of the world who have heard of the Sri Lankan Team and know something of cricket. To the Team, we should express our thanks and especially to Muttiah Muralitharan who has now established a world record. I think all of us are proud especially to receive this young man from Kandy who has now caught the attention of the world and who is famous throughout the world for his cricketing skills, more so for his bowling. Good cricketers have a tendency to be controversial. That is a hallmark and that is what he has become. So, we join you, Hon. Speaker, in felicitating Muttiah Muralitharan and the Sri Lankan Cricket Team. ( ) (The Hon. Wimal Weerawansa) , . , , , . , , , , . , , . . , . . , . , , . , , . , , .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Mr. Speaker, I, too, am very pleased that I have an opportunity to felicitate the world record breaking cricketer Muttiah Muralitharan and of course, all other cricketers who have brought honour to this country. Mr. Speaker, today cricket is, by and large, the only consolation we have across the ethnic divide that appears to bleed this country. We see this not only in Sri Lanka, but even in other countries. We saw a recent episode in Australia where one of the Indian players, Harbhajan Singh was held for racial abuse. The entire Indian nation backed that cricketer and the team finally got the ICC to reverse their original decision and even got an umpire changed, who was asked to stand in the match. We saw a similar issue in the case of the Pakistan Team where an umpire called off the match and awarded the match to the English Cricket Team for a delay in coming out of the dressing room to the field. That again became an issue where not only the Pakistanis, but the Indians and the others who were on a variety of other political issues, very much at loggerheads came together in the sub-continent. Even in the case of Muttiah Muralitharan way back in Australia, we had the same wides that we saw in the entire sub-continent and even in other countries of the Third World like the West Indies. There was a coming together of minds to stand up against discriminatory behaviour by other test-playing nations. But one aspect of which we must be happy about,is that finally the game of cricket is held in such high esteem that there is always compromise and these matters are resolved by a give-and-take attitude by all parties who are involved. We must also welcome our Colleague, the Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga who has been appointed to head Sri Lankan cricket. I would like to congratulate him, who is no mean cricketer. He had brought fame to this country and in fact, brought a player like Muttiah Muralitharan under his tutelage. He, himself had given courage to bring us this honour. Though, I represent the Digamadulla District, I am from the Kandy District and am particularly proud of this great son of soil. Let me join all of you in congratulating Muttiah Muralitharan and the team. Thank you very much. ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana - Minister of Science and Technology) , . ,
