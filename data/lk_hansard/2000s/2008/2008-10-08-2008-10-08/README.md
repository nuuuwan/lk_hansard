Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister why do you require three months time to give the details of the expenditure that has been incurred over the last 15 months ? . . ( . . ) (The Hon. M. H. Cegu Isadean ) Because the Question is very lengthy and it will require a long time to give the Answer. So, I request, Hon. Speaker, for three months time.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Unless you want to conceal information from this House, Hon Minister, there is no reason why such an innocuous Question cannot be answered. Is it because the Hon. Minister has gone out of the country more than 48 times that you do not want to highlight it to this House ? . . ( . . ) (The Hon. M. H. Cegu Isadean ) Mr. Speaker, give us at least two months time. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

I am asking you a logical question. You are a person who is intelligent and who is able to stand on your own feet. Is it because your Minister has gone out of the country more than four times a month that you do not want to answer that Question in this House ?

. . ( . . ) (The Hon. M. H. Cegu Isadean ) During the first round you were not here I could have easily tabled this, but I have been waiting to tell you that I need three months time to answer this Question. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

. . , . , . . . - - , , .. . , , . ! . ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . . . [.. 11.28] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Deputy Speaker, it was my good fortune to come to know the late Mr. D.B. Wijetunga, who was both Prime Minister and President of Sri Lanka, quite well in the post-1977 period when he was the Minister of Posts and Telecommunication in the J.R. Jayewardene Government. He was a very genial person, a very mild person and a very pleasant person to interact with at all times. I must quite frankly state that I was not in agreement with many of the political views he expressed, particularly on the national question, at the time when he was the President of this country, and that none of the minorities in this country would have accepted the views expressed by Mr. D.B. Wijetunga when he was the President of this country. Nevertheless, I think we all accepted that he was a person who was committed to certain values; he was a man of integrity and he was not a person who put forward pretences. He spoke quite frankly about whatever he wanted to say and insofar as the democratic process was concerned, I think he endeavoured to preserve the values of the democratic process and to promote it. He realized the importance of preserving and promoting democratic values and I think that was a very significant trait in his character which showed eventually that he was a true democrat. It must also be mentioned, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that Mr. Wijetunga never sought high political office. In fact, when he became the Prime Minister of this country when

Mr. Premadasa was the President, that was a bit of a surprise to the people of this country because there were many other aspirants for the Prime Ministerial position who were occupying the front row of the Government Benches. But, Mr. Premadasa for whatever reason, decided that he will make Mr. D.B. Wijetunga his Prime Minister and Mr. D.B. Wijetunga became the Prime Minister of this country. Similarly, I do not think he ever thought to become the President. When President Premadasa was killed, it so happened that Mr. Wijetunga who was the Prime Minister was elected as the President of the country by Parliament. So really, Sir, he was a person who never aspired to decide positions. But I think it was his destiny that without any such aspiration on his part he had to be both the Prime Minister and the President of this country. I thought it is my duty, Sir, in view of my very close association with him in the post-1977 period, and in view of the fact that he had always treated me with a great deal of courtesy and had always been very gentle and genial in his dealings with me to express these views in Parliament. I would join the Hon. Members in requesting that a copy of these proceedings be sent to the members of the bereaved family, to all of whom we convey our very sincere condolences. Thank you, Sir.

.. . . ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. This is regarding the provision of a helicopter to airlift the remains of late Major General Janaka Perera to Anuradhapura. As of this moment, we are made to understand that the helicopter has still not been given. Is this the respect that is being paid to a decorated officer who saved this country? The family is languishing there at the Ratmalana Airport. The Prime Minister yesterday, at 7.30 p.m., confirmed to Hon. Tissa Attanayake and us that it would be given. So, since only the Hon. D.M. Jayaratne, a senior Minister, is in the House at the moment, we call upon him to look into this. An inhuman act has been done to this gentleman.

[.. 3.37] ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

Venerable Presiding Member, this House condoles today the death of a great leader of Sri Lanka, a former President, none other than the late Hon. D. B. Wijetunga. The late Hon. D. B. Wijetunga lived a full life. If am not mistaken, he lived up to the age of 92 years. He was a man who emerged from a very simple family. Because of his devotion, honesty and capability, he was able to enter Parliament long years ago. He entered Parliament, became a Minister, then the Prime Minister and finally the President. In between he had the fortune of being a Governor as well. During his tenure of office he discharged his duties for the welfare and benefit of the people of this country. I have a special reason to admire him. He was the President who promoted me to the Cabinet. When I was the Minister of Provincial Councils and Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, he took over the reins as the President of this country and immediately invited me to

his Cabinet and I was appointed as the Minister of Home Affairs and Provincial Councils. It was during that period under his leadership that the UNP Government was able to clear the East. I very distinctly remember that a large amount of funds were allocated through my Ministry at that time to reconstruct and rehabilitate the Assistant Government Agents offices in the Eastern Province which were all destroyed by the LTTE. There was nothing left; there was no administration. Having cleared the East, new divisional secretariats were set up whole throughout the East and I had the fortune of personally visiting the East to declare open those offices and restoring once again the administration in those areas. That was a great achievement when you consider the problems we had before. The East had been completely neglected. There was no development. With the opening of the new divisional secretariats, once again life in the Eastern Province got revived. Some are of the view that he was one of the luckiest politicians in this country. Most unexpectedly, when there were very many contenders for the position of Prime Minister during the Premadasa regime, without any problem he became the Prime Minister. He kept silent. He never went behind those positions. However, his loyalty was recognized by the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa and he was appointed as the Prime Minister. He was a man who was never taken up by positions. He discharged his duties well and most unexpectedly with the demise of President Premadasa, he became the President. There was no necessity for him to stand for elections for any of these posts. They were brought on to his lap. Therefore, everyone remembers the way he came up in the political ladder and the manner in which he conducted himself after having restored in these high positions, both as the Prime Minister and the President. He was not greedy for power. He did not want to hang on to the Presidency. As soon as he found that the country was in a different political direction, he called for an election and gave way for it. Therefore, people remember him as one of the finest politicians that Sri Lanka has ever produced; a man who rose from humble beginnings to the highest position in life. He had the greatest regard for Buddhism in this country. He gave the first place, the pride of place for Buddhism and ensured that peaceful harmony prevails among the communities who live in Sri Lanka. I, therefore condole the demise of the late President Wijetunga and we are sorry that we have lost a gentleman, a politician, a party politician of the United National Party who has contributed a great deal for the welfare of the country as well as for the United National Party. Thank you.
