Hon. Speaker, if you look at the contents of the judgment, you would be rest assured that what we have been saying during the last three to four years has come to pass. Even though we prayed for this type of relief last year, I think at that particular moment it was not seen and the intentions of our argument was seen as inimical then. Subsequently, after last years action, it has been proven beyond doubt and even the Supreme Court Judges including the Chief Justice has said in the judgment that the petitioners in their submissions urged under Article 148 of the Constitution that this House has full control over public finance. I am happy that it has been restored to its lost glory because after all, if we, the Members of this House, do not know that there was expenditure incurred on Mihin Air, Lanka Puthra Bank et cetera and monies have been allocated for cars, there is no point of public finance being under our control, under Article 148. But now the lost prestige has been restored. Hon. Speaker, in the judgment it is stated, I quote: One important check on the exercise of executive power is that finance required for such exercise remains within the full control of Parliament - the legislature. There are three vital components of such control in terms of the Constitution viz: (i) control of the sources of finance, i.e. imposition of taxes, ." "(ii) control by way of allocation .." "(iii)control by way of continuous . " Hon. Speaker, in order to save time, I would like to go to page six of the Supreme Court Determination. In page 6, line 28 states, I quote : These facts have been kept away from the public domain by the statutory device in clause 2 (1) of excluding expenditure under any other law. The staggering debt service payments of Rs.722 Billion for the financial year 2009 reflect an accumulation of public debt over the past years that has resulted from irresponsible and reckless handling of public finance by the Treasury and a failure on the part of Parliament to exercise full control of public finance as mandated by Article 148 of the Constitution. On disclosure of this, Rs.738 billion would amount to be inconsistent under Article 148 of the Constitution and as a result, the Judges have said that in order to pass this you need a two-thirds majority. Referring to Clause 6 (1) of the Bill, Sir, they state the following. I quote: This clause permits the Secretary to the Treasury, the Deputy Secretary to the Treasury or the Director General of National Budget Department to transfer any money allocated under the Development Activities Program appearing under Head Department of the National Budget as specified in the 1st schedule to any other Program under any other Head in the schedule. The Supreme Court has decided that such action needs to be taken. So, they have resolved that Clauses 2(1) and 6 (1) are deemed invalid, and needs to be passed with a two-thirds majority, if the Bill is to be passed. So, Hon. Speaker, you would see that this is the result of the mad financial management that we have been referring to-date. Under Public Debt, there is about Rs.

30 billion at this moment and we would like to know whether it has been transferred to the Consolidated Fund. As a matter of fact, it was raised in Parliament yesterday afternoon, but there was no clear indication whether things have been rectified or not. These should have been answered as a matter of courtesy during the Budget Speech. The Supreme Court judgment was given well before the Budget Speech was delivered. Hon. Speaker, there is no Minister of Finance here, yet I hope that this would be rectified. As a matter of fact it should have been done yesterday. Furthermore, in the same spirit, what has happened to the PERC which was legislated by Parliament? This particular institution played a pivotal role in the public finance of this country. Now what has happened to it? At the beginning of this year, owing to the exposition that came through the COPE, suddenly the dynamic person who was heading the PERC, Mr. Arumugam, was removed unceremoniously - as a matter of fact he was my lecturer as well - and he was sent to the Ministry of Finance and Planning and he was treated so badly to the extent that he could not survive even in the Ministry of Finance and Planning and ended up as a lecturer in SLIDA. He had written to Dr. P.B. Jayasundara, the then Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and Planning, stating, This is not the way we have to repeal the PERC as there are over 28 institutions that are under probe. There are certain documentation that needs to be protected and there are public finances that the PERC needs to contribute. Please ensure that this goes on until such time that these files are closed. Hon. Speaker, the reason for bringing this up is because we determine the expenditure incurred this year, the revenue that has accrued in the past year and the deficits that are going to come in and the total impact of the economy without taking into consideration these undisclosed monies. So, when you have the PERC which has undisclosed accounts that are running into billions, how would you be able to give the true position? The Questions that I asked this morning was in no personal animosity or acrimony towards the Chief Government Whip. We ask Questions on behalf of the country and for the betterment of its citizens. We, as the Opposition, have a principal responsibility to ask Questions for public probity. Now, if you are unable to disclose this information, these books that have been given to us is meaningless and it is useless participating in this Budget Debate. So, I think the spirit must change. Look at the revival that has taken place in the USA. Look at the way Barack Obama took over the Presidency from George Bush. Look at the way McCain responded. That is the system that has been prevailing. Here, if the Opposition gets up, they say it is anti-Government or if a suggestion is made, they say it is inimical to the existence of the Government. That is, hoodwinking the people. There must be a degree of acceptability. Look at the character-assassination made on the Leader

199 200

of the Opposition. Day in, day out it takes place. Look at the security provided to the Leader of the Opposition. According to the order of precedence, he is the third or fourth citizen in this country. He is not given a bullet-proof vehicle which he is entitled to. Remember, when he was the Prime Minister, he gave the Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar 32 vehicles and an official residence. Nothing about it is mentioned. There is no courtesy in this system. I refer to the Budget Speech made yesterday just to show the politicization in the process. His Excellency the President comes here rightfully and presents the Budget, whether it is accepted or not is a different thing. Under "Public Servants Welfare" he says that he intends giving "X" amount of benefits and Rs. 1,000 per month to public servants. Under "Pension", he says, "We were able to restore pensions of retired public servants". Six lines below that, he brings in the same thing that the United National Party then offered, which means that if one retires prematurely, he or she will be entitled to a higher element of incentives. On the one hand, he scolds the UNP, and on the other, he brings in the same condition which was then introduced on the requirement of public servants. Then, this Government takes us to task saying it is we who stymied the public servant. This is disgraceful thinking as if you are addressing nursery children in this country. The entire country saw the hypocrisy. I do not want to demean myself to that low level because UNP is the party that brought Independence to this country. If there has been any degree of development, Hon. Speaker, I am sure you will agree that 95 per cent of that has been done by us. We want to maintain the decorum, the style and the manner that is needed to carry this country forward. But, we are very concerned; the reason being that we have to inherit an economy that needs to be managed into the future. Today, expenditure has risen to an uncontrollable extent. Thanks to the Supreme Court. It has now been reduced to a certain degree. But there is a lot which can be exposed during the course of my speech in order to show how we have got to walk towards a better financial management. So, Hon. Speaker, at this particular moment, all we can see is that the Government is now resorting to borrowing in the normal way. They want to expend but they do not have the revenue, so they have to borrow. They come in with promises but they do not have the ability, so they have to borrow. They borrow economic theories from Nivard Cabraal. You can see what a mess he is making of this. If you take Consumer Affairs, they do not have the ability. So they take the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane in. When he is on this side, he says one thing and when he is on that side, he says another thing. Then, take Foreign Affairs. They do not have resourceful persons. The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama went there and sees what has happened. One week after his visit, a Special Envoy was appointed; he goes to India. The Foreign Minister answers one question here and another from there.

Then, look at the international trade relationship. There is no potential, no ability. You took the Hon. (Prof.) G.L.Peiris in. And, what does he do? The Labour GSP that we got from 2001 to 2004 is owing to the sagacity of my Leader. He was a part of the negotiations. What we got unconditionally, he twists and says that there were conditions when there were absolutely no conditions. If tomorrow this Government falls, which I hope for the sake of the country, it does; then the United National Party will replace it and be able to get the Labour GSP in a jiffy. What is needed is just practical thinking. Who wants to stymie the media? Who wants to breach human rights in this country? Is that a necessity that needs to be even questioned and investigated? The necessity goes further in that, the Government does not understand that there were certain conditions that had to be complied with. So, when they signed the application, within one week the Cabinet says, "We are sorry, we are not interested in complying with such requirements. So, this is the disability in the ability of this Government. There are 110 Ministers. This is the reason why we are looking at the war. What has been done by the yet heroic armed forces, they cannot carry on in a proper way. They take the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella in to do that. The very people who helped the Government - we may have differences in our thinking with the JVP - the JVP played a pivotal role and even the President had the graciousness to say they had the support of the JVP. What has happened now? Where are the people like Wimal Weerawansa who then said, , . ? US Dollars 136 US Dollars 60 , 85 ? , . . . . . ? ? . Labour GSP , ? . Now yesterdays Daily News under the headline states, Priority for Development, CoL The Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, Minister of State Revenue and Finance and Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning states in the same newspaper, Peoples welfare, long term development. If you take the headline, Priority for Development, CoL, where on earth do you find this?

. The capital expenditure for the year 2008 was Rs. 432 billion and with the 30 per cent inflation, there should be at least an allocation of Rs. 480 billion for the next year. But that has not been made. They have allocated only Rs. 434 billion. That is only a two billion rupees increase over the last year. So, that means either there is no capital expenditure or they only pay lip service and not expend that in the actual way. When you look at the Supreme Court judgment, the total Budget deficit is not Rs. 344 billion, it is Rs. 844 billion. If you add on Rs. 95 billion which is due to unrealistic revenue targets and also add on an expenditure of Rs. 100 billion for understating of expenditure to that, you are going to have a deficit of Rs.1,039 billion. 1,39,000 . . . . - - . . . , , , . , , . . .

We must take one step at a time at this particular moment. All we can say is, the blessed are the young and they shall not inherit the national debt. This Government like no other, has ruined the economy. Therefore, this Government must be held responsible. We must ensure that they do not ruin the economy any further. Thank you, Hon. Speaker. * : : Documents tabled : Makeover Needed 01 Nov, 2008 07:05:29 Sri Lanka bad budgets, hot borrowings, dollar peg has endangered economy: IMF Nov o1, 2008 (LBO) - Sri Lanka has to change its ways to protect it self from the negative effects of bad budgets, foreign borrowings, and a de facto dollar peg of the rupee, the International Monetary Fund has said. The IMFs executive directors, in an annual assessment of the island, said the economy and the national currency were threatened by foreign hot money brought into finance the budget deficit, which could reverse at any time.

Directors noted the risks of public debt distress arising from the increasing reliance on dollar - denominated, short-term commercial debt, the IMF said in a statement after its annual Article IV consultations. Directors took note of the staffs assessment that the real effective exchange rate of the rupee is overvalued, and that the de facto peg risks contributing to external instability by attracting speculative inflows that could reverse quickly. Hedge funds that financed Sri Lanka budget deficits in 2007 and early 2008 to the tune of 600 million dollars are already pulling out, and the countrys reserves have fallen to 2.6 billion dollars from 3.4 billion dollars two months earlier. According to Sri Lankas own real effective exchange rate (REER) index, the rupee was overvalued by about 18 per cent in June, hurting the islands exporters but helping foreign hedge funds On Thursday Sri Lanka tried to float the rupee but the exercise failed and a new peg had been established at 110 rupees to the US dollar instead of the previous 108, and the central bank is still losing foreign reserves steadily. IMF said the dollar peg had encouraged hot money to come in. The IMF urged Sri Lanka to break the peg saying exchange rate flexibility would help discourage the flows of de-stabilizing capital. But Sri Lanka also needed a comprehensive policy package that would underpin confidence in the currency. Directors expressed concern that the combined build-up of macroeconomic imbalances, balance sheet vulnerabilities, high inflation, and external financing pressures poses serious risks to economic stability, the IMF said. Amid increased international risk aversion, raising external finance will become increasingly challenging, and Sri Lankas external accounts are vulnerable to a reduction in international investor risk appetite. IMF said Sri Lankas recent growth has been impressive and welcomed central bank attempts to tighten monetary policy and bring down inflation. The government was also cutting down energy subsidies and helping the national budget. But Sri Lanka needed an economic policy makeover, starting with budgets. This would need to involve a front - loaded fiscal consolidation, complemented by monetary tightening, steps toward greater exchange rate flexibility, and a further strengthening of financial supervision and regulation, IMF said. Most independent analysts had identified Sri Lankas budgets as the single most de-stabilizing factor, which often overrides central bank monetary policy (fiscal dominance) and causes high inflation and balance of payments crises. Sri Lankas budgets improved after a balance of payments and economic crisis in 2000/2001, but fiscal and economic policy reversed in 2004 as the island jettisoned and IMF - backed reform package. Four years later Sri Lankas balance of payments is under pressure again. The IMF no longer has an office in Sri Lanka. Meanwhile the IMF said a 100 percent margin on car import letters of credit should be removed. But a day earlier, Sri Lanka had already doubled the margin to 200 percent, and revived a raft of additional trade restrictions that were imposed during the 2000/2001 economic crisis.

Under the caption No medicine to Mullaitivu hospital : Officials, Daily Mirror of 6th November, 2008 states, I quote: Essential supplies including medicine and vaccinations have not been supplied to the Mullaitivu Hospital for months, authorities said. Acting Deputy Director of Health Mullaitivu district, Dr.Osmund Charles told the BBC Sandeshaya that only Paracetamol and vitamins were left with the hospital. We did not receive childrens medicine even last time. Malarial patients are found everyday but we do not have medicine to treat them, he said. Dr. Charles added the hospital had not received any medicine for the last four months and the patients with snake bites also cannot be treated due to lack of anti-venom. There is also a huge shortage of fuel for ambulances and electricity in the region,.

Venerable Presiding Member, it is indeed an opportunity for me to make my speech immediately after the Hon. Suresh Premachandran, Member of Parliament, whose speech came out more like one that he should have made on the day we debated the extension of the state Emergency in this House. But, in view of some of the very strong statements made during his speech - though I propose to concentrate more on the very far-reaching

aspects of the Budget that has been presented for the year 2009 by our President - I do hope to respond to the Hon. Member in the course of my speech. I would like to invite the House to look at the Budget for 2009 not merely as an account with estimates of expenditure and revenue measures presented to the House for its approval because it is far beyond that. Today, we are discussing a Budget which reflects a continuing process of Sri Lankas economic agenda as envisaged in the "Mahinda Chintana" and since the inception of the administration of our monetory policy, that has continued for the last three consecutive years. We have got an Action Plan contained in the "Mahinda Chintana" which we presented to the people of this country at the time of the Presidential Election in 2005, explaining how we are going to deliver the expectations of our people and cater to the aspirations of all the people of Sri Lanka. That is the structured approach through which the Budget for 2009 has been presented by our President. This Budget has several elements that correctly address the contemporary issues of a given economy. That is something that we all have to recognize without any divide in this House; that the fundamental needs of our people have been well catered to in this Budget. I do not want to repeat what my Colleagues on the Government side, the Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya and the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane, Ministers, stated in the House this morning. I would like to look at the picture in terms of our responsibilities in governing the country and in guiding the economy of Sri Lanka. Now what has happened to the world economy? It is very unfortunate to note that the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake - I do not doubt that he knows his economic principles as much as he has a knowledge of the economy - failed to admit that the downturn in the global economy or the financial crisis that has now registered in the West has its effect on all the countries in the world. That is a fundamental fact when there is a recession. That is why once again we have to see whether we were prophetic in 2005, at the time we promulgated the "Mahinda Chintana", in saying that there has to be a guided economy in Sri Lanka. We strongly advocated the non-privatization of State institutions. That is contained in the "Mahinda Chintana". We strongly advocated that State-owned financial institutions shall remain with the State whilst encouragement is given to the private sector to find opportunities in order to invest and generate wealth. Now, see what has happened in the West? The very core or the centre of economic management lies in the strength of the financial institutions. Now the world over, financial institutions have collapsed to the extent that today people in the United Kingdom are not putting their earned savings or their monies in the banks fearing that banks will collapse and they will lose even the little they have in hand. They are now buying more domestic safes to keep their money safely at home. To that extent, the world economy has taken a turn which was never seen during the last 60 years. The last recession was in 1929. That is how the liberalized economies have failed to cater to the peoples needs.

We have been very guarded and cautious whilst facilitating economic growth. I am happy to announce here that we have been consistently able to achieve a 6.5 per cent growth in terms of our GDP on an annual basis. How have we been able to register such a growth in a country which is affected severely by terrorism? That is why our President has well positioned this Budget targetting democracy and a guided economy. Then, if we take the investments targeted in the Budget, the defence expenditure that represents only about 2.5 per cent of GDP of Sri Lanka, which is a very valued investment for the sake of safeguarding Sri Lankas sovereignty, its territorial integrity and assuring safety of its people and national security, is currently being disputed by my good Friend, the Hon. Suresh Premachandran. Why is that? Are we to throw away the lifeline? Is that what the Hon. Suresh Premachandran wants from the Government, to facilitate the agenda of the LTTE? , , ? . ? ? , ?

? , , , . ? , , . . , , , . This is the greatest challenge we have to face. When I started my speech, I said that the crisis that has emerged in the West has its effect on everybody including us. What can we learn from the past? We will speak during the next seven days, during the Second Reading of the Budget. The Government benches as much as the Opposition benches will be joining in to speak about the micro or macro-development associated with the economic agenda that was unleashed in the House yesterday by our President. I would like to take some

time to get back to the fundamental principles that safeguarded our economy and allowed what we have been enjoying during the last three years. They have today reflected on our economy, making it resilient to the economic downturn and the financial crisis that has emerged right across the globe. I must cite here John Maynard Keynes, who was a major capitalist economist and who believed that the core responsibilities of capitalism was to be able to cater to the needs of a society. But, he became wise in 1929 when the world recession took its toll on the people. At that time, how did he position his argument? His argument was against a liberalized economy, but to be guarded against social elements. In that regard, I would like to refer to what became a realistic and more meaningful approach in the 1930s that ultimately addressed the issues contributing to an ultra-capitalist development in the West and that ultimately resulted in a total collapse. The Keynes theory speaks of being guarded and major investments being made by the State in the key areas of an economy. John Maynard Keynes, who was a defender of the capitalist system, advocated that State investment in the economy would lead to achieving full employment in order to repair the damage to the capitalist system. It is in that context that what we safeguarded during the last three years, retaining within the ambit of the State, has come to pay dividend with the State being responsible for infrastructure development in the key areas of Sri Lanka. That is how we have been able to look at, with very strong foreign policy perspectives and relationships built under the leadership of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa with new areas of assistance and support to augment the Sri Lankan economy. Then, at one time, when we were turning to the East, some pundits in Sri Lanka asked, "Why do you not look at the West?" As the Foreign Minister, I have had several issues raised even in this House: why do we not seek assistance from the West, from Germany? Why do we not get enough from the UK? Why do we not look at other European Union countries in order to initiate assistance programmes? While we sought all these, we also looked at other areas. Japan enhanced their economic contribution to Sri Lanka by over 25 per cent in the year 2007 and today, we have registered US Dollars 400 million in terms of annual assistance from Japan. Now we have assistance coming from China in a most substantial manner; we have assistance coming from India; we have assistance coming from Iran. Hitherto, these were not favourite countries when considering Sri Lankas dependency. But, our President had the foresight. He saw it coming before anyone else. We were dependent only on the traditional aid giving countries and even the little that flowed in, cannot be expected today because they have lost almost everything there. Their banking systems have collapsed. Looking towards a fourth year under President Rajapaksa, we are now trying to make the economy

305 306

resilient with proper economic fundamentals. Our banks are functioning; our capital ratios have gone up; our people can use their credit cards without any restriction; our mobile phone usage is increasing; and our development activities on roads are getting further enhanced. Mega development projects that were never seen since the time of President Jayewardene have now been started after a lapse of 25 years, a quarter of a century, in this country. The Norachcholai Power Plant, the Hambantota Port Development Project, the Uma-Oya project, the Upper Kotmale Hydro-Power Scheme, the Moragahakanda Irrigation Scheme and the road network are getting into gear with additional input of infrastructure, intervention and support by the State. If we did not go to Iran and get assistance to increase the capacity of the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery, from where would we get funds for an additional 50,000 barrels of petroleum products to be produced in Sri Lanka? For 45 years, since the construction of the Sapugaskanda oil refinery, there was not a single aid line or assistance that came in Sri Lanka's way for its expansion. How have we been able to build that confidence to get over a US Dollar one billion investment for the expansion programme of the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery, to get over US Dollars 1,000 million in assistance from China over the next three years for the development work in Sri Lanka and to get over US Dollars 500 million for the Uma-Oya Development Project from Iran? We get continuous assistance from Japan, India and Saudi Arabia. So, that is how we are looking at it. The world markets are getting shrunk and there is no sign of recovery in the world economy in the early part of next year; it may go beyond that. What did Senator Barack Obama, the President-elect of the United States of America, say during his acceptance speech after his victory? He said that the climb is going to be very steep and all the expectations of the American people placed on him may not get realized within the first year of his office or in one term. That is leadership. You tell the people where the expectations lie and how to manage them. That shows how deep the crisis in the world is. There are no solutions like these so-called "bogus budgets" that get introduced on and off. . . . . . , , . , . .

. genocide . , . . - - - , , , - . , 15 . It is very unfortunate that the Hon. Suresh Premachandran was going to compare the situations in Kosovo, Serbia and Georgia with that of Sri Lanka. These are different situations. There is no comparison, wherever in the world, to the fascist LTTE separatist movement in Sri Lanka. That is why the American Admiral Keating has made his comments recently about our military efforts in countering terrorism. I quote what Admiral Timothy Keating, Commander of US Pacific Joint Command, told the foreign correspondents in New York: We are hopeful that the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) would be a decreasingly important factor of much less reach than they are and have been in the past. He also said, I quote: We are very pleased the Sri Lankan Navy has been able to wage an increasingly effective campaign against the LTTE. He further goes on to say, I quote: I am confident the Sri Lankan military has very best intentions in the world (to defeat LTTE). Surely they would like to have greater capability and capacity, but the progress they are making is commendable, This is how the prominent naval Admiral in the whole world, whom I have met during my interactions, has come out strongly not only in condemning the acts of the LTTE but also endorsing the rightful action taken by the military in Sri Lanka. Why is our military taking these actions? That is, purely to safeguard the core responsibilities of the Government towards the people. That is to safeguard and protect the territorial integrity and the sovereignty of Sri Lanka and to provide national security to the country and its people. . , . , . , . ,

? . . 80 . ? ; . I think the Hon. Member did not understand what His Excellency the President said in his Budget Speech. He made it very clear that the country belongs to people of all communities in Sri Lanka. He was very emphatic in stating what we believe what is right for Sri Lanka. It is very important for me to quote what the President said in his Budget Speech. I quote: My dream is for an independent nation. A land filled with greenery. A prosperous tomorrow and a virtuous mankind. I am aware of all the expectations of Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Malays and Burghers being children of Mother Lanka. These expectations can be made a reality. Now, this is our total aim for Sri Lanka. We are conscious of the aspirations and expectations of all our people, because they are our people and they are the people of Sri Lanka. The Hon. Member was trying to attribute certain statements to the Army Commander. I totally denounce that. He was unable to quote that statement from any printed document or any other source, where the veracity of that statement can be educed before this House. The Army Commander has stated the correct position. He had never said that Sri Lanka belongs only to the Sinhalese people. It is true that there had been some misgivings in the press. He has corrected that and I must state as the Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka that this country belongs to everybody; to every son who is born to Mother Lanka and the aim of our Government is to usher in an era where all of us could live in harmony without terrorism in Sri Lanka. We are also conscious of the effects of this Budget on the key areas of the economy. What are the key areas that we are now trying to sustain? We are now attributing a greater dependency on the local production. I am sure the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa has been advocating that policy and it is evident even in his speech during the Second Reading Debate of the last Budget. Last year he spoke just before me and I have his speech. In that speech he said, " . ." . , .

. , , . .

The purchasing power that lies with the world economy is getting further shrunk. Then we must have an alternate through which we import only the most essential items from the world market but generate whatever we can within Sri Lanka. That should be our long-term objective for the protection of our economy. These are the major perspectives within which this Budget has been presented and are included in the economic action plan for the year 2009 on a continuous basis. We have been able to make the Budget Speech and present the Budget Proposals that we are discussing today based on this line of thinking.

We are further encouraged by the way we have looked at our SME sector. How have we looked at the SME sector and what are the contributions that have come from the SME sector? As one who created the National Enterprise Development Authority in the year 2005, I take a lot of pride in the strength of our small and medium scale enterprise sector which is contributing over 70 per cent of the total GDP of our country. We have to spread that to all parts of Sri Lanka.

That is why I say that the economic advancement lies in the greater democratization of the country. Where have we taken this democratization? We have taken this to areas in the Eastern Province where there was no democracy previously. Today for the first time in the history of Sri Lanka, the Eastern Provincial Council is administering the district and addressing the needs of all our people; the Tamils, the Sinhalese and the Muslims who are living in harmony. That is what was meant by President Rajapakses vision to cater to the people. We are providing more and more investment to that region because that region was deprived of development for 25 years due to the scourge of terrorism that prevailed in those areas. It is from that angle that we are looking at greater opportunities to be given to the milk production sector, the paddy sector, and the small growers in the tea and rubber sectors. They are all part of the SME sector development in Sri Lanka. There is a special concentration on the Lankaputhra Bank which is an amalgamation of the SME Bank which I created during my period when I was in charge of that subject. Now, today why did we create the SME sector to be a vibrant sector? Because, we strongly believe in the entrepreneurship of the small person and the people of Sri Lanka. Today, we have been able to improve the growth against our exports. Our resilience over the world impact on our economy sliding down with the world prices can get further adjusted if we have greater security on our production bases. That is how we have looked at the macroeconomic picture so that we can take

309 310

the micro effects of that for the benefit of all our people, 20 million in number. That is how we have to look at an action plan for the economy. We have not said that we have a war to fight in the North, we have to fight terrorism, therefore tighten your belt; no employment opportunities, no salary increases, no overtime like we said in 2002 in this very House in the United National Party Budget. No such thing has ever been said by President Mahinda Rajapaksa because he strongly believes that what is meant for the people should be given with greater enhancement. That is how we are looking at the economy whilst managing it. Some of the prophets of doom are silent today having analysed the benefits of this Budget. That is the silence that prevails because we have been able to present a Budget which is attractive and at the same time meaningful, a Budget that has provisions for development and at the same time countering terrorism, a Budget that brings liberty to the people and greater strength of democracy to all parts of Sri Lanka, soon to the North, because we have been able to look at the fundamental aspects in the last 36 months that we have been in office. So, this is a very far-reaching Budget in the opinion of everybody who strongly believes in the need to sustain greater development in our country. We are also very conscious about how the Governments social responsibility is working today. When fuel prices were going up, the Government was cushioning under the element of high price of fuel. But today, when it is sliding down you have to recover, recoup the loss whilst you pass the benefits on to the consumer. That is how a consumer-oriented market is being catered to. As the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane said, merely because you impose a duty on the importation of milk powder in order to develop the local milk production, it does not mean that tomorrow they can raise the prices. There is a regulatory mechanism through which our Government is guiding the economy. It is a mechanism of a good democratic economy, to pass the benefits of economic development to the people and to cushion the people against various adverse effects that come from outside elements, outside world. This is how we balance it. We have to always look at the fundamentals of our economy to be sustained on a continuous basis. We cannot just refer to 2006 and say that we presented the Budget, these are the estimates and these are things that approval is needed, and forget it in 2007. We must have the effects of 2006 being taken over 2007 and 2008 on a continuous basis so that every cent that we put on capital investment and cushioning the people will be on a sustainable manner. So, no one is being taken unaware of what is happening, like how the major economies have collapsed today. They cannot find answers for the collapse. Some say it is due to overheated economy, some say it is due to greater exposure to credit and lack of recovery of debt. They say that today there is a sea of debt in the world. .

Venerable Sir, special reference was made in the Budget Speech - in fact, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake and the Hon. Suresh Premachandra also referred to it - about Sri Lanka vis-a-vis the European Union and the GSP concession that is now being discussed both in Sri Lanka and in Europe. I would like to quote what the President said yesterday in the Budget Speech. In Part I, on page 13, under para 29, he says: Hon. Speaker, the European Union has adopted a new trend, wherein conditions are being attached to concessions granted by them such as GSP+. It is unfair to engage in international trade and investment within a framework through which political objectives are tried to be achieved. Now, how could political objectives replace trade concessions? That is an issue in regard to which we have made our position very clear. The President further says, I quote: We are a proud nation that is not second to any developed country which respects fundamental rights, human rights, rights of women, respect labour laws, laws preventing the use of child labour, environmental laws, gender equality, election and civil rights. So, these are ingrained in our Constitution. There are statutory provisions that we have made in order to enhance the rights of all our people. In the context of what we posses today, why should we compromise our value judgment to the European Union? That is how we have positioned ourselves. But we are all the time engaged with the world at large including the European Union. That is why we have proposed that a dialogue is the mean through which we could address these issues and we are pursuing our efforts towards that. This is how we are looking at matters. But never will we compromise our national interest, sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country. That is something I would like to repeat. In the context of these things, Venerable Sir, we are looking at the development agenda for Sri Lanka. The amber light comes on before the red appears. Similarly, we are taking very proactive action. We are not a Government that reacts merely because alarm bells are rung by some interested quarters in the world. We have got a very proactive approach when it comes to Sri Lankas priorities, the interests of our people and that of our nation. We address them in the most productive, the most meaningful and the most capable manner. That is how we are positioning our Government. I listened to the speech of the Hon. Suresh Premachandra. It is so unfortunate that he is not in the House now, even to interrupt or to intervene when I am referring to the LTTE and the type of lifeline the TNA Members are trying to throw towards Prabhakaran; the terrorist who wants people of all communities living in Sri Lanka to sacrifice for his fascist terrorist agenda which he imagines could be succeeded. So, along with the challenges that we have both in terms of democracy and restoration of democracy to all

parts of Sri Lanka, we also have the question of liberty. These are very core issues that we are all committed to. What did Senator Barack Obama say? He said that he stands for democracy and liberty. We, in Sri Lanka stand for democracy, liberty and security. Security in Sri Lanka is being threatened. Therefore, we need to restore it. , ? ( ) (The Presiding Member) . ( ) (The Hon.
