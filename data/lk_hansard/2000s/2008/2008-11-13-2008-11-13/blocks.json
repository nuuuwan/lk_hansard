The Supreme Court determined that Sections 2(1) and 6(1) of the Appropriation Bill, 2009 should be struck off owing to the fact that the expenditure does not go under the Consolidated Fund nor does it go under a specific Head. Sir, when His Excellency the President, who is also the Minister of Finance and Planning, spoke in this House, there was no reference to such a thing. Only the Minister, the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva made reference to it and said that due care will be taken. The most important thing is that the Budget report has not been presented; the actual position has not been given as to where the surplus funds have gone and the expenditures under the different Heads. So, at this moment, we are debating in Parliament something which contravenes the judgment of the Supreme Court. We would like to know in this House, Sir, as to what remedial action has been taken.",

    "text": ", , , . When the stock exchange withers and when the economy slows down, it is not the end of the road. It is up to industry to reinvent itself, to review both itself and the market and readjust its production and technology to acquire a competitive edge. That is where technology becomes a critical tool. Says Prakash Parthasarathy, an M.S. in Production Technology, Today, we have a host of technologies to choose from in any field. Some of these technologies are production oriented, others are more competitive. You can choose either to enhance your economy of scale in production, or opt to adopt a technology that can cut costs without compromising on quality. Obviously, you cannot be labour intensive at this juncture. So the best solution will be to raise productivity levels without having to retrench staff, and technology offers such solutions.' He says the current scenario offers a host of opportunities that big, medium and small industries can utilize to refashion their approach and survive. 'It is not as though all sectors of the economy are going downhill. Power and Infrastructure for instance are sectors that will throw up excellent opportunities. Similarly, energy-saving devices and technology can come in handy. A whole lot of power-intensive industries are trying their best to cut energy consumption and costs, as they are becoming increasingly costly and account for 12 to 15 per cent of the production cost. Industry must not only go in for green energy, but also learn to reduce consumption.'\" . . , , , , . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . , [ ] .",

    "text": "Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I would like to begin by congratulating His Excellency the President for introducing a very realistic and a development-oriented Budget under very difficult circumstances when both local and international factors affected the economy, for that matter, all economies all over the world. There was a major energy crisis, there was a food crisis of international dimension and there was the international financial crisis, which in fact, was the worst in the history of this world. It was the worst financial crisis to be experienced by the developed as well as the developing world. It was the greatest economic crisis which has been experienced by the world since the Great Depression of 1929. The crisis was not confined to a few developed countries or for that matter, to a couple of developed economies; it became a global process, a global crisis. I would like to focus the attention of this House to certain salient aspects, to certain salient features of the global financial crisis. It was a crisis within the capitalist system, it was a crisis within the process of global capitalism. In the history of capitalism, which then was not global in character and its orientation, there were similar downturns in the past. The first important crisis was in 1870 which the countries were able to overcome with certain management techniques. The next important phase was in 1929; I am referring to the Great Depression which was also known as the Great Crash. The all-powerful centre of finance in the United States, the Wall Street, collapsed and the levels of debt rose to astonishing heights. Europe could not pay its international bills with gold. Gold was the anchor of the then financial system in the world; it was tied to gold. Banks panicked and the depositors hoarded cash because of which the banks in both Europe and the United States fell. Their vaults became empty; there was no cash in the banks. The United States fell into depression and Britain left the gold standard. John Steinbeck, referring to this Great Depression, which was then known as the Great Crash, said the following. I quote: The Bank is something more than men, I tell you. Its the monster. Men made it, but they cant control it. Today again they have failed to control it. The world economy was recovered, and Managed Capitalism came into being. The post-war construction, based on the Marshall Plan in Europe, forced the State to have a close control of the capitalist economy. State intervention was recommended. The financial system was brought under",

    "text": "very tight regulations and funds were directed towards the development industry. The most important policy prescription of the period was that the Government stimulated demand by lowering interest rates and enlarging their deficits. A bit of deficit financing, Mr. Deputy Chairman, is necessary to stimulate growth and development. Inflation was controlled and there was a long boom in Europe and in the US where there was mass consumerism. In the '70s and '80s, both Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan brought changes to remove controls and regulations of the past 40 years. They wanted to open up the economy. Union power was curbed. Margaret Thatcher, known as the \"Iron Lady\", controlled the British trade unions and state-owned enterprises were privatized; the so-called Privatization Revolution came on the scene. Thatcher and Reagan made sweeping changes to accelerate development and marketization. Tax rates were lowered and financial regulations were dismantled. That process of change was called Democratic Capitalism and countries in the world began to adopt it. Now they are talking about Creative Capitalism. It is in this historical context that we need to look at the international financial crisis of the present time. It began with the collapse of the American housing market - two mortgage giants in the United States, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, collapsed. Federal Housing Finance Agency was asked to intervene. They intervened to help the two giants to lend mortgages at lower rates of interests and thereby support the housing market. US Secretary to the Treasury, Paulson said, I quote: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are so large and so interwoven in our financial system that a failure of either of them would cause great turmoil in the financial markets here at home and around the globe. That is what the US Secretary to the Treasury said. This shows the magnitude of the crisis which the US experienced in the last few months. It was in this grim scenario that the US started to bail out these major mortgage companies and the US Government, in the form of state intervention injected US Dollars 700 billion into the system. Britain planned a similar strategy to protect their banks; G7 Finance Ministers came out with a similar rescue plan. The global financial market was collapsing and the emerging economies began to bear the brunt. It was inevitable in the context of globalization. Mr. Deputy Chairman, what do we mean by globalization? Globalization means, by and large, expansion of business from developed to the emerging economies. In the given global context, business is all about competing with everyone from everywhere for everything. That is the nature of the process of globalization. There are 62 big companies from Brazil, Russia, China and India and they are emerging market companies. In this context, I would like to quote Dr. C. Rangarajan, the former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India. This is what he says in \"The Hindu\" of 08.11.2008 in respect of India: The crisis is no longer confined to the developed world. The heat is being felt by the developing world, including India.",

    "text": "The impact on India can be both direct and indirect. The direct impact comes from exposure to the toxic or distressed assets by Indian banks and other financial institutions. Indian banks, in general, have very little exposure to the asset markets of the developed world. Indian banks have very few branches abroad. The indirect impact will be through trade and capital flows. Now, that was the nature of the impact of the crisis on India. The flight of foreign capital began and confidence in capital flows disappeared. Emerging economies in the world accounted for nearly three-quarter of the global growth, and this is enormous in terms of development; it can make a major contribution. Collapse of an economy would lead to social unrest. All countries experienced a deficit of more than 5 per cent of the GDP. The slow flow of capital to emerging economies would affect their economies. It would affect us as well. The curios paradox, Mr. Deputy Chairman, in the given context of this global crisis, is the need for State intervention. My good Friend, the Hon. Bimal Ratnayake referred to Nicolas Sarkozy. This is what Nicolas Sarkozy, the President of France says: Self-regulation is finished. No country can indulge in self-regulation any more. Laissez-faire is finished. This is what President Sarkozy said referring to the nature of the crisis; referring to the magnitude of the crisis. All these things meant that a larger role of the state is necessary. Hon. K.N. Choksy, if you want to bail out the economy, State intervention is fundamental and necessary. It was in this grim economic scenario that the Government has introduced this Budget, which in my view, contains a number of development-oriented proposals. The Budget is some kind of an economic development plan for a particular year; it is also a financial plan for a year. Budget-making is a special kind of exercise. It is not easy to frame a Budget. His Excellency the President in presenting the Budget and the Budgetary Proposals incorporated in the Budget, referred to the need to establish both peace and stability in the country. He, in fact stated that we have reached a decisive juncture in our journey towards peace and development. Peace and development cannot be achieved without defeating terrorism in this country. At the same time, the need for a negotiated political settlement has been stressed. Sri Lanka, despite all constraints, both local and international, has been successful in maintaining an annual growth rate of 6.8 per cent compared to 7.7 per cent in 2006. Unemployment rate has been reduced to 6 per cent. Poverty rate has been reduced from 22.7 per cent in 2002 to 15.6 per cent in 2006. These are no mean achievements for a small country like that of ours, Mr. Deputy Chairman. We have achieved all these while the international economic environment remained hostile. The Budget deficit has been reduced to 7.7 per cent, and the annual rate of inflation is 13.7 per cent in 2006. It increased because of the higher food prices. All of us, all countries, both developed and undeveloped, experienced a major food crisis a couple of months back.",

    "text": "It is in this context that we need to look at the agricultural development of this country. In the 21st Century, agriculture is the fundamental instrument for sustainable development and poverty reduction. Nearly 880 million people, Mr. Deputy Chairman, depend on agriculture for their livelihood and they earn less than a dollar a day. Therefore, the development of agriculture is vitally necessary to realize the Millennium Development Goals. The importance of agriculture has been recognized in the Budget, it has been given a place in the Budget, and several incentives have been provided to increase agricultural production. Agriculture can produce faster economic growth, bring about a reduction in poverty and guarantee a sustainable environment. Agricultural production is important for the food security of a state because it is a source of income for the majority of the rural poor in a country. Sri Lanka has a land area of 16 million acres out of which Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, three million acres have been devoted to the cultivation of the four main crops, tea, rubber, coconut and paddy. The cultivated area is nearly 30 per cent of the total land area. There are various differentiations within the agricultural sector. There are 3.3 million smallholdings in the country; ours is largely a smallholding rural economy. There are 3.3 million smallholdings in the country out of which 1.5 million are in the category of less than 40 perches of land. They are home-gardens which needs to be developed to grow more food, people need to be encouraged to grow more food in their own home gardens. The rest is 1.8 million which is more than 40 perches of land. I mean, this is the picture relating to our land resources. Such smallholdings need to be developed to grow more food. According to the present policy of the Government this has been targeted. This is a targeted group with a \"Grow More Food\" campaign of the Minister of Agriculture, the Hon. Maithripala Sirirsena. In order to promote agricultural production, several measures have been introduced to discourage the consumption of wheat flour. Measures have been proposed to maximize the production of local food grains like kurakkan and things of that sort. Incentives have been provided to encourage dairy production and milking cows are to be imported about which proposal my Friend, the Hon. Bimal Ratnayake took a very critical view. Rupees 900 million have been allocated for the milk subsidy to small children. That also will encourage production of milk. The imposition of Cess on various items would provide incentives to local farmers, fruits and vegetable growers primarily. Agricultural research is vital at this stage for the development of the country. Universities have been encouraged to undertake agricultural research. Research and development in agriculture - R & D in agriculture, has tripled in China and India in the last 20 years. India and China have spent more money on agricultural research, on both research and development. This Budget has allocated Rs.300 million for scientific research and agriculture is included. I welcome that. The universities need to be provided with more research funds in order to",

People must learn to work to increase production. We can create wealth only by working hard and this is very true of agriculture and industry. I would like to focus your attention, Sir, on the need to develop a knowledge economy. Today, knowledge is a key factor in development. Today all developing economies are knowledge-based.

    "text": "Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem Venerable Presiding Member, I would say this Budget is the most disingenuous, deceptive and a dishonest attempt at hoodwinking the people of this country. Having had a look at the proposals and the way in which the Government is attempting to raise the necessary funds to meet the enormous deficit of Rs. 339 billion, we must concede that this Budget is basically a budget which has been designed to continue the war effort that this Government has begun in 2006. Year by year the military expenditure is increasing and in what type of global scenario are we attempting to bridge this enormous deficit of Rs. 339 billion? It is at a time when we are faced with the worst economic recession ever since the Great Depression? At a time such as this, we must bear in mind that the common methods of meeting the deficit is threefold. One is to sell your national assets. The other is to go in for domestic borrowing. The next ultimate objective would be to go in for foreign borrowing. Why I call this a very disingenuous Budget is for the reason that against all prudent advice, this administration embarked on a short-term borrowing for a long-term development. The prudence of this type of borrowing was challenged by many financial experts, but the Government paid scant disregard to all those warnings and went in for short-term commercial borrowing which",

    "text": "I would say, even a normal petti kade mudalali would think twice before going in to borrow for long-term investment at a short-term commercial rate such as we have been borrowing in the recent past. Now, if we are going to fund it by domestic borrowing, the interest rates will inevitably go up and it is expected that the interest rates would go up to about 25 per cent which is an increase of 3 to 4 per cent. And, if you are to go in for foreign borrowing because of the threat of interest rates going up, that tool will be quite difficult given the current global economic meltdown. Today, I browsed through the internet and found in the website of Bloomberg an article by a very reputed international rating agency, Standard and Poors, where there is an alarming reference to Sri Lanka. It states, I quote: Sri Lanka . most at risk of a credit-rating downgrade as the global economy heads into a recession and funds become scarcer, said Standard & Poors. It further goes on to state, I quote: Foreign investors are exiting Asias emerging markets as they seek less-risky returns amid the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Thats making it more difficult for the nations in the region to pay for imports and is shrinking their foreign reserves. It is common knowledge that the Central Bank had been dipping into our foreign reserves in order to keep our exchange rates somewhat stable. Within the last three to four months, we have spent almost US Dollars 500 million of our reserves. It is said that almost 33 per cent of our foreign reserves have been utilized in order to keep our exchange rates somewhat stable. If it is to be realistic, our dollar rate today should be in the region of Rs. 130 to Rs. 140. On top of it, today our export markets are facing the recession and therefore tea and rubber prices are plummeting. Ultimately, the Government is now giving it a different garb in the guise of asking people to increase domestic production saying that they are going in for import substitution. In fact, they are trying to cover up their folly of mismanaging the economy from the very outset. Today information regarding the battlefront is heavily controlled and that is a fact that everybody admits. It is said that the first casualty in the war is truth and the manner how casualty figures are being massaged in order to keep this euphoria of imminent victory alive among the people has resulted in the masses by and large being prepared to put up with any burden in the expectation that they are going to succeed in the war. But what we see is that the goalpost is being shifted everyday. The capture of Kilinochchi is now being diverted to the capture of Pooneryn and subsequently it might be shifted to elsewhere. But whatever it may be, if the common man is to put up with all these burdens, there must be some sense of sharing the sacrifices. Is the Government prepared to share? Are the rulers, those who hold portfolios prepared to give up some of their perks and privileges?",

Look at the colossal amount, which in my opinion are the most grotesque blunders, that the Government is making. For instance, I think today there is an Adjournment Motion on the issue of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation hedging oil. Finally, it has resulted in the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation having to pay, according to its Chairman, a hedge loss of US Dollars 27 million last month and he says that it might hit US Dollars 10 million monthly if this goes on in this fashion. Hedging to meet with rising oil prices could have been commercially adopted by a local company, but for the Government to go in for this and for the Central Bank to have advised and the Cabinet to have approved, in my opinion, is a big mistake finally ending up paying. Now, the common man has to bear all these losses. If it is not for this enormous blunder, today",

Now this is all covered in the garb of patriotism: saving the nation, protecting the nation; patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel, they say. I am not trying to belittle patriotic sentiments. You must be patriotic towards your country, but at what cost? When the rulers are enjoying everything, the common man is burdened with untold hardship. Everyday consumer prices are going up. But then, there is no effort to reduce any of the heavy expenditure that Ministers and ministries are engaging in. They are very happily travelling abroad with their families and the Government has to bear the expenditure. Now, look at the wasteful expenditure on Mihin Air - six billion rupees on a private airline, a budget airline, which is running into heavy losses. Today, the airline industry in India is merging with each other in order to survive. In a large market like India, various domestic airlines cannot survive and at a time like this you are going and dumping six billion rupees. Now there are various important ministries which have hardly any allocation. The Hon. Mahinda Wijesekara is there - I have held this Ministry. If this six billion rupees had been given to him, he would have done some productive work in the postal sector. But this is totally being wasted on a fruitless exercise just to keep the egos of certain people massaged. If we have at least some change in policy in trying to meet the deficit, we could appreciate. But what is happening is that there is no other option but to go in for foreign borrowing. But, is foreign borrowing going to be available in this climate? Now we are faced with, as I told you, a downgrade of credit rate which is an imminent threat for Sri Lanka. Funding difficulties are the biggest threat to Sri Lankas rating. Standard & Poor's says that it rates Sri Lankas long-term foreign currency debt at B plus with a negative outlook. Sri Lanka is facing funding concerns with rising short-term",

I must say that is the worst fallacy. Today, the Muslims are realizing that in the divided East they face the same problems, the same security threat and the same issues pertaining to their livelihood. Today, the Government is talking about a duty of almost Rs. 25 a kilo on paddy imports in order to protect the local farmer. But, after having freed the East from the terrorists, as they say, the situation has not enabled the Muslims to go and cultivate the several thousands of acres of land belonging to them. What about Vanni? Vast stacks of land have been emancipated from the LTTE. How many thousands of acres could be cultivated? Even during peace times it was not possible because there were issues of demining and that which had to be settled with those who have encroached on those lands. So, those matters have been totally overlooked. A simplistic approach cannot be adopted to solve this problem, forgetting that there is a Muslim dimension to the North-East problem. Therefore, simply by saying that the TNA should attend the All Party Conference and everything will be hunky-dory, it is not going to happen. The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana was here for a short while. I wish he was here. I was to ask him as to what the President meant by \"solving the problem within an undivided Sri Lanka\". A sudden terminology has emerged after the visit to Delhi. This terminology never existed in the vocabulary of the UPFA until this particular interview was given to The Hindu newspaper. Therefore, do not forget that a political solution is the only way out and this war against terrorism, as they say, will not bring in the expected results. The issue of separatism cannot be defeated until and unless you are prepared to devolve power. Now they are talking about demilitarization, democratization and development.

Choksy) Venerable Presiding Member, it gives me much pleasure to address this House whilst you occupy the Chair. Sir, I intend discussing the main or salient features of the Budget. Having presented three Budgets as Minister of Finance, I am conscious of the fact that the preparation of a Budget in a developing nation, which is subject to adverse international fiscal trends such as the prices of oil and flour, presents tight-rope walking for its Finance Minister. And, yet we cannot allow ourselves to be swamped. The challenges have to be faced and met as best as we could. Let us therefore examine the main features of the Budget to see whether these are correctly positioned. Firstly, I observe that the Budget refers to almost every sector of the economy. But, it presents no clear overall plan or strategy of economic development. A home-grown policy interspersed with basic international requirements is well and good. But it must lay down a clear path along which development could be channelled. This is wholly missing in the Budget. Secondly, certain sensitive issues present in our economy and which have got aggravated from year to year have not been addressed in this Budget. They are,",

    "text": "rising inflation which presently stands at 22 per cent, the high cost of living, the increase in interest rates and the sharp decline of the rupee as against the other international currencies. The Rupee presently stands at Rs.109.50 against the US Dollar. This is indeed a very high figure for a developing country. The above are unfavourable tendencies in any economy, and particularly in a country such as ours, which imports almost 70 per cent of its requirements. Cumulatively, these features will drain our national wealth and retard economic progress. The question arises as to how the Government intends arresting each of the above features. The Parliament and the country at large must be told this through the Budget. But the Budget remains silent. The Fiscal Management Responsibility Act which was enacted by the UNP in 2003 sets the parameters for the development of the economy. Every government is called upon to meet these targets. The Act stipulates that the Budget deficit at the end of 2006 should not exceed 5 per cent of GDP. But, our deficit is still 6.5 per cent. The Minister of Finance has pointed out, not without justification, that the sudden and sharp increase in world oil prices earlier in the year adversely affected the countrys economic indices. Timely planning and action could have considerably reduced this. The increase in world oil prices also took place during the regime led by the UNP. But with planning, we immediately introduced an automatic price adjustment mechanism, whereby we increased the cost of fuel to the consumer when world prices went up, and gave the consumer the benefit of reduced prices when costs decreased. This formula reduced the burden both on the State and on the consumer. Former President Chandrika Kumaratunga however abandoned this beneficial scheme when the Peoples Alliance formed the Government in 2004. It has since not been replaced by the Government resulting in the adverse results on the revenue referred to by the Minister. It has also placed adverse burdens on the people both in regard to the cost of transport and particularly the cost of living. The Budget also refers to the fertilizer subsidy costs and Samurdhi payments. None can grudge governmental assistance to the needy, but is this alone adequate in the long run? Should not parallel steps be taken to systematically reduce poverty and make the people more self-dependent? Take for example our rural youth. Schemes should be put in place to train them to be more self-reliant and self-productive. The demand for services such as of motor mechanics, electricians, repairs to and maintenance of agricultural and electronic equipment, have considerably increased in the rural areas. Why not commence training schemes to enable rural youth to",

In this manner, they enter the stream of productivity and self-reliance. The continuous granting of subsidies and doles will not end or reduce poverty. On the other hand, training people to earn a livelihood of their own will progressively reduce poverty and their dependence on the State. We must introduce innovative measures to expand the economy and the revenue it generates. The current position is that of an economy that is contracting and not expanding. The Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act fixes the ceiling of governmental borrowings. It stipulates that at the end of the financial year commencing on 1st January, 2006, the total liabilities of the Government, including its external debts at the current exchange rates, should not exceed eighty five per cent of the estimated Gross Domestic Product for that financial year. The Government has commenced external borrowings in US Dollars. The danger with which this is beset is that the Rupee has depreciated considerably as against the US Dollar. When the United National Front relinquished office in April 2004, the Dollar stood at Rs. 94.00 Today, it has spiralled to Rs. 109.50. If this trend of the reducing value of our currency continues, the Governments debt will increase to an unaffordable level when it comes to repayment of such borrowings. This is another reason why I said earlier, the Government will have to introduce measures to increase revenue by providing incentives for growth of private sector productivity. But the present Budget provides none. The country is faced with a situation where the Governments outgoings far exceed the revenue generated, leading to a greater reduction of the national wealth. Venerable Sir, looking back over the past 60 years of political independence, it cannot be said that the countrys economy and productivity or the quality of the peoples lives, particularly in the rural areas, has substantially improved. To my mind, the growth of the economy and the end to the ongoing war in the North are matters that have to be handled on a national basis, by cooperation and coordination between the major political parties. Our present system of political parties competing for power and the party system we follow in Parliament are not beneficial to our nation. This system is known as the adversary system and has led to nothing but destructive criticism between the Government and the Opposition. We might well think along the lines of establishing an Economic Council representative of all parties in Parliament. This might be worthwhile of consideration so that the economic development of the country becomes the responsibility both of the Government and of the Opposition, Parliament as a whole, and in this situation there is a greater opportunity, a greater chance for the development of our economy and for the increase in the quality of the lives of the people, particularly people who, in the rural areas, have contributed considerably to the economy of the country by maintaining the agriculture,",

This is how our leaders must act before our country could face a similar situation in the future. We must all get together and ensure that a similar situation does not arise. The Opposition should come forward to support these valid proposals and not criticize for the sake of criticizing in order to gain some political advantage. More important than the Budget Proposals to which I will come next, is the Presidents forceful endeavour to instil confidence into a nation of multiethnic composition which deserves the appreciation of all those who love peace. He demonstrated his conviction by speaking in Tamil as well. He said, I am aware of all the expectations of Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Malays and Burghers being children of one Mother Lanka. These expectations can be made a reality. I possess that confidence. I will certainly fulfil that. Let us love challenges. Let us march together towards a better future for Mother Lanka. This is an important message clearly and loudly stated by His Excellency the President. I wish to applaud him for these concluding remarks giving confidence to the people of this country. He has been very successful in boldly facing up to the challenges of the time and standing up as President of the people of Sri Lanka. All of us must appreciate that in Budget-preparing , one should take into consideration the impact of todays global economic crisis and the food crisis and carefully craft into it stringent protective measures against such impacts. His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa should be lauded for taking care to include elements of protectionism and ensuring that everybody gets something. He, in his endeavour to build a self-reliant economy, has laid a strong foundation for an economy that can withstand any global recession and other economic upheavals. All these have been achieved while providing necessary allocations for various development programmes, welfare programmes as well as relief measures to the people. This has been done despite extremely trying circumstances and adversities created by forces beyond our control posing many challenges. On the one hand, the Government has been compelled to continue to battle with the armed groups in the North, while on the other, is seeking a just and honourable solution to the baffling ethnic problem of the country. As a result of this, a high expenditure on security becomes inevitable and as you see, the defence expenditure has reached an all-time high record of Rs.200 billion. There are economic imperatives such as defence, education, health and infrastructure improvements which demand substantial allocation in the Budget. There is no way to reduce this expenditure unless you impose a cut on",

However, we must be satisfied that His Excellency the President has made the required allocations to the imperatives and for the development programmes of the country. Rupees 29,935 million has been allocated for \"Gama Neguma\", a consolidated development programme to improve rural roads, electricity schemes, drinking water schemes and self-employment projects and to upgrade the living standards of the people. These imperatives did not prevent him from providing relief to the people who suffer from the impacts of the high cost of living. A price reduction of Rs.30 per litre on diesel, Rs.15 per litre on petrol and Rs.20 per litre on kerosene has been effected and this is bound to benefit the people to a very large extent. I hope the benefit of this price reduction would be passed on to the travelling public by the transport sectors. Also, a monthly discount of Rs.30 on electricity for consumption of less than 90 units and a discount of Rs.20 on water for consumption of less than 15 units would benefit a large number of ordinary households. It is true that the people are still confronted with the ever-increasing cost of living. But the Budget has spelled out several reliefs to cushion the impact of the high cost of living. Reduction of VAT from 15 to 12 per cent, increase of the Cost of Living Allowance to public servants by Rs.1,000 and to pensioners by Rs.560 are bound to give some relief. One of the reasons for the high cost of living has been our dependence on imported items of food and goods for our living. Despite increased food production since 2006, our country still spends about US Dollars 800 million to import food items. This amounts to 73 per cent of the export revenue earned by Sri Lanka on export of plantation crops. This money could have been saved and our food security can be guaranteed by giving incentives to our farmers. The imposition of a cess on import of food items will encourage the local producers and the Governments programme like Api Wawamu Rata Nagamu which was launched under the \"Mahinda Chintana\" could boost the food production. As promised in the \"Mahinda Chintana\", action has been taken by the Budget to heed to the request of local producers and industrialists to encourage local production towards building a strong economy. This has been done by imposing a cess on selected items of imported food and goods in order to place a discouraging effect on its use. We can be satisfied that the main focus of this Budget has been on strengthening the national economy against any possible impact of the global economic crisis as well as the food crisis, while at the same time, making the country move forward to the status of a developed country. I am proud that His Excellency the President came to this House to deliver the Budget Speech in a",

It is an indicator of the correct policy of the Government and its sincere commitment to achieve the goals of development. Already, work relating to several mega projects, such as the expansion of the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery, Hambantota Port, Weerawila Airport, Norochcholai Coal Power Project, Upper-Kotmale Hydropower Project, Moragahakanda and Kalu-Ganga Reservoirs Projects, the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway and the Southern Express Highway, is under progress. Road development projects which were ignored for several decades have been undertaken under \"Maga Neguma\" and many village roads have already been concreted. Once the modernization project of the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery is completed , we will have the capacity to refine our total requirement of oil. These are projects that should have been launched by past governments. Unfortunately, they have failed and no one visualized todays situation in their foresight. It would be a grave mistake and a lapse on our part if we also leave it for the next generation or for the next government or for any other government in the future. The future generation is sure to curse us for this lapse. We must somehow find the necessary money. One of the ways is to impose taxes without pushing the people into hardship. Another way is through grants and loans from our friendly countries. Within the last three years we were successful in increasing foreign aid up to US Dollars 1,000 million towards development activities. We must be grateful to the President of Iran for the gracious offer and help given to Sri Lanka to supply oil on a credit basis for four months free of interest and for another three months on minimal interest. Which country will give us such benefits? This is all due to the fruitful friendship built between the President of Iran and our President. I am shocked to hear the Hon. John Amaratunga making an allegation that we have signed the contract with Iran to buy oil at US Dollars 137 a barrel when the market price is US Dollars 67 a barrel and that somebody is getting a commission. The Agreement entered into with Iran is only to get credit facilities and not to buy oil. Fuel is purchased at the prevailing market price. We are no fools to buy oil at US Dollars 137 a barrel when the market price is US Dollars 67. Hon. Deputy Speaker, I table* before this House the relevant invoice relating to the purchase of oil at US Dollars 67 a barrel. With regard to the allegation that somebody is getting a commission, I am afraid that the Hon. Member may have spoken with his own experience for which, I do not want to say anything.

Deputy Speaker, I know the Opposition has been very critical, saying all kinds of things about the Government raising loans. However, they should appreciate that all loans raised have been for investment that would generate assets manifold the amount of loan. This is a Budget that satisfies all sectors and objectively in line with the \"Mahinda Chintana\" which means total concern for the welfare of the masses. It lays the foundation for the implementation of programmes towards building a new Sri Lanka with rapid socio-economic development. It is a good beginning to reshape the economic policy of the country and to boost the growth. That is the mandate that the people gave President Mahinda Rajapaksa and reiterated at subsequent elections. The incentives given in the Budget to agriculture, dairy farming and national industries are sure to give a boost to the economy of the nation. The fertilizer given to the farmer has been 96 per cent subsidized. What costs Rs. 6,000 for a 50 kilogram bag of fertilizer has been continued to be sold at Rs. 350.",

Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I thank you for giving me this opportunity to move the following Adjournment Motion on the hedging of oil prices in Sri Lanka: I move, The prices of crude oil has been falling dramatically in the last two months in the world market. However, this benefit is not passed over to the Sri Lankan consumers. This is a Government which came into power stating that even if the world prices go up they will not increase prices. They have told untruth to the people. Such a situation has arisen owing to the fact that the Government has incompetently handled the macroeconomy of the country and the finances of the people coupled and ably assisted with the following facts: A) Hedging the oil prices without professional knowledge and not capping on the downward pricing trend even though there is a cap on the rise. Furthermore, getting a bad name by not paying Standard Chartered Bank and the Citibank. B) High interest cost for debts that are outstanding towards the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation which is around Rs. 57,000 million as at October 2008.",

D) Owing to lack of funds, borrowing from Iran and carrying an unbearable debt owing to high financial costs. E) Special levy of Rs. 72 per litre on petrol and Rs. 17 per litre on diesel being imposed. Therefore, please table the Cabinet approved Hedging Agreement and how much outstanding and due to Iran as at today. Also advise whether such debts are taken into the countrys total debt and if so, how much it is against GDP. Furthermore, also advise the total debtors with names and a statement with all the taxes from the point of import to selling, coupled with production costs, with selling margins for petrol, diesel, furnace oil and kerosene oil. The 62nd Budget was presented by the President of this country. He came to this House and said that he intends reducing the burden of the people and with much expectation it was only a hoax when he reduced Rs. 15 on petrol. Mr. Deputy Speaker, by reducing Rs.15 from Rs. 157, he did a clerical job in this Parliament. It is not the job of a President to come to this House and reduce petrol price. Did he come here, Hon. Minister, to increase the petrol price? But, my Adjournment Motion is a little more in depth than that. Today, there is a bungling of the entire economy of this country. Petrol is a very important commodity in the day-to-day life of the people. Maybe, owing to the ill-advice and amiable and generous disposition of the Hon. Fowzie, it seems that he is wrapped up with others coaxing him to do certain things. I know that the Chairman of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation also displays ability and I must say that he has co-operated on many instances in giving information which I appreciate. But, the two of them have a good brief but a bad case to defend. That is the problem. You have a Government that has 110 Ministers and you are utilizing the petrol profits to beef-up the general revenue of your Government. That is the sadness of it. Hon. Minister, I would like you to table the Hedging Contract later and I would also like if you can present the Debtors' Statement as of today and also the cost calculation from the time crude oil is brought to the port and until it is sold because it will reveal many things. And in the process, I am sure you will answer the other three questions which are there. The total debt that is owed to Iran? Now, I am made to understand through the process that almost 90 per cent of our oil is purchased from Iran. That is not the best of source to get your oil. But, owing to the precarious situation that your Government is faced with, you will run after any guy who will give you a day's credit rather than being able to buy spot-oil at a discounted price. Now, this is the problem that we are faced with, Hon. Minister. Let us see the impact of it on the country. I will basically at this particular moment, start off with a statement uttered by the the Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, Minister of State Revenue and Finance and Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning. He states in an interview published in the \"Irudina\" of 9th November, 2008, I quote:",

    "text": "\" . . . 7500/- . . . . \" You came into power with acolytes like the breakaways of the JVP who said that even if the world oil prices go up, they will not increase the prices. Now, the prices have come down and we are asking the same jokers as to why the prices have not been reduced? Now you are faced with the embarrassing situation of defending the Government and giving us an acceptable answer as to how you are going to dabble with these types of things. So, on that basis I would basically like to say that it is not only the ministers or the elite society who use petrol, but the innocent trishaw drivers, the fishing folk who go for fishing in the night and the people who do self-employment. The CEB is also bent on certain activities brought about due to the fuel adjustment factor and everybody is basically caught up with the petrol price. On the same score, I would like to state in this house the prices prevailing in the neighbouring countries as of today. In China, petrol is sold at Rs. 95 a litre; in Indonesia it is Rs. 70 a litre; in Pakistan it is Rs. 100 a litre; in Thailand it is Rs. 82 a litre; in Vietnam it is Rs. 85 a litre; in Malaysia it is Rs. 71 a litre and in Maldives, which is landlocked and has to come in barges and sometimes go from Sri Lanka, it is Rs. 89 a litre. Mr. Deputy Speaker, I gave these figures in order to show the huge gap that is there in comparison to the countries that we are competing with and in Sri Lanka it is Rs. 142 a litre. Now, remember every person does not use fuel in this country. Whether it is petrol, diesel, kerosene oil or furnace oil, only about 52 percent of the population use it. So, 48 per cent do not use any fuel and they have to pay for the sins of others. Likewise, only 48 per cent of people use electricity. So, sometimes when there is a fuel adjustment factor and you have been lending fuel to CEB and when they default, you are basically making somebody to pay for the sin of others. Now, if somebody goes to Supreme Court and says, My fundamental rights are infringed for the simple reason that I never use electricity, I never use petrol but I have got to carry the burden of somebody else, then you are in trouble. Now, Hon. Minister, I am particularly intrigued at certain statements that have been uttered by your officials. They say that the debt factor is one of the contributory factors in the pricing. Who determines that? Is it the Minister, the Chairman or the officials? But you have been kept in the dark and the others are taking decisions on your behalf. You are an efficient Minister; you are an amiable Minister but I do not understand as to why you have sometimes got to take advice from others.",

    "text": "So, giving that credit to you, let me look at the debit side as well. If that is the case, who gave authority to give credit to these people? Now, you say Rs. 42 billion is due from the CEB to the Petroleum Corporation. Then, you say from the armed forces. Now you vote funds to the armed forces from Parliament - Rs. 177 billion - to pay for those petrol bills. Are you saying that the armed forces while basically getting Rs. 177 billion for the war also owes another Rupees seven billion which means, Rs. 184 billion. Tell the truth to this House because the Government is basically showing rhetorically through the media everyday that capturing of areas is going on. There must be a dividend that has to be received for this type of activity. So, if you are basically saying Rupees seven billion is due, then you have got to add that to the defence expenditure of this country. You have the Police Department that owes Rupees one billion. Then you say about Mihin Air. What a calamity is this! You have voted Rs. 3,200 million and it is run aground; it is bad debts. Then you have Rs. 800 million that is due and this House is going to spend another Rs. 6,000 million for Mihin Air. Remember all 225 Members in this House, for DCB only get Rs. 1.1 billion. You spend Rs. 6,000 million for Mihin Air. Remember, in this House we have basically voted for the armed forces who are in active areas, Rs. 2.5 billion but you spend Rs. 6,000 million or Rs. 6 billion for Mihin Air. Sometimes the Ministries have only Rs. 100 million but you spend Rs. 6,000 million for Mihin Air. What a colossal waste! For whose advantage are these types of things being done? Hon. Minister, the reason why I am moved this Adjournment Motion is to tell you that this country is facing this situation today due to the ill-advised decisions taken on hedging. We have seen the prices go up which I agree is in a manner that was not expected, but now the prices are coming down. Hon. Deputy Speaker, you could see the drastic drop of crude oil prices from US Dollars 147 a barrel to US Dollars 56 at this moment when we are speaking. On that score, obviously somewhere around May, you would see the trend analysis going up due to hedging. You buy 1.2 million barrels of crude oil and about 1.5 million litres of refined oil per month. We have seen the trend of it and we are made to understand that 50 per cent or one third of it seems to be hedged - [Interruption.] Okay. One third of it is being hedged. On that score, you have locked in US Dollars 136 per barrel till May, 2009. Who has advised you? Has the Cabinet approved this? On the upward trend, you have kept a profit of US Dollars 1.5 million, but on the downward trend you have not capped it. Why have you not been given that advice? We have got to carry that sin now. When the price of petrol comes down, you have to buy twice the quantity. All these are not known to us, but communicated to us. That is why we wanted a Cabinet decision in this regard. I know that you may not be involved in it but it may be thrust upon you. But unfortunately you have to carry that bad brief, Hon. Minister.",

    "text": "Leave that aside. If they are saying that Rs. 57 billion is outstanding, then there is another presumptuous statement made that there is an opportunity loss of Rs. 23 billion. You make a profit of Rs. 22 billion through refining and you lose Rs. 23 billion by reducing oil prices. So, you have a loss of Rs. 1.2 billion. But you are calculating Rs.23 billion as a national profit. How on earth is this type of calculation going to help? I am only taking the case of petrol, Hon. Minister. You refine 40 million litres of petrol per month; you have 70 million litres of kerosene, 145 million litres of diesel and 88 million litres of furnace oil. None of those are at a loss at this moment. Now, with regard to petrol, I table* a document in which the taxes imposed on petrol are stated. Those are: VAT 05 per cent, PAL 03 per cent from CIF, Excise Duty, Custom Import Duty, Surcharge 15 per cent CID, SRL 1.5 per cent, 01 per cent T.T. on imports and 01 per cent Dealers T.T. So, the total tax on petrol is Rs.71.61. For diesel it is Rs.16.12. So, at the rate of Rs.72, if a litre of petrol is multiplied by 40 million litres and then again multiplied by 12 months, you get a profit of Rs.34,560 million. That is unconscionable. Beyond that, if you deduct Rs.72 from Rs.142, you get Rs.70. Today, the price of a barrel of petrol is US Dollars 56 which when divided by 159 litres to a barrel comes to a rate of Rs.38. If you deduct Rs.38 from Rs.70 you get a profit of Rs.32. Rupees 32 multiplied by 40 million litres into 12 months brings you another profit amounting to Rs.15 billion. Hon. Minister, black-marketeering is done by your entities. It is the Petroleum Corporation and the Ceylon Electricity Board. Rupees 50 billion profit on petrol only is nothing but it is 5 per cent of the total revenue of 2009. Is this conscionably possible to be done? You have the President coming to this House. Last year he came and said, I will ensure that the VAT is reduced from 15 per cent to 5 per cent because I do not want to burden the people. This time what did he do? When he can reduce the price of a litre of petrol by Rs.70 he comes and reduces it by only Rs. 15. Who is held responsible for that? Who is held accountable for that? It is owing to the fact that you are mismanaging the economy. Now, you could see the price that you have got to pay owing to hedging, mismanagement and ill-advice. When you have profitable contracts, you go to the Standard Chartered Bank and the Citibank; when it is making losses like in Mihin Air you go to the Bank of Ceylon, and when you have a problem with paddy millers you go to the Peoples Bank. But when it is making profits you go to the foreign banks. Have the foreign banks given you the risk analysis of the downward trend? If so, has the Cabinet taken that decision? If not, who is held responsible? That is what I want to know from the Cabinet Paper. I will take it up tomorrow owing to lack of time.",

But, that charge comes in from a premium between US Dollars two to 20 cents. So, on that score, Hon. Minister, how on earth is this country going to survive? You have on one hand Rs. 3,460 billion as the total debt and on the other, a debt of Rs. 1,381 billion due from the foreign banks. You have not added to that the loan taken to purchase oil, the debt on arms which are brought into this country. So, our country is more indebted than what is being actually shown.",

    "text": ". . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I have been very carefully listening to my good Friend, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake and also to the Hon. Jayantha Wijesekara, Member for the Trincomalee District. I must say that certain facts the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake stated just now are very important and crucial and also I must thank him for giving me time to submit the connected papers within the next week. [Interruption.] Yes, what I want to tell the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake is that we have gone into this hedging on a request made by the Central Bank. I wish to explain the situation in which the Government decided to enter into the oil hedging agreement. Towards the end of the year 2006, oil prices started going up and created a huge pressure on our foreign exchange reserves. The Central Bank at this time, made a presentation to the Cabinet and advised the Government to enter into a hedging agreement in order to mitigate the impact of escalating oil prices which have a huge bearing on the foreign exchange outflow of the country. Accordingly, a Cabinet Paper was submitted and the Cabinet had given approval for the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation to enter into an oil hedging agreement using zero cost collars. As you know, you do not go to the Cabinet to get approval for every hedging that is done. But permission has been granted and in the interest of the country, we have done our best. We called for the Expression of Interest on oil hedging from the international banks as well as the State banks. It is not true to say that we did not give a chance to the State banks. We wanted the State banks to get involved in this business. The local banks did not come forward but the Standard Chartered Bank, the Citibank and Deutsche Bank came forward. The Bank of Ceylon, the Peoples Bank and the Commercial Bank did not come till very late. They have now got into this business. So, I am very happy that they are also in the business. At the very beginning, may be they did not have the mechanism to do this or may be they were worried that they would lose money and therefore did not want to come forward. That is how we had to go to the international banks. We studied their proposals and looked into them with a view to securing the best terms for the country. Before entering into the contract, the CPC had obtained",

    "text": "professional advice and related training. In order to study the mechanism and get the relevant experience, we started oil hedging in a small way - I have been telling this all the time in Parliament - and made a profit of US Dollars one million in the year 2007. In the year 2008, we gradually increased the quantity since oil prices were escalating sharply, and all of you are aware that the price went up to US Dollars 147 per barrel. Today it has crashed down to US Dollars 55 per barrel and not 56. The prediction at that time was that it will go up to US Dollars 200. Everybody was talking about it and the entire world was panicking. Sir, I will now read the details of hedge gains of the relevant months. Up to 31st August, 2008, CPC had at a hedge gain of US Dollars 24 million and the details are as follows. March (2008) US Dollars 914 million, April - US Dollars 475 million, May - US Dollars 588 million, June - US Dollars 112 million, July - US Dollars 211 million, August - US Dollars 101 million. So, the total gain was US Dollars 2,403 million. You must appreciate that. We have done a good job of work. You will never give us a bouquet for it. But, now you are giving us a brickbat. I do not mind. But you must understand that even reputed international researchers such as Goldman Sachs and EIA have failed to forecast the unprecedented downward trend in oil prices. Nobody expected that. I am sure you also never expected that it will come down below US Dollars 80 or anything like that.",

The forecast WTI price in December is US Dollars 147 per barrel. Due to the global economic recession oil prices crashed suddenly in the months of September, October and November which nobody expected, anticipated or thought of it. Unbearable high oil price has created a huge pressure on our foreign exchange reserves and the profitability of CPC, since we maintained the most reasonable domestic fuel prices irrespective of the actual cost price. We have hedged only 35 per cent of the requirement and the balance 65 per cent is kept unhedged. Since low oil prices are beneficial to the country and to the corporation in the long run, the downward pricing trend has not been capped, especially due to certain reasons. I hope the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake will listen to me now because I am going to explain why we did not cap. It is because the more it comes down, the more the country will benefit since Dollars are not sent outside the country. What we were purchasing at US Dollars 147 will be purchased this month at US Dollars 55 or 52. That will be the average price.",

    "text": "So, if the CPC wants to establish a bottom line capped, then a portion of the protection of upward pricing movement has to be sacrificed. I hope you are listening to me, Hon. Ravi Karunanayake. The CPC always prefers downward pricing trends, since 65 per cent of its purchases has been unhedged. The CPC expected the lowest price of oil to be US Dollars 85 per barrel. It was permitted only to protect the upward pricing movements by the Cabinet. Hence many hedge providers are not comfortable to suggest capping downward price movements. The CPC has not defaulted the banks; neither the Standard Chartered Bank, the Commercial Bank nor the Citibank. We have paid everything that we had to pay. The price of oil crashed during the month of October and the monthly average prices dropped very badly beyond expectation. This is an unpredictable and unknown phenomena. In this situation, the CPC had to pay hedge losses amounting to US Dollars nine million. Hedge gains during the first nine months of this year have helped the CPC to manage its operation at a somewhat reasonable level despite the all-time high international oil prices that prevailed during the period while maintaining the most affordable domestic fuel prices. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, why does the Government not withdraw taxes that are put on LIOC, Rs.72 on petrol and Rs. 17 on diesel? If that is done, immediately your problem is solved. If you are conscious of the burden that the people are undergoing - . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) No. It is wrong to say that there is a tax of Rs. 72. It is not so. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)",
