That is why we have always been telling the world at large without hiding facts that we have to call a terrorist, a terrorist. This is what our foreign policy is all about; it is to clear the way for democracy. Sri Lanka is one of the countries which is being considered as the most democratic in the whole world. Ours is a country where there is rule of law; ours is a country where people have the franchise and at the same time, they enjoy the regularity of elections. In terms of the results, you will concede the fact that there had not been a single election that had been contested and won by the Opposition recently. That is the truth. The reason being that we have maintained the highest level of de-cency, decorum and honesty in the pursuit of our goals, particularly in the pursuit of the democratic agenda. That is why today we are battling against the world when our country is not getting recognized in those ways and it is our responsibility to tell the nation as much as the interna-tional community how we are looking at these matters.

    "text": "( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Not only Chief Minister Karunanidhi, we are also inviting Chief Minister Modi and every politician of India to visit Sri Lanka. What is wrong in that? Karunanidhi is a democratic politician; he is not a terrorist. That is how we are looking at it; that is our engagement. This country is an open country for everybody to visit and ascertain the situation. That is why we have been able to register the highest number of State visits to Sri Lanka recently, 10 in all. Where did you find this type of figures in the past? The last State visit to Sri Lanka was in 2003. Since then, there were no State visits till 2008. When we stated that the country was ready for State visits, there was so much of sarcasm and cynicism from the Opposition under mining our efforts. But, the year 2008 proved totally that Sri Lanka is a country, a destination, which is at the highest level of diplomacy and political and international engagement. That is how we are looking at it. Sir, I must state how we have been able to position ourselves. It is my duty to explain to the House about the budgetary allocations that have been made to us because some of the Hon. Members will speak after me. We have got a substantial budget allocation and we want to bring the highest return on investments for the country made with the monies that have been allocated to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We are very conscious about that. Today we are proud to state in the House, with great responsibility, that we did not expend all that was allocated under the Supplementary Estimate on the SAARC Summit. These are the true figures that we bring out because it is our responsibility to be accountable for all the funds that get allocated from this House to run the respective ministry. In Foreign Ministry engagements worldwide, though it costs us a lot, we still maintain a modest approach. With greater discipline in terms of financial management, we have been able to bring about a greater degree of work relating to Sri Lankas interests. The Hon.

We are still left with substantial amounts to be spent from our allocations. The Foreign Ministry has still got over a billion rupees in its hands and that itself shows the financial discipline with which we have conducted its affairs and the financial administration that was there in the year 2008. With regard to the investment that I spoke of, in terms of funds being invested in the Foreign Service in several countries worldwide, not only in the countries that we have our Missions, but even at the multilateral stage, we have made the highest visibility for the country in the year 2008. When my learned Friend was in the Foreign Ministry as the Deputy Minister, you were not a part of many international fora. There was no ACD; there was no ARF; the BIMSTEC never met at that time and SAARC never came to Sri Lanka for the last 10 years. The Commonwealth, the CMAG - where Sri Lanka has got a Chair - was never available at that time. Even our engagement with the European Union began to be closer from 2005 onwards and that is how we have been able to position ourselves. Our President has had the opportunity of meeting the world leaders. How did that happen? Some were saying that we cannot reach out to the West. But, we have met several leaders including Gordon Brown, the Prime Minister of United Kingdom, in the year 2008, not once but twice. That itself shows the close relationship that we have been maintaining. Very soon, we will be undertaking a State visit to Turkey. Whereto were the State visits previously? Why are we getting registered so much worldwide? On several occasions we had the opportunity, at the level of our President himself, to address the United Nations. Once it was on the first day itself. On the second occasion, he was the first speaker on the second day. Now, that is the rating we maintain today in the international fora. When it comes to the Eastern bloc - I am referring to East Asia - our international funding and the assistance coming from Japan has got enhanced by over 25 per cent from 2007 to 2008. Mega developments are taking place with the allocations that have been given by the Chinese Government to Sri Lanka. Then, coming on to India, our political and close engagements with India, in every respect has proved to be strong in spite of the many concerns that were expressed by the Opposition, which I am unable to refer to here. Today, we are maintaining the closest relationship with India, with over eight meetings with the Indian leadership and the Indian Foreign Minister with myself and our Presidents close engagements with the Indian leadership.

We have to battle it out in order to place the country in the correct position and to undo the damage caused by the Ceasefire Agreement. You mentioned how we are going to approach our political road map. You may recall the time that we annulled the CFA, on the 3rd of January 2008. I maintained in the Cabinet the need for us to accelerate the political process. That is how we looked at it. On the 23rd of January, 2008, the APRC proposals were submitted by the Chairman of the APRC, the Hon.(Prof.) Tissa Vitharana to the Cabinet for its consideration. That is why today we can see the Eastern Provincial Council functioning. An election was held. Thereafter, a Chief Minister was elected from the Tamil community who was an ex-child soldier himself. Today, the administration there is in the hands of the people of the Eastern Province. Was it possible in the past? We were trying to negotiate with the LTTE. Where did our negations with the LTTE take us ? I, myself took part in the negotiations in Geneva with the LTTE on two occasions. You were not there, Hon. Member. But we were there, talking to Thamilselvan, Balasingham and the rest of the crowd. But what happened? They started killing our people. Therefore, this is how we have to respond to terrorism; the way terrorism deserves to be dealt with. That is why our armed forces are today engaged in this conflict through which we command success. I would have been happy today if I could have heard from my learned Friend in the Opposition an endorsement of the Government efforts in countering terrorism. When we talk about the success and victories that our armed forces are achieving in the North, it is only those who are part of the LTTE or those who are sympathetic towards the LTTE who could be silent. We do not believe in a military solution. Our President has repeatedly stated to the nation and to the international community that political issues will only be solved through political measures. That process is very much on. You wanted to know what type of a political solution we have in hand. The Constitution of Sri Lanka clearly answers that question. The Thirteenth Amendment is part of the Constitution of our country and all of us have taken the Oath of Allegiance to that Constitution. The provisions incorporating the solution is already found in the Thirteenth Amendment that has been included in the Constitution of Sri Lanka. Our Governments mandate is to fully implement it through our devolution proposals. That is how we are going to look at it. We do not need a two-thirds majority for that. We need a consensus and we",

    "text": "need that consensus also from the Opposition as well. That is why our President has repeatedly invited the United National Party as well as the TNA to be part of that process so that we could register a lasting solution to this issue that has confronted Sri Lanka. We are looking at a very progressive agenda for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Our Foreign Service has done a great service in maintaining the highest standards and also fully engaged in working against a lot of challenges. The contemporary challenges are the most difficult at times to handle. The reason being that there is an economic downturn in the world; there is so much of divide taking place in the world and also there is so much of anti-Sri Lankan propaganda that has found its way across to the international community. We have to take all that on board. As much as our Foreign Service has been responsible to assist and virtually promote Sri Lankas interest in the world, in terms of the economic agenda too we have made significant strides in bringing a lot of assistance from the international community to our country. When it comes to humanitarian assistance, it is the Foreign Service and it is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that are at the core in terms of connecting up resources, mobilization and delivery to Sri Lanka. Not only that, we have to see to it that it reaches the deserving people. Particularly today in the Wanni, through the UN and other agencies we have to report and we also have to supervise to some extent to see that everyone who deserves gets this assistance, coming from the international community to Sri Lanka. We are also engaged in our consular responsibility. I must compliment my Deputy Minister, the Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila, for the efforts, initiatives and supervision he extends to that division in seeing that the interests of people living and working abroad, particularly in the Middle East, are being taken care of, along with the Ministries of my Colleagues, the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella and the Hon. Athauda Seneviratne. It is one of the core responsibilities of our Foreign Service. It is in that context, I would like to measure what we have been able to achieve for the people living abroad too. Only yesterday, I dispensed around Rs. 13 million as instant compensation payment, for the first time, to those who are finding their way back to Sri Lanka. This year alone, we have disbursed Rs. 93 million; that is Rs. 930 lakhs to the people of Sri Lanka, as compensation. I must also appreciate the efforts of my Missions in the Middle East towards making that possible and to have taken care of over a million people of Sri Lankan origin and the Sri Lankan citizens living abroad. At the same time, our Missions in all parts of the world today are working according to an accelerated agenda. I am sure some of you may wish to speak about the Labour GSP Plus situation and the European Union. Our position has been clearly maintained and we have stated in the most explanatory manner to the world at large, that we are not prepared to subject Sri Lanka to an",

    "text": "investigation that undermines Sri Lankas sovereignty but we are prepared for a dialogue because we strongly believe that we have responded in terms of all the covenants that the EU seeks from us and that we are a part of it. This is Labour GSP Plus and we do not want a political dimension in our trade relationship with the European Union. In that context, we are also valuing our continuous engagements with all the countries in the European Union and we have had close dialogues at the bilateral level and we are also seeking a close engagement with the European Union and the European Commission. That is how we have positioned ourselves. When it comes to issues that concern Sri Lankas economy, it is our assistance in some quarters that has been able to strengthen the current level of the economic well-being of our society and that of our country. I can spell out a series of areas where the contribution of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has assisted Sri Lankas economy, Sri Lankas infrastructure, Sri Lankas foreign relations and in addition to that the well-being of Sri Lankans living abroad. Therefore, I wish to place on record, Mr. Chairman, that the contribution that comes from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs cannot be measured in terms of monetary gains only because the positioning of Sri Lanka by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been done in the most systematic and beneficial manner to minimize or avoid the damage caused when addressing issues confronting us in Sri Lanka. From that angle, I must compliment the Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, his entire staff and the Heads of Missions, our High Commissioners and Ambassadors and all the other staff in the Missions for the services they have rendered to Sri Lanka through our Foreign Service and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. , . 2005 . , . , . . . , , .",

Therefore, it is necessary to maintain its maturity and dignity. In fact, once you go through the Progress Report of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or considering the financial investments for the year 2009, it is doubtful whether our Foreign Ministry is actually focused on long-term and short-term goals or proper missions to achieve them. For example, the capital expenditure for the year 2008 was Rs. 1.4 billion and 90 per cent of that is spent on purchasing buildings or their maintenance and repairs. The total amount spent on upgrading and development was Rs. 431 million. For capital assets, it is Rs.566 million and it is the same for the year 2009. Under that, it is proposed to allocate a sum of Rs.450 million for the development of High Commissions in Canada and Britain.

    "text": "Rs.79 million. Other capital expenditure would be Rs.127 million and according to us, only realistically important capital expenditure is for delimitation of continental margins - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Presiding Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Dunesh Gankanda) The weakness of capital investments could be highlighted in comparison to the proportionate figure of Rs.1.2 million which was allocated for capacity building last year. There is no such investment proposed for this year. The principal investment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should be for its Human Resource Development. Next, it should be to gather and share the information which is strategically important. But, this Budget does not propose any such long-term investments and we see it as one of the prime downfalls of the Budget Proposals. Madam Chairperson, any country needs to maintain external affairs because we cannot be isolated. It is important to note that we cannot maintain these external affairs adamantly as we wish. Therefore, we need to maintain our foreign affairs on the basis of obtaining comparative advantages within the competitive environment. The mission of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should be to acquire comparative advantages through each and every transaction with another state. In fact, we question whether the Ministry actually does extend their foreign affairs based on a strategically important manner as mentioned above. Therefore, let us analyse the Ministrys mission as they have mentioned. According to the Progress Report of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 2007, its mission focuses on the following four areas. 1. Strengthening political relations among states. 2. Developing multilateral and bilateral economic co-operation. 3. To implement programmes via foreign relations to protect the national security, sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the Sri Lankan State.",

    "text": "comparative advantages for us. Sri Lanka is a Third World developing country. The biggest challenge for us is to increase our export income via expanding trade affairs among states. At this juncture, we should pay more attention on strengthening political relations; to strengthen our foreign trade and therefore, we will have more trade relations with the USA and the EU. Seventy seven per cent of our exports are purchased by the USA and the European Union. Out of that, the EU has purchased only 36 per cent of our exports in the year 2008. Fifty nine per cent of our annual export income for the year 2008, which was US Dollars 3.8 billion was from the EU and the USA. In fact, unfortunately the undiplomatic foreign policy of the present Government has weakened the political relations with the EU. This eventually results in losing key foreign trade opportunities with the EU. The best example, Hon. Minister, for this scenario is the threat of losing the GSP Plus trade preference to Sri Lanka. Madam Chairperson, although we have weakened the existing political relations among states, we do not carry any long-term strategic plan to strengthen the political ties with the rest of the countries. As we all know, the upcoming African market is predicted as one of the largest markets. Though it does not seem to be important at present, it will indeed be significant in the near future. Therefore, most of the states by now have commenced strengthening the political relations with the African Continent. In fact, the Progress Report of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Sri Lanka clearly indicates that they do not have a clue about this important trade development in the world. For example, the Ministry has not been able to commence any productive discourse with any of the African states except with Egypt. This indicates the parameters of the strategic programme of the Ministry to strengthen the political affairs among states. Madam Chairperson, let us now focus on the unilateral and bilateral economic co-operations. As we know, the two most important economic strategic points to Sri Lanka are China and India. In considering the nature of economic relations with China, it could only be identified as a country which provides goods for credit. At a time where we are unable to furnish the debts, the existing economic co-operations become much weaker. Although we have entered into a Free Trade Agreement with India, CEPA, the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement has not yet been implemented. The Foreign Direct Investment which should have been brought in by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in co-operation with the line ministries have drastically dropped during the last year. Though we have developed economic co-operations last year, they were mainly with the Iranian International Political Agenda in order to obtain unilateral economic advantages. For example, although Iran had donated aid to upgrade the capacity of the oil refinery in Sri Lanka,",

Hence, it is comprehensive that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs actually does not work towards achieving the strategic goals or relative advantages towards developing our economy. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not acted efficiently towards countering challenges on national security, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. The best example in this regard is our foreign affairs with Cambodia and Myanmar. As we know, the LTTE purchases their weapons via the illegal non-state weapon dealers based in the above mentioned States. So far we have only come to an intelligence-sharing and understanding agreement with these States. The Hon. Minister would know how long it will actually take for active participation beyond these understandings. This tiny example clearly indicates how efficient the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been with regard to national security. Let us now pay attention on the role of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in obtaining lasting peace for the ongoing conflict in Sri Lanka. In this context, prime attention should be given in obtaining international experience on the protection of human rights to the Sri Lankan Government and in return delivering to the international community the message of protecting human rights within the state boundaries. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has failed in countering the propaganda carried out by the LTTE and the rest of the international organizations in Sri Lanka as a true violator of human rights. Hence, there is greater pressure on Sri Lanka by the international community. The key feature is the campaign led by India to enter into a ceasefire agreement. If these campaigns of India affect in changing its policy towards the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka, that would indeed pave the way for the international community to pressurize more on Sri Lanka very soon. In such a context, it will be obvious that the LTTE would succeed in defeating the foreign policy of the present Sri Lankan Government. The above mentioned catalyst is a result of the inability of Sri Lanka to achieve strategic approaches in foreign affairs as a state.",

Do not think that the Foreign Ministry is only yours. It is our country and we also have a sense of responsibility. When your people are doing wrong things or moving in the wrong direction, we have to make it known. The other problem is regarding the situation in India.

More than us, it is the minority communities who are suffering. So, Hon. Minister, this situation is very critical. The President always says that India is our friend, that India is supporting us, so on and so forth. But, what do we see in the news? The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu says, You cannot believe the Sri Lankan Government or the President. Where is the friendship? I cannot understand. Things are hotting up in South India but still they have not decided to keep quiet or be silent. I do not know what is going to be the outcome ultimately. Then you spent nearly Rs. 3 billion on the SAARC Summit. It is a huge amount. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) May I correct my learned Friend. You are not aware of the total expenditure on the SAARC Summit because still we have not tabled the accounts before the House; but only the estimates. ( ) (The Hon.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I do not know. You know it better than me. These problems have come up from time to time. Then, our leader, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the other day in Parliament said that he will give the fullest support and co-oporation to amend the Constitution in order to give effect to all the covenants that we have signed. But, the Prime Minister rejected it. Why is that? Why are you shy of the respective covenants being brought within the framework of law of Sri Lanka? So, this is why the world is watching carefully the attitude and the conduct of the Government. No wonder the allegation of human rights violations taking place in Sri Lanka is in the prime place among all this. Also, I read a news item that the JVP has made an allegation that the Government has a secret agreement with India because there were two visits to India recently - one by the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa and the other by the President. But, nothing was said or the people of this country informed as to what were the conditions or agreements reached between the leaders. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) I have already stated that in this House a week ago and tabled the two joint communiqus, that were issued by the Government of Sri Lanka, with the Government of India. That is called the India-Sri Lanka Joint Press Release. I am sure my learned Friend would have had the opportunity of reading that properly and understanding the context. Beyond this, there is absolutely no other agreement or no other understanding between the two countries. Everything that had been discussed is reflected in the pages of this document I have. I have already tabled this. This is in the Hansard. If you want to get any clarification from me with regard to the contents of this, I am prepared to respond to you. ( ) (The Hon.

    "text": "( - ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila - Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs) , . debate . . . I found that the quality of debate which I experienced as a first-term Member in this august Assembly over the last few years, has gone down to the level of saying, \"There is an allegation\", \"So and so is saying this\", \"This paper is saying this\", or \"That tabloid is saying this.\" There was an allegation made in the morning that the Foreign Ministry's allocations have been used up within the first six months of the year. At the very outset of my speech, I completely deny that allegation. The Hon. Kiriella is not here. If he comes and sees me I can show him the percentage of allocation that has been used and the percentage that is remaining for the rest of the months. I would request them not to just speak to the gallery and to the media. Then, they were asking as to why we cannot go to Chennai? Is Chennai a country? Is Chennai not a part of India? What about our relations with India? Did His Ex-cellency the President not go to Delhi? Did the Hon. Foreign Minister not go to Delhi? What is wrong in our inviting the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu to come to Sri Lanka? Do our Hon. Members and Ministers not go there? All these talks prove the various allegations being made and talked about everywhere, about the \"- .\" Today you would have seen the TNA Members prompting the UNP Members to talk.

    "text": "Ministry of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare and the Ministry of Labour Relations and Manpower. Of course, it is not only the 17 officers from that section of the labour who look after the consular interests of the citi-zens of Sri Lanka abroad, because the Foreign Ministry is also mandated to look after the interests of every citi-zen of Sri Lanka abroad. I am happy to say that my mis-sions, my ambassadors and the officers there are doing their utmost to ensure that their interests are looked after. Then, there was an unfounded allegation about various happenings in the safe houses. I completely deny that allegation. If there are any complaints about anything happening in any of the safe houses, I would request the Hon. Member to please come and meet the Hon. Minister or me personally, bring them up and if they are proved correct, we will take stern action against those responsi-ble. Of course, there are times when the safe house is full. There are delays in repatriation. That is because of the laws of that particular country and we as a sovereign country have to abide by them. Just because an employer and an employee have a problem and the employee does not want to work there, we just cannot take him in and send him away. There are exit permits to be obtained. As one of the Hon. Members mentioned, there are pending court cases. So, we have to wait till the court cases are over. These are matters that we have to look into. One other allegation - a laughable allegation - that was made is that we have not done anything about losing the GSP Plus concession. Does that mean, to retain the GSP Plus concession, we must sell our sovereignty down the drain? Should we allow some foreign country to come in and investigate us? That is one thing that this Govern-ment will never allow. But, there was a contradiction. The same Hon. Member who said that we are not doing anything about losing the GSP Plus concession, not doing enough to ensure more garments being exported when the Foreign Minister discusses with the ambassadors and lures them into buying more tea for their countries, says, \"That is not a part of your job.\" Tea is grown locally and is 100 per cent value added. Where garments are con-cerned, we get only a 30 percent value addition. But, the interest of the garment manufacturer is very important to the Opposition. They talk about that. I do not know whether it is a contradiction or whether there is some other motive behind it. -[Interruption.] One of the UNP Members. I do not like to mention names. You can get it from the Hansard. The Hon. Members also spoke about suspicions, alle-gations and newspaper reports. A Member of the TNA commenting on our Progress Report said that though we have talked about various Divisions in the Progress Re-port, we have not mentioned anything about the migrant workers. I think she has not seen the pages on the Consu-lar Division in the Progress Report which very clearly state about the Sri Lankans abroad who have been looked after and the type of services that have been rendered by our embassies in consular functions.",

Our primary mandate is to look after the interests of all Sri Lankans abroad, be they housemaids, be they masons, carpenters or professionals in various parts of the world. We do not keep ourselves confined only to the Middle-East. Therefore, I would like to tell the Hon. Member - though she is not here - to read our Progress Report care-fully and still, if she feels that there are some matters which require elucidation, we are always available. Hon. Ranjith Aluvihare, to answer your question about the 18 labour welfare officers, it is not only them who are attending to the consular functions, but also our diplo-matic officers attached to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and who are there in the embassies are also working to-wards the welfare of these migrant workers. Of course, as was mentioned by the Minister of Labour Relations and Manpower, sending more people to embassies is one of the priorities. But, we must understand that it is not easy to just send people to embassies because the receiving country also has to agree. There are certain limits that are placed. Each country can bring in only a certain number of people to serve in their missions. So, there are practi-cal difficulties. But, we are trying to send more people as much as possible, specially to countries where we have a vast presence. I must also inform you that our Con-sular Division has worked in such a way that in certain countries we have started working on holidays. For in-stance, we keep open the Consular Division in Doha on Fridays, and in Singapore, we keep the Consular Division open on Sundays. Now in France, I was there two weeks ago, we have started opening our Consular Division every alternate Saturday, in the first instance, to give bet-ter services to our Sri Lankans in France. When there were amnesties declared in the UAE and Kuwait, we sent special teams of officers from here to help the -",
