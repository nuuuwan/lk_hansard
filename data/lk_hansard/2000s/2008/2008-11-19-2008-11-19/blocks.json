We have also for the first time, carried out a joint advertisement with the SriLankan Airlines over the Al Jazeera Arabic channel to create awareness of Sri Lanka in the Middle East, which has shown results. From the 8th to 10th of November this year, my Minister visited Iran with the Secretary to the Ministry of Tourism, the Chairman and the Managing Director of the Tourism Promotion Bureau on a promotional visit and met the Iranian Tourism Minister, His Excellency Rahim Mashee, and more than 70 top level tour operators with a view to develop closer ties between our two countries. We are hopeful that Mahan Air will start operations to Sri Lanka early next year with a few charters, which will help to generate traffic from the Iranian market as well. We will also pay attention to the Chinese and Japanese markets now that we have developed multi-faceted trade and investment ties with those two major markets in the Asia-Pacific region. My Minister, at the initial stage itself after promulgating the new Tourism Act, which was stalled for nearly two years, effectively set up four independent in-stitutions in terms of the Act to manage the four important aspects of tourism. They are briefly, product development and standardization, marketing and promotion, Human Resources Development and MICE tourism promotion. These interconnected subjects are now being handled by very competitive Boards of Management appointed by my Minister. I wish to underscore the most significant philosophy in this exercise which is the development of an excellent public-private partnership. The delay in promulgating the new Act was that certain quarters raised concern that the SME sector would be neglected by the promulgation of the new Act. That too was addressed by my Minister as a consultative process of all stakeholders was carried out, there being representations of all stakeholders in the Boards of Management of the institutions that come under the new Act. Equal attention was drawn to muster the support of the SME sector while taking every effort to safeguard their business interests. To face the current difficult situation, the Ministry worked closely with the Department of External Resources of the Ministry of Finance and Planning to organize a loan package through the European International Bank with a view to assist the SME sector. On a decision taken by my Minister, we allocated Rs. 100 million from the Development Fund through which we supported the SMEs to participate at international trade fairs, which otherwise they cannot afford to. My Ministry has taken every effort and will continue to do so to strengthen the SME sector, on which even His Excellency the President is very keen. Before the end of this year, we will be developing a comprehensive database of SMEs in tourism so that before the SMEs are taken into the mainstream, meaning the formal sector, we will be able to carefully develop their capacities, which is very essential. The database will",

The contribution that tourism can make for regional development is immense. Sri Lanka's tourism has not been able to show its true potential due to the curse of terrorism for more than two decades. With the success of the Government in its attempt to crush terrorism, Sri Lanka will be able to look beyond the war and market itself as a peaceful nation being the paradise of the Indian Ocean. The East, which has been deprived of development due to terrorism, is now ready for development with it being liberated from terrorism and a Provincial Council with the mandate of the people being established. My Minister believes that there is great potential for tourism to economically empower the people in the East and that an accelerated programme is necessary to achieve the same. With this objective in mind, a high-powered committee which included the Chief Minister of the Eastern Province and myself was set up to regulate and expedite tourism development in the Eastern region. Let me now speak about East coast development. We assisted the Sri Lanka Air Force in the development of the airport at China Bay.

The former Sri Lanka Tourist Board declared this area as one of the tourist development areas. It is a world famous surfing point in Sri Lanka that attracts the UK, Japanese and Australian tourists. The Eastern region is blessed with a stretch of sun-rising beachfront, shallow blue waters, lagoons, flora and fauna that are unique to the region. Now let me explain some of our key development projects. The investment in tourism continues to grow and I would like to thank the BOI for the investment incentives package offered to the investors. At present, there are nearly 250 hotels with 15,000 rooms which are sufficient to accommodate nearly 700,000 tourists. The present level of tourist arrival is around 500,000 tourists. Then, let us take the Kalpitiya Dutch Bay Resort. In the history of Sri Lanka's tourism, we have never carried out such a mega project. We have already identified a 4,100-acre block of land at Kalpitiya which includes 11 islands. Already we have taken possession of nine islands and the balance acquisition will be completed by the end of this year. Before the end of this year, we will be calling for bids from developers to invest in this area. There are nine private sector investors who have already shown interest to invest in facility development of this resort. There, the major tourist attractions are beaches, living coral reefs, whales and dolphin watching, birdwatching, wildlife, shipwrecks et cetera. It will be an integrated development, encompassing tourism, agriculture and fisheries. The \"Dedduwa Lake Resort\" is a proposed project. The Southern coastal belt of Sri Lanka is heavily built and it is very difficult to find land there for tourism development. Dedduwa is located on the inland side of Bentota where we are planning to set up a lake resort, where the total land area is 1,200 acres. We are now in the process of acquiring land for this development. In order to modernize the existing Bentota Tourist Resort, the first ever-planned tourist resort in Sri Lanka which consists of 600 rooms, we have already commenced to set up a picnic area with all basic facilities for the locals to enjoy the beach. There will be a restaurant and changing rooms with toilet facilities. We have also recently constructed a purpose-built life guards' unit to take care of the safety of the tourists. The Ramayana Epic is well known in India. In Sri Lanka, there are nearly 50 sites related to Ramayana. We are now carrying out a publicity programme about those sites in the Indian market. We are also working towards the improvement of infrastructure facilities in and around those sites. Then, with regard to domestic tourism, we operate accommodation units at Kataragama, Anuradhapura, Bandarawela and Nuwara Eliya at affordable prices for 4 - PL 003503 - (2008/12)",

We noticed that the locals are travelling during weekends and school holidays and are making use of the tourist hotel facilities. Today, nearly 50 per cent of the tourism business is centered on domestic tourism. For the long-term sustainability of the tourism industry, there is a need to develop and promote domestic tourism. We started an airport survey this month to interview the tourists at the airport on their departure to obtain a feedback of their experience in Sri Lanka. This will help us to plan our tourism in the future. The Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management conducts regular courses to train students to be employed in the tourist industry. The main school is in Colombo and there are regional schools in Kandy, Bandarawela, Koggala and Anuradhapura. Those who are trained in these schools will be able to get immediate employment in Sri Lanka or overseas. In addition to the general programme, we believe that under the Mahinda Chintana, focus should be given to empower rural youth. We have initiated a four-month programme where youth with little or no knowledge in the English language are given a crash course in English and taught the basic skills in hotel industry to handle back-end jobs. Under this programme, we have successfully sent over 300 youths to work in the Middle-East enabling them to earn Rs. 30,000 to 50,000 a month, who would have otherwise ended up working as labourers in the Middle-East for a lesser wage. We have also trained 460 informal tourist service providers as tourist facilitators in Bentota, Sigiriya, Wayamba, Kalutara, Yala, Wasgamuwa and Negombo. The Budget has addressed some of the concerns of the industry by the reduction of VAT from 15 to 12 per cent; giving a grace period of six months to hoteliers for the repayment of loans and the reduction of the cost of electricity in the hotel sector. The provision made for setting up of Tourism Villages in the Budget Proposals would further develop the required infrastructure facilities by promoting new tourism destinations. In spite of several setbacks, the Ministry of Tourism is committed to take this industry forward under the leadership of the Hon. Milinda Moragoda. We have prepared a four-year Tourism Development Plan for the period 2009 to 2012. It provides the strategic direction for Sri Lankas tourism industry and the activities to be undertaken to achieve the targets. Thank you.",

Member, who is the Chairman of the Cricket Board. After listening to his speech, I feel that he is making a tremendous effort to popularize the game of cricket and trying to bring back the glory that Sri Lanka had in the field of cricket in the international arena. All what we see is that the correct man has been put on the correct job. That is very important. I think the Hon. Minister will take necessary corrective steps on matters that he has unveiled in this House. Now, Sir, I will get on to the subject of tourism which is also equally important to Sri Lanka. There is no doubt that in 2008 and 2009, there will be a drop in tourist traffic as well as in the income from tourism. There is no debate on that. I think the Hon. Minister will agree that when we look at the different news items and reports coming in, we cannot expect any increase or for that matter, sustain the levels that we had in 2007. The main reason for that is the failure on the part of your Government to put an end to this senseless war. That is the main reason why tourism is dipping, the tourism industry is going down and the income is also going down. Why do you not put forward the political package and finish this off ? What is the meaning of this ? It will go on and on. Next year also, you will have the same problem unless you come to some sort of an arrangement and stop the ongoing conflict between the Government and the LTTE. That is the main reason for this. As a result of it, what happens is, as soon as some of those light aircraft are sighted or some bombing takes place in some part of Colombo or elsewhere, travel advisories go out. The CNN will go to town on that; they will start giving publicity that Sri Lankas Capital has been bombed by the LTTE and also the BBC will come out with it. Then, how can you expect tourists to come? With that goes out the travel advisories from the",

    "text": "ambassadors. You cannot be blamed for that. Unfortunately, no sooner they go out, all the cancellations come in. We are now at the beginning of the season. If you ask the hoteliers, they will tell you how many reservations have been cancelled. Some of the five-star hotels in Colombo are surviving because there are some businessmen who come and go. Because of that, they are able to carry on. But they are just breaking even with about 40 per cent occupancy. They are not happy at all. Then, Sir, I am made to understand that even the few people who come on tour packages do not bring money here. The money is deposited with the agents in those countries and Sri Lanka never sees the light of that funding. So, we are not benefiting at all from that type of tourists. The ultimate requirement is that there should be a peaceful environment in Sri Lanka for people to come. Who wants to come to a country where there are conflicts? They are only transiting in Sri Lanka to go to the Maldives. That is what is happening now because there is so much of peace in the Maldives. But, I am told that now even in the Maldives there is a big drug problem and they are also not doing very well as they would have in the past. So, as a Government you have to take steps. There is no point in trying to give excuses. The fault is with the Government for its failure to end the conflict. You either finish it off with the LTTE or come up with a political solution in order to have peace in the country. Please keep that in mind. The next problem is the world recession which will also have a very serious impact on tourism in Sri Lanka. Now, in places like the USA and some of the European countries, they are discouraging their citizens from going out on holidays to other countries because there is a foreign exchange problem in their own country. So, this is something that will affect us not only in 2008 but also in 2009. I read a news item that appeared in The Sunday Times of 21st September, 2008, referring to the \"Asian Outlook 2008\", an annual report released by the Asian Development Bank where it states, I quote: Food and oil hikes to continue in Asia this year - ADB That report comments on many issues that confront the Asian countries. According to that, there would be major difficulties in their economies. So, in the light of all that, we cannot expect tourism to flourish in this country. The inflow of tourists will undoubtedly go down. You would have transit tourists, but you cannot count them and predict on the expected number of tourist arrivals. You are thinking that 400,000 would have come to Sri Lanka. But, they come and wait for a couple of hours and go off. So, you must not get carried away with the statistics that are appearing in the books. These are some of the problems that we have to",

The Asian economies are particularly going to suffer and as a result of it you may not even be able to expect the Indian tourists to come, because the growth in the Indian economy has gone down from 9 to 7 per cent. In 2007, there was a large number of Indian tourists who came. But, even that same number may not turn up this year. Now, what do you do in a situation like that to support the hoteliers? Hon. Minister, you have to sustain these hoteliers. During our time in 1983, 1984 and 1985 what we did was, we gave soft loans to all the small hoteliers who had registered with the Sri Lanka Tourist Board - not to the five-star hotels. They were given interest free loans merely to sustain their hotels. That is on the one hand and on the other, there was a system called \"debentures\" that were issued where a monthly payment was given to the small hoteliers in order to maintain and sustain the hotels to get over this period. This may be a temporary phenomena for one or two years. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Milinda Moragoda-Minister of Tourism) I want to make just a short comment on that. In this Budget, we have a six-month moratorium on loan repayment. I agree with you on that issue. That is not a debenture or a soft loan. But, the hotel sector is entitled to a six-month moratorium on loan repayment. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) That alone is not enough. I mean that is where you are not going to - ( ) (The Hon. Milinda Moragoda) It is at least a start. You asked what we were doing. It is a start. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) You have to give them a hand. How can they survive? Earlier it was revealed that so many thousands of people are losing their jobs and retrenchment is taking place. All that can be avoided to a certain extent if the Government intervenes. So, it is very important that you develop some methodology as to how you are going to sustain the smaller hotels. Now, if you take for example, the Negombo stretch, there are a large number of small hotels. They have no business and they are facing very difficult circumstances. The main problem is to maintain these hotels. They will have to maintain them for one or two years till such time - good times - comes to Sri Lanka",

So, this is something that we have to look at particularly, not to the five-star hotels, but there are an enormous number of small hotels which are registered with the Sri Lanka Tourist Board and which were doing very well in 2006 and so on, but today they are in dire straits. There is another problem. That is the mosquito menace which is also creating difficulties for tourists. You have not been able to do anything to eradicate this. If you take even the Negombo stretch in the Gampaha District, there are a lot of tourists who have suffered from the epidemic of Chikungunya, all due to mosquitoes. So, something has to be done. Either the local authorities will have to be activated to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes and curtail the problem or the Government will have to intervene. Then, besides that, there is another menace. That is the problem of stray dogs. Tourists cannot walk on the roads. They are scared thinking that there are rabid dogs running around the tourists areas. Nothing has been done to eradicate that problem. So, these are some matters that you will have to address your mind and make sure that the people who come here are made comfortable.

It was very interesting. I do not know why they came to Sri Lanka to spend their honeymoon. Nevertheless, the problem was with regard to the type of food that had been served in that hotel. They all fell ill - the whole family including the couple plus the other children who had accompanied them. They were ultimately hospitalized and they had to go back. Their complaint was that the food served was half- cooked and was not fit for human consumption. As a result of that, they gave a lot of adverse publicity. When they went back, they would have given interviews to the press in that country. This is what happens. This is what the \"Daily Mirror\" dated 17th November, 2008 states, I quote: Lankan honeymoon was holiday from hell. See the kind of publicity that we are getting. So, some sort of supervision has to be enforced on these hotels. The main reason behind all this is that they cannot make ends meet.",

Many of the tourists who come to Sri Lanka try to get connection through SriLankan Airlines. There are a lot of cancellations. They are stranded in different parts of the world. How can you expect to develop tourism? Then again, there are flight delays. These are some areas that you have to jointly address. You have to start with the airlines because if the airlines do not help you to bring tourists here, you will never be able to develop this industry. Then, we are sorry about the large number of young people who had a lot of expectation in developing a career in the hotel trade and today are left high and dry. Most of the young people who have the experience are all looking for greener pastures. Many of them are going to Australia and some of them are going to Canada. Ultimately, you will realize that we will have no expertise or trained and capable people to run the hotels here. Everyone is moving out. It is a very sad story.

The structural changes made internally in the administration of the sector have proved successful. The decision to bring into force the new Tourism Act is a positive and far-reaching action. The private sector which is the main engine of growth has now been given the opportunity to be a part of the administration. They have been demanding for a long period to develop the sector together with the public sector and this opportunity has now been afforded.

This has resulted in a dynamic consultative process and a sharing culture for the public and private sectors and SMEs in tourism to work in partnership, for the development of tourism, leaving aside petty political differences. This co-operation between public and the private sector is essential for an industry like tourism, which is our fourth largest foreign exchange earner, which is looking after a population of nearly nine million people who are direct and indirect beneficiaries of the industry.

These innovations are timely and appropriate given the global challenges of the 21st Century, signified by the economic crisis and the climatic change. It is reported that offices maintained by the former Ceylon Tourist Board for the last 30 odd years in France and Germany, have been closed down while putting in place plans to strengthen the office in the United Kingdom. This strategic direction, I understand, is a joint proposal by the public and private sectors and will save annually Rs. 30 - 40 million which could be ploughed back into more promotional efforts. Many countries promote tourism through destination management companies, which will do marketing and promotional activities. It is good to see that we are now following this international trend, which has proved to be successful in other countries. Narrowing down international promotions by intensifying the efforts in Russia, Germany, France, UK, the Middle-East and India, would be another strategic direction of Sri Lanka Tourism. This would make sense, so that we could make effective and efficient use of the funds available for promotion. I believe, China and Japan in the Asia Pacific Region should be on board. Special attention should be paid to the youth market and special segments such as pilgrim trails, leisure traffic from the Middle-East, high spenders from UK, France and Germany. The industry must be urged to match promotional efforts effectively, so that the particular segments can be equalled with the product available here in the destination. The recent survey of the World Tourism Mart indicates that due to the present financial crisis, tourists will prefer destinations closer to their homes. Hence, it",

We do understand the major challenges to the industry arising from travel advisories and blown up foreign media coverage need to be managed carefully. In this instance I believe, Sri Lanka Missions have a major role to play in dispelling the adverse publicity in foreign countries and promoting Sri Lanka tourism. Locally, the initiatives taken by the Sri Lanka Tourism to promote special events such as the balloon festival, Hikkaduwa beach festival, Galle literary festival and the film festival, Vesak festival and Sri Dalada Perahera will help Sri Lanka tourism to cushion the negative mindset that is being created. Sri Lanka Tourism perhaps can join hands with other parallel ministries to develop such positive stories to show the world that Sri Lanka is still safe for tourists. This year, the Hon. Minster of Finance and Planning has given wide prominence to the tourism sector in his Budget Speech. The proposal to help the small and medium sectors of the industry is very ingenious. When international tourism is low, it is necessary that we promote local tourism and this is where the small and medium sectors will benefit. In this context, the role of the provincial councils becomes very important. Their involvement effectively will provide impetus in promoting employment in the rural sector and help to earn valuable foreign exchange needed by the country. The tax concession given in the Budget will ease the burden of the industry to a certain extent. The industry has to also adjust itself and be able to stand on its own instead of depending on the Government to help them when arrivals are low. The efforts of the Government to defeat terrorism are bearing fruit. In the near future, we may all realize the dream of a peaceful united Sri Lanka. The tourism sector would benefit most from this. In conclusion, I wish to say that I am confident that Sri Lanka will again become a popular destination. The policy measures already taken, if properly implemented, will result in achieving the goals of increased arrivals to the country. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) . . [.. 12.07] ( ) (The Hon.

Madam Presiding Member, I wish to thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak at the Committee Stage discussion on Heads 136, 219, 294 and 322 of the Ministry of Sports and Public Recreation. Madam Presiding Member, we have heard many speeches on the Budget Proposals by different Members with different political views. Some praise the Budget to the heavens, while others criticize and tear it to shreds. This reminds me of a great Russian writer Tolstoy. He said that a historical event created in the minds of the people depends entirely on the political leanings of the writer. Quoting history of Napoleon's period of the two French writers, one says that Napoleon was a republican and that his power rested upon his leanings on cunningness and duping his followers. The other wrote, a \"Bonapartist\", that the power of Napoleon was derived from genius and his virtues. I wonder whether \"Mahinda Chintana\" together with the Government has placed the programme before the country with the purest of motives combined with the sacred duty of improving the standards of living of the people with increased tax and VAT system, in order to promote the local industrialists, while our foreign borrowings will be doubled and trebled within",

    "text": "the next couple of years, with a vision of ending the war in the shortest period of time and that dawn, we shall call, \"The dawn of the new era\". Let us hope for it. As a member of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, I see objectively and impartially and wish to grant the proper values and merits to the proposals that are placed before us. I wish to say that the Muslims of Sri Lanka comprising the Malays, Moors, Memons, Bohras, Sunnis and the Shias sect, whom I represent, contribute towards the upliftment of our economy in spite of increased tax, VAT and other reforms and we have stood the test of time and we will still hold the forte. Madam Presiding Member, I wish to speak about sports, which subject is under my dear Friend. Hon. Minister, the following institutions come under your purview: the Department of Sports Development, the Department of National Zoological Gardens, the Department of National Botanical Gardens, the Sugathadasa Sports Complex, and the National Institute of Sports Science. If you look at the international awards won by the Sri Lankans in the year 2008, it is very negligible in comparison to the 2007 results. In the South Asian games we have won seven gold, nine silver, and 15 bronze, bringing a total of 31 medals to the country. But, your department has not shown any remarkable interest in the Asian Grand Prix which had won two gold, six silver, and six bronze totalling up to 14 medals. Hon. Minister, I wish to place on record that the estimated funds for development are Rs. 490 million in the 2008 and Rs. 570 million in the 2009. I wish to seek your indulgence to the following : one is the Reid Avenue Sports Complex. The complex was partly handed over to the Colombo Municipal Council in 2002 for maintenance and day-to-day governance. I was the Chairman of Sports and Recreation Club of the Colombo Municipal Council in the year 2001-2002 and a sum of Rs. 50 million was given to the Colombo Municipal Council as a grant for the development of the Reid Avenue complex. The Reid Avenue complex is a heritage property and had been constructed during the British times, the pre-Independence era. The position is that these funds given to the Municipal Council for the development of the complex were deposited in the Banks and used for solid waste programmes. Not a penny was released for the upliftment of this particular area. This country had a green patch within the City of Colombo which is the Racecourse and the turf, the most outstanding heritage property sites in our country. When the late Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike was the Prime Minister in 1963, she chopped and blocked out most of the areas, and ruined the area with the planetarium giving part of it to the University, some to the Ministry of Sports, some to the Bloomfield Club, some to Royal College and so on. Petty political affiliations made them",

    "text": "to give these lands, which was a beautiful landscape in the City of Colombo, to various institutions. We regret this. There is no revival whatsoever. I was the President of the Billiards and Snooker Association of Sri Lanka in 1990 and presently I am the Vice President. This game of billiards and snooker brought international recognition to Sri Lanka for the the first time when Mr. M.J.M. Lafir was declared the world champion in billiards and snooker. What support has this Department extended to this association? Our Association is in a state of ruins. It does not get any assistance whatsoever; there is no financial support for the coach; there is no proper infrastructure; no facilities and no income. The measly entry fees were sufficient only to pay our electricity bills and not even the water bills. I would request the Hon. Minister to kindly grant institutions like this, a minimum of Rs. 600,000 per year so that they can again produce world champions. My dear Hon. Minister, I would also make use of this opportunity to invite the attention of the Sports Clubs and institutions which are founder Members of the Cricket Board. I am the President of the Moors' Sports Club. I have been the founder Member of the Cricket Board, having served a number of years in the committee of sponsorship, tour organizing, et cetera. I have been the Treasurer of the CDCA. The Ministry interferes with people who are running the Board, which has brought great pride to our country, making Sri Lanka, world champions in cricket. Today, after Mr. Sumathipalas era, this particular body has gone into interim administrations where people like Mr. Dharmadasa, and now the Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga, our Member of Parliament, Captain Cool - heads this Organization. I know there had been a lot of expenditure. There are no funds. Even this year we have not got any funds. The funds are cut. There was unnecessary spending without proper screening for infrastructure development of the Cricket Board, running into millions of rupees. Money had been spent lavishly. The Moors' Sports Club which is open to all is a 100 per cent Buddhist-Sinhala oriented team, playing cricket in our country. Our funds are cut to size and we can no longer survive. Our Members will be leaving for better pastures in the near future.",

    "text": "sports in the right way by providing them with proper infrastructure, proper nutritional programme, proper training, we can never come up. For example, Germany spends a considerable amount of time on their youth to bring them up as sportsmen, to build their character so that they will be better citizens of the country and leaders of the world. Therefore, I would like to invite your attention to the appointment of a committee to find the pros and cons of sports. I would also like to say that an up-to-date gymnasium for the athletes to build up their physical fitness is necessary. A sports centre for the youth is also necessary as a common place to meet and interact with others, exercise their skills and make use of sports medicine. A clear programme on physical fitness should be conducted on a daily basis. Today, you can build tourism through sports. A classic example between 1980 and 1990 was Bangkok, the Capital of Thailand. It was a city of fun and the awareness of AIDS made Bangkok a desert with no Americans, Japanese or Europeans coming to that country. I am sorry to say that the Hon. Minister of Tourism is not here to give us a hearing. But, today Bangkok has developed tourism through sports where independent teams come from overseas. I, as a Member of the Colombo Municipal Council and of the provincial administration, took teams of players from our country to Bangkok where they got teams from other countries also to come in. Through that, their tourism is improving. There are sports tournaments conducted in that city. The World Championship for Billiard and Snooker, the Blanc World Championship for Handball, SEA Games, the Asian Games, all those are held in Bangkok. So, I would like to invite the Hon. Minister of Tourism to make sports a part of tourism. I am very sad that the Hon. Minister of Tourism is not here even to listen to what we say. When they do not listen to what we say, there is nothing they can do. The development of social and healthcare facilities, highways and hotels is important for tourism. You must understand that the hotel industry of Sri Lanka is in dire straits. From Bentota in the Western Province up to the borders of Puttalam, the area is dotted with thousands of motels and hotels. There were 140,000 who were employed in the hotel industry, but they are unemployed today. They are seeking for greener pastures in the Maldives and the Middle East and we are ruining our tourism industry. There was a time when Walkers and Neckermann brought tourists from European countries. The Europeans and the British are no longer millionaires. They are the paupers of the world. Today, in the millionaire class are the Asians, those of the SAARC region. So, why do you not give the SAARC countries a fair chance by reducing the rates? Today, the biggest problem is the hotel rates. The five-star hotels which come under the purview of the Ceylon Tourist Board are quoting US Dollars 80 to 90 per",

    "text": "person and the other five-star hotels are offering a rate of US Dollars 55 plus and they say these are crew rates. So, why do you not have open rates in the hotel industry so that they can be competitive? Sign up agreements with airlines; sign up agreements with countries that have potential. India is one of the largest countries from which we can bring a lot of people to Sri Lanka; have seminars and conferences and keep our hotels going. Hon. Minister of Tourism, may I invite your attention to the fact that the tourism industry in Sri Lanka should be promoted. I would like to repeat that it is in dire straits, not because of the war situation. There is no war in Colombo; there is no war in Bentota. There is nothing. No bombs are going off at the moment. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Shafeek Rajabdeen) Please give me one more minute, Madam Chairperson. What I would like to emphasize is that the Western Province has so many hotels, but its inhabitants, especially in the Colombo District, are poor. Hon. Minister, there should be training centres to train youth on tourism like the hotel schools. But, no youth are going there. There will be a day when there is peace in this country and the tourism industry will open up. By that time, we will not have the proper personnel to cater to this industry. I think you should pay attention to these facts and give proper leadership to the hotel industry, not only in Colombo but also in other provinces. Whether it is the Northern, the Eastern, the Western or the Southern Province, there should be hotel schools so that the breadwinners, even if they do not have job opportunities in Sri Lanka, can at least go out of the country, make money and send it to Sri Lanka. Thank you, Madam Chairperson, for giving me this opportunity to express my views. At the same time, I wish to very warmly congratulate the Hon. Minister of Sports and Public Recreation, the Hon. Gamini Lokuge, for the wonderful job he has done. If he wishes to make any interaction, I would like him to join the Hon. Minister of Tourism, the Hon. Milinda Moragoda, and work for the betterment of the Sri Lankan society. Thank you.",

    "text": "consultant to the International Monetary Fund, that the crisis that the world is facing today is probably more serious than the Depression of the '30s. In those circumstances, it would be idle to pretend that tourism is not affected by these changes that are taking place around us over which a small country like Sri Lanka has very little control. So, I think any assessment of the work that is done today by the Ministry of Tourism headed by my Friend, the Hon. Milinda Moragoda, has in a spirit of fairness and candour, to be evaluated against the backdrop of these global developments which are part of the reality of the international scene today. In that context, Venerable Presiding Member, I would like to share with you some thoughts of mine with regard to the singular achievements of the Ministry of Tourism notwithstanding the very considerable challenges that we have to face as a nation. I would like to point out to this august Assembly that there are at least five significant achievements on the part of the Ministry of Tourism. The first achievement, Venerable Presiding Member, is the spirit of innovation which has characterized the endeavour of the Ministry of Tourism to try to attract tourists from countries where Sri Lanka was not so well known previously. Traditionally, we have been attracting tourists from the United Kingdom, Germany, the Continent of Europe and from North America, to some extent. But, today, as a result of the indefatigable efforts of the Hon. Milinda Moragoda and his able Deputy, the Hon. Faizer Musthapha, we see tourists from other countries also in hotels all over the country. I have seen this myself, particularly in the District of Kandy. We have today a large numbers of tourists coming from countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Jordan. We are therefore departing from the traditional, the conventional patterns of the past. That is one of the hallmarks of success with regard to any pragmatic strategy that is devised for the present day. New horizons, new vistas of opportunity - that is one of the hallmarks of the work that is being done today by the Ministry of Tourism. I think that is important. Just a couple of weeks ago, I had occasion to attend a conference in Manila, the Capital of the Philippines, which was declared open by the President of the Philippines, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. On that occasion, there were representatives from chambers of commerce and industry from all over the Asia-Pacific region. They were addressing the collective challenges that this region faces; the need to attract tourists from unfamiliar sources. I think the Ministry of Tourism has to be justifiably complimented for the efforts that they have taken in that regard to make the country well known in South Africa, in Australia, in New Zealand, in Japan, in Korea and for that purpose, they have advertised the strengths of this country which the Hon. Y.M. Navaratne Banda so eloquently referred to, not only in the established journals of the West but in Al-jazeera, in well-known journals in the Middle East and in Eastern Europe. So, I think that is a very commendable achievement.",

    "text": "The second achievement, Venerable Presiding Member, in my view, is this. The Ministry of Tourism under the leadership of the Hon. Milinda Moragoda has not been content to promote run-of-the-mill tourism. They have been emphasizing specialist tourism. By that, I mean several things. One is religious tourism. As the Hon. Navaratne Banda suggested we have a uniquely rich heritage. One of the well-springs of that heritage is Theravada Buddhism. We now have in Sri Lanka large numbers of tourists who come into this country to study the origins, the practice, the ramifications, the doctrinal content and the practical application of Theravada Buddhism. We also have eco-tourism, Venerable Presiding Member, as you yourself are well aware. The splendor of our rain forests have attracted tourists from all over the globe. Then, we also have health tourism. I saw for myself when I was in Hambantota last weekend at the Oasis Hotel, the entire hotel is full of German tourists who come here, year after year, to benefit from Ayurvedic treatments. We are living in a world where allopathic medicine and in particular, addiction to antibiotics is looked upon with disfavour. There is a very strong impetus in the western world to get back to nature and this provides us with a unique opportunity to offer the world the wonders, the marvels of traditional medicine in this country. Companies like Siddhalepa - a four generation company; Samantha Kumarasinghe of Natures Secret, these people have done yeoman service to our economy and the Hon. Milinda Moragoda and his able Deputy have given leadership to that and today our hotels are full of tourists who come here for the purpose of benefiting from this traditional wisdom of which Sri Lanka is a repository. So, in all these respects, Venerable Presiding Member, we are attracting tourists of high quality. The Hon. Navaratne Banda spoke of a decline in the number of tourist arrivals. We must consider, not only the number of tourists who arrive but the amount of foreign exchange they bring into the country. I am aware that countries like the Kingdom of Nepal and the Kingdom of Bhutan impose a compulsory restriction - when they issue visas, they insist that a tourist in those countries must spend a minimum amount of money per day. The Hon. Minister of Tourism has focused upon quality tourism and that is with the object of addressing the very problem, the dilemma that was focused upon by the Hon. Navaratne Banda. We need foreign exchange, we need to encourage tourists to come into the country but without detriment to the integrity of the cultural traditions which we have nurtured and protected in this country for centuries. The way to do this is not to open the floodgates, not to welcome multitudes of tourists, but to ensure that we get into the country quality tourists who spend large sums of money. The third contribution which the Hon. Minister of Tourism has made is with regard to his energetic and vigorous response to travel advisories. I have personal",

    "text": "experience of this myself, Sir. When I was researching and teaching in the University of Oxford as a Distinguished Visiting Fellow of All Souls College, I had this experience. I leave Sri Lanka on a Thursday. On Sunday, I read the British newspapers. Their coverage of events in Sri Lanka is a distortion of what is happening here. I do not say that that is done deliberately or mischievously. That is inherent in the nature of journalism. What is sensational hits the headline. So, it is not a balance presentation. Very often therefore, tourists get an exaggerated impression of some of the negative events which are taking place in this country. It is based upon that, that some of the travel advisories have been issued. The Hon. Minister of Tourism has responded to some these advisories. He has been engaged in continuous negotiations with the countries in question and his efforts have largely been successful. Some of these travel advisories have been softened; they have been extenuated in tone and in content. The Ministry of Tourism has acted on the basis of the very practical premise that the best ambassadors are the tourists themselves, investors, businessmen who come into this country, who go back to their own countries and tell their countrymen, their peers, their colleagues that what they read in the newspapers is not an accurate reflection of the situation that prevails on the ground in Sri Lanka. So, the perceptive, the sensitive manner in which the Ministry of Tourism has dealt with some of these volatile and complex situations is, I think worthy of commendation of this House. The fourth achievement which I would like to highlight with your permission, Venerable Presiding Member, has to do with the style of working which is characteristic of the Ministry of Tourism. It is not a top-down approach. The Ministry of Tourism has discussed its plans with entrepreneurs, with businessmen and with hoteliers and there has been a continuity and an intensity of involvement on the part of those who are actually involved in the tourist trade. When I was in Dhaka to attend the 50th Anniversary Celebrations of the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry, there were several leading members of the hospitality establishment in Sri Lanka participating in these deliberations, and one of the points they all made with great consistency and great emphasis, is that they appreciate the degree of consultation, the fact that they are insiders. It is not as though decisions are made and they are informed ex post facto. They are constantly involved in the formulation and the implementation of policy with regard to tourism and that has made possible, a very productive and collaborative partnership which is in a large measure responsible for the achievements that we see today. Venerable Presiding Member, that is the fourth point I would like to make. I would not take very much time. The fifth and the final point is this. The Ministry of Tourism has put in place a mechanism for continuous review. They have a plan of action, there is no",

    "text": "complacency and from time to time they evaluate their own performance to ascertain whether they are achieving the targets which they have set themselves. So, there is a spirit of self-evaluation, of introspection, that is very desirable. In this country it has happened all too often in the past, that there is a wide chasm, an unbridgeable gulf between the policy as it is set out in formal documents and the practical application of that policy. The Ministry of Tourism is perennially conscious of that reality. It is for that reason, Venerable Presiding Member, that from time to time they have examined how effective the actual implementation of their policies happens to be and if they find that there are deficiencies or shortcomings, they have shown no reluctance or hesitation to put in place corrective machinery. That, I think is very much the spirit in which a Ministry like Tourism should approach their work. So, these are the thoughts that I would like to express to you, Venerable Presiding Member. In conclusion, I would like to say that we have to recognize the gravity of the challenges that we face. But the secret of success is to refuse to be overwhelmed by circumstances. We must acknowledge the complexity and the gravity of the challenges but not be captured by their magnitude. The Ministry of Tourism has evolved a set of imaginative policies. They have looked elsewhere, they have benefited from the experience of other countries but they have recognized the unique character of our own situation. They, therefore have had the resilience of mind, creativity to adopt those experiences to suit the circumstances of our own situation and that is why Venerable Presiding Member, we have been able to mitigate the negative fallout from the global situation which has affected other countries in the region much more than those developments have affected Sri Lanka. These are not gratuitous, they are not coincidental, they do not just happen; they are the result of conscious and deliberate policies which are formulated and implemented with finance. I think it is only right and proper that this august Assembly should recognize the extent of that achievement and I would like Venerable Presiding Member, to add my humble tribute to the quality of the work that is now being done by the Ministry of Tourism. Thank you. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . . [.. 2.28] ( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) , ,",

[ ] , . . . . , . - - . , . . . . . * : : Documents tabled : CONSIDERABLE FOCUS ON TOURISM IN BUDGET The tourism industry observed that there had been considerable focus given in the Budget 2009 compared to previous years. The Tourist Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL), Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO) and the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises in Tourism (ASMET), stated in a media release issued yesterday that there is considerable focus on tourism in this years National Budget compared to the previous years, where we were only given a passing mention. It was noted that last week the Industry met the President, and other officials of the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance, during which the Industry was able to highlight some aspects of the tourism industry as follows. Issues highlighted were pertaining to the employment within the industry where about 65,000 people are directly, however, it was pointed out that this has perhaps the largest trickledown effect to a very large informal sector, which is dependent on Tourism. We estimate that the livelihoods of over 900,000 People are in one way or another affected by tourism. In addition they stated that the Tourism sector is virtually on its knees now, requiring urgent support to ensure continuity and sustainability. Tourism being a Front End industry, gets hit the first but has the ability of bouncing back at short notice given the correct conditions. Hence the Tourism industry would be the ideal vehicle to kick start economic and social development, and give leadership to the economic revival after the war. The President, Central Bank Governor Nivard Cabraal and, Finance Ministry Secretary, Sumith Abeysinghe gave a very patient hearing, and understood the predicament within the Tourism Industry. The various items of relief granted in the budget are expected to greatly help the industry tide over the present crisis. The tourism industry hopes to build on this foundation and work closely with Sri Lanka Tourism to eventually build a stronger and more resilient Industry for the future. Tourism sector lauds budget The Tourist Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL), Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO) & Association of Small and Medium Enterprises in Tourism (ASMET), are pleased to note that there is considerable focus on Tourism in this years National Budget compared to the previous years, where we were only given a passing mention. Last week the Industry was very happy to meet with the President, and other officials of the Central Bank and Ministry of Finance, where the Industry was able to highlight some aspects of the Tourism Industry as follows. 8 PL 003503 (2008/12)",

    "text": "Although the Tourism Industry employs only about 65,000 people directly, it has perhaps the largest trickledown effect to a very large informal sector, which is dependent on Tourism. We estimate that the livelihoods of over 900,000 people are in one way or another affected by Tourism. The Tourism sector is virtually on its knees now, requiring urgent support to ensure continuity and sustainability. Tourism is a Front End industry, which gets hit the first, but has the ability of bouncing back at short notice given the correct conditions. Hence the Tourism industry would be the ideal vehicle to kick start economic and social development, and give leadership to the economic revival after the War. The President, Governor of the Central Bank, Nivard Cabraal and Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Sumith Abeysinghe gave a very patient hearing, and quite understood the predicament the Tourism Industry is currently in. Consequently the Industry is grateful to the president and all others, for providing relief in the Budget 2009 for the Tourism Industry. The various items of relief thus provided will greatly help the industry tide over the present crisis. The Tourism Industry hopes to build on this foundation and work closely with Sri Lanka Tourism to eventually build a stronger and more resilient Industry for the future.",

Two weeks back the industry met the President and other officials of the Central Bank and Ministry of Finance where the industry was able to highlight some aspects of the industry, the statement said. They include; though the industry employs only about 65,000 people directly, it has perhaps the largest trickledown effect to a very large informal sector and accordingly some 900,000 are in one way or another affected by tourism; the industry is on its knees now, requiring urgent support to survive; and tourism is a Front End industry, which gets hit the first, but has the ability of bouncing back at short notice given the correct conditions.
