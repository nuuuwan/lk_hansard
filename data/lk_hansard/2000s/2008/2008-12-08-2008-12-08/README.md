. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Sir, may I be heard with regard to the matter raised by the Hon. Member belonging to my Party? We make this statement on the Floor of this House, Sir, because you are the custodian of the rights and privileges of the Members of Parliament. The Member of Parliament has complained that his freedom of movement had been restrained other than by a judicial order. Action has been taken to prevent the Member of Parliament from travelling abroad to receive medical treatment on the basis

3457 3458

of an action not supported by the law; there was no judicial order preventing the Member of Parliament from so moving; there was no order made in terms of some law of this country preventing the Member of Parliament from so moving and consequently, the prevention of movement of the Member of Parliament has been in contravention of the law of this country. In fact, I am informed that a couple of days ago an application had been made to the Magistrate's Court in Colombo and the magistrate had instructed that notice be issued on the respondents and the Attorney-General be consulted. The magistrate had refused to impound the passport of any person on the basis of a mere application. Thereafter, it appears to be that some authority in the TID or the CID has taken it upon himself to communicate a directive to the authorities of the airport and thereby prevent the Member of Parliament from moving. Now this action by this authority, whoever he may be, is in contravention of the law, is in violation of the law, is in flagrant violation of the rights and privileges of the Hon. Members of this House and it is your duty, your responsibility as the Speaker of this House, to ensure that if there has been such violation, if there has been some such flagrant violation, that violation is removed and that the Member of the Parliament is permitted to move as he desires. If it is not restrained by court, if it is not restrained in terms of some legal provision of any law in this country, the Member cannot be prevented from moving and therefore, Sir, it is my duty to request you, as the Speaker of this House, as the custodian of the rights and privileges of the Members of Parliament, to communicate to the immigration authorities that unless there is a judicial order or an order legally made by some authority with power vested by law to make such an order, that a movement of the Member of Parliament should not be restricted, should not be restrained. That is your duty, I submit, Sir.

This is not the first time our Members have been restrained in this way. Last year during the Budget Debate, our Members were prevented from coming to this House. This, Sir, constitutes a serious violation of the fundamental rights of Members of Parliament who belong to the Tamil community and this is a matter which is intolerable, which you must not tolerate and I call upon you, as the Speaker of this House, to give your mind to this matter and issue a direction to the immigration authorities that this matter be immediately remedied and that this restriction be removed and that Member of Parliament be permitted to travel. I also request you to refer the matter to the Committee on Privileges to look into it and consider what action they should take against the person concerned, beyond whatever action you immediately take. I implore you, Mr. Speaker, to act in such a manner that the rights of the Members of this House are protected. Otherwise, this Parliament and you yourself will become a subject matter of ridicule. Thank you.

( ) (Mr. Speaker)

Thank you. I will look into that matter.

( - , ) (The Hon. Dew Gunasekara -Minister of Constitutional Affairs and National Integration)

Mr. Deputy Chairman, I take this opportunity to spell out my views and some observations on three main matters within the short time at my disposal. Firstly, I take the Government revenue. I must thank the Ministry of Finance and Planning for their performance in raising the tax, the revenue base. Since the opening of the economy, our revenue as a percentage of GDP, dwindled from 24 per cent in 1977 to 13 per cent by 2004, after 27 years. It went up to 16.3 per cent for the first time in 2006. However, it had declined to 15.8 per cent in 2007 obviously due to the concessions granted on essential imports in order to counter the rising cost of living. Our target is 19 per cent by 2010. But, this is not realizable unless we streamline our tax policy, tax administration and tax laws. We cannot relax on this effort. In spite of many measures, Mr. Deputy Chairman, taken with regard to tax administration, there is a massive tax evasion in the country both extensive and intensive. "Extensive" means, new tax payers. "Intensive" means evasion within the existing files. The Department of Inland Revenue has to contribute its share in raising the revenue with more efficiency and speed. After the VAT fraud, the image of the Department of Inland Revenue has been tarnished. The lost prestige has to be restored. It is a herculean task for the new

3497 3498

Commissioner-General, whom I know is capable of handling it. There is a Select Committee examining the deficiencies of this Department and we are trying our best to help him in the accomplishment of his task. Mr. Deputy Chairman, secondly, I wish to touch on black money, the informal economy in our country. This, again is connected to the tax evasion. At one time, there was a conception in our country that black money operates under closed economies. But, now it has been proved beyond doubt the world over that there is a massive black economy operating under the liberalized economy and that is being done more sophisticatedly. In the recent exposures through Sakwithi, Danduwam and Marana Daduwam, et cetera we are able to discover where black money goes and how the unauthorized micro-finance institutions have flourished in our country. In addition to the loss of revenue, they are a threat to the internal financial system. The surplus generated in the rural areas in the recent past through the increase of paddy production found its way to those unauthorized micro-finance institutions. Sir, I believe that the Department of Inland Revenue and the Bank Supervision Department of the Central Bank were well aware of the existence of these unauthorized micro-finance institutions. They cannot be unaware when the whole country was well aware of it. In my own understanding, there are no specific regularity requirements to counter these. The Central Bank should, in my view, have adequate powers to act swiftly and to bring those unauthorized micro-finance institutions to book. They should come to Parliament if they need adequate powers and they cannot just look on until the poor people are fleeced. Sir, all those who resort to bribery and corruption today, invest their ill-gotten money in these unauthorized micro-finance institutions. I do not know whether there is co-ordination between the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption and the Department of Inland Revenue. If not, there should be. Thirdly, more importantly, I would like to touch upon the ongoing financial crisis which we are facing today. A number of Members in the Opposition touched upon this but, I think we have not had sufficient, adequate discussion in Parliament. Parliaments world over are discussing the ongoing global financial crisis but, I think we have devoted less time to discuss this question. Sir, in the era of globalization, no country is spared the pain of a major financial crisis even if it had originated elsewhere because the currency movements are quick to latch on to economic fundamentals, including growth rates and inflation. The housing market collapsed in the United States and the consequent credit crunch and the liquidity squeeze have caused the export of their crisis to all parts of the world and today we are gradually feeling the pinch of it. The turbulence in the financial market was the end result.

Sir, I have been telling this House repeatedly to be on the vigilance on the huge financial capital movements around the world making enormous profits through speculative capital and capital gains. In 2007, the circulation of speculative capital in the world was in the region of US Dollars 3.2 trillion per day and 68 per cent of this turnover comes from the hedge funds, where there is world over accumulated black money. It is a finance-driven globalization. In a US Dollars 60 trillion world GDP, the Sri Lankan GDP which is just only about US Dollars 22 billion is a drop in the mighty ocean of the world GDP, but yet we are vulnerable to the fluctuations in the international financial market. So many lessons are there to be drawn from the current global financial crisis. We will have to look at the crisis through the prisms of political economy in order to gain an insight into the real nature of the crisis, the dimension of the crisis and innovativeness of the crisis, and not from the point of view of economic theories so much.

The intricacies of these new financial instruments will have to be studied. The theory of supply and demand in its traditional form does not operate today. So many formidable factors are influencing the financial markets. The Central Banks and the Central Governments cannot simply tackle these situations. That is what has happened to the present crisis. In the United States the Central Government has failed to tackle it. It is so as in the case of all other developed countries. Sir, today, the Central Banks, the world over play a secondary role because of the financial markets operate on their own unbridled.

Investment tools in the financial markets are on the increase. Earlier those tools were only through stock or bonds. Today, there are new tools. Hedges are also new tools. We have been discussing about hedges. The whole matter is before the Supreme Court and still sub judice. Therefore, I do not want to touch upon it. I hope we will get an opportunity to debate the issue in this House. These are the new participants. They need the financial markets today. Central Banks cannot bridle them; Central Governments cannot bridle them. This is a peculiar feature. You do not find such a situation in the entire world economic history. These are new features that are springing up. It is high time that we have a financial engineering exercise by the Central Bank and the Treasury. The Finance Intelligence Unit in the Central Bank has to be vigilant, alert and study in depth as to what is happening the world over. When accidents occur like what happened in the United States, the whole world suffers. Therefore, it is necessary that we give urgent attention to these trends and its development. When accidents occur as in the case of the subprime mortgage crises, the whole world suffers and thereby we are suffering. Therefore, Sir, skillful financial engineering is needed for the Central Bank and the Treasury in the context of new developments and new trends in our financial market. That is why there is a demand for

[ ]

2008 08 3499 3500

reforms to the international financial system in which Sri Lanka should actively participate and support. There is already an initiative on the part of BRIC. Brazil, Russia, India and China have got together and formulated a policy because the American economy is no longer in a position to give advice. Therefore, new economies are emerging. I think we must actively support the BRIC which accounts to US Dollars 14 trillion in the GDP, beating the United States of America and the European Union. Therefore we, as an Asian country, have to reorient our economic policies, economic relations and foreign policies to suit the new developments. Thank you.

This was what the late Mr. G.G. Ponnambalam said. I will read it out. Bear with me, Madam, Presiding Member. I quote:

May I also say this? I am talking quite seriously. If God forbid - he reflects the attitude . He means the then Member for Dambadeniya, the late Mr. R.G. Senanayake. Madam, bear with me for a moment. .he reflects the attitude of mind of the majority of good Sinhalese people, for whom I have the greatest admiration - I still want to hold the light of unity bright - if, as I understand him, the Opposition are of the same way of thinking, and if the people of this country are going to increasingly adopt that line of thinking, then my good Friend, Member for Dambadeniya - I say this in all seriousness and in all sincerity - it will not be federalism, it will not be regional councils, it will not be district councils, but you and we will have to part. I am not saying this as an idle threat. This was said by late Mr. G.G. Ponnambalam. Can I have one more minute, Madam? It further states, I quote: I am sorry the hon. Member . "He" means the late Mr. R.G. Senanayake. I am sorry the hon. Member who quoted me has run away. I did say in 1952, in opposing the federalists, and I say now, I do not believe in federalism, I do not believe in separatism, I do not believe in divisive politics; but if eventually, everything having being tried and having failed, a dissident movement of complete separation has got to be made, I shall not hesitate to lead it, and I repeatedly tell you here today, do not force us to it. This is what the late Mr. G.G. Ponnambalam, the Tamil Leader who co-operated with the Sinhala leadership since the advent of Independence had to say on the Floor of the then House of Representatives as far back as the 13th of June, 1968. . .

- the same late Mr. G.G. Ponnambalam was one of the three leaders of the Tamil United Liberation Front. At the convention held in 1976, the Tamil United Liberation Front adopted the goal of the establishment of a separate and sovereign Tamil Eelam. Madam, the time is running out. I wish the Government would take serious note of the sentiments the Tamil National Alliance seeks to submit on behalf of the people it represents. Time is running out. I would leave it at that. Thank you.

. , . . [.. 1.44] ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama - Minister of Enterprise Development and Investment Promotion) Madam Chairperson, we are now coming to a close of the Debate on the Budget for the year 2009. I think all will agree, just as my good Friend, the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa mentioned a few minutes ago, that we are having this Debate or engaged in this Debate in extraordinary times. In our own country, we are about to see the end of a terrorist war. Globally, however, we are beginning to see the effects of a global economic meltdown, which has not been seen in the western world for several decades, if not longer. There is no doubt that the nature of this global meltdown is going to affect all of us whether we belong to the developed world or whether we are middle-income countries or even the least-developed countries. Today, there is a virtual freezing of inter-bank transactions. A strong negative feedback loop from the financial sector to the real sector has clogged the flow of credit. The world output growth is on a steep downward trend. Compared with the 5 per cent growth in 2007, the prediction for 2008 is 3.9 per cent and for 2009, it is 3 per cent. Even if we take the emerging markets, the growth of 6.9 per cent in 2008 is likely to shrink to 6 per cent in 2009. Madam Chairperson, in the context of such a global downturn, there may be some truth in the Opposition's claim that some of the figures that we are discussing may not be exactly correct. Actually all budgets are projections. The Government hopes to get a certain amount of income; it hopes to make certain expenditures, but the real life situation, both globally and locally, sometimes tends to distort those figures. Nobody claims that those figures are set in concrete, but within that, we can examine the trends, the projections, how we think the local economy will move forward. For example, this morning my good Friend, the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti, made some observations regarding taxes and the likely impact on various other local consumer products. He looked at the taxes and said that if you add this tax to the present values, then invariably we are going to have higher prices in items like milk foods, sugar and wheat flour in the year 2009. This will not be so because one of the consequences of the economic downturn is the falling demand for commodities, particularly agricultural commodities. We can say with a

[ ]

2008 08 3531 3532

fair degree of confidence that in the coming year, just as much as oil prices are coming down and will come down, wheat prices will also come down. Wheat prices have now come down by 50 per cent according to what is called the Kansas City Board of Trade which sets the international benchmarks for wheat. So, it is coming down by 50 per cent. Fertilizer is coming down by large amounts. What about milk foods? My Colleague, the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane has already reduced the prices of milk foods and I am sure, as we go along, may be sometime in the next couple of months, we will be able to reduce that further. Wheat flour has come down. Milk foods have come down. Sugar prices will come down. Oil prices will come down. So that these taxes must be analysed in terms of a global scenario. I am pretty sure and I am quite willing to take a bet with my good Friend, the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti that he will be wrong. We will be able to, in the next few months, reduce commodity prices. So, the taxes are not going to push the consumer prices to that extent. In fact, what I would expect is a tumbling down of the market prices. So, this is one way in understanding how the global economic scenario works. In this case, the reduction of demand for many of these consumer items is one example of how it will affect us. The reverse is also possible just as much as the big consumer societies which is concentrated largely in the United States and the European Union where they are struck by this economic downturn - some even call it a meltdown. The United States is today officially in recession. When they take various criteria for economic recession, they say that you can now say that the United States is in a state of recession. So, in that scenario even our exports will get affected to some extent. Our garment exports will be affected. Sometimes, our agricultural products, agricultural commodities like tea and rubber will certainly be affected. They are being affected now. So, it is quite possible that some of the statistics that are debated in this House could also be affected. In this whole discussion, there was a lot of emphasis on, "Is this figure correct? Is there a zero missing here? Are their double digits here?" Those I would like to submit to you, Madam Chairperson, is not very relevant when we are discussing a budget in such extraordinary times. Then, what is relevant, what is most important when we evaluate a budget at a time like this, I would submit, is to find out the key aspects. Are we on a growth path? Is our GDP growing? Do all these proposals - the collection of taxes, the borrowing of money, the budgetary gap, the ability to pay - subsumed or get subsumed under this common and basic legend, the basic objective being, can we sustain the growth path that we have been engaged in and which we have been pursuing for the last three or four years? I am happy to say that our economy is growing at the rate of 6 per cent, 6.5 per cent, 7 per cent, consistently, and that is the surest way of ensuring even further growth. It is only when a country is investing in growth that you

can provide those basic social services. It is only then that we can find the money for health, the money for education, the money for Samurdhi. All these things have to be earned through our economy and that can be done only by an expanding economy which is based on growth. We have set ourselves the target of a 6.5 per cent growth which maybe, to some extent, questioned now because of the global downturn but we have to use all our budgetary strategies, our economic strategies and our political strategies, in a way that we can sustain this 6 per cent growth or 6.5 per cent growth in our economy. That is our target. Now, when we look at that target, we have to decide as to how we are going to finance this 6.5 per cent growth. No amount of grandiose lecturing in this House or grandiose publicity will give us that 6.5 per cent growth. There are basic economic techniques by which we can go on that growth path. Basically all other techniques, technologies, all get subsumed under one word investment. We have to invest money. Otherwise, there will be no growth. My good Friend, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, knows that well. Words or rhetoric, empty promises - none of these will propel an economy. We have to find the money and that money comes in a complicated situation if you look at the nuts and bolts of our economy. We have a large public sector. Twelve lakhs of people people are paid at the end of every month from the Public Exchequer. Six lakhs of pensioners are paid every month through the Public Exchequer. Roughly, we can say that one out of every ten Sri Lankans is a Government servant. I think that is a world record. Now, there are two approaches. As a Government, we were committed to retaining the public sector enhancing better governance, better performance and not sending them home. What did our good Friends opposite do? As a matter of policy they said, We are sending them home; first year we are sending 100,000 home; next year we are sending 300,000 home. That was one of the techniques they proposed and wrote into their budgets and in fact made monetary allocations for voluntary retirement schemes in the budget itself so that they could give effect to that policy. Now, this is where we have a problem. I know my Friend, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, is one who is fighting for this within his own party. If it is simply cutting the public sector, if it is simply cutting the subsidies, if it is simply cutting everything that the poor people of this country want, then of course anyone can have a balanced budget. That is not a very big problem. What you need is an adding machine, a foot-ruler and a pair of scissors and then you can be the best Finance Minister. The IMF or anybody in the world will say that he is a brilliant Finance Minister; he has balanced the Budget. But, what will happen to the country?

What is that document my good Friend, the Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya was referring to, something about your vision statement?

3533 3534

( ) (An Hon. Member) . ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, not . What is that Ananda Atukorales vision? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

An alternative budget. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No. What you had when you all were in power? ( ) (An Hon. Member)

Regaining Sri Lanka. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Yes, Regaining Sri Lanka. That is Ananda Atukorale's vision for the UNP. That is the fact of the matter. You know very well who it is - your economic pundit. That was adopted by the UNP. I mean, anybody can do it. If you cut off all the subsidies, if you shrink the Public Service, if you do not invest in the future, if you cut down your investment in education and social welfare, then of course you can regain Sri Lanka before you say "Jack Robinson". That is not difficult. But, that is not acceptable as the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa said that in a live democratic society, in a genuine democratic society, people want benefits; they want a return for putting a government in power; they want to see their lives improving; they want social justice. Then, I am afraid, Madam Chairperson, I do not think we can do that by Regaining Sri Lanka in the way our Friends opposite are anticipating and I am glad to say that the prospective Finance Minister and the think-tank of the UNP, my good Friend, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, has rebelled against that thinking because he is a Member of Parliament. He is not seated in an air-conditioned room with an adding machine cutting and chopping figures, because every weekend people come to visit him. They come to his office. They make demands. They want Samurdhi. That is the flesh and blood of a politicians life. So, naturally you have to respond to that. I see my honourable Friend in the Opposition nodding. Growth is important and we are to have a balance. Politics and budgeting is all about getting the correct balance. You may have an argument that it is not the correct balance. We can say, it is the correct balance.

That is a legitimate debate. But, we cannot have a serious debate on the grounds of looking at the figures and saying, you can cut these; you can cut these; you can cut these and then you can have a balanced budget. That is not the debate. So, I want to emphasize that the key element of this Budget is sustained growth. If we are to have sustained growth, it stands to reason that you have to invest in that growth; you have to find the money for that growth and it is the nature of our economy that we cannot domestically produce that amount of money that is needed for growth. If you are willing to lead a substandard life - they are saying that only ministers do not like to lead a substandard life - then, of course, with what we get domestically we can live like that. If you want to skip meals, if you want to get salary cuts, if you do not want a bus service, if you want to walk to your work place, of course, you can depend on your national savings, what you generate locally, local taxes alone and do that. But, nobody wants that. We are not in politics to give that. We are in politics to go beyond that stage and get growth in the country. For that, we have to borrow. Though there was a big song and dance about borrowing, I want to tell you what this great - ( ) (The Presiding Member)

Hon. Minister, please wind up your speech. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I have been given 40 minutes. I have just started. ( ) (The Presiding Member) No, Hon. Minister, you have been given 17 minutes. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I have been given 40 minutes. Please check it. ( ) (The Presiding Member) You have been given 17 minutes. We have one more speaker, the Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha. He has got 10 minutes. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Well, in a non-controversial way I am trying to develop an argument. Anyway, I will take five more minutes and stop. So, I will not go into the details of what I have brought, except to say that America, the West, the world is in debt to the tune of 1400 per cent of GDP. The

2008 08 3535 3536

American debt alone is about US Dollars 600 trillion. So, this debt is relative and I want to say that the Sri Lankan debt ratio has been coming down. It is now something around 85 per cent of GDP. It has come down from 120 per cent of GDP in the past. As a result of investing this money, there is an expansion of our economy, of our wealth and the ratio of debt to GDP comes down. That is quite normal. That is the answer to this and much of our debt is on concessionary terms. The answer that I want to give to my Friends from the JVP is that most of it is project aid. We are not using that money as establishment costs. We are using this money for projects. I want to read out to you the names of some of these projects and ask you whether they are not worthwhile. Look at the investments we have made. We have done the Southern Highway, the Southern Transport Development Project, the Road Network Improvement Project, the National Highways Development Project, the Outer Circular Highway for Colombo, the reconstruction of the Mannar Bridge and Causeway, the Batticaloa-Trincomalee Road and the Padeniya-Anuradhapura Road. Then, what about the developments in the power sector? There is the Norochcholai Coal-power Plant, the Upper Kotmale Hydropower Plant, the Kerawalapitiya Transmission Line Project which we are opening tomorrow. Then what about Uma Oya Hydropower Project? All these projects are funded with advantages and concessionary terms from countries that have recently been lending very generously to us such as Iran, India, China and Japan. They are mega donors and they are giving these funds on very concessionary terms. So, the question is not whether we are taking loans. There is a question, I accept. We must use them properly and make sure that the money we borrow is used for the particular project which we have promised to implement, implement it properly and make it useful for the generations to come. So, Madam Chairperson, since you are not giving me time ( ) (The Presiding Member)

I gave you four minutes extra. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

Okay. I think I must wind up my speech now. But, I want to say that as far as this Budget is concerned, our objective is clear. We are going for 6 per cent growth and we are getting it by national savings, by taxation and so on which I have tried to show. The commodity downturn in the world will not impinge on the cost of living of this country as evidenced by the fact that our inflation has come down. Next month it will be 18 per cent. It has come down from 26 per cent. By the end of 2009, we are hoping to go into a single digit inflation. So, there is a strategy, there is an objective.

I am glad that my good Friend, the Hon. John Senewiratne is present here. He has done a wonderful job in the power sector. He has completely transformed the power sector. Take for example, the Norochcholai Coal-power Plant. Tomorrow he is opening the Kerawalapitiya Power Plant. Then, what about the Uma Oya Hydropower Project? I am told that they have just signed the Agreement. Then, take the Upper Kotmale Hydropower Project. The other day he showed the video of that to the Cabinet. So, things are happening. Lastly, I want to make an appeal to this House. When it comes to national economic growth in parameters, let us agree. We can have differences of opinion in interpretation, figures and so on. But, I want to make this appeal. I know that there are very responsible Members in the Opposition, not all, but, there are some. So, I would like to appeal to them to co-operate in making 2009 a growth year for Sri Lanka. Thank you, Madam. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Thank you. . .

Thank you very much, Madam, for giving me this opportunity to speak at the culmination of another Budget. As you know, this Budget has been presented at a time when the economy is at an absolutely low ebb, in chaos; devaluation is taking place, the world is in a financial meltdown and through that process, all we can basically say is that we are in deep trouble.

The problem is not whether you have good budgets or bad budgets. The problem you have is of a fundamental nature, as to how it is carried forward. That is the main problem with this Budget. It is fundamentally flawed. There is no idea as to where this economy is heading. There is no commitment from the Government. They only want the people to suffer on the glorification and wishful thinking of the 110 Ministers. Hon. Chairman, I think it is my bounden duty - . . ,

"Sri Lanka export earnings dropped by 9.4 per cent in September", states the Central Bank. exports . , " " . . ? , " . " . . Hon Minister, you know from the Stock Exchange that Rs. 90 billion was invested by foreigners in this country. Now, it has dropped to Rs. 19.3 billion. There is an outflight because they know that this Government is not adhering to its commitments. Then, the weaker Indian Rupee has ensured Sri Lankan exports to turn into Indian

imports and now we have a double problem. While cheaper imports are coming in from India to Sri Lanka, no exports are going to India. I am only referring to India. Exports out of India is becoming more dearer than Sri Lankan exports. Hon. Minister, your people are capable people. In your Government of 110 Ministers, are you not discussing the impact of the Government? After all, look at the latest statement of the HSBC. Your Government borrowed money from them last time. When we told, "Do not do this" and when the Hon. Leader of the United National Party said, "We will ensure that these types of borrowings are not allowed to be carried forward, you all laughed. What is happening today? Today you are paying 8 1/2 per cent interest when it can be brought down to 3 per cent. Now, that is being traded on the secondary market at 22 per cent. So, that shows the weakness of the economy of Sri Lanka. Look at the ratings that have been given by HSBC. The rating of Pakistan and Sri Lanka is "3C". That is the rating we have got. While India is "2B" China is "2". So our economy is heading towards disaster. You must understand that when you ruin the economy, we, the UNP has to put it right. You must ensure that it is handed over in a condition that it can be resurrected. That is the problem we are faced with. So, Mr. Chairman, recently there was a debenture issue of the Bank of Ceylon. That is something which climaxes, because within one month you were trying to get public funds. You were unable to get that. You only got Rs. 670 million. But what happened? The BoC debt debenture issue was oversubscribed. Who has subscribed to that? Two billion rupees from the Army Welfare Fund, one billion rupees from the Bank of Ceylon Pension Fund and only Rs. 677 million from public funds. So, Hon. Prime Minister, your Government is in trouble. We are basically trying to ensure that the economy is protected. After all, what you ruined, we have been resurrecting like we did in 2001. We brought fundamentals into play, we brought a negative growth into a positive growth and at the end of the day you used that and managed to go on a little longer. Owing to the fact that you will lose the Executive Presidency you dissolved our government. When our Leader went overseas and brought Rs. 45,000 million into the development of this country, you were worried. Today, you cannot get a red cent. There is a US Dollar 300 million syndicated loan from the Standard Chartered Bank. Not a guy is putting a dollar into that. That is the stark reality. At this moment, the ICICI Bank has withheld the US Dollars 25 million loan being given to the Government. Why? They are worried as to whether this Government is going to be bankrupt. The Commercial Bank - [Interruption.] Listen, Hon. Aluthgamage, it is more wiser to listen than to shout. Listen, like the other Colleague from the Kandy District, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama. On this particular basis, the Commercial Bank has posted Rs. 1.2

3545 3546

billion as possible write-off owing to the hedging factor. Now, the Government that was hedging is trying to fudge us. No fudging is permitted. We have presented a No-Confidence Motion against your Government because you have lied to yourself. You come to this House and say that nobody knew it. Then, when we went before the court regarding the hedging factor, the court quite rightly gave the judgment on behalf of the people of this country. Then, the Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie comes to this House and says, Do not blame only me. I am part of it. The entire Cabinet gave approval for it. Then, what about Nivard Cabraal? He is the architect of this. He basically hides behind and tries to put these forward, thinking that he can get exonerated. We will ensure that every single person who is behind this national treacherous act is exposed and justice prevails. These people are not expected to play folly according to the fantasies of their voyage of discoveries. You all knew what you were going into. When you were getting US Dollars 27 million, nobody questioned as to why you were getting that US Dollars 27 million. But, when you are going to fork out as of this moment, Hon. Chairman - [Interruption.] Well, if you have got some jokers in this House, my strong advice is to put them out or bring another court order to make them say, "I am sorry, I will not make any noise in this House". I do not want to waste time. But, all we want to say is that hedging has impacted the national economy to the tune of Rs. 110 billion. Today, thanks to the Supreme Court; we have managed to put a stop to this. But, what has happened now. The Standard Chartered Bank, the Citibank and the HSBC are not opening LCs anymore. They say, Okay, you are going to hide behind this. We will not give you money owing to the fact that your country is ill-equipped. In the circumstances you have two options: either you have got to strengthen your currency or you have got to bring more dollars into this country. So, at a time when we have got to speak at the winding up of this final debate, all we can say is - ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Ratnatilaka)

If you want to do it, do it in the proper way. You must bring the Resolution to increase the salary in the proper way. We have a responsibility here. ? . We, in the UNP decided that we cannot support this because of the fact that the Constitutional Council has not been appointed. But, now we are seeing a far more serious issue about which there has been no reply from the Government. So, how can you proceed with this? How can we in this House now say that we are agreeable to this when this serious charge has not been replied to in any way by any Member? I do not think the Hon. Ministers know what to say about this. I do not blame them.
