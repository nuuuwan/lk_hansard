: : PRIVILEGE : THREATS MADE OVER TELEPHONE ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

Mr. Speaker, as you are aware, according to the letter I wrote to you last Friday, I have launched a new media unit called Defence Watch for the specific purpose of countering the highly misleading defence-related news items of the present Government. The present regime while claiming to be waging a war against terrorism, is in fact exploiting, endangering and sacrificing the lives of many of our valiant armed forces as well as those of innocent Tamil civilians in the North, in order to pursue a sinister political agenda of establishing a dictatorial police State. As a person committed to democracy, moderation and racial harmony, I feel that I can no longer remain silent in the face of this insidious attempt to bury our much-cherished democratic traditions. In fact, as a senior Member of Parliament, I feel that I also owe it to the people who have placed their trust in me over the last 20 years, to raise my voice against this conspiracy to deceive and mislead this country. It is in this context that I held the first press conference of Defence Watch on the 4th of November, 2008. At this media briefing, I presented facts and figures, which contradict the propaganda machinery of the present Government, and also I revealed the existence of several secret committees under the Secretary of Defence, who had been assigned with the task of preparing a blueprint for a police State and to suppress the democratic opposition to the Rajapaksa Regime.

2008 11 775 776

The following day, I started receiving highly-abusive and threatening telephone calls and I was told in no uncertain terms that my life will be in jeopardy if I continue with Defence Watch and I was specifically asked not to criticize the Secretary of Defence or the Army Commander. The numbers in question are 0112307013 on which I received a telephone call at 2.24 p.m. and then, subsequently I received another telephone call on 0112304063 at 4.53 p.m. In fact after that, there were several telephone calls from land-lines which I did not answer. As you will surely agree, this is a serious impediment to my rights as a Member of Parliament. In fact, I attempted several times to speak to the Inspector-General of Police without much success. Then I informed the Director of the MSD who in turn requested me to get in touch with the SSP, Panadura. He promised to send a police team on the 6th of November to record my statement along with all the telephone numbers in question. So far no one from the police has come. This may not be the fault of the police as I have reliable inside information that they are being pressurized by a leading official in the Ministry of Defence not to record my statement. However, I am actually thankful to you, Sir. I know that you have already taken some action on the letter I wrote to you. As the custodian of the safety and security of all Members of Parliament, again I earnestly request you to urgently intervene in this matter and make sure that the police conduct this inquiry properly. And, also I request you, Sir, to refer this matter to the Committee on Privileges under Standing Order 127. Thank you. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Palitha Range Bandara) , . - [ ] . [ ] .

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Nahumaduhu nuwasaliala rasulihil kareem.. ammaabaadh Mr. Presiding Member, the Budget is perhaps one of the most important instruments of governance. In my view, this Budget that we are talking about is a tool for the implementation of social, political and economic policies and priorities which have an impact on the lives of us all. I was happy that the first part of the speech of the Hon. Minister of Environment on the impact of the global economy and the climate change on the economies of the world was very educative, though I did not agree with the latter part of his speech. The problem with a Budget is that it is hard to fill up one hole without digging another. Today, I would like, as a person who spent 29 years in the private sector, to air the various views expressed by this sector on the Budget rather than dissect it politically. We all agree that the discussion of the Budget for 2009, is being overshadowed by the increasing gloom in the global economy and the impending anxieties that are gripping our economy. The global recession is of a magnitude that is described as the worst since the great depression of the 1930s. What would be its impact on the driving forces of our economy? Agricultural and industrial exports, remittances from abroad, tourism, foreign investment, foreign borrowings and the depreciation of the rupee on the cost of living have been the issues of real concern which have led to the lack of business confidence in our country today especially due to the high rates of inflation resulting from poor economic management. Over the years, our Budgets have not been taken seriously - as you can see today, the Minister in charge of the subject of Finance is not in the House - as the figures that would ultimately turn out at the end of the year, would be quite different to those presented. This has happened so often. Even if the figures are in fact realistic, it would be difficult to convince anyone that it is so. Such

[ ]

2008 11 847 848

is the degree of scepticism about the Budget mainly due to supplementary estimates that distort the original expenditures on the one hand, and taxation measures that are introduced at intervals of time after its presentation. In fact, we have had eight such interventions after the Budget was presented for this year, 2008. Although the Budget, as the centre-piece of Government policy should address the fundamental issues facing the economy such as the curtailment of Government expenditure to be aligned to expected realistic revenues, there is very little done to address these fundamental economic issues. This Budget is not seen to anticipate potential impacts of the spreading global economic slowdown, to be able to defend our economy. On the other hand, the global recession is likely to have serious implications on the vital sectors of our economy. I spent over 22 years in the apparel industry holding managerial positions and as Chief Executive Officer/Managing Director of several companies for over eight years, before entering this House. The export industry which contributes US Dollars 3.2 billion is perhaps the largest contributor to our economy, accounting for approximately 10 per cent of GDP and employing nearly 270,000 people. The industry will face a tough year next year with slowing demand in key markets and the likelihood of loss of GSP Plus duty free exports to Europe. Exports to the USA, the biggest market till recently, were down by 11 per cent in the first six months of this year while shipments to the European Union markets were up by 12.6 per cent. There is top-line pressure on retailers in our principal overseas markets. Several of our buyers are downsizing and now, after the financial crisis, the situation has got worse. We are definitely going to face serious issues next year. Buyers of garments from the UK market have already indicated a downturn in the numbers of orders. Last month, the share of exports to the USA fell to 48 per cent. For the first time in the history of the garment industry we are exporting more to the EU than to the USA. This is significant because we are losing our market share. The main reason for the EU market growth was the GSP Plus trade facility under which we export to the EU duty free. We may very well lose this facility towards the middle of next year because of differences between our Government and the EU over their concerns about alleged human rights abuses in our country under the guise of the ongoing war. The GSP Plus deal comes up for renewal by the end of this year and according to the GSP Plus regulations, even if it is not renewed, the scheme will continue until May 2009, and very probably for six months after that. So there will be no serious effect on exports for the first six months of 2009. Should this lapse, the Government has

promised support for the industry to help exporters cope with the loss of the trade benefit, which would in turn cost the Treasury approximately US Dolllars 100 million. Now, how on earth are we going to find the money to finance this, but by borrowing and at what cost? Today 105 apparel factories account for 87 per cent of our clothing exports and 150 factories the balance. By the end of 2009, this total could fall to 200. A lot of consolidation is taking place and the small and medium industry is struggling because of problems in the industry and the country today. Large players will get larger and there will be mergers. Smaller factories would probably end up tying up in one way or the other in manufacturing and be bought up by larger players. This will mean a significant loss of employment at all levels and the vicious cycle continues. Now let us take the largest agricultural export of this country, tea. Around six million kilograms of tea pass through the auction each week amounting to almost 300 million kilograms a year and exports last year amounted to a staggering US Dollars one billion. In the past few weeks, tea prices have plunged sharply from record peaks and stocks are being left unsold at the auctions, leaving growers, manufacturers and brokers in a cash flow crisis. The Chairman of the Tea Exporters Association, Jayantha Keragala is quoted as saying, This is part of a global crisis that has started, and none of us can see what will happen in the next few months. All commodities are on a downward trend and the buyers are adapting to this.

The decline in the price of tea is a serious issue. Prices have fallen by over 25 per cent in recent months. This in itself would not have posed a serious difficulty had the tea industry not adjusted itself to the recent boom in prices and consequently increased its cost structures.

The windfall in tea and rubber prices enabled both crops to cope with the increases in cost of production owing to the domestic inflationary pressures. In addition, costs of production rose owing to wage increase, partly in order to enable workers to cope with the high costs of basic living. The tea industry was able to pay these higher wages owing to the high prices for tea. Now tables have turned with the decrease in tea prices. Consequently, the tea industry is once again caught in a cost price squeeze. In the past, and I believe it was in the 80s, the government introduced tea, rubber and coconut stabilization funds. The industry was to siphon off a part of earnings when prices were high to the fund to assist the industry when prices were low according to a set formula. It did not work then as prices were consistently low and the Government decided to use Rs. 700 million that was in the stabilization funds to reduce the budget deficit.

849 850

( ) (The Presiding Member) , .

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. M. M. Naoshaad)

Once again the Government is attempting to stabilize tea prices by purchasing tea at a floor price. If international tea prices remain at current levels for long, then such financial support could be unsustainable, especially as tea stocks are time-bound and stockpiling for long periods is not a sustainable option.

The third and more serious danger on the economic horizon is the likelihood of remittances from abroad declining. In recent years, remittances have been rising sharply owing to the increase in income in oil producing countries of the Middle-East. Both wages and the numbers employed have been increasing and consequently remittances have increased sharply. For instance, in 2007 the inflow of remittances increased significantly and financed about 70 per cent of the countrys imports. Around 57 per cent of our inward remittances are from the Middle-East and about 27 percent from Europe. There are serious fears that the fall in income of the Middle-Eastern oil income would reduce remittances. This fear may be somewhat exaggerated, as inward remittances come from a wide variety of countries that include the US, European countries, Australia, East Asia, et cetera.

Considering all these factors, it is most likely that we will not see the kind of increase in remittances that was witnessed in recent years but remittances may not decline as such in the near future. Instead there could be a deceleration in remittances next year.

The adverse impacts of the global conditions are severe for our small export-import economy. The bashing from many fronts: decrease in prices for tea and rubber exports, dwindling industrial export incomes, a deceleration in remittances and lower inflow of foreign investment. All these external shocks are likely to affect employment conditions, incomes and economic growth. In this context, over-reacting to the current gloomy expectations may lead to wrong policies in a mistaken direction. It will be the task of economists and experts to determine the extent and duration of the external shocks and adjust domestic economic policies to cope with them. Fiscal policy would be an important component of the response. Yet, what is disturbing is that there is inadequate attention to these fundamental issues in this years Budget that could change the impact of the effects of the world recession.

Let us look at the different implications of this Budget: Fiscal Fiscal estimates over past three years were optimistic compared to outcomes. Investment sacrificed to achieve Budget deficit target Debt is rising. Debt servicing absorbs most of revenue. Debt: GDP ratio is a poor indicator due to high inflation. Many measures populist rather than practical COL Allowance increase and other relief measures may soon be eroded in real terms unless revenue and expenditure targets are met and inflation curbed sustainably. Higher taxes on imports may raise inflation and affect citizens expectations at higher per capita incomes, more than raising domestic output, without other inputs. Giving protection to local industrialists through tariffs can increase the profits of local enterprises by victimizing the common man and forcing him to buy goods at high prices and limiting his choice. But, such taxes cannot help exporters, who have to compete in foreign markets against more efficient producers from other countries. That is why import substitution policies have failed in the past and have simply victimized the common man and allowed select businesses to make profits even by selling low quality goods. Real Unrealistic growth and inflation estimates have affected revenue and expenditure estimates. Target revisions have all been downwards. External factors had both positive and negative effects on incomes and prices, but analysis is imbalanced. Oil, tea, rubber, migrant worker remittances. Impact of declining consumer demand not addressed adequately. Growth is being dampened; hence Government revenues will fall further. Government borrowings is crowding out private investment. While Government has increased healthily, inability to meet targeted investment expenditure affects future growth and fiscal targets adversely, as seen in recent past. External External account unsteady. BOP - balance of payment surplus in 2007 achieved through commercial borrowing, not earnings. Trade deficit in 2008 widened relative to migrant worker remittances and net service receipts, needs alternate financing.

2008 11 851 852

External commercial debt is rising. DSR debt service ratio doubled in three years. Global crisis and domestic factors will raise costs and new borrowings. Reserves declined repaying debt and defending rupee. Already restrictions on imports (IC requirement since November and Budget) How do we meet essential import costs and debt service payment in the longer term. Monetary Monetary conditions not stable either. Credit growth has shrunk, especially to private sector. This will impact on economic expansion and thereafter on Government revenue. Yet interest rates remain negative and exchange rate was steady in October. We are now forced to adjust one or the other soon for macroeconomic stability, similar to what happened in January 2001. Spent Dollars 790 million to prop up the rupee against the dollar. CBSL accommodation of Government borrowing, which rose to Rs. 92 billion by early November not healthy. Is the entire impact on reserve money balanced by loss of reserves? Our dollar reserves according to the Central Bank were down to US Dollars 2.6 billion in October compared to US Dollars 3.5 billion in August. Analysts have warned that the process known as sterilized intervention is a recipe for a currency crisis. We had a similar situation in 2000/2001 which pushed the country into its first economic contraction in post-Independence history.

General Expectations Ideally, an annual Budget should analyse the previous performance against economic targets set and give reasons for difference. The analysis should stress on both strengths and weaknesses of performance. It should include both positive and negative effects of the domestic and external environment.

( ) (The Presiding Member) , .

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. M. M. Naoshaad)

Just give me two minutes. Historically, monitoring of outcome versus targets has been very poor in our Budget analysis and documents and this is no exception.

I will fail in my duty if I do not warn the Government that in reality, you are emotionally and dangerously dancing to the tune of the piped piper of Vanni, the LTTE supremo. Though you have convinced a majority of the majority that fighting the LTTE at any cost is the only option available, you are bleeding the country into a financial abyss. This is exactly what Velupillai Prabhakaran has always been wanting successive governments to do, engage him militarily and take the country to economic doom. He has always known that he cannot win the war militarily but he could win economically. The grim statistics of the war finally disclosed for October were, 171 security forces personnel were killed and 1122 were injured, 38 civilians were killed and 62 were injured. ( ) (The Presiding Member) . Before I conclude, I will just quote what Abraham Lincoln, the late President of the United States of America, said: You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong. You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift. You cannot enrich the poor by impoverishing the rich. You cannot establish sound security on borrowed money. You cannot help the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer You cannot build character and courage by taking away mans initiative and independence. You cannot further the brotherhood of man by inciting class hatred. You cannot keep out of trouble by spending more than you earn. You cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they could and should do for themselves. Finally, I conclude by quoting what Voltaire, the French philosopher and author said: It is dangerous to be right, when the Government is wrong Thank you. [.. 2.49] ( )
