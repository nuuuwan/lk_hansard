[.. 11.20] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Ven. Presiding Member, I rise today to join this House in expressing our heartfelt condolences to the family of the late Hon. Maheswaran and to record our sentiments. The Hon. Maheswaran was a multifaceted personality. Those who came to know him would always remember him for his rebellious conduct and in the meantime, very comical approach to life. He was in a way, a very philosophical person. I remember, when I encountered him a few months back in Parliament and inquired as to why he was absent for a while from Parliament, since I had not seen him for quite a while within the Chamber, he said with a smile, If Maheswaran is not in the House, you can be sure that there would not be enough excitement. When I asked him as to why he said that, as if he had a premonition of what would happen within the House and is it why that he was keeping away, he said, I had some urgent business matters to attend to, and I did not have the time to come, but I have been monitoring as to what is happening. It is very frustrating when you see the inconclusive nature of the matters in this country". In my opinion, the finest hour of the Hon. Maheswarans politics was the day in which he barged into the House - a very agitated and hostile Member - and raised a point of Order on the issue of the sudden eviction of Tamils from Colombo's lodges and private dwellings, which took place a few months ago. I was seated among the Government Benchers at that time as a Minister and was a witness to the theatricals that took place when he, in utter frustration and in a very agitated mood, went ahead, removing his shirt and throwing it on to the Chamber. The disturbed Chair at that time warned him not to engage in such theatricals and wanted him to calm down. But, such was Maheswarans nature. His outrage was very sincere. We felt that his emotions and rebellious conduct were quite justified. When it came to my turn at the Party Leaders Meeting that was summoned soon after the Hon. Maheswarans lengthy disposition to this House on that day, I told my Colleagues in the Government that the Government ought to unequivocally express their regrets to the Tamil community of this country. They in fact did so. Thereafter, the Leader of the House expressed his regret and no less a person than of the calibre of the Prime Minister also expressed his sincere regrets to the Tamil community for the conduct of the security forces on that day. We have also heard the Hon. Maheswaran, on many similar occasions in this House, raising issues pertaining to the grievances of his community, when it came to

harassment, intimidation and perpetual discrimination his people are subjected to in everyday life in the current climate. His voice in this House was not involved in raising deep-seated controversial issues such as the intractable constitutional problems which confront our nation. He was more concerned with the rights of his people to live as equal citizens in this country. Let us not forget that the Hon. Maheswaran represented a national Party in Parliament, perhaps for the first time after 1952. All of us know, Venerable Presiding Member, that 1956 was a watershed in the national politics of this country. In 1952, the United National Party had several Members representing the Jaffna peninsula including KKS. In 1956 we saw a reversal of fortunes when the South was swept with a nationalist fervour that changed the political destiny of this country. In 1952, even the late S.J.V. Chelvanayakam lost his seat. But in 1956, ten Members were returned on behalf of the Federal Party and there began a long journey a very tortuous and a difficult journey for the fight in the struggle to achieve the parity of status that they wanted in this country. We have come a long way and the Hon.Maheswarans entry into politics in 2001 also brought about the enactment of the Ceasefire Agreement and I was a part of that Government. The Hon. Maheswaran was also sworn in as the Minister for Hindu Religious Affairs. The Hindu community in this country, I am sure, is forever indebted to Maheswaran for the bold initiatives that he took to help the cause of Hindus and to rehabilitate and reconstruct many affected and damaged Hindu Kovils all over the country. I remember him fighting with the then Prime Minister, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe to get sufficient funds allocated to his Ministry. The other Ministers and I had many such misgivings trying to get sufficient funds allocated for the necessary development work that was assigned to us. But, after much hassle and persuasion, he managed to get about Rs. 200 million. A religious dignitary of a particular temple in the Ampara District in a place called Manikkamadu, a very small village in the Samanthurai Electorate, approached me at that time to get some assistance through the Hon. Maheswaran. When I spoke to him, he readily agreed to come along with me to go to Samanthurai and visit this temple. Such was Maheswarans magnanimity and readiness to assist his people and their causes. To us, the image of his young daughter who was weeping and wailing in sorrow and agony is something that we could never forget on the day he passed away. We saw similar images of Ravirajs children flashed all over our newspapers when he was assassinated in the streets of Colombo. Today, we see controversy surrounding the magisterial inquiry pertaining to his untimely demise. His counsel has asked that the identification parade be repeated once again, since the witnesses have failed to identify the assassin who was

4 PL 002744 (2008/01)

417 418

arrested. There had been many controversial statements that have been made. There has been questions on the IGPs conduct in expressing his opinion as to who was behind the assassination. All of us know that Maheswaran had faced some problems from the LTTE in the past. It is no secret. When he had to contest the General Elections of 2004, the United National Party had to shift him to Colombo, because there was some pressure on him to contest with my Colleagues here from the ITAK list. But, that should not detract from the need to have a balanced and credible investigation being launched into the circumstances in which this cold-blooded assassination took place. Particularly, the Government has come under a lot of criticism for the removal and reduction of his security. Some of us who are now in the Opposition raised this issue way back on 12th December. I raised a matter of Privilege in this House on the drastic reduction of security to some of us and brought it to the attention of the Speaker. In fact, up to now, though the Speaker has intervened, our security has not been restored to the levels to which we enjoyed when we were previously in the Opposition during the tenure of the same Government. In those circumstances we are compelled today to seek redress from the judiciary since there has been no proper response to our plea. We must remember that these are times in which the Hon. Douglas Devananda who is a Minister in the Government himself has called for the disarming of various armed groups in the Eastern Province, if elections are to be held. Such is the climate in which we are living today. Therefore, Venerable Presiding Member, the Hon. Maheswaran and his legacy leaves many questions unanswered when it comes to secrecy surrounding his assassination. Of course, when the assassin was taken into custody we expected the investigations to be concluded very quickly and we would be able to know the culprits. But up to now the issue remains a perpetual controversy. Added to that, we find new allegations being brought out implicating even television presenters such as Mr. Sri Ranga, the presenter of the "Minnal" programme on Shakthi TV. The fact that he conducted that programme and in that programme, the Hon. Maheswaran came out with some startling revelations which he was to openly disclose to this House on the 8th of January when we resumed Sittings has now become a matter for consideration by courts in the proceedings that are pending before the Magistrate. Be that as it may, we are looking for scapegoats all over. We have not yet found any clue to the assassination of the late Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham nor have we been able to solve the mystery surrounding the death of the late Hon. Raviraj. There are many other assassinations that took place before that, yet, no conclusive evidence has surfaced to find as to who was responsible for all those assassinations. But clearly in this instance, the reduction

of security that had been provided officially to the Hon. Maheswaran has put the Government in the dock. What we regret today is that the Government continues to disregard the reasonable request of the Opposition to restore security provided to Party Leaders and Members of Parliament who had been previously given enhanced security. With those words Venerable Presiding Member, I will say a few words in Tamil since it would be more appropriate as the Hon. Maheswaran represented that community in this House for two terms. , . , - . .
