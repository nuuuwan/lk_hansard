(b) Will he state the reason as to why a marks system was introduced by abolishing the hitherto followed system of considering 16 years of service when a police constable is promoted as a sergeant? (c) Will he admit that an injustice is caused to officers who do not engage in duties in the Presidential Security Division or at Elections when promotion are granted under the new marks system, as they do not get marks for that service even though the officers who fall short of 16 years of service by one or two months would definitely get their promotions at the next occasion of granting promotions, under the old system?

( ) (Mr. Speaker) - . ( . ) (The Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera) . ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) . ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, I have been following this matter. The powers of Parliament include ensuring the implementation of treaties, agreements and conventions. The Chief Opposition Whip referred to the United Nations Convention against Corruption. Recently, there had been the Sinharasa case taken up in the Supreme Court where it was said with regard to the Convention that legislative authority must be sanctioned by Parliament; a separate law must be passed and the mere fact that Sri Lanka has signed it, does not make it a law because in certain instances you have to pass legislation. That is why they referred to the ICCPR Optional Protocol, which has in any case, now become an issue internationally. Article 65 (1) of United Nations Convention against Corruption states, I quote: "Each State Party shall, take the necessary measures, including legislative and administrative measures, to ensure the implementation of its obligation under this Convention. Under the Convention, you have broken this up into two: legislative measures and administrative measures. As far as legislative measures are concerned, I do not

want to get into an argument on what has to be done. But here, the Chief Opposition Whip referred to administrative measures in relation to, according to the document I got from him, Article 6(2) of the Convention, which states, I quote: "Each State Party shall grant the body or bodies ........" To prevent corruption, the necessary independence, in accordance with the fundamental principles of its legal system, to enable the body or bodies to carry out its or their functions effectively and free from any undue influence. Article 11 (1) of the Convention states, I quote: each State Party shall, in accordance with the fundamental principles of its legal system .. take measures to strengthen integrity and to prevent opportunities for corruption in the prosecution services. So, he has raised this specific issue to point out that the transfer of the Director-General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, which is investigating certain issues including the MiG 29 deal, is a violation of this. The House can now enforce it because the President and the Cabinet are responsible to Parliament. Because it is an administrative matter, it can be enforced and it is also preventing the investigation of other cases pertaining to corruption such as the issue of the Sky Network (Pvt.) Limited, where the TRC has not issued a licence to Sri Lanka Telecom. Instead, they have been asked to purchase it from a private company which has no experience. Sri Lankan private operators like Digital and Suntel were given licences. We have no problem with it. The issue of Sri Lanka Telecom is one such case he was referring to. Now, having this administrative measure, under which both the President and the Cabinet are responsible to Parliament, this is a matter of Privilege of Parliament. What he was suggesting or what I understood from what he said is that, instead of debating this fully in the House, to call the Party Leaders and discuss that. Then we can define it. If we cannot agree at the Party Leaders Meeting, we will take it up in the House and define what the responsibility and the privilege of the House are in regard to implementing the Convention against Corruption. If the Government does not want to and is opposed to implementing this Convention, I hope not, let them say that in the House. But we think they are not opposed and what this administrative measure means is, finally they are responsible to Parliament. However, you have to enforce it. In view of the Sinharasa case, rather than debating it here, I also suggest that we go along with his proposal, debate and discuss this matter at the Party Leaders Meeting.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Convention Article 6. Convention ; . We will start again. Under List II, Parliament is responsible for the implementation of conventions. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) 6 (2) ? 6 ? ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) In page 156 of the Constitution, under Foreign Affairs of List II of the Thirteenth Amendment, , it states, I quote: implementing treaties, agreements and conventions. . According to Article 42 of the Constitution, the President is responsible to Parliament and according to Article 43 (1), the Cabinet is also responsible and answerable to Parliament. So, the Constitution envisages the duty of Parliament to take action when the Executive fails to act. Responsibility means, the Executive is responsible to Parliament and when the Parliament feels that the Executive has not acted, then we have the power to take action. This is in respect of the UN Convention against Corruption. As it was cited in the Sinharasa case, there may be a dispute on a matter when it has to be implemented by legislation. What he is suggesting is that the Party Leaders should discuss and now define the position. This is an administrative matter because this is pertaining to a transfer of a Director-General. It is not legal. It is administrative. I think he mentioned here the Sri Lanka Telecoms issue, where they are going to purchase a WiMax licence from Sky Network (Pvt.) Limited which has not been granted by TRC and it is to be investigated. You cannot do that without the Commission functioning. These are administrative matters. Therefore, to avoid any misunderstanding of the House we will define our jurisdiction on these matters at a meeting called by the Hon. Speaker with the Party Leaders. Thereafter, we will proceed to discuss this further.

Srikantha) Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the TNA, I would like to endorse the views that have been submitted by the United National Party as well as the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna on this issue. In addition, I would like to pose only one question, Mr. Speaker. With all the names of the nominees to be appointed to the Constitutional Council being given, what is the delay in appointing it? I believe when the Hon. Ministers seek to defend the inordinate delay or rather the inexcusable delay or rather the extraordinary delay in constituting the Constitutional Council, they are trying to defend the indefensible. There cannot be any excuse. One cannot simply hide behind anything to say that this can be delayed because the Constitution, Mr. Speaker, is a

2008 05 2595 2596

working document. One may not agree with this Article or that. One may have ones own reservations but one cannot simply whisk away any Article or rather any provision in the Constitution. I think anybody with a basic understanding of the law, namely, the Constitution, would agree that nobody can refuse to implement the Constitution, particularly when somebody is a creation of the Constitution. We are, in fact, the creation of the Constitution. The President himself is the creation of the Constitution. And, the Constitutional Council again needs to be a creation of the Constitution. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I think there is no point in wasting time. It should be constituted as early as possible. While it is being delayed, obviously for reasons well known to us, we find the sudden and rather unceremonial removal of the Head of an institution charged with investigation into very sensitive matters. What does it mean? What is the very motive behind it? What is the purpose behind it? We are entitled to ask that. People are talking in loud voices about good governance and the rule of law. Here we find a mockery is being made of this. Therefore, on behalf of the TNA, we would like to say that this involves a breach of privilege because we are entitled to debate this. Mr. Speaker, we are entitled to ask as to why there is a delay. It is all because of the delay or rather the refusal in constituting the Constitutional Council, all these things are happening. There is no point in saying that this had happened in the '50s, '60s, '70s or '80s. There is no point in saying that this has happened or this happened. My question is, what is happening now? What are you doing now? This is the question we seek to pose to the Hon. Members of the Government ranks who are my good Friends, who are quite fully well aware of the spiritual letter of the Constitution. I leave it at that, Mr. Speaker . . ( . . ) (The Hon. K. N. Choksy) Mr. Speaker, what I want to say is that there is a mandatory duty cast on the President by the Constitution to appoint this Constitutional Council. He has not done so nor does he give any reason for not doing so. If this House is informed of any valid reason, then we could consider the matter. But here the President keeps quiet. He does not reply to any of his Ministers. He does not give the House an explanation about the failure to perform a mandatory duty cast on him by the Constitution. If at all, the President himself should hold up the Constitution to the country and advise every citizen of the country to follow the Constitution. Here the person who is expected to do that is himself violating the Constitution with impunity and not giving this House a reason. So, it is best that the President puts an end to this festering sore and appoints the Constitutional Council so that this matter does not have to come up each time the House meets. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, so much of time was spent. Today so much of time is being spent on discussing the same matter over and over again without having a valid

explanation from the President as to why he is not doing it or a good reason put forward before this House as to why he cannot do it. So, I, with great respect, urge the President now to put an end to this matter, not let this sore to fester any more and appoint the Constitutional Council and have an end to a very unpleasant episode that has eaten into the body politic of this country over the last three or four weeks. I thank you, Mr. Speaker. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . ( ) (The Hon. Anura Dissanayake) , . - ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ? ( ) (The Hon. Anura Dissanayake) . . , 4 5 .

( - ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama - Minister of Foreign Affairs) , . . . . , . . , . ; . . . . . . . . , . If I may now speak, Mr. Presiding Member, on the recent visit of Ms. Angela Kane, what the Opposition tried to make out is that the UN Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Ms. Angela Kane is coming to Sri Lanka on a fact finding mission on behalf of the UN Secretary-General. She came but did she come on a fact finding mission or did she come in terms of the co-operation enhancement between our country and that of the United Nation system? I must state that much against the expectations of the Opposition that the visit of Ms. Angela Kane, the UN Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs proved very much how we are being positioned with that of the international community and in particular, with the United Nation system. I must assure this House that the central

objective of Ms. Kanes visit was aimed at strengthening United Nation-Government of Sri Lanka relations in the backdrop of various incidents in the recent past and mounting criticism of the UN in the Sri Lankan press. I pointed out to Ms. Kane that the incidents of criticism in the past were due to the fact that some members of the UN staff had acted in breach of the UN mandate, including participating in demonstrations orchestrated by the LTTE in the uncleared areas. I appreciated the prompt action taken by the United Nation headquarters to withdraw the staff concerned from Sri Lanka. I was assured that the UN would prevent a recurrence of any such activities in the future. That is because we have a very transparent approach for all these matters vis--vis that of the international community. We do not hide behind facts. We are bold enough to state to the international community for what as a nation we stand, for the people of our country in the enhancement of security needs and how we are going to address the political issues in this country through political solutions. His Excellency the President has gone on record repeatedly stating that all political issues have to be settled through political means and not through military means. But terrorism has to be countered in all its manifestations and forms as it deserves to be countered and that is why there is a military engagement targeting the LTTE which is being declared by the FBI recently as the most brutal terrorist organization in the whole world. This is our effort and the Opposition must take the point that the international community is fully behind Sri Lanka in countering terrorism and they are appreciative of our role in the political front. Ms. Kane who undertook a field visit to Batticaloa, which has the second largest UN staff presence in Sri Lanka, expressed her satisfaction on the development of the district, in particular the speedy resettlement of Internally Displaced Persons - IDPs. She also agreed that there is a need in the Eastern Province for transition from humanitarian projects to livelihood projects and pledged to explore further UN support towards this end.

On this occasion, I wish to place on record in this House the significant contribution being made by the staff of the United Nation agencies in Sri Lanka whose commitment and painstaking efforts have supported the endeavour of the Government to restore normalcy in areas affected by the present conflict, as it did in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami. Their continuing efforts across the country in the field of humanitarian relief and rehabilitation, health, education and infrastructure development are fully recognized and appreciated. It will not be lost sight of due to the actions of a few errant officers who have mistakenly been allowed into a system, that we believe continue to uphold the highest traditions of this service. So that is to say how we are working with the UN agencies.

2008 05 2619 2620

There is another development that I must cite here in this House. That is due to the prompt action taken by the Foreign Ministry both in Colombo and in the capitals, that we have succeeded in preventing the inclusion of Sri Lanka on the agenda of the forthcoming Asia-Europe Meeting, ASEM to be held in Beijing in October 2008, for which the preparatory meeting was held in Slovenia on the 2nd and 3rd of March 2008. The ASEM is an informal process of dialogue which initially brings together the EU member States and the European Commission, with the ASEAN countries as well as India and Pakistan. Sri Lankas capacity to avoid this surreptitious effort to include Sri Lanka on the agenda of the ASEM is a testimony to the fact that we do have friends of influence and that the Foreign Ministry has the capacity to successfully lobby them in times of need. Now, that is the support we are generating from the international community. I am not talking of history. I am talking of contemporary times. This is how we have been able to galvanize the support both in the ASEAN context and that of the European Union interests. It is how we are looking at matters. We take pre-emptive actions. We are proactive in terms of - ( ) (The Presiding Member) , .

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) , . . Recently there was a discussion on Sri Lanka in the House of Lords. The oral debate in the House of Lords in the United Kingdom on Sri Lanka on 27th December 2008 was instructive, for in the midst of much disinformation being repeated to please constituents, we saw a more informed debate initiated by Lord Naseby, who visited Sri Lanka last month and gathered a first-hand account of developments in the Island. Lord Naseby was to ask as to what assistance Her Majestys Government was offering to the Government of Sri Lanka following the recommendations of the All Party Representative Committee in that country. That is in Sri Lanka. Replying Lord Malloch Brown, the British Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Office was to observe that the Government of the United Kingdom supports the efforts of the APRC - now that is what is important - to devise a political solution to the conflict. It was also noted that the United Kingdom believed that full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment including the funding for the councils and greater emphasis on the official use of the Tamil language, can be a step forward.

Responding to Lord Naseby as to whether the United Kingdom should not be doing more to stop the millions of pounds that are going from the United Kingdom to continue the war, the Minister of State observed that he had made everything clear to Tamil UK nationals; that he thought it utterly inappropriate for them to contribute in any way that might be used to provide military arms for terrorist activities in Sri Lanka. So that is the stand taken by the United Kingdom and these are as latest as two months ago. The Seventh Session of the United Nations Human Rights Council opened in Geneva on 3rd March 2008, that is day before yesterday. My Colleague, the Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe speaking at the high level segment of the Human Rights Council on the 3rd has already briefed the Council on various aspects of Sri Lankas commitment towards the promotion and protection of human rights as well as the consistent policy of openness and transparency with the international community which is being followed by the Government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa. As stated by my Colleague in Geneva, Sri Lankas position is that, "While we do not hold ourselves above criticism from well-meaning and genuine partners" at the same time, "We do not however welcome efforts to denigrate and weaken us in the eyes of the international community to achieve propaganda games and to fulfil narrow politically motivated objectives". This will be the spirit of participation of the high-level delegation from Sri Lanka at the Human Rights Council that will continue in Geneva through the coming three weeks. We are confident that the international community will view the Sri Lankan developments in the context of a democracy that is fighting terrorism, whilst preserving fundamental freedoms of its people. Sir, the other aspect is the international response to the continuing political process in Sri Lanka. I must bring this to the notice of the House. The coming weeks should be important in further confirming to the world Sri Lankas commitment in empowering the people of the Northern and the Eastern provinces in managing their own affairs. On the 10th of March the election to the local bodies in the Batticaloa District would be a significant first step towards democratization of areas which were previously terrorized by the LTTE. The international community will be closely watching us as to how this process is concluded. It will be an indicator of the maturity shown by both the electors and those who will be elected to office. It will also be a curtain-raiser for the Provincial Council elections which will be held shortly, as proposed in the recommendations of the APRC of 23rd January.

So, this is how we are looking at the international dimension and I must thank the Hon. Presiding Member for giving me time. I think it is time that the Opposition should look at the dimension in the correct perspective in the national interest of Sri Lanka and I am happy to assure the House that the Government of Sri Lanka of President Mahinda Rajapaksa is doing everything best and has commanded the respect of the international community both in our military operations and that of our political process in the country.

30th January, 2008. Statement issued by Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi outlining reasons for not contesting Local Authority Elections in Batticaloa District. The reason for the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi not contesting Local Authority Elections to be held in the Batticaloa District on 10th March 2008, is our conviction that the forthcoming election will not be free and fair, and that consequently the result of the election would be a perversion of democracy. The T.M.V.P in alliance with the ruling U.P.F.A and also independently, is contesting the elections to the said local authorities. The T.M.V.P is and armed para-military group. It has moved around in the Eastern province, openly brandishing weapons. The T.M.V.P

displays strong armed presence in all parts of the Batticaloa District. It has freely used its weapons on the people. Extra-judicial killings in all parts of the Batticaloa District have been a common and continuing occurrence. Abductions and extortions are frequent occurrences. The Police and the Armed forces do not take any action against the cadres of the T.M.V.P. The Law enforcement machinery in the Batticaloa District is paralysed. No investigations are conducted nor any arrests made in regard to any crimes committed by the cadres of the T.M.V.P. It is the public belief that the T.M.V.P. enjoys the patronage of the present Government ; that the Police and Armed forces are hand in glove with the T.M.V.P; and will never enforce the law against the T.M.V.P. Consequently, the civilian citizenry experience a deep sense of insecurity. The people are gripped with the fear that the T.M.V.P. could with impunity inflict the penalty of dealth on any one, who offends them in anyway, as has happened in several instances. The climate of fear is compounded by the ruling U.P.F.A and the T.M.V.P being in electoral alliance with each other. This confirms the public fear that the rule of law could be violated by the T.M.V.P with impunity. The following are some of the atrocities committed by the T.M.V.P. against politicians. 1. The killing of Mr. Joseph Pararajasingham M.P. by shooting inside the Church premises at Batticaloa on Christmas eve 2005. 2. The rocket propelled grenade attack on the residence in Batticaloa of Mr. S. Jeyananthamoorthy M.P. Batticaloa, on 21st July 2007 and the subsequent murder of his step brother Mr. Thambipillai Thiyagachanthiran by shooting on 20th August 2007 at Batticaloa. 3. The abduction of Mr. K. Sasitharan at Batticaloa, son-in-law of Mr. T. Kanagasabai M.P. Batticaloa on 18th November 2007 and intimidation of death, so as to prevent Mr. Kanagasabai exercising his vote in Parliament at the 2nd reading of the Budget on 19th November 2007. 4. The abduction of Mr. P. Srikanthaseya at Batticaloa, brother of Mr. P. Ariyanenthiran M.P. Batticaloa; the abduction of Mr. Arunachelan Sivapatham at Batticaloa, nephew of Mr. S. Jeyananthamoorthy M.P. Batticaloa; the abduction of Mr. R. Nagalingam at Batticaloa, Personal secretary of Ms. K. Thangeswary M.P. Batticaloa; accompanied by intimidation of death of all three persons, so as to prevent the said three Members of Parliament from voting in Parliament at the 3rd reading of the Budget on 14th December 2007. The aforesaid four Members of Parliament of the Batticaloa District have also been consistently threatened with death by the T.M.V.P. The aforesaid matters were brought to the notice of the Government at the highest levels but to action was taken against the T.M.V.P. or its cadres. 5. The following Members of Local Authorities of the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi elected to Local Authorities in the Amparai and Trincomalee Districts in March 2006 have been shot and killed by the T.M.V.P. (I) Mr. Gopalasundaram Pathmakalapan, Member of the Seruvilla Pradesha Sabha, Trincomalee District on 30th October 2006. (II) Mr. Thangarasa Ithayarasa, Member of the Kinniya Town Council Trincomalee District on 26th January 2007. (III) Mr. Thilainyagam Uthayakumar the Chairman of the Thirukkovil Pradesha Sabha, Amparai District on 26th June 2007. (IV) Several other local politicians have been killed. (V) Several other local politicians have been abducted.

6. Numerous other extra judicial executions of civilians in the Eastern Province particularly in the Batticaloa District have taken place in 2006, 2007, and are continuing. It is reasonably estimated that around 400 Civilians have been victims of extra judicial executions or enforced disappearances at the hands of the T.M.V.P. in the Batticaloa District after mid 2006. It is also widely known that Professor S. Raveendranath, the Vice-chancellor of the Batticaloa University was abducted within a High Security Zone in Colombo by the T.M.V.P. and it is widely believed now, that he has been killed. Despite the Government having been informed at the highest level no action was taken to save Professor Ravendranath. None of the aforesaid killings have been investigated by the law enforcement authorities nor have any arrests been made. The Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission, Human Rights Organisations and Independent Media personnel, have widely reported on the outrageous criminal activities of the T.M.V.P in the Batticaloa District. Neither the Government nor the law enforcement authorities have taken notice of such reports. The Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi is convinced that the Government will not take any legal action, against the T.MV.P. for any of its crimes, and will give the T.M.V.P a free hand to commit such crimes during the current electoral process. The Tamil people of the Eastern Province have since 1956, overwhelmingly supported the policies of the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi at all electoral processes, at all levels, Parliamentary, Provincial, District or Local. They have supported the ITAK which stood for substantial autonomous rule in the areas of their historical habitation, the North Eastern region, based on a federal arrangement. The people of the Northern Province have supported the same policy at all levels. In fact, the T.M.V.P leader Karuna, unreservedly supported the Oslo Communique of December 2002, and the Interiam Self Governing Authority proposals of October 2003, which stood for the right to internal self determination in the areas of historical habitation of the Tamil speaking people - the North - Eastern region, based upon a federal arrangement, within a united country. At the Local Authorities elections held in the Amparai and Trincomalee Districts in March 2006, the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi was overwhelmingly victorious in the predominately Tamil areas, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress was similarly victorious in the predominantly Muslim areas, and the said two parties were victorious in the mixed Tamil and Muslim areas. The fundamental cause of the current conflict, is the failure of successive governments to accept Democratic Pluralism and meaningfully recongnise the democratic electoral verdicts of the Tamil people. The Government is now attempting to subvert this democratic political history of the Tamil people, through an undemocratic electoral process at the Batticaloa local authority elections, with the armed might of the T.M.V.P. The people of the Batticaloa District are aware of the manner in which military operations were conducted by Government forces with total disregard for the safety of Tamil Civilians and Tamil habitations. Over 300 Tamil civilians were killed as a result of aerial bombing and multi barrel rocket fire. Very many hundreds were gravely injured. Thousands of houses were destroyed or extensively damaged. Plantations and crops were destroyed. Live stock were killed. Vehicles, fishing and farming equipment were destroyed. Even the Government Agent Batticaloa was not able to freely send food or medicines to the affected people. Non Governmental Organisations were prevented or restricted in rendering humanitarian relief.Several people were drowned when they were fleeing from this military onslaught. The T.M.V.P worked with the Government forces to destroy Tamil lives and Tamil owned property.

Several hundreds of thousands of Tamil civilians were displaced and rendered destitute during the military operations in the Batticaloa District. These people are subjected to much deprivation, particularly as non governmental organizations do not have free access to serve these unfortunate people. These people are in no position to exercise their democratic wishes. No arrangements made can be an acceptable substitute for these people being able to exercise their franchise while resident in their homes, without fear or favour, as these persons have historically done. The T.M.V.P. claims that they support the policies of the Rajapakse Government. The Tamil people have suffered immensely at the hands of this Government and continue to suffer. Politically, this Government continues to reverse whatever progress was made towards a negotiated peaceful resolution of the conflict. The North-East merger which existed for over eighteen years has been held to have been irregularly done, after this Government came into power, and this Government is taking steps to institutionalise this position. After twenty years of efforts to evolve an acceptable solution, the Government is attempting to implement the outdated 13th amendment, in the North - East. The T.M.V.P. finds such policies of the Rajapakse Government acceptable. Such conduct on the part of the T.M.V.P. is highly questionable. Even the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress which held several ministerial positions in the Government have resigned their ministerial positions and crossed over to the opposition, accusing the Government of being unjust to the minority Muslim and Tamil people, particularly in the Eastern Province. The Government is concentrating on the Sinhalisation of the Eastern Province, High Security Zones have been declared in parts of the Eastern Province and Tamil people are being prevented from resettling. It is such a Government that the T.M.V.P. Wants the Tamil people to support. It is because the T.M.V.P even in these circumstances, supports the Government, that no action is taken to enforce the Law against the T.M.V.P. This is why the T.M.V.P is able to act with absolute impunity. The Local Authority Elections to be held in the Batticaloa District would be a Mockery of Democracy and a Travesty of Justice. It is for these reasons that the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi has decided not to participate in this illegitimate and farcical process. Mavai. S. Senathirajah General Secretary Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi

Sir, I will take this opportunity to speak a few words on the extension of the Emergency, the present situation in the country, the present situation with regard to the peace process, the military situation and the way forward. At this particular moment, all I could say is, we have a choice to make: whether it is war, a peaceful process or both. The intention of the Government has always been to show that it is a military pursuit with a political settlement. But, what has the political settlement come to? Has the military action led us forward? At the very outset, I would like to congratulate the military for all what they are doing. But, we oppose every movement made and every activity carried out by the Government to politicize such military victories. It is the United National Party that gave full thrust to the military to build its capability, knew its strength and used it at the time when it was most appropriate. Let us all learn from the dead past and courageously walk towards the future still not dawned. That is what we have got to do. But, in this process, we have got to ensure that it is a solution, not for some, not for a selected few, but for all. That is why the United National Party, at every given moment, has not only been talking, but also walking the chalk. This has led us to the situation that we are in at this particular moment. Sixty years after Independence, we still seem to be struggling to stand on our own feet. Various rhetorics are being expressed and at the end of the day, there are only headlines and deadlines. We give too little, too late. We look at it from a chauvinistic point of view. Various things have come up and at the end of the day, we do not see the wood for the trees. I, at this particular moment when we are debating the Emergency Regulations, would like to speak about a Colleague who is no more with us, the late Hon. Maheswaran. We remember his activities and the way he behaved in Parliament. He had been silenced owing to the fact that the military or the defence authorities did not provide him with the required security. Eighteen security personnel were there a week before the Vote on the Budget. Two or three days before the Vote on the Budget, the number of security personnel had been decreased to two and as a result, today the Hon. Maheswaran is no more. So, was the negligence or the inability of the police and the relevant people to provide the Hon. Maheswaran with the required security the reason for his absence from this House? We would like to know what the Government is doing about this. The Hon. Members of Parliament, irrespective of the side of the political divide they belong to, have been expressing their concern about this. The Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham was killed on Christmas day. The Hon. Raviraj was killed in November, 2006. Then we had the unfortunate killings of the Hon. Maheswaran and the Hon. D.M. Dassanayake.

2008 05 2655 2656

All of them were killed. But finally, we only seem to be talking and dancing around the issue instead of finding a solution. So, we call upon the Government to activate the process and find out who did these. Ten hours after the Hon. Maheswaran was killed, the IGP comes and says, Yes, he was caught; a former rebel operator has killed him. Then everything was in abeyance. After that, owing to the legal pressure put by the family and his party, the investigations stepped up. Again, the same accomplice is supposed to be the killer. To-date, we have only heard more rhetoric instead of getting an actual solution. Do not allow these types of matters to be swept under the carpet. While we talk about the late Hon. Maheswaran, we are duty-bound to raise these matters and I want an answer from the next speaker from that side who will speak after me. . . , 2007 18 " . : 2 ' - " , ? . ? ? , - - .. , . , ? , ? , , ? . . . . , . ; . . . , ? , . . , . , - - . ,

. . But we need a solution. Otherwise at the end of the day all this will be a waste of time. Remember, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, we spend Rs. 500 million a day on this war. It does not matter. The UNP does not grudge for a moment. If you are going to spend billions, never mind, but it must finish before a certain date. So, finish it off by 30th March. If everything is going to finish by 30th March, why are you going to burden the people? Why are you going to increase electricity charges? Why are you going to bring in more taxes? That is what we are asking. Do not for a moment misuse the United National Partys hand of cooperation that we have extended. The Hon. Dew Gunasekara knows more than anybody else and the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana will bear testimony to this. Whenever there was a necessity, we have not politicized, but helped you more than the partners of your own Government. Now, look at the situation that is there. I am going to take up this issue only on the basis of the past incidents that have contributed to the ethnic issue. They say, this issue came up because of the 50 : 50 concept brought in by Mr. Ponnambalam in 1946. Then they say, this issue came up after bringing in the "Sinhala only" policy within 24 hours. Again they say, it was because of the standardization of the education policy. Then they say, it was because of the 1958 riots over the word "". The 1983 riots were used as a ploy for this, they say. Then again they say, the Vaddamarachchi attack was something that has contributed to this issue. Also the arrival of IPKF into this country, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas attempt to capture Jaffna and re-hoist the flag, present President Mahinda Rajapaksas military adventure are among the factors that had contributed to this issue, they say. Again they say, that anti peace accord was another reason behind this. They also say that the Ceasefire Agreement was also a cause. But all those are excuses we have used over the last 60 years. If we, Sri Lankans, cannot find a solution by ourselves, what have we got to do? At this particular moment we can see other countries moving forward. You find deserts in Dubai converted to oases. But what, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, is happening to Sri Lanka? We are an oasis. But we are creating a desert out of that oasis. That is what is going on.

We scold the Americans; we tease the British; we insult the Indians and we say the Japanese are only talking and not doing anything. Then, who on earth is helping us? Are they getting help from Bin Laden? Are they getting help from Cubans or from the North Koreans? Why are you allowing this to go on? Are you using the JVP to hit India? Why is Government not coming forward to defend India? Mother India has been helping Sri Lanka all the time when we were in trouble. Where is the Foreign Minister? He is travelling around the world. Why is he not able to come and defend India? Why is he allowing this Indian bashing to go on? We are asking the Government. The Government must give us an answer.

) (The Hon. Dew Gunasekara -Minister of Constitutional Affairs and National Integration) , . , . . . . Mr. Deputy Chairman, it is not our desire or satisfaction to come to this House ritually and seek the approval of this House for an extension of the Emergency. Yet, the need for an extension continues to operate, so long as there is violence in the country and so long as there is threat to security of the country. The mandate given to this Government is to protect its people. It is unfortunate that we have not been able to bring to an end these senseless and meaningless killings. Mandate is also given to us by the people to find a solution to the problem. There are some, but few who subscribe to the view that there is no ethnic conflict which needs a political solution. However, the Government is committed to find a solution which is acceptable to all communities of this country to enable them to live in peace and peaceful co-existence. Today, after 25 years, Mr. Deputy Chairman, this conflict has grown out of proportion, out of control, transcending the national borders of the country. It has embraced geopolitics as well as international interference. History shows that separatism tends to seek support elsewhere. Chauvinism, extremism, and separatism finally fall prey to the designs and machinations of foreign imperial interests. The latest example is Kosovo.

Let me give my own interpretation of the Kosovo episode because we have to draw necessary lessons from it. Some attempt to interpret what happened in Kosovo to suit their political positions and convictions. What really did happen in Kosovo? What lessons can we draw from Kosovo crisis? Extremism on either side, as in Sri Lanka, Serbian great power chauvinism on one side and ethnic Albanian terrorism and separatism have both contributed to the break away of Kosovo, the only beneficiaries being the imperialists. The ethnic Albanians of Kosovo can claim to be independent, but Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, take my word that they will perpetually be pawns in the hands of foreign interests. Yugoslavia, once a leading light of the Non-Aligned Movement, is destroyed today. Even the name Yugoslavia has withered away. Today, seven new States have emerged within the former State of Yugoslavia. On the Floor of this House, I wish to reiterate what I said in this House, on the day that the Thirteenth Amendment was debated in 1987. Responsibility primarily rests on the two major parties, SLFP and the UNP to prevent such situations as now occurred in Kosovo. If the Members of the TNA think that separatism that they encourage will usher in liberation, they are sadly mistaken. Kosovo today has become a colony in the hands of foreign interests. I have repeatedly advised this House, on behalf of the Communist Party which I represent, to take into consideration the geopolitics, foreign interests, and international developments in handling our national question. The failure on the part of the Serbian State to integrate Kosovo Muslims or ethnic Albanians as equal partners contributed to the growth of separatism in that country implicating external interventions. Mr. Deputy Chairman, recollections come upon my mind about the meeting with Marshall Joseph Tito, together with Dr. N.M. Perera, when both of us participated in the National Congress of the Communist League of Yugoslavia in the year 1978. Tito was a source of inspiration to the Third World countries and to us, the students of national integration and his exercise in national integration was fascinating. The UN Security Council Resolution 1244 of 1999 which gave the United Nations jurisdiction over Kosovo, explicitly rejects the declaration of independence by Kosovo and reaffirms the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia of which Serbia is the Successor State.

2673 2674

Russia has warned the West that Kosovo would open a Pandoras Box setting off separation and territorial conflicts in Europe and elsewhere. It is for the first time since the Second World War that the U.N. member State was dismembered in violation of all principles and rules of the United Nations. President Putin has said that Kosovos declaration of independence and its recognition by the West has set a terrible precedent, which blows apart the whole system of international relations. The President Putin has also said that the recognition of the new State of Kosovo amounts to recognizing the right of the West to decide the fate of other nations arbitrarily. Mr. Deputy Chairman, this was the logical outcome of the Serbian ultra- nationalism on one side and denying the Kosovo people of devolution of power. In fact, the Slobodan Milosevic, the former Serbian leader, galvanized Serbian chauvinism by abolishing the Kosovos regional autonomy.This paved the way for separatist tendencies and the international interferences and the final break away of Kosovo. Therefore, in my view, the LTTE resorted to a similar strategy of military solution purely in anticipation of an international interference. This is the signal warning to us from Kosovo crisis. This is why we always warn of extremism in the South as well as in the North. They mutually nourish and nurture themselves. This is why we should find a solution internally for an internal question taking note of the geo-political concerns and the international interventions. , , . ; . , . , , Black Sea - - transport . . - - . , . . . .

Venerable Sir, anyway I must tell you that India in most instances have behaved like a big sister, not like a big brother. A big brother is a big bully; a big sister never bullies. There would have been instances where the big sister tried to become the big brother. But in most instances India has acted like a big sister, not like a big brother. So, the big sister who has never bullied us, who has always come to our assistance when we were to be bullied by some big brothers, today is being condemned by some sections in this society for reasons only known to them.
