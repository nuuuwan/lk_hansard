MUMBAI TERRORIST ATTACK : STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama - Minister of Foreign Affairs) , . 40 . . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . . ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama ) . . . Hon. Speaker, on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka. I wish to make this statement on the multiple terrorist attacks on Mumbai on the 26th November, 2008. The situation is still continuing at the time of my making this statement to this august Assembly. As the Hon. Members would be aware, President Mahinda Rajapaksa has vehemently condemned these attacks. The President in his statement has drawn attention to the urgent need for consorted action by all countries to eradicate terrorism wherever it is, and whoever the leaders and manipulators of such violence may be. In my own message to my Indian counterpart, Shri Pranab Mukherjee yesterday, I have expressed Sri Lankas willingness to stand shoulder-to shoulder with India in the fight against this menace, with resolve, which poses a clear danger for international peace and security. The fact that the terrorists had deliberately chosen soft targers such as hotels,a hospital, a commuter railway station and other public locations, proves beyond an iota of doubt, their evil and criminal interest in causing maximum civilian casualties and also to instil fear panic in ordinary people with a view to disrupting normal life in the vibrant and the bustling commercial and financial nerve centre of India.

The methodology and well coordinated precision of these savage attacks are reminiscent of the terror tactics employed by the LTTE against civilians and vital infrastructure in Sri Lanka. We have seen this over again during the last 25 years. I have no doubt in my mind that terrorist groups the world over study and mimic the modus operandi of each other to cause maximum death and destruction. We, in Sri Lanka are all too familiar with the stark reality of the cruel hand of LTTE terrorism which has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent civilians over the last several decades. Leaders around the world have close ranks to denounce this terrorist outrage with one voice, which has been destribed as Indias 9/11. We are greatly encouraged by the US President-elect Barack Obamas message wherein he states; These coordinated attacks on innocent civilians demonstrate the grave and urgent threat of terrorism. President-elect Obama has revealed his firm commitment and determination and that of the incoming US administration in the global struggle against terrorism when he goes on to state: The United States must continue to strengthen our partnerships with India and nations around the world to root our and destroy terrorist network. Thus, we can be rest assured of continued US leadership in the fight against this universal menace, which is common and grave threat to humanity. It is in this context that we, in Sri Lanka are confident that Velupillai Prabhakarans overtures to India contained in his latest message yesterday will not find accommodation. After all, was it not the LTTE that brutally assassinated Rajiv Gandhi on 21st May, 1991 in Sriperumpudur in the Indian State of Tamil Nadu? Rajiv Gandhi one of Indias great sons and an illustrious leader had to pay the supreme sacrifice for his unshakable stand supporting Sri Lankas sovereignty and territorial integrity and his outright rejection of the LTTEs separatist and fascist agenda. It is all the more reason that the New Delhi High Court, in a recent ruling had upheld the Central Indian Governments decision on 14th May, 2008 to ban the LTTE. The Court had, in its ruling, agreed with the Centres submission that the LTTE continues to use Tamil Nadu as the base for carrying out smuggling essential items like petrol, diesel and also narcotics and drugs to Sri Lanka. It further states that the Government of India is apprehensive that unless the ban on the LTTE countinues, acts of aggression on Indian soil are likely to occur.

However, all is not lost for the LTTE. Even at this late stage, I repeat the call of President Mahinda Rajapaksa for Prabhakaran to lay down arms, renounce terrorism and enter the democratic path in order to be a part of the political process that is currently underway, to evolve a sustainable solution which will bring lasting peace and stability to our nation. Thank you, Sir.

Hon. Minister, we see the sudden turn of events and we appreciate that you have acknowledged the role US intends playing. It was not too long ago that you, the Government of Sri Lanka, with Iran, tried to roundly condemn the United States of America. It has not taken too long for you to realize that Sri Lanka belongs to the

world and not that world belongs to Sri Lanka. At this moment also - [Interruption.] Let me finish this. It is also nice, as my Leader mentioned, that the Indian Government, the Congress did not suddenly turn to the BJP or Bal Thackeray or the muslim factor and say that they are the ones who are behind it. That is maturity. That is why my Leader wants to show that the statesmanless in the - ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) , . Sir, the Hon. Member stated that we were not acting in line with the world international opinion in terms of the US role in counter-terrorism action and we were trying to align ourselves with Iran. That statement is totally false and it is a most irresponsible statement made in this House. We maintain the best of relations with the United States and with the entire world body. Our relationship with Iran is also a relationship that has been traditional and in contemporary times, in line with our economic pursuits. Thank you, Sir.

[. . 12.13] . ( . ) (The Hon. T. Kanagasabai) Sir, I have very little time to speak. Our Hon. Minister is not a stranger. You were known to me for the last 15 to 20 years. When you were the Minister of Agriculture, I was an Assistant Director and you were very helpful to me. You even went out of your way and recommended me for a study tour in India. I will come to my subject. The only plantation crop that we have is coconut. I am very sorry to say that we do not get what we deserve or what we need in the North-Eastern Province. Along the coastal belt there is very fertile land suitable for coconut cultivation. The British people were concentrating on coconut cultivation. I know that about 75 to 100 years back, they exported coconut products from the Batticaloa town. There is a small harbour. From there, they have exported coconut. I have to emphasize on one or two points. One is regarding the staff. Hon. Minister, I think the Deputy Ministers are also here - you know in Batticaloa there are about 100,000 homesteads. In each homestead you get not less than five coconut plants. There are 100,000 homesteads in Batticaloa. But, now there are a fewer number of estates there. The owners were the British people. They sold them to our people and now the land is fragmented but there are coconut trees. But, we have got only three field officers to manage all this . We had 12 officers but now it has dwindled down to three. How can they advise the people? How can they do this extension work? Now we have to depend on other districts for coconut, cadjan and everything. I told the Chairman and he made some arrangements and I think we got one field officer. So why do you not spend some money on this? Why do you not recruit some staff? The Government is recruiting staff for so many subjects. When you go to a DS Division, you have officers such as Social Officer, Rural Development Officer, Community Development Officer and so on. We have 14 DS Divisions in Batticaloa. In all those, we have got only three officers for coconut development. I cannot understand the policy of this Government. This extension service is very important. I have 30 coconut trees. Last week my brother told me three trees had fallen due to the red beetle problem. So, my people there do not know how to control the red beetle and somebody must be there to advise them. I want the Hon. Minister and this Government to do something about this and recruit more staff. You always say, Batticaloa, Batticaloa but we do not get anything. The second point is, I have to thank Dr. Jayantha Gunathilaka, the Chairman of the Coconut Cultivation Board. We have two small estates in Batticaloa owned by the Coconut Cultivation Board. One is at Pasikuda and the

2109 2110

other at Mailampaweli, So, I wanted the Chairman to have some livestock also in one of the farms and he was good enough to give four herds of cattle. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) ! . . ( . ) (The Hon. T. Kanagasabai)

So why do you not increase that livestock? Do some more research and find new varieties and try to get some non-fat coconut milk for our people. Thank you ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) . . [. . 12.17] ( . ) (The Hon. Deepal Gunasekara) , . , . . , . , . . . . . , . , . . . . . . 100 20 . . . .

, , . , . . , - . - , , , , . , . , . , - . . Hon. Minister, it is true that the tea industry is facing a crisis but we must also bear in mind that the companies that have been managing the tea estates had been making enormous profits during the last four years. Therefore, they cannot say that they are suffering. They cannot make the labourers or people who work on these estates suffer. They can always reserve that money and utilize it for the welfare of the people in the tea industry. Moreover, they must also bear in mind that the expenditure on all development work in the estates is borne by the Government. Hon. Minister, the Tea Board has to do more work. I would urge in this Assembly that you should employ people from the plantation sector in overseas Tea Board offices so that the people who buy tea will know who is producing the tea. This is my humble request. I hope the Hon. Minister will think over this and give employment in overseas Tea Board offices or centres for the girls of the plantation sector as well. Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) . [.. 12.49] ( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) , .

. , . . 15 - 20 . . , 3 - 4 . , , . . . . ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Hon. Member, can I make a correction to that ? ( ) (The Hon. Selvam Adaikkalanathan) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Of course, there is a situation with regard to kerosene. But, in time to come, we will relax that definitely. By now, we have relaxed the restriction on fishing in the Jaffna Peninsula by four hours. Also, the last Indo-Lanka Agreement or the MoU, which was signed by the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, Senior Presidential Adviser, in no way states that Indian fishermen will be allowed to fish or they will be given permits to fish in our waters. We are in the process of giving our fishermen the chance to trawl in the Mannar Basin, Talaimannar up to Jaffna. But, it is not correct to say that we are willing to allow or we will allow the Indian fishermen to come to our territory. Actually, there is a huge problem with our people going to the Indian territory for fishing on which India has obliged by releasing them having obtained court permission as well. ( ) (The Hon. Selvam Adaikkalanathan) Thank you very much. ! . . ,
