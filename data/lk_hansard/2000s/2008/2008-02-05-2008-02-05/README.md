( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . This is completely misleading Parliament because the power conferred on the Cabinet by the Constitution are being given one by one to the other institutions. Parliament is supreme. All laws are made by Parliament. Article 55 (4) of the Constitution very clearly says this. ; , All policies have to be made by the Cabint and approved by Parliament.

Hon. K. Sivanesan, Member of Parliament for the Jaffna District - according to what the Hon. Sivanathan Kissor had said, were prevented at the Omanthai checkpoint from travelling to Colombo yesterday and consequently, they have been denied their right to attend the Sittings of Parliament.

I think that is a serious matter, Sir, which has a very adverse impact on the rights of Members of Parliament to be able to partake in Parliamentary Proceedings. I think it is also an assault on the dignity of this House. If, for no reason whatever, those Members of Parliament had been prevented from travelling, crossing that checkpoint to be able to come to Parliament, then, I think it had been a serious breach of their Privilege and it is a very serious matter which, I think you, as the Speaker of this august Assembly, will have to take serious notice of and appropriate action must be taken by the Government to inquire into the matter, as to why these Members were prevented. You must take action to ensure that the Members of Parliament are not so prevented in the future. Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) , . , . .

[.. 11.30] . . ( . . ) (The Hon. K. N. Choksy)

Madam Chairperson, the post-independence period marked a considerable improvement in services and industry in our country; employment increased. Consequently, labour disputes between employer and employees became more frequent. This gave birth to a strong trade union movement in the urban areas. The State found it necessary to step into an area which was hitherto a province entirely within the purview and the joint control of employer and employee. The States intervention was by means of legislation. Hence, statutes such as the Industrial Disputes Act and the present law under consideration by the House came into existence. The Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act was enacted by Parliament in 1971. It has proved to be a well-designed and effective law which is fair by both employer and employee. On many occasions, the invocation of this law where a dispute has arisen has assisted in preventing the spread of the dispute by bringing about a fair settlement through the Commissioner of Labour. The law applies to every shop and office and factory which employs more than 15 persons. An employer is prohibited from terminating the services of a workman who has been in employment for one year without the prior written approval of the Commissioner of Labour. A fair exception is made in that a workman can be dismissed without such approval on disciplinary grounds. The Act has stood without disturbance since 1971. Where a termination is disputed, the Commissioner of Labour decides the dispute after hearing both sides. His decision is made final. For the proper working of the Act, certain time limits have had to be necessarily imposed, such as the period after termination within which the application to the Commissioner has to be made by the employee. The

present amending Bill, as the Hon. Minister has pointed out, is to extend the period after termination of services to make an application to the Commissioner challenging the termination of the workmans employment. The period presently granted by the law is three months. It is being extended to six months. Such extension of time is to my mind beset with several objections which may hamper the due administration of justice. The law, as I have already said, presently gives a dismissed workman three months' time to make his application to the Commissioner. This period of three months is adequate and reasonable from both points of view. It gives the workman sufficient time to have himself advised on his legal rights, as also to collect his evidence and the monetary expenses involved. From the point of view of the employer, it is fair and reasonable because he would then know where he stands in the matter and can arrange his business affairs accordingly. But it is not only the two parties to the dispute who matter. All litigation has an element of public interest in it since law and order are essential elements for the maintenance of organized society. Large scale labour disputes cannot only hinder this, but also affect the countrys economy adversely. Madam Chairperson, this element of public interest has resulted in the enactment of the law under consideration, and also other statutes such as the Industrial Disputes Act. This latter Act created Labour Tribunals and Industrial Courts, which have functioned smoothly for half a century. Perhaps one dominant reason which prompted the enactment of special law and took such matters out of the hands of the normal courts was the time element in the hearing and decision of disputes.

What is commonly termed "laws delays" has given rise to the oft heard criticism that "justice delayed is justice denied". The early decision of disputes and the finality of such decisions are amongst the axioms of the law. Certain categories of disputes have a "snowballing" effect and hence require for this reason also early finality of decision or settlement. For these reasons I have stated, the extension of the time-limit from three to six months, that is, double the time, is unnecessary and unjustified. It will also give rise to the other problems I have envisaged above. The present limit of three months should therefore be continued and not extended. The same observation as above applies to the Industrial Disputes (Amendment) Bill which also seeks to extend the period granted to a dismissed workman to make an application to a Labour Tribunal from three months to six months. This too is unjustified and not advisable for the reasons I have stated earlier. Thank you.
