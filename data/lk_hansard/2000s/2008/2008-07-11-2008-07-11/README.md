( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Speaker, today, in the morning - I brought this matter to the attention of the Hon. Prime Minister as well - there will be a meeting of the Committee on High Posts. Today at 9.20 in the morning, we were given a letter informing that the meeting will convene at 10.30 a.m. When Parliament convenes the Committee on High Posts for the first time, due time must be given to the Members to come prepared. You cannot send us the letter at 9.20 in the morning and expect us to be there at 10.30 a. m. for an official meeting. I am sure the Hon. Prime Minister is unaware of that, but I would greatly appreciate if this meeting can be rescheduled because we have been called to discuss certain problems that are prevailing with the National Police Commission and the Election Commissioner. So, first of all, due recognition must be given to this Committee. These Committees are not at the beck and call of the Government. They have a multi-party composition. So, I would greatly appreciate if this type of nonsensical activities are not carried out in the future. Secondly, it is an absolute insult to the Committee on High Posts to give us the letter at 9.20 a.m. when we walked in, informing that the meeting will convene at 10.30 a.m. The Hon. John Amaratunga, the Hon. (Mrs.) Renuka Herath and I got the letters at 9.20 in the morning. So, I am quite aware that the Hon. Prime Minister is unaware of that and I just sent him an intimation on this. So, I would greatly appreciate if this meeting can be rescheduled for the next Parliament Sitting.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , . . . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . [ ] ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) . . . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) There must be decorum in doing this. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) . . . . [ ] . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) This is a fundamental principle. When the Committee on High Posts is meeting for the first time today at 10.30 in the morning, you should not give us intimation at 9.20. The Government may be jobless but certainly we are not. ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) You are jobless. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is your intention. You run amok in this place, but that does not mean that we also do so. We work to a schedule.

In acacia you get a lot of nitrogen. Acacia is recommended and not cyprus. ( ) (The Hon. Hemakumara Nanayakkara) But there is a problem with acacia also. Acacia leaf when it falls on the ground, it takes a long time for decomposition. Acacia is very good as a wind belt and also very good for the purpose of obtaining firewood. I agree with you Hon. Member on that. . ( . ) (The Hon. T. Kanagasabai)

In our sandy areas, it thrives very well. ( ) (The Hon. Hemakumara Nanayakkara)

Yes. It thrives very well and grows very fast. But there are big butts there. If we can go into agroforestry, it is a crop which could be grown for firewood, for

Therefore, you cannot denude the entire land in a jiffy. No, you cannot do that. What you have to do is to clear lands on strips. If there is a mountain or a hill along the contours, you have to clear the strips. And, you go for strip cropping with desired varieties. It could be jak fruit, it could be "gamdel", it could be breadfruit or it could be any useful agroforestry crop.

? You are getting a lot of money from the ADB. Wild elephants come and damage our crops and destroy our houses. Our coconut plantations have gone to the dogs. So, you must find some money and compensate these poor people. I want your officers to visit the Batticaloa District. I represent the Batticaloa District. I want the Hon. Minister to pay a little more attention to this District. When you develop the Eastern Province, please look into the Batticaloa District also. , . . . ? .

The blowing that comes into your house will carry margosa leaves and they will act as a disinfectant. If you have a murunga tree behind your house, when you get a visitor and when there is no curry at home, you can prepare a sambol or sundal and serve that with murunga. So, we must promote murunga cultivation. When I was in the Department of Agriculture, we produced a lot of margosa plants and distributed them free. Margosa comes up very quickly. It is an ideal tree for the Eastern Province and all the areas in the dry zone. So, why do you not promote the growing of margosa trees? Within a short period we can have timber. I heard that in those days they were exporting teak to many countries from Batticaloa. History says that. We can produce teak trees in our area. Pullumalai area is very famous for teak plantations. That area is an ideal place for teak. .

,

.

. In my hometown, on my own initiative with the support of the Rural Development Society and the priests of the temple, we have planted kumbuk trees for one kilometre along the roadside. On both sides of the road, there are two small tanks. It is only during the Maha season the tanks are full. We have planted kumbuk trees there for the purpose of providing shade, a lot of firewood and timber. There is an ideal microclimate. People walk on that road to go to the

temple and kovil everyday. There is a very famous temple. It is between Kalmunai and Kattankudi. I want the Hon. Minister to visit there and see for himself how, without costing a cent to the Government, we have planted those trees. This could be followed by others and it will serve as a demonstration. Also, with the co-operation of public organizations you can do it. If you cannot visit there, Hon. Minister, you can send your Director or somebody to see this.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) , .

. ( . ) (The Hon. T. Kanagasabai) Okay. I will make one more point. Please open a centre of the Department of Wildlife Conservation in Batticaloa. You must chase these wild animals away. There are so many poor people. Peasants are sending me letters and petitions asking for help. Even now there are wild animals in our area. This happened after the rehabilitation process. The wild elephants used to come to these affected houses about six months back. Now, they continue to come back to these houses again. Please, do something; help these poor people. You send your officers and see for yourselves. If I am wrong, next time when you get the opportunity, you call me and blackguard me. I will accept it.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, I will not take any more time. I thank the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara for giving me some of his time to make this speech. Thank you, Sir.

[.. 11.59] . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. M. M. Naoshaad) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Mr. Presiding Member, I am privileged to have this opportunity to speak on the Debate on the Supplementary Estimate of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources which deals with a very important subject globally. I am happy that we have a young and energetic Minister whose actions I have been observing long before I came into this House despite having political differences. He made a very valuable contribution in the House today. It was followed up by another valuable contribution from the Hon. Hemakumara Nanayakkara, Minister of Agriculture. To follow up on this, since the Hon. Minister made a comment on surveying the boundaries of the forests in the Eastern Province, if I may record in this House, the Eastern Province has a square area of almost 9,965 kilometres which is 16 per cent of the total land area of this country. Its length reaches from Kumana in the South-East to Pulmoddai in the North-East which is almost 286 kilometres. Its breadth from Ulhitiyawa in the Western hinterland area to Kirankulam in the Eastern littoral is around 89 kilometres. The coastal line spreads up to a length of 420 kilometres. Ampara has about 110 kilometres of that, Batticaloa has 100 kilometres and Trincomalee has the other 210 kilometres. What is important in relevance to the East and the preservation of the environment and natural resources is that 60 per cent of the Eastern population is farmers. The general thinking in this country is that the Muslims of this country are a very rich community. But, we know that the ethnic equation in the East is almost equal. Most people would be surprised to know that over 60 per cent of the population in the Eastern Province is involved in agriculture. The monthly income of the majority of them is almost Rs.1,000 per month. Only 5 per cent of the population in the East get a monthly income of over Rs.5,000. So, the annual income of the majority of them is around Rs.12,000 and only 5 per cent of them get Rs.60,000. So, what is important here is to understand the way of life of these people; why they are there, why they are involved in agriculture and why they do certain things which are at certain times interpreted to the advantage of those who are in power such as the incidents which occurred in Pottuvil where the Muslims of Pottuvil were branded as timber merchants who were cutting timber illegally and I am sure the Hon. Minister knows as to who was really doing that as a business. Leaving all that aside, what I urge the Hon. Minister is to understand the plight of these people. Why do the people living in the areas adjoining forests get involved in what they are doing? Some of these actions are illegal. But, it is something that is happening all over and connected to their livelihood. So, while regularizing this,

1563 1564

[ ]

we have to ensure that they have some means of livelihood. There has been a lot of contention with land issues in and around Pottuvil and Arugam Bay. I am not going into the details of it because I believe that some of those are administrative issues which should be left to the officials to handle administratively than make political capital out of it. But, like I mentioned in my first speech in this House, we must remember that we are all Sri Lankans and we all have equal rights. We cannot stop it by just uttering these words; but the people of this country, whether they are Muslims, Tamils or Sinhalese, should feel that they are being treated equally. One major problem we have right now, like the Hon. Member who spoke before me mentioned, is the damage caused by wild elephants. In my village in the Ampara District, I was surprised to see that one day at 3.00 in the morning, there was an elephant roaming in Samanthurai, in the village itself. I think, they were gaining entrance through two areas; that is through the Buddangala Sanctuary area and also from the Deegawapiya area. I understand that the Hon. Minister of Nation Building, the Hon. Susantha Punchinilame had asked the Samanthurai Divisional Secretary on the 18th March to send him the estimates for electrical fencing and I am aware that these estimates were sent to the Hon. Minister on the 9th of April. I now understand that purchase of material for fencing of the Buddangala area has already commenced and I would ask the Hon. Minister to expedite this process because there are thousands of acres now getting ripe for harvest and this is the time that the elephants do most of the damage. They just walk around in herds and destroy what the people have been labouring for three to four months to reap. If this is not curtailed now, then, with the food crisis that is prevalent in the world today, things would turn to the worst in this country because we all know that Ampara is the rice bowl of this country. So, I would urge the Hon. Minister to look into this very, very sensitive issue which is also a very urgent issue and also ensure that there is equality in the treatment of all nationals when it comes to issues relating to his Ministry. Thank you. [.. 12.07] ( ) (The Hon. Piyasiri Wijenayake) , , . , , , . , .
