. , , . . , . . . . . . [..11.59] . . ( ) ( () . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala- Minister of Higher Education) Sir, I am happy to follow my good, learned Friend, the Hon. John Amaratunga who, as usual could not speak to the point. The question before this House is a foreign policy matter of fundamental importance. In my view, one should not treat the SAARC Conference as a tamasha. The SAARC Conference is an event which gives an opportunity to all the leaders of the respective countries to examine vital issues of regional co-operation. That is the primary focus of this Conference. The 2007 Summit was held in Delhi, and this Summit, here in Colombo, has been organized to coincide with Sri Lankas 60 years of Independence. In my view, the need to hold this Conference in Sri Lanka has to be looked at from the point of view of a foreign policy posture. This is a major foreign policy exercise as foreign policy too could be considered as a resource for development in a given country. The Opposition, primarily the UNP, has been arguing against this Conference and their concern, as my good Friend the Hon. John Amaratunga explained, is about its expenditure. The question is whether Sri Lanka, at this stage can look at it from financial considerations. A country has to look at an international issue from the point of view of international considerations as well. Sri Lanka, as a small nation, has to play a dynamic role in the arena of foreign policy. It has been our record in the past 60 years, that Sri Lanka as one of the small nations in the region has played an active and significant role in the arena of international relations and it was Sri Lanka which showed the world that small nations too can be equal partners in the sphere of international relations. That has been our record. As a small nation, Sri Lanka was able to play a leading role in the arena of international relations. This is in addition to the utility of regional co-operation as an instrument of international relations. Sri Lanka unlike India, did not possess a foreign policy strategy in the pre-independence period. Our Nationalist Movement, unlike that of India, did not pay much attention to issues of foreign policy but the leaders of the traditional left and the late Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike made some reference to the need to study issues of foreign policy for an emerging State. Therefore, Sri Lanka, at Independence did not inherit a tradition of foreign policy. The old guard

1705 1706

of the UNP, the late Hon. D.S. Senanayake and others were not interested in foreign affairs and they were not enthusiastic about a foreign policy strategy for the emerging State. They were only concerned with the maintenance of the commonwealth connection, the commonwealth link. They were servile to the interests of the West. They were not keen in building resources to conduct a viable, effective and dynamic foreign policy for an emerging State and this was largely conditioned by their attitude to the West, primarily to the United Kingdom and the United States of America. In other words, in the period 1948 to 1956, Sri Lanka began to follow the British lead in foreign affairs, and relations with the socialist world were deliberately neglected. That was the UNP strategy on foreign policy. The pro-western partisan foreign policy which the UNP leadership championed in the first decade after Independence came to be transformed only after the defeat of the UNP in 1956. The year of 1956, as all of us know, was a demarcation in the political history of Sri Lanka and the victory of Mr. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike in 1956 had a major impact on the conduct of foreign policy and on the content and the nature of the foreign policy which Sri Lanka followed thereafter. Mr. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike was one leader of this country who had his own vision, his own views on foreign policy especially for a small country like ours and the countrys foreign policy came to be based on his ideas. It was on the basis of the foreign policy perceptions of the 1956 political changes that our foreign policy postures came to be formulated. Sri Lanka, under both Mr. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike and Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike developed a dynamic foreign policy which came to be described as dynamic neutralism and radical non-alignment. During the period that Mrs. Bandaranaike was the Prime Minister, foreign policy was described as radical non-alignment. It was Mr. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike at the Asian Relations Conference in Delhi in 1946, who echoed the need for regional co-operation. Today the UNP is opposed to the SAARC Conference.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) No, no!

. . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala) You are not opposed to it ?

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) We are not opposed to it. We are opposed to the Supplementary Vote.

. . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala)

Okay, thank you. Today their arguments over the SAARC Conference show that what they, as the old guard of the UNP, did in the period of 1948 to 1956, have no foreign policy strategy. It reminds me of the Bandung Debacle of the late Sir John Kotelawala which is part of history. It is my view that a small nation like ours can take the initiative in international affairs. That is the great lady, Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike's contribution in the sphere of international relations. Sri Lanka, though a small nation, was able to play a leading role in international affairs and it was entirely due to the dynamic foreign policy which Mrs. Bandaranaike, the great lady, pursued with great enthusiasm. It was Mrs. Bandaranaike who gave Sri Lanka a clear-cut foreign policy with which the country, despite its smallness reached the international stage and became a major player in international affairs. Her greatest achievement and the pinnacle of her greatness came during the Fifth Non-Aligned Summit which was held in Colombo in 1976. The UNP today, as usual, condemned it and derided it saying that it was a tamasha to boost the image of Mrs. Bandaranaike - [Interruption.] That is what you said a little while ago. Mrs. Bandaranaike did so much to take this small nation of ours on the international stage. The dividends, both political and economic, which it brought was immense. That is part of history, that is recorded history and the Fifth Non-aligned Summit held in Colombo laid the foundation for the disappearance of colonialism, neo-colonialism and apartheid. I do not want to waste the time of this House making an assessment of its results. SAARC was formed for the purpose of promoting regional cooperation among the countries in the region of South Asia. In the period of its existence, from 1985 - 2008, SAARC has played a significant role in promoting regional cooperation on matters vitally and fundamentally relevant to the development of the region. That is important and SAARC at one stage declared several declarations pertaining to various issues in the respective countries. I do not say that the lofty objectives of the regional body have been achieved. Since 1985, SAARC had evolved a framework for cooperation and coordination among the member States and continuation of this cooperation is indispensable in view of the current global situation. That is important. SAARC has two nuclear powers - India and Pakistan. Both have gone nuclear. The two monarchies, Nepal and Bhutan have dismantled their monarchies and the people have been given the opportunity to elect a representative democratic government. These are the changes which are taking place within SAARC. India is the major economic power within SAARC. India is emerging as an economic powerhouse. International economic development reveals

[ . . ]

2008 22 1707 1708

that efforts are being made to bring countries together to form economic groupings which is the pattern today. The smaller nations need to examine the viability of such developments and SAARC has made several declarations at its summits and they are specially useful to the countries engaged in cooperation. Mr. Presiding Member, in our foreign policy calculations, we need to look at SAARC and its utility as an instrument of regional cooperation from the point of view of our national interest. The foreign policy of a country is based on its national interest and one can say that foreign policy is also the extension of domestic policy. What are the major components of our national interest? In the given scenario, the national interest consists of national sovereignty, territorial integrity and the defeat of separatism. The next component is the need to accelerate the process of economic and social development. Eric Hobsbawm, one of the leading British historians, whose book I bought a couple of days back, states that any modern State has to pursue its interests - a State has a set of permanent interests, and it is on the basis of our permanent interest that we need to promote regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations. As I mentioned earlier, Sri Lanka hosted a number of international conferences. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, please wind up your speech. . . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala) Okay. Give me one more minute, please. For instance, the Fifth Non-Aligned Summit to which I referred brought enormous dividends in the area of international relations. There are both local and global issues of international importance, which could be discussed here at this conference of the SAARC. The SAARC region is yet another important centre of power. Today, the power in the international system is based on multi-polarity; I am using a word from the jargon. The world is no more bipolar and it is no more unipolar. Now multi-polarity in international relations means that there are several centres of power in the world in which context, regional cooperation becomes important and it is through this instrument of regional cooperation that immediate issues affecting States could be resolved. Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Thank you. The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, please.

[. . 12.14] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Presiding Member, I thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to speak on the Supplementary Estimate of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs which is to be passed today. Whilst speaking on the subject of foreign affairs, first of all I would like to know whether the Government has a foreign policy, because we see that it is a makeshift policy. Goal-posts are changed from day-to-day, national interests are submerged for day-to-day survival and the general attitude that is being displayed by the Government is, Do what I say, but do not do what I do. That is the general impression that is being created. Now the Government is calling upon this Parliament to basically approve Rs. 2,880 million. We, the United National Party, are not opposing the SAARC. But certainly the Supplementary Estimate is something that we totally disapprove of, because this is basically spending people's money for a tamasha, just for personal glorification. We make no bones about that. It was mentioned before that under Head 112, Rs. 6,576 million has been allocated for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. First of all, we want to know whether this is a Foreign Affairs Ministry or a Foreign "Jaunting" Ministry. Because everyday you see somebody is loafing around at the expense of the country's taxpayer. Now, here you are asking for Rs. 2,880 million owing to the fact that the SAARC Summit is being held in Sri Lanka. Mr. Presiding Member, first of all what I would like to mention is that while they are asking for Rs. 2,880 million, they have also spent Rs. 2,100 million on bulletproof cars that are being brought to this country. Now, in this they say that Rs. 222 million is required to be paid to the CMC. But, I am also tabling* an article which is published in today's The Island newspaper which states, "Rupees 374 mn to beautify Colombo city - Mayor". So who is paying the difference of Rs. 152 million? These are just guessed estimates prepared at the whims and fancies of the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, who was being indicted very strongly yesterday by the Supreme Court, and at this particular moment whether he has the morality to be surviving as the Secretary to the Treasury is the question. But I am tabling* these arithmetic figures that are being spoken of. I am asking the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs as to why they are asking for this Rs. 2.8 billion. I must say that they are two

capable people who are in two different directions; one is jaunting the world and the other one is acting all the time. But, I must say that he is a good actor and he does his work well. All we want to say is that you are playing around with the country's money. On the same score, you are saying that Rs. 222 million is required for the Colombo Municipal Council. Hon. Minister, today, The Island newspaper states that the CMC requires Rs. 374 million. Who is going to pay for the balance Rs. 152 million? So, when you add up all these, you find that almost an additional sum of Rs. 5,138 million is being spent on the SAARC Summit. This is because there is Rs. 2,100 million being spent on bulletproof cars coming into this country. You are ignoring that fact. Who is paying for that? You are saying for "SAARC" and asking approval for a supplementary expenditure. That is why we stated during the Budget Debate that we do not want to give the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance or the Secretary to the Treasury, the right to move from one Head to the other. Now, Rs. 2,100 million is spent on bulletproof cars for eight leaders who are coming to this country for two days but nobody is saying as to who is paying for that. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Hon. Member, you are speaking in the House. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am speaking to the House. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Can you give me the breakdown of Rs. 2,100 million that you are speaking of? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You answered in Parliament. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) You are quoting some figures. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am quoting figures that you gave last time when the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena answered a question in Parliament. This is the problem of the Government; the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) I have given you the figure. Rupees 2,100 million is for the police. We have given that. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, there was a question asked in Parliament. You said that 31 bulletproof vehicles have been brought in and you also said that 12 new vehicles have been brought in for the SAARC Summit. That was the answer given. So, I am stating what the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena said; either the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena does not know what he is talking or you do not know what he has said. You are talking of Rs. 5,100 million being spent on this SAARC Summit. That is what we are asking. Then, we ask from the Foreign Ministry, is there a policy? As I said, it is a makeshift policy that changes and basically moves around. The Hon. (Prof.) Wiswa Warnapala who spoke before quite eloquently tried to put across the message as if the Opposition did not have a policy. He was talking about sovereignty. You have the Indian Army that is coming in here to protect the foreign leaders. You have Pakistan coming along with their own helicopters. You have the Afghanistan Leader coming with American helicopters. Is that not affecting the sovereignty of this country? The United National Party is the party that got Independence to this country. So, it is we who have the right to ask this question. The Hon.(Prof.) Wiswa Warnapala just mentioning sovereignty and "eradicating terrorism" does not mean anything. I am asking you once again. You say that LTTE announces an unilateral ceasefire. Either, the Government must accept it or reject it. On one hand, you say the entire peninsula has been captured and on the other, you say that the LTTE announces an unilateral ceasefire. You, on one side, say, ceasefire is no good. On the other side, they unilaterally announce this. Now, does that mean that the Norway people who were speaking and the Indian troika that came here brought pressure on you all? Is that the reason behind all these? You were castigating and character- assassinating the United National Party for bringing stability. You are surviving owing to the peace process which took the country forward. But, I am just asking a direct question. I know the Government will not be able to answer. My Friend, the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama will smile and try to evade the issue. But, going beyond the surface, you will not be able to answer this because if you accept it, then it is one story and if you reject it, you will have a different story. This is why we say that the Government does not have a policy. On that same score, we are asking about the Indian visit of, as we say, the troika. Why did the Indian Foreign Secretary, the National Security Adviser and the Defence Secretary suddenly come to Sri Lanka? Is it because of SAARC? Well, if they came to speak about SAARC, then, what did they speak with my good Friend, the Hon.

[ ]

2008 22 1711 1712

Sampanthan? What did they speak with the Hon. Douglas Devananda? What did they speak with the Hon. Thondaman? Why is it? If they came to talk on SAARC, what relationship does that have? So, these are the internal problems that are being highlighted now. The Government does not have a policy. It is made by a makeshift policy. Look at the Indian system. They are basically allowing the bureaucrats to run. You do not have a foreign minister to foreign minister discussion. You have them speaking to you. The CEPA is handled by the same bureaucrats who have come in here. What is happening? Sovereignty has been relegated to them by you. The Ministers are relegating their powers now. That is the question we are asking. Then we are also asking, Hon. Minister, as this is a Debate on foreign affairs, what was the action taken against Mr. Dayan Jayathilake, a former terrorist who has converted himself to a diplomat? He has basically said that the monarchy should be removed. Are you accepting it? In that case, who is going to head the Commonwealth? Has the Government accepted that policy? These are the questions I ask before I come to the subject matter. Hon. Minister, another very horrendous incident took place. About a month ago, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, Leader of the Opposition, and I had the opportunity of visiting the United Kingdom. We had to meet Mr. Lord Malloch-Brown in the Foreign Ministry. An official from our High Commission there quite shyly said, I am sorry, instructions have come from Colombo not to provide diplomatic status to Mr. Ranil Wickremasinghe. The foreign missions in other countries, normally accord diplomatic status to the Leader of the Opposition but in this case, that official had been instructed not to provide any vehicle to Mr. Wickremasinghe to go and meet the British Foreign Minister. Mr. Lord Malloch-Brown had asked, "Is this the way you treat a former Prime Minister of this country"? We went to France. We had the opportunity to meet the French President, Nicolas Sarkozy. We met the French Prime Minister and we also met the French Foreign Minister. Once again, an official from Sri Lankan embassy in France told the Leader of the Opposition, I am sorry, we have got instructions from Colombo not to provide protocol service to the Leader of the Opposition". Is this the way a Government that is going to bring peace into this country behaving? It is an absolute shame, Hon. Minister to do such things.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) I would like to know who that person was.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am telling you, the officials in the Sri Lankan Embassy in France -

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) It is customary -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It is customary but it was not given. That is the problem.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) There is nothing for you to seek. I would like to know the name of the officer who told you that. No protocol services have been terminated. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The Embassy officials who came -

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Who is the Embassy official? Tell me his name.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Well, the official staff who came to the Airport - ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) No, no. Tell me the name. Who said that?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) They dropped the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe at the Hotel and said I am sorry -

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Who said that? Kindly name the person. You are a responsible Member here in this House. Can you name the person who said it? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, do you think that a peon would come to the Airport? No. A person from the Consular section said, We have got instructions from Colombo not to provide protocol service to the Leader of the Opposition - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) If you name the person, I can ask them as to why they deviated from the normal practice.

1713 1714

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, you had better look into it. I have mentioned this on an earlier occasion. The same thing happened in UK as well. This is the problem. You do not have a High Commissioner in UK. You are basically shuffling different people.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) The UK High Commissioner has taken up duties.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is now. But when we were there, there was no High Commissioner. The High Commission does not close just because the High Commissioner goes off. The instructions had been given from Colombo not to provide protocol service. We can manage without any of them. But the issue that matters is, the intention of the Government. Then, look at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not know what the Minister of Foreign Affairs is doing. It is an open secret. You may have differences. On the same score, the Minister of Export Development and International Trade does not know what the Minister of Foreign Affairs is doing. Look at the battle that is going on. I do not blame you, Hon. Minister. You may have valid reasons. I was surprised to see on your right-hand side the Minister who was basically at loggerheads with you. Before, I commented on this, he went away. But I would like you to take this matter up. Today Labour GSP has become an issue. He has made a statement without consulting you. I am sure if it had been given to you, within 24 hours you would have agreed that what we were doing was the correct thing and approved it. But what are we to do now. Hon. Minister, you spoke about the sovereignty of our country. The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva said that no foreign armed forces would be coming here. Why do they need to tell an untruth in this Parliament? The respective Foreign Missions have told us about the security personnel coming here. Almost a hundred rooms in Taj Samudra Hotel and the Galle Face Hotel have been booked for that purpose. Why, if there is a mutual agreement between two countries, it is not a problem. This is where the sovereignty is affected. You are talking about this agreement and that agreement, but what is the answer, Hon. Minister. If you cannot, at least your able Deputy Minister can answer? He is smiling away. He puts his bhaila and all and gets out of the problem. I am sorry, you cannot do that. Here is an issue of national importance.

Now, the English "Lakbima" newspaper of 13th July, 2008 says, "The first Indian military contingent here Tuesday". Then the Sinhala "Lakbima" of 13th July, 2008 says 3 . Hon. Minister, first get your house in order before you talk of what the others are doing. Then, going on further, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is obviously in shambles with regard to posting of heads to foreign missions. Normally there was a courtesy bound owing to the professionalism in the Ministry that there is a 60:40 balance between the career diplomats and the political appointees. But now it is 70:30.

( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila) I have the figures here with me. It is 55:45.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It may be 55:45 before certain relatives went out. So, I am saying at this moment it is 59:41, to be very precise. Certainly I do not want to get out of context, Hon. Minister. You know that I basically speak on facts. So, in the same way, look at the visa consular fees that have changed. I know the Deputy Minister fought valiantly on this. I need to mention this because I remember he was irritated when certain officials came before the COPE. I thought from the way he reacted he might even get a heart attack because he was passionately fighting on behalf of some people. But now we find that it was an illegal charge. You have said that the Cabinet approved it when in fact the Cabinet had not approved it. Now I am tabling* the document on the background information on Revision of Fees of Consular Services, for the sake of clarity and to save time. Now you are asking this House again to correct an anomaly that was created before. You did not get the approval. You said that you got the approval and now you are saying, I am sorry, please correct it. Then you have said that refunds need to be made. But nobody had sought a refund. Who is the guy who is going to spend Rs. 5,000 to get a Rs. 4,000 refund. Hon. Minister, these are what you call "daylight robbery". Please ensure that there is professionalism in the system. This is what we have been always saying. Stop this colourization. Look at this country. It is now heading towards a failed State. I am tabling** the Sri Lankan Failed State Report which states that Sri Lanka has moved from the 25th position to the 20th position.

So, that is why we are saying that this country is moving from danger to disaster. This is what is happening. The Foreign Ministry is the place where you have got to absolutely ensure that the correct things happen. But look, on one side you say that you are taking the LTTE on, but on the other side the reports in all foreign countries indicate that they have become more vigorous in their campaigns. So, then the Foreign Ministry is not doing what they have got to do. The ambassadors are just having cocktail evenings rather than saving the country. Otherwise, how can the LTTE be able to vociferously promote themselves when they are banned in most of the countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States of America and most of the European countries. This is because your embassies are not doing the job. And if that is the case, Hon. Minister, why on earth are you keeping them there and why are you heading such a ministry? Able men, walk the chalk, that is what we are asking. So, on the same score you are asking money for something we feel you have busted. Rs. 6,500 million for what purpose? That is the problem. We are not opposed to SAARC. Never mind, you are getting glorified with the SAARC. There may be reciprocal advantages that come in. But certainly, see the amount of money that is being spent. You are asking for Rs. 2,880 million. The difference between what CMC says and what we are providing is another Rs. 150 million, and Rs. 2,100 million on 11 bulletproof vehicles. Besides that, see what you are doing. You are breaking up innocent peoples' houses. What a crime, what a curse! I, being the UNP Leader of the Colombo District, happened to go there one morning. They have suddenly given notice to break down 653 houses. Luckily we went to court and managed to get a stay order. You, being a lawyer, will understand the ramifications of trying to breach such an order. But when we got the stay order at 10.42 a.m. to stop it, at 11.00 oclock they started breaking the houses. May be by 2.00 oclock they have broken about 43 houses and the tense situation made the people get on to the railway lines. We had to go and solicit our assistance after the police felt that they were doing some inhuman act. We managed to get out of that place after giving the assurance that there would not be any more breakages. But, what happened? The next morning at 4.30 a.m. I get a call. I must salute those UDA drivers and the lesser position holders of the police, maybe constables, who called and told us, " , . ." They told us, "Please ensure that the people get back to where they were so that they could help us not to break those houses". Hon. Minister, in the name of SAARC, just because eight leaders are due to come, you sacrifice the lives of almost 5,000 people who have been living there for 60

years. The Hon. Minister of Urban Development and Sacred Area Development had the audacity to say that that was correct and they are going ahead with it. The people have gone to court and I hope they would get the desired judgment, the redress that they are looking for. Is that what you are doing? SAARC is an association of eight of the poorest of countries trying to eradicate poverty. What this Government is doing is, it is trying to increase poverty. Your mandate is not for breaking houses, but for making houses. Is that what SAARC is for? You saw on TV what the Pakistan Member of Parliament from the Labour Party said. He said, I would be ashamed to come for this SAARC Summit if the Government, in the name of SAARC, is breaking these innocent peoples houses. There were houses of Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Malays and Burghers. That is the composition of the Sri Lankan identity and you have blown that composition into nothing. You are trying to show the world that by breaking those 653 houses, as the Hon. John Amaratunga said, we can suddenly become a First World country from a Third World country. No. So, please ensure that your morality is checked; your conscience is pricked. If you are inhumane, we do not mind that. You are unable to provide a solution to the innocent people of the North and the East. You are trying to create another militancy factor here. The Tamil problem is on at the moment. The Muslim factor is also becoming militant owing to the rigging your undertook at the Eastern Provincial Council Election. Now, are you trying to bring that war from the North and the East to the rest of the country? Please, in the name of SAARC, stop this nonsense. Then look at the other things you are going to do: stopping trains coming into the city; buses not operating; houses being broken; schools being closed; the Airport being closed. Constitutionally, you guarantee that a person can go anywhere, stay anywhere and do anything within the law. You are stopping that. You are making such a big noise, Hon. Bhaila, Deputy Minister, about Budget Shops. I am tabling* a document to be included in Hansard. You will be horrified when you see that, where you have asked them to move out within 24 hours, not only move out, but also to take their stuff and get out. They might even say that since I am staying in a house close to the Parliament, I am the biggest terrorist and I also should get out of that house. That can happen. - [Interruption.] I guess President Gayoom must be coming to the Budget Shop to buy some rice at Rs. 10 because these days the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane sells rice at Rs. 10. , Budget Shop . , . ! I am tabling* a document which gives the immense benefit the SAARC Summit brings and the disparities of it.

I am saying all this in the interest of the country. After all, we are not mavericks who are trying to bring a bad name or bad impression on the country. But, the impression you are going to create after one week of the carnival would be severe. Then, look at the Labour GSP. Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, you have the power to make it or not. The Hon. Minister of Export Development and International Trade is on cloud nine these days. He has been telling the Hon. Prime Minister and the Cabinet, Do not worry, I will get this done. He thought that he was lecturing at the European University. You also have your manoeuvring skills. You said, You try yours; I will also try mine. Now, the battle between the two of you is affecting the nation. Labour GSP is something which is related to your area of work. You had been a Chairman of the BOI; you have been handling trade. We have been helping and talking on these issues. But, what is happening? The EU delegation is in Sri Lanka as of now. Five out of the seven members have said that this country would not get it. Why? Why do we not work together? My Leader very categorically and very openly spoke up for that. Being the Leader of the Opposition, he went to Brussels and spoke on behalf of the Government. After he came back, he was castigated; he was character-assassinated. Then, he asked, What are we doing?" Never mind, we still challenge them. We, as the Opposition, are ready to give our support unconditionally, but you have to do what you have got to do as a Government. If you are unable to reap benefits, what can we do? Do not with a pro-western backing attack them like how the Hon. (Prof.) Wiswa Warnapala did. He did it an absolutely sadistic manner. Just because you bash the European Union, do you think they are going to give you Labour GSP? They do not care a tuppence for Sri Lanka. We are not the size of China or India. They do not know where Sri Lanka is. We have got to fish for opportunities ourselves, go to them and say, We are Sri Lankans. The biggest problem is this . , . , . , ? So, Hon. Minister, let us put politics aside. Here, the Opposition is coming forward. This is not only for textiles. This is also for the fisheries sector, for agriculture, for tobacco, for education and for tourism. Almost 7,000 products are affected by Labour GSP. Almost 200,000 people are directly employed in the textile industry and almost 500,000 are engaged in other related activities. Almost 10 per cent of GDP comes from services and exports of the textile industry to the European Union. So, let us get together. Here is a clarion call from the Opposition. We are

looking at it in the national interest. We are not bothered about the PA Government. We are only interested in the people of this country. Coming above politics, we say, do what you have got to do and we will give our unstinted support; whether you have got the audacity to accept that challenge, is the question. The personal battle between the Hon. Minister of Export Development and International Trade and the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs is not the issue. You can put that aside. I saw them in the morning. Is their being together the first sign of their coming together? I spoke to the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris in the morning. I put forward this challenge because my Leader wanted me to do so and now let us take it up. We will tell the EU delegation before they go, You have come here to ensure that the ICCPR is accepted. Here we are. We accept the 21 conditions put forward. But you have to say whether you accept that the human rights violations should be stopped, the media intimidation that is going on should be stopped and whether the Constitution is going to be fully implemented. That is the problem. The Seventeenth Amendment is in the Constitution. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. Your time is over. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, please give me three more minutes. So, I am asking you whether the Seventeenth Amendment, which is already in the Constitution, would be fully implemented. If you are unable to provide an answer, who are we to provide you with an answer? But here, we, as the Opposition - you say that normally we oppose things - are ready to support this. So, Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, keep the Minister of Export Development and International Trade out. You take it upon yourself and say, There is a clarion call from the Opposition and I am ready. Before the EU delegation goes, you can say, For the first time, the two major parties have got together. All the other small mucky parties can be put aside. That is what is required at this crucial hour. Do not colourize the economy; do not play around with the economy. If you lose the economic war, we will lose all wars. I come back once again to the issue of CEPA. I am asking, who is running the show? Is it the bureaucrats, the politicians or the Ministers? I can see what is happening in Colombo. It is a mafia that has taken over. I am talking of Dr. P.B. Jayasundera who has been charged by the Supreme Court; I am talking of the Governor of the Central Bank. The same thing is spreading to the other areas. Whether it is the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, Public Security, Law and Order or the Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, please ensure that the political machinery takes decisions on behalf of the country. You were elected, not they.

The Indian system is different. As I said, a troika came to Sri Lanka. They put across certain ideas. I am talking about the present Indian situation. As you know, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe and the United National Party have a very close relationship with India. But, is the Indian policy of Delhi different from the policy of the Indian Embassy in Colombo? They are saying, Do not buy arms from anybody else. There are the LIOC and oil exploration matters, and now a problem over the Kachchativu Island has come up. Then, you have the CEPA matter; and also the issue whether Pillayan should be made the Chief Minister or not. Foreign armed forces are being brought in to protect the foreign leaders who are coming. Then, there is the issue of the North-East merger. On the one hand, to the Co-Chairs you say, Okay, a solution is required and on the other, you say, The Thirteenth Amendment would be accepted. So, how can you go forward? Is the Thirteenth Amendment being pushed forward? Six months ago, there was a big issue saying, "After 21 years we have accepted it". Why do you not walk the chalk? Hon. Minister, this is what we basically say, we are judged by the friends we keep. You can do what you want with Iran; you can do what you want with Zimbabwe; you can do what you want with North Korea; you can do what you want with Cuba, but you have 222 countries in the world. It is an international club. Either you accept it or get out of it. If you are getting out of it, you have to have the might to do what Venezuela is doing - to challenge the world. They can act crazy in their own way. But can we, small Sri Lanka, an island of poverty in an ocean of prosperity, challenge the world? When I started my speech - you were not here then - I mentioned that you said, "Do what I say, but do not to do what I do." That has to change. You must realize that Sri Lanka is in the world and the world is not in Sri Lanka. So, on that score, you must develop a foreign policy that safeguards the sovereignty, protects the country and also benefits the Sri Lankans. We call upon you once again, to ensure that the SAARC Conference will not be treated as a joke. Where has the approval come from for the CEPA, the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement with India? Has it come from the Cabinet? The Secretary to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry of India came here two weeks ago. He went back after conceding certain things on the assumption that the Cabinet has given its approval. What is the government that will come and speak with you if you do not have the authority to make decisions on behalf of the Government? You said that the signing of the CEPA will be announced. After the CEPA was approved and sent by Government officials, the Cabinet says, We are sorry. The Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources says, I have not given approval. The Minister of Irrigation and Water Management and Minister of Ports and Aviation says, I have not given concurrent approval. The Minister of

Trade, Marketing Development, Co-operatives and Consumer Services says, I have not accepted certain conditions. The service industry, the bankers, the accountants, the lawyers and the advertising companies say, We do not know what is going on. The Chambers of Commerce which are supposed to go along with the Government say, We told you about our fears, but you did not give in to our ideas and as a result, we have got to oppose". After all, they have to look at their interests. We say that the CEPA needs to be implemented. But it has to be done considering Sri Lanka's interests. What is the Government doing? India is doing what is good for India. But, what your Government is doing is also what is good for India. So, who is looking after Sri Lankas interests? That is why I said that the bureaucrats should take this over. It is time that Parliament takes this over. Ensure that the CEPA is tabled before Parliament. There is no point in wasting time telling this to the world, blaming the bureaucrats and finally saying, "I do not know". It is a preposterous situation for the Cabinet. What the President says is, I do not know what my Minister told you. The Minister has agreed, but we have not agreed. In that case, how can a Cabinet Minister work in the future? You must first get into the Presidents mind and see whether he is accepting what you say. Dr. Dayan Jayatilleke has said, "Abolish the monarchy". Then you make the Foreign Minister to say, "Sorry". You do not know whether the President had told Dr. Dayan Jayatilleke to say this. Next time, you will look like an idiot. That is the problem, Hon. Minister. That is why I said, do not play around with the national interests. This country has economically gone bankrupt. This country does not have a foreign policy and a particular direction to go forward. In the name of God, please ensure that you protect Sri Lanka. Before too long you will get the message from Sabaragamuwa; you will get the message from the North-Central Province and then be ready to pack your bags. Ensure that you protect the country. Then, we will resurrect the country like we got Independence in 1948. So, please ensure that you do not make a mockery of the SAARC Summit that is going to be held. Constitutionally, you are bound to protect the people. Under the Constitution, every single person has a right to stay where he wants. Tomorrow, please do not say that even we cannot stay down the Parliament Road because then four or five persons will have to move out of that place. Hon. Minister, I know your sense of humour. Do not take this lightheartedly. After your speech, the Hon. John Amaratunga said the same thing. The Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike had the Non-Aligned Movement in Sri Lanka. She said that she conquered the world. Then she said that she would have oil pumped from Pesalai so that that money could be used to develop the country. Then what happened? Nine months later she was in the Opposition. Here, it is the same thing. You will be glorified as the Leader of the SAARC of the region. Now you are saying that you are trying to explore oil in

[ ]

Mannar. There is a similarity and you would not take nine months; it will be nine days before you start going back home. All what I say is, please ensure that you protect this country and see that carnivals and glorifications are stopped. Work for the people and ensure that peoples houses are not broken down, Hon. Minister. Thank you. * : * : * Document tabled : Ravi Karunanayake From : Bradley emerson <bradleyemerson@gmail.com> To : Ravi Karunanayake<ravik@eureka.lk> Sent : Sunday, July 13, 2008 9:28 AM Subject : Fwd : Sri Lanka among top 20 in failed states ranking

Lanka Business Online Thu Jul 2008 By Rohan Samarajiva Choices : Sri Lanka among top 20 in failed states ranking. July 3, 2008 (LBO)-in mid 2006, I wrote column entitled The Sri Lankan state : Failed failing or maligned?. It was about a comparative ranking on countries on their likelihood of becoming failed states. At the end of a critical assessment of their methodology, I concluded that Notwithstanding these methodological problems, the index does provide a good basis for debate and discussion on the condition of the Sri Lankan state. Then last year, I re-examined the 2007: I said that the good news in that Sri Lanka is holding its place at 25 in the new survey that includes 177 countries (up from 146 in 2006). In this ranking, a high score is bad. This is a top 20 you do not want to belong to. But Sri Lanka has just joined the top 20 of failed states, sliding 5 places down in the 2008 survey that covers 177 countries again. 2006 2007 2008 2006-08 Rank rank rank change Afghanistan 10 8 7 -3 Bangladesh 19 16 12 -7 Bhutan 39 47 51 12 India 93 110 98 5 Maldives Not 66 67 1 Nepal 20 21 23 3 Pakistan 9 12 9 0 Sri Lanka 25 25 20 -5 Source: Fundforpeace.org The SAARC region as whole (with the notable exceptions of India and the Maldives) does pretty badly, with Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka decling in position, vis--vis 2007. Nepal, which was a member of the top 20 (with Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan) in 2006, has now climbed to 23. Last year, I bemoaned that Rwanda and Liberia were seen as less likely to end up as failed states than Sri Lanka. Rwanda (exemplar of genocide) now ranks 42nd and Liberia (once a synonym for failed state) 34th. These countries are improving; Sri Lanka is going downhill.Comparison of the component scores for Sri Lanka and Liberia, the land of Charles Taylor, is educative in terms of what it takes to improve/worsen:

Liberia Liberia Sri Lanka Sri Lanka 2007 2008 2007 2008 1-1 Monting Demographic 8.1 8.1 7 7 Pressures 1-2 Massive Movement of 8.5 8.4 8.6 9 Refugees or Internally Displaced Persons creating Complex Humanitarian Emergencies 1-3 Legacy of Vengeance- 6.5 6 9.5 9.8 Seeking Group Grievance Or Group Paranoia 1-4 Chronic and Sustained 6.8 6.5 6.9 6.9 Human Flight 1-5 Uneven Economic 8.3 8.3 8.2 8.2 Development along Group Lines 1-6 Sharp and/or Severe 8.4 8.3 6 6 Economic Decline 1-7 Criminalization and/or 7 7 8.9 9.2 Delegitimization of the state 1-8 Progressive Deterioration of 8.6 8.5 6.5 6.6 Public Services 1-9 Suspension or Arbitrary 6.7 6.7 7.6 8 Application of the Rule of Law and Widespread Violation Of Human Rights 1-10Security Apparatus Operates 6.9 6.7 8.7 9.3 As a State Within a State 1-11Rise of Factionalized Elites 8.1 7.9 9.2 9.5 1-12Intervention of Other States 9 8.6 6.1 6.1 Or External Political Actors Total 92.9 91 93.1 95.6 Source: Fundforpeace.org Liberia is improving its component scores gradually. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, is seen as reaching the top score in group paranoia at an astounding 9.8/10. Criminalization of the state, exemplified by the brazen attacks on journalists, has risen to 9.2/10. The scores on widespread violation of Human rights (8/10) and the security apparatus operating as a state within the state (9.3/10) contributes to Sri Lankas decline. What company shall we keep in 2009 in the absence of remedial action? Burma? North Korea? Its only 2 more points that we need to overtake North Korea, and only 4.7 to tie with Burma.

( - ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila - Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs) Mr. Deputy Speaker, as I have limited time, I would like to respond to some of the speeches made by the Members of the Opposition. Most of them were not relevant to the Debate today. They started off the Debate by talking about a Supreme Court judgment delivered yesterday. The Hon. Members of the Opposition spoke about the judgment against the LMS privatization, conveniently forgetting the fact that the privatization took place when the current Leader of the Opposition was the Prime Minister. Who was the Secretary to the Treasury at that time? Who were the people who brought this to light? It was the COPE which was dominated by Government Members that brought this whole transaction to light. This is the sort of hoodwinking of the masses that the Opposition has now got underway. They spoke about the 600 houses being demolished. An Hon. Member of the Opposition said that 600 houses were demolished yesterday for the SAARC Summit. I can say with authority and with responsibility that it is an absolute falsehood. I have got the figures in my hand. There were only 330 families living there. They said that only ten by eight feet houses are being given, which again I completely reject. We are ( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) - ( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila ) . . . We have been paying Rs.8,000 per month to these families who have been displaced. ( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) . ( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila ) . 8000 . . We have been paying Rs.8,000 per family and that will be paid till their houses are ready in July, 2009.

1769 1770

We also had a complaint saying that when the Leader of the Opposition went to France, the officers who came to the airport to meet him had told him that they have got instructions from Colombo not to provide protocol. When people from the Embassy come to the airport to receive him, is that not part of the protocol service? What else do you call it? Of course, there are young gentlemen - young boys - who are in protocol service who come to the airport. There are certain types of services that we can provide. We cannot provide services that they may have wanted. So, that may be the reason why they would have told that they cannot provide that service. Those may be the services that they were referring to, which I am not aware of. ( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) Are you referring to the foreign service? ( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila ) That I do not know. You should know better. Another thing that came to light - and I think that this is something that the people of the country should know - is that a person who was a Member of Parliament of the United National Party and who helped a person who had defected from the LTTE to come to Colombo, has been appointed by us to the Washington Mission. Today they are against our giving a job to a person who worked against the LTTE and took up arms against the LTTE. This shows the nexus between the LTTE and the UNP. This is the sort of work that the UNP is doing. ( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) . ( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila) This is what he spoke about. The Hon. Member on his feet there, spoke about irregular appointments. Whom did they appoint to Singapore? Who was Jayaratne? What were his qualifications? Who was Rosy Senanayake who was appointed to Malaysia? What were her qualifications? Who was the person, the massive, appointed to Washington? All types of allegations that the UNP is making against our Government at this time are baseless. I can only say, Hon. Deputy Speaker, that all these emanate from petty jealousies within the rank of the Opposition because our Leader, His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa is going to be elected as the President of the SAARC.

We heard one Member of the Opposition talking about how fallen down we are among the international community. Seven members of the SAARC region; eight other observer countries - all are coming to Sri Lanka with the topmost and secondary level delegations. Is that not a sign of confidence considering the security and the stability of our country? There were some allegations made that leaders of some countries are not coming. Who are they to decide on who the leader of a country is? They said that the Pakistani leader is not coming. I can tell you that the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Yousuf Raza Gilani is going to be here. If they do not consider him to be a leader, that is their lookout. [Interruption.] You cannot decide as to who the leader of Pakistan is. You may be able to decide as to who the leader of the LTTE is because of your connections with the LTTE. Whether Musharraf comes or Gilani comes, it is not for you to decide. It is a matter for the people of that country to decide. That is a sort of democracy you have within your party. That we know. But you should allow democracy to flourish in those countries. ( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) , - [ ] ( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila ) . . , . [ ] Then the Opposition was talking about the unnecessary expenditure incurred on international meetings. They talked about The NAM. But they conveniently forgot to talk about the SAARC Summit that was held in Sri Lanka under the UNP Government. That was the SAARC Summit that had to be postponed because leaders refused to come and on a small-scale that Summit was held in the following month. If we are talking of politics, all this should be discussed. I very much appreciate what the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake said that they are willing to join hands with the Government for a better future of the country. But, it should not be done with undue motives. They talked about the GSP Plus and mentioned that the GSP Plus application has not been sent. There is a time for that. We have time till October to send the application to get GSP Plus concessions. What is this big hurry? Why should we send this application now? They go around the European countries campaigning that Sri Lanka should not be given these concessions and at the same time they come here and shed crocodile tears saying that 200,000 people in the garment industry are going to be affected and another 500,000 people in other industries will also be affected.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, we are confident that this Summit is going to bring immense benefit to this country not only due to the relations among the seven countries but also because of the large number of foreign media personnel and journalists who have already arrived here and who are going to be here for the next few days. The positive impact of this Summit is going to be felt not only by Sri Lanka and the SAARC countries but also by other countries of the world which will result in many more people coming to Sri Lanka not only as tourists but also in the field of investment. One matter which I will touch on before I wind up, Mr. Deputy Speaker, is that there was an allegation that we are conducting a tourist tamasha with these monies. The tourism promotion programme that is being held in the South has nothing to do with the SAARC Summit. It has not been organized by the organizers of the SAARC Summit or by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs but by the Tourist Board as a part of their normal day-to-day programmes. We have to look into many other aspects when the SAARC countries are going to be here. I thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and I would commend this Supplementary Estimate as well as the Notification under the Consular Functions Act to the House. Thank you. , . . Question put, and agreed to.
