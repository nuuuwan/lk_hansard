Hurulle - Petitioner COUNSEL Y.I.W. Wijayatilake, P.C., A.S.G., with Janak de Silva,S.S.C., Maithree Amerasinghe, S. C., for the attorney General Shibly Aziz, P.C., with Anandi Cooray, Anslam Kaluarachchi, Sabrina Ahamed for the Petitioner (No. 4/2008) Court assembled for hearing at 10.30 a.m. on 24th October 2008 The above petitions presented in terms of Article 121(1) of the Constitution were taken up for hearing and considered together since it was agreed that the grounds of constitutionality raised in the petitions were identical. The Petitioners in their submissions urged specific issues in respect of clauses 2 and 6 and contended that the Bill is inconsistent with Articles 148 and 150 of the Constitution. Article 148 reads as follows : Parliament shall have full control over public finance. No tax, rate or any other levy shall be imposed by any local authority or any other public authority, except by or under the authority of a law passed by Parliament or of any existing law. The Petitioners submitted that full control over public finance vested by this Article would form part of the legislative power of the People exercised by Parliament in trust for the People in terms of Article 4(a) of the Constitution. It was further contended that funds of the Republic not allocated by law to specific purposes form one Consolidated Fund in terms of Article 149(1) of the Constitution and that withdrawals from it have to be in terms of Article 150(1) and (2) of the Constitution that read as follows : (1) Save as otherwise expressly provided in paragraphs (3) and (4) of this Article, no sum shall be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund except under the authority of a warrant under the hand of the Minister in charge of the subject of Finance. (2) No such warrant shall be issued unless the sum has by resolution of Parliament or by any law been granted for specified public services for the financial year during which the withdrawal is to take place or is otherwise lawfully charged on the Consolidated Fund.

2633 2634

Paragraphs (3) and (4) of the Article mentioned above relate to instances where Parliament is dissolved and are not relevant to the matters at issue. The Petitioners also submitted that to meet urgent and unforeseen expenditure there should be a Contingencies Fund as provided in Article 151(1) of the Constitution and when advances are made from the Consolidated Fund there should be a Supplementary Estimate presented to Parliament to replace the amount advanced in terms of Article 151(3) of the Constitution. It is common ground that at present there is no Contingencies Fund and the fiscal position of the country does not permit the establishment of such a Fund. Conceding this position the Petitioners contended that in any event in keeping with the full control Parliament should exercise over public finance, when funds are required to meet unforeseen expenditure, such expenditure should be approved by Parliament on the basis of a Supplementary Estimate in the manner provided for in Article 151(3) of the Constitution. We are in agreement with the submissions of the Petitioners as to the basis on which the full control over public finance vested in Parliament should be exercised. In the Determination made by a Bench of Seven Judges in regard to the Bill titled the 19th Amendment to the Constitution (S.D. No.1140/2002) this Court laid down the manner in which the provisions of Articles 3 and 4 of the Constitution as to sovereignty of the People and its exercise have to be interpreted. According to that Determination in terms of Article 4(a) of the Constitution, Parliament is the custodian of legislative power of the People and will exercise that power in trust for the People in whom sovereignty is reposed. Legislative power includes the full control over public finance as stated in Article 148 cited above, which in our opinion is also a vital component of the balance of power firmly established by the Constitution in relation to the respective organs of Government. Article 30(1) of the Constitution states that the President is the Head of the Executive and of the Government. in terms of Article 43(1) the Cabinet of Ministers is charged with the direction and control of the Government and is collectively responsible and answerable to Parliament. One important check on the exercise of executive power is that finance required for such exercise remains within the full control of Parliament the legislature. There are three vital components of such control in terms of the Constitution viz; (i) Control of the sources of finance i.e. imposition of taxes, levies, rates and the like and the creation of any debt of the Republic; (ii) Control by way of allocation of public finance to the respective departments and agencies of Government and setting of limits of such expenditure; (iii) Control by way of continuous audit and check as to due diligence in performance in relation to (i) and (ii). Since such control is exercised by Parliament in trust for the People, we are of the opinion that the process should be transparent and in the public domain, so that People who remain Sovereign are informed as to the manner control is exercised. It follows that any Act of Parliament concerning public finance should be premised on a disclosure of the basis of such enactment so as to be transparent in its implications. And, an Act lacking in such transparency or being an alienation of control by Parliament would be inconsistent with Article 148 of the Constitution.

In the light of the foregoing we would consider the specific grounds urged in respect of clauses 2 and 6 of the Bill.

Clause 2 of the Bill The Appropriation Act is the foremost legislation concerning public finance for any particular financial year. The Preamble to the Bill, under review specifically states that it is intended to make financial provision in respect of activities of the Government during the financial year and for the payment of advances from public funds.

The format of Appropriation Bill has been broadly similar over the years. Following such format Clause 2 of the Bill contains an estimate of Government expenditure for the forthcoming year, that is 1.1.2009 to 31.12.2009 (financial year 2009). A statement of such expenditure is contained in the first schedule under different Heads, with each Head having one or two programs. One program, styled Programs No. 1, relates to Operational Activities applicable to all Heads. The other Programme, styled Programm 2, relates to Development Activities applicable only to certain Heads. It is a known parliamentary practice that after the second reading of the Appropriation Bill the Committee of the whole House considers each Head of expenditure separately on the basis of the detailed estimates that are presented to Parliament. The Petitioner in S.D. 3/2008, Mr. Nihal Sri Amarasekara, submitted that the Recurrent and Capital Expenditure estimated at Rs. 980,634,464,000 (approximately Rs. 980 Billion) specified in clause 2(1) being the total of the expenditure under the Heads set out in the first schedule does not in fact constitute the totality of government expenditure in the financial year 2009. That, this figure does not include the debt service payments due from Government by way of interest and capital in the financial year 2009 in respect of the loans taken and the debt raised by the Republic. On that basis he submitted that there is a non disclosure of the total expenditure of Government for the financial year 2009 and that clause 2 premised on such non disclosure is inconsistent with Article 148 of the Constitution. The submission of the Additional Solicitor General who supported the Bill is that clause 2(1) contains a reservation that the expenditure of Government set out therein is without prejudice to any other laws authorizing any expenditure It was submitted that there are other provisions in the Construction and specific laws that provide for payments from the Consolidated Fund and that such expenditure is not included in the sum of approximately Rs. 980 Billion set out in clause 2(1). It was further submitted that details of such expenditure would be tendered to Parliament in the Budget Estimates of 2009. An extract of which was submitted to Court. Accordingly to this extract in the financial year 2009 in addition to the Rs. 980 Billion specified as expenditure of Government, a further expenditure of Rs.738,779,568.000 (Approximately Rs. 738 billion) would have to be incurred for such other expenditure. Thus the expenditure of Government for the financial year 2009 would not only be 980 billion specified in clause 2(1) but also include a further Rs. 738 Billion, totaling Rs. 1719 Billion. Of this a component Rs. 722 Billion would be for debt service, whereas the estimated revenue for the year is Rs. 875 Billion. Whilst there may be some merit in the submission of Addl. Solicitor General that clause 2(1) makes a reservation in respect of expenditure authorized by any other law, the submission of the Petitioner that clause 2(1) does not set out a proper account of governmental expenditure for the financial year is correct. The purpose of the Appropriation Bill is to set out the estimate for the financial year. Debt service and other matters in respect of which the expenditure is charged on the Consolidated Fund are equally activities of the Government. Any estimate to be complete should include the totality of the expenditure in respect of all Government activities in the financial year. In this instance the total expenditure is clearly not disclosed in clause 2(1). A large compenent of approximately Rs. 738 Billion is not included. In was submitted by Addl. Solicitor General that the borrowing limit of 849 billion is set out in clause 2(1)(b), to meet the deficit between the total expenditure of approximately Rs. 1719 billion and the expected revenue of Rs. 875 Billion. In other words it is expected to meet the debt service payments due in the financial year 2009 amounting to Rs. 722 Billion by raising further debt. Is it relevant to note that here, that as submitted by Mr. Amarasekaera, in terms of clause 2(1)(b) proceeds of loans could only be used to meet the expenditure of Rs. 980 Billion included in clause 2(1). Accordingly debt service payments that are not included in clause 2(1) cannot be met from the proceeds of loans. Be that is it may, assuming the premise presented by the State, the Government is caught in a veritable debt trap in which debt service payments for the current year are met by raising further debt in that year

2008 04 2635 2636

thereby increasing the debt service payments for the succeeding year. These facts have been kept away from the public domain by the statutory device in clause 2(1) of excluding expenditure under any other law. The staggering debt service payments of Rs. 722 Billion for the financial year 2009 reflect an accumulation of public debt over the past years that has resulted from irresponsible and reckless handling of public ficnance by the Treasury and a failure on the part of Parliament to exercise full control of public finance as mandated by Article 148 of the Constitution. Hence we agree with the submission of the Petitioners that the enactment of the Clause 2 in the present form without the disclosure of the additional expenditure of Rs. 738 Billion would amount to an inconsistency with Article 148 of the Constitution. The Clause would cease to the inconsistent if it is amended by the inclusion of the expenditure already charged on the Consolidated Fund in terms of other laws being approximately Rs. 738 Billion according to the Estimates. Such items of expenditure may be included in a separate schedule. Clause 6 (1) of the Bill This clause permits the Secretary to the Treasury, the Deputy Secretary to the Treasury or the Director General of National Budget Department to transfer any money allocated under the Development Activities Program appearing under Head Department of National Budget as specified in the 1st schedule to any other Program under any other Head in the schedule. It further provides that the monies so transferred shall be deemed to have been covered by a supplementary estimate by the appropriate Minister. The submission of the Petitioners is that the allocation of money under the respective Heads in the Appropriation Act is a legislative measure taken by Parliament and the provision in clause 6 in effect empowers the Treasury officials to amend the allocation that has been made by Parliament. It was also submitted that if there is a shortfall in the allocation made to a particular Head of expenditure the proper procedure in terms of the Constitution is to present a supplementary estimate to Parliament. In terms of clause 6(1), instead of such supplementary estimate being submitted to Parliament, the Treasury officials are empowered to provide the extra allocation which is then deemed to have been covered by supplementary estimate submitted by the appropriate Minister. On this basis it was contended that the clause amounts to an alienation of the full control of Public Finance vested in Parliament by Article 148 read with Article 150(1) and (2) cited above to Treasury officials. Hence clause 6 is inconsistent with Articles 148 and 150 (1) and (2) of the Constitution. A similar challenge was made in respect of the Appropriation Bill of 2007, and this Court having considered the matter, made a determination that there was no alienation of Parliamentary control of Public Finance. The Petitioners now contend that the said determination was made without examining the nature and volume of the transfers made and on the assumption that such transfers are duly reported to Parliament through the medium of the Reports submitted to Parliament in terms of the Fiscal Management (Reponsibility) Act No. 3 of 2003. It is recorded in the determination that the transfers should be specifically indicated in the relevant Reports submitted in terms of Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act No. 3 of 2003, with reasons for the particular deviations. The Petitioners submitted the Mid Year Fiscal Position Report 2008 submitted to Parliament covering the first 4 months of the year 2008 which admittedly does not include any of the transfers that have been made. In the result, up to date transfers made in respect of the current year have not been reported to Parliament. This position is conceded by the State. Addl. Solicitor General submitted that the Fiscal Management Report 2009 would be presented to Parliament on 6th November 2008 (Budget day). An initial copy of which was tendered to Court. This copy reveals that during the period 1st January to 30th September 2008, Treasury officials have made 108 transfers in terms of clause 6(1) of the 2007 Appropriation Act. A sum of Rs. 7,558, 078-445 has been transferred from the Recurrent Account and a sum of Rs. 13,422,507, 041 has been transferred from the Capital Account under the Head Department of National Budget That is nearly Rs. 21 Billion have been transferred by. Treasury officials during the period from the Development Activities Program to other activities under a large

number of Heads. The transfers reveal that many of them have been for foreign travel, purchase of vehicles and for other miscellaneous items of expenditure far removed from Development Activities. Furthermore this report does not specify any reason which required the particular deviations to be made. Hence there has been no compliance of the determination made by this Court. The items of Government expenditure are included under over 300 Heads, specified in the 1st schedule to the Bill. As noted above each Head has one or two Programs, in respect of which too, specific amounts are stated. This allocation is a legislative act of Parliament in the exercise of powers vested in Parliament in terms of Articles 148 and 150 of the Constitution. Form the Appropriation Act No. 44 of 2003 onwards a budgetary practice evolved in which large allocations have been made under the Head Department of National Budget, with a provision similar to clause 6 referred to above authorizing a transfer by Treasury officials to any other Head. By this means the recourse to Parliament to obtain supplementary allocations when there is a shortfall in any particular Head has been obviated and that function of Parliament has been; alienated to Treasury Officials who have made transfers form the amounts allocated to Development Activities under the Head Department of National Budget. Addl. Solicitor General conceded that although an Program is titled Development Activities, in fact it is utilized for miscellaneous expenditure. In the present Bill under Head 240 titled Department of National Budget following amounts are allocated under the Development Activities Program, where Rs. 4,980,000,000 as Recurrent Expenditure and Rs. 27,647,500,000 as Capital expenditure. Accordingly a sum of approximately 32 Billion is thus set apart to be transferred at the discretion of Treasury officials to any other Head. As noted above for 9 months in the current year 108 such transfers have been made amounting to Rs. 21 Billion. Accordingly to the same Report titled Fiscal Management Report 2009 which as stated above will be tabled in Parliament only on 06.11.2008, during the period 16.10.2007 to 31.12.2007, 127 such transfers have been made totaling a Recurrent expenditure of Rs. 34,422,384,169 and a capital expenditure of Rs. 33,262,585,762. Thus during the period of 2 1/2 months transfers have been made upto approximately Rs. 69 Billion. An examination of the subjects in respect of which and the amounts of such transfers reveal that the then Secretary to the Treasury has been operating a Budget of his own. It appears that the observation made in respect of previous years Appropriation bill has inhibited such transfers showing a marked reduction of such transfers, from 69 Billion for 2 1/2 months in 2007 to Rs. 21 Billion for the first 9 months of this year. But the problem remains. For the reasons stated above we are of the opinion that clause 6(1) of the Bill is inderogation of the control of public finance that should be exercised by Parliament and is accordingly inconsistent with Articles 148 and 150 of the Constitution. Addl. Solicitor General submitted that in the current volatile fiscal situation some measure of flexibility should be permitted since the allocations in schedule 1 are made on a lower estimate than what would be the actual expenditure. In the circumstances the power of transfer as provided in clause 6(1) should be sustained by providing Parliament with an effective opportunity of reviewing each transfer. We are inclined to agree with this submission in respect of which the Petitioners had no serious objection. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the inconsistency with Articles 148 and 150 would cease if clause 6(1) is amended by the inclusion of a specific provisions that the money so transferred shall be deemed to be a supplementary allocation made to the particular Ministry and the transfer including the reasons therefore are reported to Parliament within a period of two months form the date such transfer is effected. For the reasons stated above we make a determination in terms of Article 123 of the Constitution that provisions in clauses 2(1) and 6(1) of the Appropriation Bill 2008 are inconsistent with the Constitutiion and may only be passed by special majority required under the provisions of Article 84(2) of the Constitution.

2637 2638

We also make a further determination (i) if clause 2(1) is amended by the inclusion of the expenditure already charged on the Consolidated Fund in terms of other laws, with such items of expenditure being included in a separate schedule; and, (ii) clause 6(1) of the Bill is amended with the inclusion of specific provision that the money transferred shall be deemed to be a supplementary allocation to the relevant Ministry and reported to Parliament stating the reasons for such transfers within a period of two months from the date of the transfer. We wish to place on record our appreciation of the assistance rendered to Court by the Additional Solicitor General and the Secretary, Ministry of Finance who was present in Court and produced all material documents; and Mr. Nihal Sri Amarasekara who appeared in person and Presidents Counsel who appeared for the other Petitioner.

Hon. Speaker, I am sure the Hon. Members are closely following developments in the country, especially the ongoing operations by our security forces in the North to disarm the LTTE and restore democracy, peace and stability to the region. In this context, our close and regular interaction with India, whose friendship and goodwill which we greatly value, has assumed critical significance in recent times. Of particular importance has been the recent visit of the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, Senior Adviser to the President, as the Special Envoy of the President to New Delhi. The successful outcome of his discussions with the Indian leadership is most reassuring for the peoples of India and Sri Lanka and all those friends and well-wishers who desire for lasting peace in Sri Lanka. Of course, it goes without saying that enemies of peace and the prophets of doom, who had predicted otherwise, are naturally disappointed. In this context, I believe it is my duty to keep the Hon. Members apprised of the ongoing dialogue with India, insofar as we address the concerns expressed by India regarding the current situation in Sri Lanka. In doing so and making this Statement, I would also attempt to provide a reply to the matters raised by the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera on 21st October, 2008. Hence, I feel it is appropriate that I table* the two official communiqus issued jointly by India and Sri Lanka in New Delhi on 26th October, 2008 at the conclusion of the Hon. Basil Rajapaksas visit. They are, the India-Sri Lanka Joint Press Release and the India-Sri Lanka Joint Statement on Fishing Arrangements. The visit of the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa to New Delhi must be viewed in the backdrop of the strong bonds of friendship and trust that the Government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa has forged with the political leadership of India, as a manifestation of the longstanding historical ties between India and Sri Lanka. Hon. Members would recall that I alluded to this aspect of our bilateral relations with India in my statement to this House on 21st October, 2008. This visit therefore took place as part and parcel of the high level political dialogue between the two countries which President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Indian Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh had agreed to maintain. Hon. Members will be aware that President Rajapaksa telephoned Dr. Manmohan Singh on 18th October to keep him abreast of the current situation, during which conversation, he informed the Indian leader that the Government of Sri Lanka has taken utmost precautions to ensure the safety and well-being of civilians who have been displaced. The Government attaches the highest importance to the humanitarian needs of not only the Internally Displaced Persons, IDPs, but also all civilians

trapped in the conflict-affected areas of Vanni in the Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu Districts. I wish to categorically state that there is absolutely no shortage of food or essential items in Vanni. The Commissioner-General of Essential Services has received confirmation to this effect from the Government Agents of Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu. Hon. Speaker, the question then arises as to why the Sri Lankan Government has agreed to accept the 800 tons of relief material from India for the affected civilians in the North as per the India-Sri Lanka Joint Press Release. The answer is quite simple and it lies in the self-same Press Release. Since the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera is attempting to stir up an unnecessary controversy on this matter, I feel it would be useful to quote the relevant extract from the India-Sri Lanka Joint Press Release. It states, I quote: As a gesture of goodwill, India has decided to send around 800 tonnes of relief material to Sri Lanka for the affected civilians in the North. The Government of Sri Lanka will facilitate the delivery. Both sides agreed to consult and co-operate with each other in addressing these humanitarian issues. A plain reading of the above extract makes it abundantly clear that the envisaged humanitarian assistance is to be provided to the civilians in the conflict-affected areas in the North as a gesture of goodwill by India towards Sri Lanka. This aid is, after all, a manifestation of the friendship and good neighbourliness between our two countries. It is in this same spirit of friendship and goodwill that Sri Lanka extended a token financial grant of US Dollars 25,000 as immediate relief to the Government of the Union of Myanmar in the wake of the devastating cyclone "Nargis" which hit the country on 2nd May, 2008. We also offered to send a team of doctors and nurses to provide medical assistance to the victims of the cyclone. Similarly, when a massive earthquake struck the Sichuan Province in China on 12th may, 2008, Sri Lanka was one of the first countries to come forward and provide immediate humanitarian relief to assist the survivors of this terrible tragedy. On President Rajapaksas personal instructions, I organized the dispatch of relief material worth over US Dollars 1.5 million, which included tents, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment to the Sichuan Province. We arranged a special A-340 SriLankan Airlines flight on 25th May to the regional capital, Chengdu. The Chinese President, Hu Jintao and the entire political leadership of China have expressed their gratitude and appreciation to President Rajapaksa for his deep personal concern for the people of China. When torrential floods hit Nepal in August, Sri Lanka once again showed its solidarity to the Nepalese people by making a token contribution of US Dollars 25,000 to the Nepalese Government as relief assistance for the victims.

* . . Placed in the Library. 4 PL 003381 (2008/11)

2693 2694

This is not all. When heavy rains caused major floods in the Indian State of Bihar in September 2008, only two months ago, which displaced over two million people, the Government of Sri Lanka, in keeping with its policy of friendship and goodwill that is deeply rooted in our culture and national ethos, offered humanitarian relief for the flood victims in the form of a cash donation of US Dollars 50,000. The cheque for this amount was handed over by our High Commissioner to the Resident Commissioner of Bihar in New Delhi on 12th September, 2008. On that occasion, the High Commissioner of Sri Lanka in India, Romesh Jayasinghe had referred to the letter that His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa had sent to the Indian Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, the previous week, in which the President had recalled that the State of Bihar has a special place in the hearts of Sri Lankan Buddhists, since every year tens of thousands of Buddhist pilgrims visit the State to pay homage to the sacred land where the Lord Buddha attained Enlightenment. I feel it would be in the fitness of things to table the Press Release that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued in this connection. I drew the attention of this august Assembly to these matters in order to disabuse the minds of the general public of Sri Lanka of any ulterior motive that certain interested parties are trying to impute to the Government of India for the humanitarian assistance it has offered to the civilians in the North who have been affected by the conflict. Hence, the people of Sri Lanka should not be misled by those who are attempting to give a mischievous construction to this noble gesture of goodwill extended by India. We are open to receiving humanitarian assistance and relief from any other friendly country that wishes to contribute towards the Governments efforts to keep an uninterrupted supply of goods and essential services to the civilians in the conflict-affected areas. Hon. Members would recall that in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami disaster which struck Sri Lanka in December 2004, there was a worldwide spontaneous outpour of sympathy for the victims which soon translated itself into massive consignments of emergency relief items being sent to Sri Lanka from several countries. I must emphasize that it is the Government that has carried the major burden of feeding and providing essential services including medical and educational facilities to the people in the uncleared areas of the Vanni without any interruption since the onset of the conflict despite several attempts by the LTTE to disrupt the transport of these goods. Since August 2006, the Government through the Commissioner-General of Essential Services has sent 37,000 metric tons of food items to Kilinochchi and 35,000 metric tons to Mullaitivu.

The Government deeply regrets the temporary inconvenience and the hardships that our people in Vanni are experiencing which will be soon over. The Government will never abandon them and will continue to take care of their needs and welfare despite many obstacles. President Mahinda Rajapaksa is personally monitoring the situation. Addressing Sri Lankan media heads and editors at Temple Trees on 21st October he said, Our primary responsibility as a Government is to look after all our citizens. I carry out this responsibility to the fullest especially with regard to the people who are temporarily displaced in the North due to the ongoing military operations to defeat terrorism. There is a wrong impression created in Tamil Nadu that this has not been done. This is furthest from the correct position. All these are our citizens and we take every measure to look after and provide for them. Let me reiterate to this House that our Government has not been subject to pressure from any quarter to halt the ongoing military operations to defeat terrorism. On the contrary, we have received the unstinted support and co-operation of our friends in the international community to pursue this goal. In fact, the India-Sri Lanka Joint Press Release of 26th October explicitly endorses the common position shared by both countries that terrorism should be countered with resolve. Indias stand on this matter could not have been expressed in a more unambiguous and candid manner. The political leadership of India fully understands and appreciates the imperative and urgent need to rid Sri Lanka of the scourge of terrorism which has cost us dearly in terms of the many thousands of lives lost, the huge economic losses suffered consequent to vital national assets being destroyed by the terrorists apart from the climate of fear and insecurity that grips the ordinary civilians who agonize whether they would be caught up in the next train or bus bomb planted by the terrorists. President Mahinda Rajapaksas administration from its inception is firm in its resolve to defeat terrorism and provide a durable political solution to address the genuine grievances of the minority communities. Even today, the Presidents commitment to peace remains undiminished. He has categorically rejected the notion that the Government is pursuing a military solution. Addressing the All Party Conference on 11th October, President Rajapaksa declared, However difficult it may be, it is my belief that the efforts to find political solutions to political issues should be continued. It is my belief that there are no military solutions to political questions. The people have elected us to realize their aims and aspirations. It is our duty to ensure to the Tamil people of the North the same democratic rights as enjoyed by the people in all other parts of the country. Military operations have become necessary to eradicate terrorism from the country and enthrone democracy throughout the land. For any political solution to be feasible, disarmament of the LTTE

[ ]

2008 04 2695 2696

is an essential prerequisite. As long as the LTTE remains armed and possesses the capacity to kill innocent civilians and destabilize public order, whatever political solution that may be proposed will simply not be viable. I must remind the Hon. Members of the House that President Rajapaksa has taken the lead in restoring democracy and civil administration to the Eastern Province, which was until last year a hot bed of terrorism and violence. Today, the political landscape in the Province has undergone a dramatic transformation, which one could scarcely have contemplated a year ago. Following the holding of Local Government Elections in the Batticaloa District and the subsequent provincial council elections, we have today an elected Chief Minister with a Board of Ministers functioning within the democratic institutional framework. It is the sincere desire of our Government to further enhance the democratic process in the Eastern Province and replicate the success of this model in the Northern Province too, once we eliminate the menace of terrorism from that region. Hon. Members would note that the Presidents sentiments regarding the Eastern Province have been reflected in the Joint Press Release. I want to assure the Hon. Members of the House that contrary to media speculation and comments of armchair pundits, there are no secret deals with India. I must once again emphasize that there are no secret deals with India. . . The excellent understanding that our Government has with the Indian Government in our efforts to defeat terrorism and restore democracy to the North is reflected in the Joint Press Release of 26th October, which is self-explanatory and which I have already tabled before this House. As President Rajapaksa has repeatedly said, the solution we seek is one which secures peace with honour and dignity. It cannot be peace at any cost since any such settlement is bound to fail. Unlike in war where there is a victor and vanquish, in a peace process all stakeholders are winners. I want to again emphasize that the Government is firmly and irreversibly committed to the peace process since the ultimate winners are the people of Sri Lanka. Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, can you tell us what are the conditions agreed upon between the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa and the Foreign Ministry of India to appease and satisfy Karunanidhi? Why are you keeping the people of this country in the dark? People have placed trust in you and put you in the Government and it is your duty to come and tell the people what took place and the conditions that were agreed upon. Why are you hiding that?

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) I only hope that my learned Friend listened to the detailed Statement that I made. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I listened. ( ) (The Hon.

I am still on my feet. Hon. Member, I am on my feet. After I have finished you can start. Sir, we have not had any sort of controversial agreements with India. It is basically a humanitarian process that was addressed during the visit of the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa as the special envoy of the President of Sri Lanka to Delhi. In that, we have reflected on the issues. We have discussed the humanitarian situation; we have discussed the political process; we have discussed the fisheries issue and all that is reflected here. I have already tabled it. The Hon. Member can read it and reflect on that.

I totally disagree with you. That is a political campaign that your party, the UNP, as well as some other parties have decided to carry on. That is a political campaign. Please do not say that.

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, it is a very sad occasion when we have to get up to debate the extension of the state of Emergency as this is an occasion where we recall the cycle of mounting tragedies that seem to be an inextricable part of our troubled history. The proclamation of a state of Emergency has serious implications for democratic governance, the rule of law and human rights. The Regulations allow you to bypass the public scrutiny of ordinary legislation. These Regulations also have an adverse impact on basic human rights as they derogate from constitutional safeguards relating to freedom from arbitrary arrest and from indiscriminate search and seizure operations, torture, extrajudicial killings and disappearances. Just look at what is happening in the East today. Speakers who spoke before me have elaborated on the position of the security there. The reason why we

2773 2774

opposed the TMVP contesting the Provincial Council Elections, is only because they were an armed group, they are still an armed group and today they are unable to control their cadres. They do not know whether their cadres belong to the Karuna Group, the Pillayan Group or the Velupillai Prabhakaran Group. That is the sad plight of the East today. In the East we have a bigger problem, the problem of land. The Leader of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress elaborated on some of the issues. But, what we have to remember here is that the people of the East are basically farmers and for over thirty years they have been cultivating lands which they are now deprived of, citing so many reasons. In fact, in my terminology, conservation is preserving what you have and conservation is not grabbing back and planting anew. These are some of the reasons that are attributed to the land disputes in Karango and Rathal Kulam in Pottuvil, Karanga Vattai in Ampara and so many other places in the East. Having said this, I am reminded of what Rabindranath Tagore said. He said, Truth raises against itself, the storm that scatters its seeds broadcast, and he also went on to say, The deepest source of calamity in history is misunderstanding. For where we do not understand, we can never be just.... Now this takes me to the statements made by the Commander of the Army and the Hon. Minister of Environment and Natural Resources with regard to whom this land belongs to and the status of the minorities. I do not want to get into a debate on the history of our motherland and about who came first and who came last. I have spoken about this before in this House and made my stand on this and I will state clearly again that this land belongs to all of us, who call ourselves Sri Lankans. I think, there is no dispute about that and I am very glad that the Hon. (Ven.) Ellawala Medhananda Thero today, did clarify to say that though this is called the land of the Sinhalese, it belongs to all of us. I would like to remind the Hon. Minister that history is also the worst enemy of those who are selfish and greedy. History exposes their deception, greed and conspiracy. This is why we have this protracted war that has taken us to the brink of collapse as a nation. You cannot expect to build a nation by suppressing and subjugating other nationalities. Mahatma Gandhi is on record as saying , "As human beings, our greatness lies not so much in being able to remake the world, as in being able to remake ourselves. We must become the change we wish to see in the world... and not the way in which you are heading Hon. Minister, but in building a nation by embracing all the competing nationalities and marching towards as one. That is the change every Sri Lankan wants to see. Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I would just say a few words in Sinhalese.

Let me conclude my speech by quoting Wilhelm Reich, an Austrian-American psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who said, They call you Little Man, Common Man; they say a new era has begun, the Era of the Common Man... I have never heard you complain: You promote me to be the future master of myself and the world, but you dont tell me how one is to be the master of oneself.

Your liberators tell you that your suppressors are Wilhelm, Nikolaus, Pope Gregory the Twenty Eighth, Morgan, Krupp or Ford. And your liberators are called Mussolini, Napoleon, Hitler and Stalin. I tell you: Only you yourself can be your liberator! This sentence makes me hesitate. I contend to be a fighter for pureness and truth. I hesitate, because I am afraid of you and your attitude towards truth , . . , . , . . . , , . , " " . Thank you.

[.. 3.08] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Sir. I stand in this House to speak on the extension of the state of Emergency which, as you know, has become a monthly ritual. I would like to start off with reference to the statement made by the Hon. Prime Minister in this House and ask as to why the casualty figures have not been given. Is it something astronomical or is it a new phase that has begun? But we would like to know why the Prime Minister has not made it public as to how many people have been injured. We have been looking at the Governments amnesia of convenience and change of policies which not only puzzles many, but also stun the Government Members who wonder as to what stance they should take and at which moment. If you look at the foreign policy, there are two different policies that have come out. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama, in this

2785 2786

House stated that there is no interference from any country and when we questioned in Parliament, he said, Neither has India nor any other country threatened, intimidated or made innuendos or has done anything to take preventive steps on the military action. At the same moment, you have got the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, the special emissary, who goes to India and comes back and takes the Western powers on. He says that certain Western powers in this country have an ulterior motive and say that there is no apparent reason as to why they are taking such an intransigent position when things are being done in a manner that is acceptable to them. Unfortunately, most of the politicians on the Government side with the heterogeneous alliance that they have, do not know at what time what will happen, as I told you. They do not understand that Sri Lanka happens to be inside the world and not the world inside Sri Lanka. This is the irony. So, with that in mind, we would like to get a clarification. I thank the Hon. Minister of Agriculture for giving me time to speak in advance because I need to attend to some other matter. Hon. Minister, , . . , ,

- Minister of Export Development and International Trade- . , Labour GSP . The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris says one thing and the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama says another thing. Now, I am made to understand that there are other Ministers who are creeping in saying, "they both cannot do the job and I will do it better" and trying to make a mockery of this exercise. I deviated from the topic but must get back to the Debate on the extension of Emergency because there is a necessity today to get an answer on the policy. Sir, you had the special emissary visiting India. Now, what was told to the Indian people made Mr. Karunanidhi so happy; that you were more happier coming out of the agreement rather than going into the agreement? You have Pranab Mukhergee going from Delhi to Madras, (Chennai) and speaking with Mr. Karunanidhi and he was happier than ever. So what was it that was communicated to Karunanidhi that made him so happy? Is it that the open fishing licences have been given? Is it the ceasefire agreement that is supposed to be brokered by India? Is it that the Thirteenth Amendment plus, plus which has gone even further than the Indian situation, for which this Government laughed at us earlier? We saw the writing on the wall and spoke certain sensible statements. But at that particular moment, there was such character assassination by those who are in the Government today - who were in the Opposition then - and today amnesia of convenience have brought them back into the same position.

I am happy to see that the Minister, the Hon. Prof. Tissa Vitharana is here. I guess it must be making his life easier these days. But as for the APRC, what has been going all this time? What has been happening? Now, you are supposed to railroad this process. Remember that when you did this in December last year, you were told, Okay. Well, you bring the report, but do not put what you want, put what we want. I hope that same irony does not befall this time also.

So the situation that befell us is due to this special arrangement between the Indian Government and the Sri Lankan Government which led to Karunanidhi retarding the process that he was supposed to take. We are happy if it is a step in the right direction. We accept the situation that the Government has realized that India is our best of friends when we require them. You need them to come into a solution but, at the same time we wonder whether there is an ulterior motive and this is only a temporary momentum until other acts are put to place. I guess, you have got to come clean on this type of thing. We have been experiencing this ethnic tension for such a long time. You would have to take a responsible stand. During elections you are just half a kilometre away from Kilinochchi and after the election you are being pushed back. .. , , . . .

This morning, the Minister of Foreign Affairs made a categorical statement that owing to humanitarian requests of the Indian Government, there is an acceptance of their generosity and that they would ensure that food stuffs are brought in. But, in the statement he also said that up to now, the Government of Sri Lanka has sent 32 tons to Vanni and 36 tons to somewhere else and the Indian Government is going to give 800 tons. Now, if that component is coming in, is it to feed a generation for the years to come or what is it? If 32 tons have been sent to Vanni and another 36 tons have been sent somewhere else all this time, 800 tons seem to be a huge component. So, we would like to know when it is coming, to whom it is being given and when it is going to take place. After all, instead of a forceful airdrop you have a persuasive handover. Earlier, the same Government said, "INGOs, get out of that place". You told the NGOs to go out. The Sri Lanka Red Cross that was locally helping the people there was told to leave. So, I do not understand what this Government is doing; whether they do have a policy or whether it is a "makeshift" policy or whether it is a "live by the minute" type of policy? The Government must have a stand. It must be able to come with a professional approach.

Mr. Presiding Member, for the sake of saving time, I table* The Hindu dated 29th October, 2008, which carries an interview with the President. I guess many would have read this. I table it and I only question the wisdom or the sagacity of the President who says, I quote: "First of all, this issue has been there for a long time, more than 20 years, and it's high time we came to a solution." I mean, has the President got up from his sleep suddenly and decided - ( ) (The Presiding Member)

Hon. Member, you have only three more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Sir, I have been given additional time. ( ) (The Presiding Member)

I am so sorry. I am helpless. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Okay. Thank you. Sir, I would like to know as to whether the President suddenly got from his sleep because this has been going on for a long time. He was one of the Members who basically protested outside the Pettah bus stand when the Thirteenth Amendment was being brought in. So, I guess these are statements which are made for "live by the minute" type of approach and I think the President has to come out with a more "statesmanlike" approach. The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe has been character-assassinated for taking a stand which is in line with the international community, which is in line with the Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Burgers, Malays and all other communities. And now only what he said has come to pass and suddenly there is a makeshift operation that is going on. The President goes on further. It states, I quote : It is my duty by the people of this country. And let me repeat: I myself will take charge of the political process and see it through politically. Up to now what has he been playing? Has he been playing marbles with this national issue? How many people have been injured? How many people are no more

with us? Our Colleagues, the late Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham, the late Hon. Nadarajah Raviraj and the late Hon. K. Sivanesan lost their lives. How many people have paid with their lives throughout this conflict? Also see how our Colleagues, the late Hon. T. Maheswaran, the late Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, the late Hon. D.M. Dassanayake and our war hero, the late Major-General Janaka Perera lost their valuable lives. So, is it that you have been playing around with peoples lives and suddenly realize when things are becoming difficult, that you have got to take a stand which is more in line with what has been accepted by all sensible political parties?

The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana and the Hon. Dew Gunasekara have been consistently maintaining a very cohesive policy. They know that we are a political party that calls a spade a spade. We have lost three elections. Yet we have the courage of conviction to take the stand that this is the way forward and now we are happy that the Government is suddenly coming back to our thinking. But what is going on? Sir, I would like to at this moment state that from the 2nd of April, 2004, the Government has spent Rs. 583 billion. . 2004 734. 2005 820. 2006 1,064. 2007 1,390. 2008 1,800. . 5,808 , .
