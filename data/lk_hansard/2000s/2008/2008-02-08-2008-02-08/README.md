VOTE OF CONDOLENCE: HON. T. MAHESWARAN [.. 11.17] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Speaker, I rise in this House to speak about one of our Colleagues, one of our Brothers who is not with us any more. It is with a great sense of sadness that I get up to speak about the late Hon. Maheswaran. A 42-year old Colleague of ours, married and having three children, came into this

1273 1274

world from Karainagar in Jaffna. He was born on the 10th of January, 1966 and had made an invaluable contribution to this House. He helped me tremendously when I was appointed as the Leader for the Colombo District. He was a person who gave a lot of strength to the United National Party, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe and our Colleagues here. He had his priorities in the correct place. He was a Colleague who lived as a true Sri Lankan. Though he was born a Tamil and Hinduism was his religion, he always thought of Sri Lanka first. He did not try to politicize or create an image saying that he is from the minority. He spoke on behalf of the majority as well. He had these qualities in him. His debating skills were as good as any one of us. Even though his mother-tongue was not Sinhalese, he had the ability and the courage to debate whenever there was a necessity. Hon. Speaker, the late Hon. Maheswaran had his primary education at St. Johns College, Jaffna and from there onwards he ensured that he did his best for his area. Then he ventured into the business field and became a successful businessman. In 1999, when the United National Party contested the first Presidential Election under the leadership of the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, he had the guts, the courage, the vision and also most importantly the indefatigable spirit to represent the UNP in Jaffna. When people were worrying about flying a green flag, he was there not only flying a green flag, but the Sri Lankan flag as well. That is the type of a Brother we have lost. He sat behind me and today his stony silence is absolutely felt in this House. Today, when we are speaking of a late Colleague of ours, we remember another lovable and amiable person, the Hon. Raviraj who is no more in this House. He was also a person who rendered an invaluable service to build a bridge between the Sinhalese, Tamils and the minorities of this country. He believed that the social fabric of this country is made up with the true spirit of the Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Burghers and Malays. Be they Buddhists, Christians, Hindus or Muslims, he thought that all these put together make the social fabric that shows the Sri Lankan spirit. That was what my Colleague, the Hon. Maheswaran fought for; that was the same that the Hon. Raviraj fought for and it was the same that the Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham fought for. These Members of whom we are now speaking, who got elected to Parliament are no more with us. How many more have we got to speak about before this senseless mayhem is stopped? Hon. Speaker, while he did his best for the party in the year 1999, the Hon. Maheswaran got elected to Parliament from the Jaffna District in the year 2000. The United National Party was proud that we had a Member elected from Jaffna after 1952, if I am not wrong. The Hon. Maheswaran flew the flag for us in Jaffna. It showed that you can be a Sri Lankan, a UNPer, a Tamil

coming from any corner of this country and that was the honour he brought us. Once again he got elected in 2001 and then in 2004 from the Colombo District. That is how we became very close and ensured that we looked after the interests of a country where we have lost governance. When the opportunity was there to bring durable peace to this country, it was snatched away from us and today we pay the price for it. A senseless, purposeless, destinationless journey we have embarked upon. People have been losing their lives in such senseless activities.

Hon. Speaker, all we could basically say is, let us at least learn lessons from these Colleagues who have lost their lives paying the price for politicization of certain issues. On the 1st of January 2008, around 9.35 a.m, a day on which everybody starts their journey from a religious place, our Colleague was killed in the very place where he would have loved to set foot on. In a Kovil, in Kochchikade in Colombo he was brutally gunned down. He was praying along with his little daughter when some absolute insane people killed our Colleague, yours and ours, Maheswaran. Hon. Speaker, he, in his dying moments said - the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe also stated that - , . Even at his dying stage he spoke in Sinhala to show the brotherhood which he cherished. What can we say? Sir, this House has become a place where we speak of all the good deeds of a person after he is dead and gone. It has become a fashion now. Let us stop this heinous crime, Sir. Just before we got on to the Vote of Condolence, you saw the mayhem in this Parliament. Character assassination is as bad as killing people. That has become a fashion of this Government. When it affects the Government it is a heinous crime; when it is committed on the Opposition it is a joyous time for them. It is the same when they think that they can eliminate our Colleagues in the Opposition and govern the country. Those curses can never be taken away. The little daughter who is crying for her father is long-felt in their hearts until the moment to say with thrill that they have reduced another UNPer. That is not the way you can solve the problem in this country, Sir. This is a pathetic situation. It has to be looked at in a manner that is well beyond politics. This country is not made only of Sinhalese. The strength, the social fabric of this country is made because we are Tamils, because we are Muslims, because we are Burghers and because we are Malays living along with Sinhalese. We must remember that the business acumen of the Muslims, the industriousness of the Tamils and the kind-heartedness of the Sinhalese collectively make a true Sri Lanka. That was what my Colleague who was directly behind me was espousing. Destroying his life on the 1st of January in a Kovil which nobody ever thinks of, is brutal. The late Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham lost his life in a Church. Where is this country heading? What has

2008 08 1275 1276

[ ]

happened to Sri Lankans who get up in the morning with religious activities? Sir, we have to turn the searchlights in. We have to find where this problem lies. Sixty years ago when our great Leader, the late Hon. D. S. Senanayake got freedom from the British, his only passion was to ensure that we take forward what the British had done. There are people who for political sake, are cursing the Dutch, the Portuguese and the British. But have we put enough efforts thereafter to prove that we, as Sri Lankans, have done better than what these people had done for the country? That is what we must realize and that is what we have got to learn and change ourselves. Shouting from platforms to protect people and when elected to represent their interests, gunning them down just because they do not share the opinion of the Government is the most heinous crime that can be committed. That is what has happened to my Friend, the late Hon. Maheswaran. He was a tower of strength for us, I must say, in the Colombo District. When some of our Friends were going to cross over to the other side, there were various attempts to take him as well. But he stood the test of time. He had various problems that were thrown against him as much as what is done against us. They think that making life difficult would yield temptation and make political changes. He believed like us when the going gets tough, the tough gets going. That is why he had paid the price. Hon. Speaker, you also have a big role to play in this House. There is no point saying after he is dead and gone, "I did my best." There is no point saying, "We should have done that" when we could have done. There is no point saying, "We are losing our worth" when the wife has lost her husband, when the children have lost their father and when we have lost a Colleague. I got up in the morning thinking that I must speak not only on behalf of the late Hon. Maheswaran but also on behalf of the Tamils that he spoke for, on behalf of the Sri Lankans and most importantly, on behalf of the family members who are unable to voice their opinion here. Why was the Hon. Maheswaran's security reduced? Just because he did not share the opinion of the people across the Divide when he stood and voted with the Opposition on the 14th of December, is that the crime that he had committed for his security to be reduced? I am not casting aspersions, but I am only saying that we have lost a Brother in Parliament and if we do not take cognizance of this fact, then what are we there for? If we do not speak on their behalf, we are hypocrites. If we do not speak of the anguish, the tears those families are shedding, then what are we there for? Hon. Speaker, I think it is your bounden duty - and it is a must at a time when the country is in crisis, thinking that the Ceasefire Agreement being torn would bring a solution to this country, and when there are chauvinist elements who think that a peace process is not the answer to this country - to ensure the protection of these people to the maximum. When we speak, we are not only speaking as

Members of Parliament who are elected to this House. The 225 Members of Parliament are not the entire Sri Lankan generation. Look at the seven innocent D.S. Senanayake College students who got killed. Who is responsible for that? What about the innocent people who got killed in Buttala, the innocent people who got killed in Nugegoda, the innocent people who got killed in Bakmeewewa, Dambulla? All these happened after the abrogation of the Ceasefire Agreement. The late Hon. Maheswaran was a great advocate that a peaceful proposition, a political solution is the only answer to the problem of the ethnic minorities. He was a minority. He had an absolute right to speak on behalf of his people and he said, "All we want is an honourable win-win solution in our country". We have lost a person who could voice an opinion, who can speak in Sinhala and tell the Sinhalese being a Tamil, "All we want is to partake in the futuristic activities of this country." After he died, various political connotations have come about, even the judicial process was put to test. When the accomplice was produced before the court, identification was a problem. We have an IGP in this country. When the Hon. Johnston Fernando, the Hon. Earl Gunasekara, the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera, the Hon. John Amaratunga and myself were there in the hospital he came, instead of even seeing the body of the Hon. Maheswaran in the morgue, went to see "the supposed to be accomplice" and then comes on the Rupavahini and says "Yes, we have caught the person." Three or four days later, after our lawyer, Mr. Ameen who, on behalf of the family spoke and ensured that the system of justice must work, it is converted to say, "No, he is not the person". Yes, there is a DNA test that has confirmed this. Then, whose person is he? Who was he working for? The Government was very quick to disown saying that there was no such security person. They were coming from here, there and everywhere but there was no proper answer given to this particular problem. Today, we are only talking of what happened but historical evidence is there to take it forward. The late Hon. Maheswaran mentioned that on the "Minnal" Programme on the 30th of December 2007. That young guy Sri Ranga takes on the system whether it is the President of this country, whether it is the Leader of the Opposition of this country or whether it is a foreign dignitary like the Indian Prime Minister or the Japanese Prime Minister; it does not mean anything to him. All what he wants is to get the proper answer to a particular question. The Hon. Maheswaran gave his brilliant best on the 30th and said, "I have compelling evidence to show what this Government is doing". Is that one of the reasons why he had to pay the price? There is no point in saying, just because he mentioned that in the "Minnal" Programme, he had to pay the price. What a concocted lie it is. He made even more hard statements on Max TV. Why is it that Sri Ranga or MTV or Sirasa or Maharaja Organization needs to be taken to task on a matter when the truth has been mentioned? His family bears testimony to what the Hon. Maheswaran had said. He is not a person who gets up just for the sake of shouting like

1277 1278

[ ]

some of the Members on the other side of the Divide. He had credible evidence and that is what he wanted to show to the general public. Hon. Speaker, it is time that we bury our political differences. We have lost the Hon. Pararajasingham. We have lost the lovable Hon. Raviraj. We have lost another lovable person, the Hon. Maheswaran. Whatever money you pay or whatever nonsense you talk, you can never bring their lives back again. So, at least, let us learn from here onwards that there is a necessity to stop the mayhem that is going on in the country. I must also mention of another Colleague, the Hon. D.M. Dassanayake who is no more with us in this House today. He may not be a Tamil but he is also a Colleague of ours whom we have lost. All I want to ask is, why was Hon. Maheswaran's security reduced? Yesterday, in Parliament I stated that the bullet-proof vehicle of the Leader of the Opposition was withdrawn. The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe is a person who said, when the Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar was in the Opposition, that it is our bounden duty to protect such people. He had 37 cars. It was increased to 38. He was given a house. He was fortified with security. When the Hon. Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka was in the Opposition, he wanted certain houses not only for decorum but for his safety and that was given. He was given vehicles. The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe is the person who is earning the wrath today. Even his 12 to14 year old bullet-proof vehicle that was given was withdrawn. A substitute car was given. That is also taken away. Are we waiting for things to happen to talk? When the Hon. Maheswaran died, he had only two security officers but to guard his corpse there were four security officers. What a life are we leading, Hon. Speaker ? I am speaking because my wife and I having children in the same classes of their daughters, feel the anguish. We felt the tremor that was there in their family and what they spoke can never be erased in a hurry. Not only that, the Hon. Maheswaran was seated directly behind me and his absence is felt by all of us. Let us take this as an opportunity to move forward. The Hon. Mano Ganesan is another Member of Parliament who is not in this country today. The Hon. Rauff Hakeem is another Leader who took a political decision. Has his security got to be restored by courts in this country? Have we got to go to courts to get our basic rights? Forget about human rights, we must have our basic rights in this country and that is what we are speaking of here today. Hon. Speaker, I think, it is nothing but right to speak of a way forward. Speaking of our Colleague is sad. His loss is felt but how can we stop these things happening? That is where the United National Party in its true feeling has got to ensure that we have a solution in this country. Hon. Speaker, we have a very unfortunate and a tragic situation in this country; that we cannot stay together is being proven day by day but the inability to provide a

solution for that is the saddest thing. When the answer is blowing in the wind, you try to give a different answer to that. The late Hon. Lalith Athulath Mudali in 1987 spectacularly displayed his ability going to Vadamarachchi. We won it. But we could not solve the problem. We, the United National Party fought the issue. The late Major General Denzil Kobbekaduwa under the then government of the late Hon. J.R. Jayewardene captured the East. We captured many parts of the North and we thought that we could bring in a solution. But the problem was not solved. Then in 1987, the Indian Peace Keeping Force came to Sri Lanka. The North and the East were captured but we were unable to solve the problem. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . . . . ( )

, , () . Whereupon MR. SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. (MRS.) NIRUPAMA RAJAPAKSA took the Chair. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Madam, you are another product of a true Sri Lankan, a Sinhalese who is married to a Tamil. That is what a Sri Lankan should be and we are proud of you, Madam, and I am happy to speak when you are in the Chair. The IPKF was unable to give a solution to the problem of this country. Even though many tried to accuse us that we negotiated through fear or we feared to negotiate, is absolute bunkum. We know that this problem has to be settled in a manner that is acceptable to all Sri Lankans in this country. Sri Lankans mean, as I said before, Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Burghers and Malays. When they are all to put together, they make a true Sri Lankan identity. That was what we were trying to get.

2008 08 1279 1280

Thereafter, there was a change of government. We had Anurudha Ratwatte going to Jaffna and hoisting the Sri Lankan Flag. But the problem was not solved. Then, we had the same situation back again in 1995 and 1996 of military adventures and misadventures. That is why the United National Party Government, on the 22nd of February, 2002, when the late Hon. T. Maheswaran was the Minister of Hindu Affairs, decided that we should have a Ceasefire Agreement with, I would say, the most-leading barbaric terrorist group. But they came to the discussion table. They thought, Yes, let us trust the Government and move forward. There was peace that dawned though it may not have been 100 per cent; it had its lacunas. But finally, there was a way forward. Today, many interpretations are given. But you are unable to come up with a solution. In order to solve this problem, the United National Party brought the District Development Councils. The Thirteenth Amendment was brought in. The very pundits who shout around today saying that the Thirteenth Amendment is the answer to the solution, created mayhem at that time by burning properties and conducting protests in Pettah. We are happy that even after 21 years, the Government now has the sagacity to accept the Thirteenth Amendment which basically as they feel, is the need of the hour. Madam, we, at this particular moment, say that there is a way forward. Just because we are in the Opposition, it does not mean that we oppose everything. Just because they are in the Government, it does not mean that whatever they say is correct. All we want to say is, please ensure that we take the Sri Lankan spirit forward. We, at this particular moment say that there is a necessity to solve the ethnic problem in this country. This is the best of times. The worst of time sometimes yeild the best results. I think, we have come to a situation where the Government feels that they are helpless and they are visionless. They believe in a military answer. Well and good! We, as the Opposition will never create a problem for those gallant security forces. The police is doing a magnificent job. We will never allow their benefits to be politicized by an incompetent, inept and a corrupt Government. That is why we are sad. "We have given time", they say. The Government and the Heads of the Armed Forces have said that by March this problem is going to be solved militarily. Our Leader of the Opposition, despite many problems created to the Opposition has said, "Yes, we will give the time that is required. But do not go beyond that". You have not given an answer to the cost of living, you have not given an answer to good governance and you are isolating yourself from the world. How long can we just keep on looking at a Government that is incompetent in handling and providing an answer to that? So, all we could basically say is that this is the best time to move forward. The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana, the Chairman of the APRC, has become helpless today. After meeting 65 times with a majority of parties, the Government showed a lion and brought forth a mouse today. That is the situation that prevails in this country. He spoke to us,

as the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition gave him all the support that was needed. He said he was to bring out one thing but owing to political compulsion brought out another thing. Should we not at least for the sake of Maheswaran, for the sake of Raviraj, for the sake of Joseph Pararajasingham and for the sake of D.M. Dassanayake look at this in a manner that is more pluralistic, more national-oriented and more as a Sri Lankan problem? We also have the Hon. Sampanthan of the TNA who has been espousing a political solution to this dexterous problem, but his voice is in the wilderness. Then we have the Hon. Senathirajah who has been espousing the same cause. All of us are trying to climb the same hill from different directions. But unfortunately, we seem to be at some point or the other unable to collectively travel that journey to the final height of this country in solving this issue. When we are just about to solve this issue, some problem overcomes us and the very opportunity of solving gets lost. So all I could say is, there is no point blaming the past. We, the living must ensure that we give an answer to a living problem. Let us all get together and ensure that we solve the biggest problem in this country. My personal belief is that the economic problem is the biggest problem in this country. Others share a different opinion but we have got to listen to all of them. Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana, I am sure you have a big role to play. The wind has been taken out of your sails. But you must have the courage of conviction to do what you have got to do. You must at least provide from your own conscience. You do not represent the LSSP when you sit there; you represent the country as the Chairman heading the APRC. The foreign dignitaries were speaking very highly of you. We, as the Opposition are proud of you but we were so disappointed when you delivered a mouse when you were supposed to deliver a lion. The foreigners are aghast as to what you have done. We know your problem. But you must be able to withstand that pressure. We, from the Opposition are doing that. You must have the courage to do so. The Colleagues who are in front of you are willing to help you. Why did they walk out? Why did we walk out? Why did the JVP walk out? That is all because in your heterogeneous Government, you cannot solve your problems and you want us to solve your problems. That is the problem in this country. So please before you talk about other people, before you talk about us, you better look at your end. Turn the searchlight inwards. You have taken every possible person on to your side but you are unable to deliver not only on the ethnic issue, not only on the cost of living, not only on the infrastructure of this country but even on good governance in this country. Where is the Seventeenth Amendment? You all are able to pass budgets, you have the majority, so why can you not solve the good governance issue and introduce the Seventeenth Amendment? Everybody has collectively put their strength together to give you an answer. So, what

1281 1282

is the delay? Now various excuses are being brought in this House in order to ensure that there is good governance. Do not think that political power is there for you always. You are at the tail end of your journey. Do not create problems when you have only a short distance to go. We always get a vote, an approval from the people to solve the problems of this country. We are character assassinated because we brought the Ceasefire Agreement. We are character assassinated because we brought the Thirteenth Amendment in this House. Today, you have to seek refuge in the same thing that you opposed and unable to deliver. A Colleague and ex-Member of this House, Mr. Anandasangaree said, You are today treating a cancer with the medicine that was prescribed for ulcer 20 years ago". I think, that is the most apt statement made in todays context. Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana, you do have a bigger role to play than this. I do not want to put you into political problems. But, in this journey you must stand way above the rest and say, At least I did what I could despite what the others wanted me to do. We will support you. We will help you despite others shouting around. There are some political clowns in this place who say that any solution is not good. They say Prabhakaran is one of the biggest problems. There is no question about it. We had this racial problem in 1948, in 1956 and in 1963. Was Prabhakaran there? So, do not think that this is the issue. This is well beyond that. Let us think about that. You know I have been advocating a tough stance. But I saw how the Ceasefire Agreement melted peoples thinking and I myself felt that the commercialization process is the best way to solve this problem. Giving a political solution is the best way forward and I am sure our Colleagues, the Hon. Sampanthan and his team will support if there is something genuine. Why should they come forward when they know that the Government is only politicizing issues? That is why we have lost our Colleague and Friend, the Hon. Maheswaran, that is why we have lost a Colleague we loved, the Hon. Raviraj and that is why we have lost the Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham and likewise, the Hon. D.M. Dassanayake. So, let us together and take this opportunity to ensure that this be the last time that such political cruel activities take place and move forward. The UNP has a pivotal role. Many foreign dignitaries come and tell us that we have the key. Yes, certainly we do so. But, we will help when we feel that it will bring a solution. Going back to a 21-year old solution is not the answer. What have you brought out of the Thirteenth Amendment? Now you say that a Committee has to go into this. Please, do not make fools of Sri Lankans. You can make fools of the Peoples Alliance Government, the JVP and the Jathika Hela Urumaya. We do not care. But do not make the international world to lose the confidence that they have on Sri Lanka. People outside our country think that Sri Lanka is a great country. There is no better country than Sri Lanka in this world for us. We have a big right because it is our forefathers; it is our leader, Rt. Hon. D.S. Senanayake who got Independence from the foreigners.

So, we have an absolute right and we will take that bounden duty forward unlike board-carrying chauvinistic elements who shout for every trivial issue but not for real burning issues. Are they talking of the cost of living? Are they talking when people die? When we were Governing they were making a big noise about the Manirasakulam Camp. Where are these Honourable Venerable Sirs who were shouting then? Where is Champika Ranawaka who was then just a normal commoner going to Manirasakulam Camp? Today, he has to go there in buffels. What is the solution they have provided? Hypocritically they have opposed us and today the very same people are saying that the Thirteenth Amendment is the need of the hour. Madam Chairperson, you are here today because you have a conviction to serve the people of Hambantota like your father whose benevolent service is appreciated by the people there. But is your strength reckoned? Is your ability taken into consideration by this incapable, incompetent Government? No. That is why we say that we do not want to politicize. As I said, those families are still shedding tears day by day. The innocent daughters are asking, Where is our father, will he ever return? Who is that insane person who took our father away? That is what those children are asking. That is what Maheswarans brothers are asking. And today we are debating as to who the hell is that accomplice who did that job. Let us stop this politicization. Let us think of the country and move forward. I, all along with my Colleagues, walked the six and half miles taking Maheswarans casket from his house on his final journey. Every single person in that long journey we walked along shed tears and said, Maheswaran was one of us. The most touching moment in that journey was, when silmanis came in and paid tribute to the late Maheswaran. That was something that touched every one of us. That showed what a pluralistic life Maheswaran led. So, I think we can speak minute after minute, hour after hour, day after day but that does not bring Maheswaran back again. All what we can say is, Maheswaran, even after your death, your voice is clear and loud and your principles are laudable. We will ensure to achieve what you could not. I hope the people of this country will realize what a mockery, what a hypocrisy and what a miserable journey this Government is taking this country through. There is a necessity to stop the journey which is going in the wrong direction. We are going to a destination unknown. We are heading there quicker than ever. Let us keep the grip together and let us make a difference together. Let us stop this politicization. Let us think as Sri Lankans. Let us think that this is our country and not somebody elses country and let us not shed another drop of blood in trying to get this problem solved. Madam, with your permission, may I as the leader of the Colombo District, on behalf of my Party, my Leader and my Colleagues request you to convey this

condolence message to Mrs. Maheswaran, the three children, the brothers and his family members. We share their loss and Maheswaran has not died in vain. Thank you.

, . , , . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and MR. SPEAKER took the Chair. .. . ( ) (The Hon. M. M. M. Musthaffa) Hon. Speaker, I think it is a privilege to speak on the Vote of Condolence of the late Hon. T. Maheswaran, who was a close friend of mine as well as other Members of the House. The Hon. T. Maheswaran used to call me every other day and have heart-to-heart discussions on certain matters arising in this country, especially about the problems in the North-East. He used to travel to Parliament with me as I also live just about 100 metres away from his house. May be, due to security threats, he used to call me and join me to come to Parliament. The day before he passed away or was killed by terrorists or whoever it is, which we all condemn unanimously, I was supposed to take part in the "Minnal" programme. I agreed to participate in that with him on that day. That day, I left Kalmunai and I was travelling via Udawalawe, Ratnapura when unfortunately, there was an accident. I saw a car turn upside down. Then, I had to stop and see who were the victims, but I did not see the victims. When I proceeded to the Kahawatta Hospital only, I came to know that it was a friend of mine. Then, I arranged his vehicle to be towed by a winch and took his family to Colombo. By the time I reached Colombo, it was about 6.45 p.m. While I was coming, the presenter of the "Minnal" programme, Mr. Ranga, kept on calling me saying, "Please, try your level best to come even if you are late by 10 or 15 minutes". But, I could not make it. I regret very much my not participating in it on that day. I should have participated in that programme on that day; I should have been a Member on the "Minnal" programme on that day. But, unfortunately, the Hon. T. Maheswaran was in it all alone. Though I did not watch the programme, he had spoken very harshly about his security threat, antagonizing certain groups. This is what people believe had led to his killing. So, this is an unfortunate incident. Other than intellectuals, leading politicians were also killed by terrorists or whoever it is or whatever group. So many intellectuals and leading politicians belonging to the Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim communities were assassinated. In that series of assassinations, the Hon.

Maheswarans killing was a notable one. People might think he was a chauvinist, which was not true. He became a Member of Parliament of the United National Party. First, he contested Jaffna, then he contested Colombo. He won both with a majority. But, I would say that today had he contested any Tamil-speaking area in the Island, he would have definitely won that seat. He was not a chauvinist; he was not thinking on that line, but he really had a feeling for his country. He felt for the suffering communities not only in Jaffna or in the East, but for all three communities in this country. As a businessman who travelled across the world and knew the business world, he had a real feeling for the country. So, we criticize and condemn his killing carried out by whoever it is or his untimely passing away. Today, it has come to light as to who the party was behind this killing. The late Hon. Maheswaran acted very cordially with anybody in Parliament. That is why today many Speakers spoke on his Vote of Condolence. There are more Speakers still waiting to speak. I hope it would be taken up on another day. So many Members of Parliament and Ministers spoke about him because he was a man who used to speak to everybody, though sometimes he behaved in the Chamber in a way we did not agree with. But, of course, the moment he came out of the Chamber, he was a friend of everybody. I remember during the UNP regime, he was the Minister of Hindu Affairs and he used to help all those temples. In my area, in the Ampara District, he gave out a number of cheques to temples and before handing over those, he called and told me, Myown, these cheques should be handed over by you. These cheques should be taken and delivered by you to the authorized people in the temples because I do not want to get the credit. You also must get credit. You are from that area. I know that you are moving very closely with all three communities. So, I want to give you a chance to hand out these cheques to the people of those kovils so that you would get some credit for it. He was such a wonderful character. I remember, when he came to my house in Kalmunai, he just slept on the floor. I told him, No, you have a bed. You have an air-conditioned room. You can sleep there. He said, No, Mr. Myown, I just want to sleep here; I want to relax. So, he slept on the floor. Such was his character. Everybody knows that he was a billionaire, but his lifestyle was very simple and acceptable to everybody. In the House, he spoke for hours and hours. He came out with his inner feelings for the suffering communities. He wanted to have a peaceful situation in this country. He was trying his level best to achieve it. He could have easily joined the TNA; he could have easily supported the Tigers, but he refused to contest the Jaffna District under the TNA. He wanted to be a member of a national party. This is why he chose to contest the Colombo District. Nobody ever thought that the Hon. Maheswaran would

2008 08 1315 1316

7 PL 002911 (2008/03)

win. But, he proved that he was a man with personality, a man with the peoples attachment. I know very well that not only the Tamil people, but also the Muslim and Sinhala communities voted for him. He was such a wonderful character. I feel sorry for the Hon. Maheswaran who used to call me every other day. His family would remember it though I do not speak to them directly. They know that he was so close to me. Every other day, he used to discuss with me very deeply, matters relating to the ethnic issue and his business activities. So, I lost one of my good Friends, I would say. Though our relationship started after both of us joined the United National Party, we felt that it was a long-term friendship. So, I offer my heartfelt condolences, regret and sympathies to his wife, children, brother and other members of the family. I offer not only my condolences but also that of my family and my people. They know that I was very close to him. Therefore, I offer my condolences to all the members of his family. I want to say in this House that when the late Hon. Maheswaran participated in the "Minnal" programme, he had spoken very harshly against some parties. But had I participated in it on that day, I could have cooled him down. I had been advising him; I had been telling him, Be careful, Hon. Maheswaran. You are behaving in such a way, maybe, because you are unable to bear it up. But remember, there are so many parties after you. They can damage you and put the blame on others. So, be careful. But, the Hon. Maheswaran was a fearless character. He wanted to do whatever he thought correct. That was his character.

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Nahamadhu Wa Nussali Ala Rasooluhul Karim Hon. Speaker, I wish to thank you for giving me the opportunity to express my Vote of Condolence on the passing away of the Hon. T. Maheswaran. On behalf of the Colombo District Members of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and brother voters of the Colombo District, I wish to express in this solemn House, our deepest sympathies on the demise of the Hon. T. Maheswaran. At the dawn of 2008, a new year for all Sri Lankans when one starts the day visiting his respective places of worship and meeting and greeting people, the most unfortunate event took place. The Hon. Thiagarasah Maheswaran was greeted with bullets and all of us were robbed and denied of a valuable Member of Parliament especially a leader for the minority Tamil-speaking people of this country who had his vocabulary skills in a trilingual manner. The Hon. Thaigarasah Maheswaran, a product of St. Johns College, Jaffna, a businessman of repute and a great social service-oriented individual chose his path otherwise when others took up to arms and started fighting for a separate state. He took up to democratic norms and lived up to his last days in the democratic process which we all appreciate. He expressed his voice for his people especially for the Tamil-speaking minority of this country in the Jaffna and the Colombo Districts. One must remember that the Hon. Maheswarans killing is a blow to the Sri Lankan identity because he represented the United National Party from the Jaffna District in the Fifth Parliament. He was the first Member to contest from the United National Party after 1952, after the formation of the Federal Party in the Jaffna District and after 42 years to be elected as a Member of Parliament for the Jaffna District with 11,900 preferential votes. As a non-Cabinet Minister of Hindu Religious Affairs and as a national democratic leader, his services by and large to the Hindu community kept his head up in the Colombo District at a time when the world identified every Tamil living being as a potential Tiger terrorist. He not only served the Northern people but also the Hindu

Indian community and the hill country Tamils as well. Though he was a man from a different district, he contested in the Colombo District at the Parliamentary Election of 2004 as a United National Front candidate and was successful. He also won the goodwill and affection of his people by polling 57,978 preferential votes. I remember with gratitude, when I met the Hon. T. Maheswaran in the venues of his election campaign as a brother member of the same party, when we visited the minority Muslim areas and to a greater majority of Tamils areas, he received us with garlands, engraving in our hearts his excellent personality and quality. The Hon. Maheswaran was a fearless politician and he lived with determination to fight for the cause of his people and he voiced the grievances of the Tamil people who are being oppressed. Being a son of Mother Lanka, he followed the democratic norms and lived up to the last days of his life fighting for the legitimate rights of the Tamil-speaking people. I have had the privilege of associating this Brother Parliamentarian in many programmes of protest against the Government such as the abduction of Tamil and Muslim business community members, agitations for freedom of press, human rights violations and for the freedom of the common people. The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress was ever so pleased to associate and participate in comradeship in the struggles organized by Brother Parliamentarians like the late Hon. Raviraj, the late Hon. T. Maheswaran and the Hon. Mano Ganesan. The people of this country must respect the great Gandhian quality, the path of non-violence that he followed. When many misunderstood Tamil brethren took up arms to reach their goal, the Hon. T. Maheswaran pledged in his oath of allegiance to work towards peace and prosperity in a spirit of tolerance and in a Sri Lankan spirit as a member of this august Assembly and he dedicated himself towards a united and unified Sri Lanka. His demise has created a great void to this nation and a loss of a great voice in Parliament. He was a man of action who kept Members of both sides of this House on their toes. Even after two decades of war, he spearheaded Tamil religious affairs as a true Tamil National leader in his own way. It must be repeated that his assassination by a sole assailant especially in a most sacred place of worship, in a Hindu Temple in Kotahena in the early hours of the 1st of January shocked the world over, inspired all Tamils, the Tamil blood and further generated groundswell of sympathy bringing sharp swings in public mood at a time our country is at a crossroads. One may wonder whether the Hon. T. Maheswaran, a Tamil in the democratic mainstream with a diversity of views and options had taken the correct path. Therefore let me seek the indulgence of this House to ask, was there not a lapse in the security of this great personality when the Government reduced the security of all party leaders and politicians especially after the Budget and whether

the window of terror was opened with the withdrawal of security giving bright ideas for possible assassinations of leaders in this country? We must all stand accountable when we sit here and when we talk in this august Assembly whether we are doing the right thing. The ministerial security department has opened the gates of terror where many evil-minded persons can take the shots. I must also say, that with the demise and burial of the Ceasefire Agreement signed in 2002 and the intensification of terror attacks, a very meaningful, effective and efficient system to ensure public security and safety has to be given top priority and the need of such a system is the need of the hour. The list of tragic events in this country after the dawn of the new year, on the first day itself, with the killing of the Hon. Maheswaran has continued to grow with the killing of a Deputy Minister, then the Okkampitiya bomb blast which killed 26 precious and innocent lives with several others injured and also the targeting by terrorists vehicles of the Sri Lankan army on the Buttala-Kataragama road. I must remind you that the plague of bomb blasts is fast spreading to all corners of the country. Are we taking our country to a place like Ethiopia where mass killings, eradication of community and ethnic groups are taking place, where people cannot express their opinion and views, and the freedom of speech is curtailed? Special care has to be taken, Hon. Speaker, to ensure security, specially in the city of Colombo, in view of the vulnerability of the VIPs, who are targeted in the hub. The great politicians who are the policy makers of this country have to be safeguarded. The terrorists will make every effort to carry out their foul deeds with a view to destabilizing this country, so long as the conflict remains unconcluded either by an all-out war or through peaceful negotiations. We know that His Excellency the President, Mahinda Rajapaksa is intent on pursuing the two pronged-policy of curbing the terrorists with an offensive war and also exploring the political solutions to the national problem through devolution of power. Let me remind you that this country has to take some form of devolution to come back to the mainstream of politics. The re-introduction of the new Indo-Lanka Accord and reverting to the Thirteenth Amendment which we can all see, is back in process for negotiations. For Prabakaran, it will mean the continuance of sacrifice of valuable lives of young men and women through suicide cadres causing havoc and mayhem in the South with assassinations, claymore mines and bombs which spread carnage and fear in the minds of the common people of this country. People in the North and the East will continue to suffer with terror in their everyday lives with thousands of children being deprived of their education, their day-to-day activities and children are left to starve

1325 1326

without food, without proper wherewithal in their own habitats, with fear of losing their families, of men and women who are never to return. Hon. Speaker, on behalf of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, and for the sake of humanity, I would like to remind that the Almighty Allah, the Creator of all human beings born into this world and according to the traditions of the Holy Prophet, Nabi Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam, we choose the different lines of religion, such as Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and other religious practices in the world. In all religious beliefs, it tantamounts to the worship of one God who preaches not to do evil but to do good, respect the elders and parents, and to do good deeds in our short stay in this world. In the same way, irrespective of the school we attend in our young days, be it Royal College, St. Thomas College, Zahira College, Wesley College, Ananda College or the Central College, we all learn the same curriculum and the same subjects and we sit for one national examination and pass out. It is neither the religion nor the school that finally counts. It is human race, human values and whatever that stand accountable. Hon. Speaker, I stand before you with a very heavy heart with the demise of the late Hon. T. Maheswaran which made me fill the vacant seat in this august Assembly. Let me assure you, Sir, and the House that I will carry on the good deeds and also be a voice to my Tamil brethren of the District of Colombo because we operate in the District of Colombo with no exception on grounds of caste, creed or religion and we work together in the upliftment of community development. As the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress leader of the Colombo District, I wish to convey my deepest sympathies to the late Hon. T. Maheswarans family, especially to his young children, his kith and kin and to all his supporters who are left orphaned without his support. I shall remain faithful in fulfilling the aspirations of the community, especially the Tamils and the minority Muslims, and I wish to say Assalamu Alaikkum to every one of you for listening to my speech. Thank you. [.. 3.25]
