( - ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila - Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs)

Everything is included, but there is a reply with which I am not satisfied. Therefore, I just - [Interruption].

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I have no problem with the two of you. You do your best to answer. But all I want to know, Hon. Deputy Minister, is whether the Answer includes the expenditure that has been incurred by the embassies or not.

( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila)

That is also mentioned under other expenditure

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Other expenditure? Has that been tabled?

( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila)

That has been included in this.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

But, there is some expenditure incurred by the embassies which has not been included there. I am telling you in advance, because I know the Answer that is there. Also, the second thing that I would like to mention is that I would appreciate if the Ministry of Foreign Affairs takes a more proactive stand in the media because a lot of negative things are taking place. Look at the tourism industry. What is happening today? An old lady had met with a tragic incident. Tragic circumstances are talking place. Your Ministry has to protect the image of the country. You spend Rs. 5 billion to tour round the world. At least you have to spend a billion to promote our country.

( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila)

Thank you for the advice.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Please do that. If the Hon. Minister cannot do, you do it.

. , . . , . , , , . , . . , . , . , , , , . , ... , , , '' , , , , , , , , , . . [.. 1.25] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Madam Chairperson, today we are discussing the Votes of the Ministry of Re-settlement and Disaster Relief Services and the Votes of the Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rights. Before I commence my speech in regard to these Votes, I would like to make a few comments in response to what the Minister, the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen had to say this morning. We, the Tamil-speaking people of this country, I would say the Tamil people and the Muslim people, never

opposed this country achieving Independence. We all struggled together to ensure that the country achieved Independence. In fact, when the Ceylon National Congress was formed in the early 1920s, Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam was unanimously elected the first President of the Ceylon National Congress. At that time, the Ceylon National Congress consisted of stalwart Sinhala leaders like the late D.S. Senanayake, the late F.R. Senanayake, Sir D.B. Jayatilaka, Sir James Peiris, E.W. Perera, E.J. Samarawickrema and people of the calibre of the late Dr. T.B. Jayah. They all reposed their faith in Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam and called upon him to lead the independence struggle and he was elected President of the Ceylon National Congress. A few years later, Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam was gravely disappointed with the way in which the Ceylon National Congress was functioning and he withdrew from the Ceylon National Congress. When the Donoughmore Commission came here and wanted to make recommendations in regard to the improvements to be brought about to the Constitution of Sri Lanka and the State structure in Sri Lanka, the Jaffna Youth League demanded Swaraj and told the Donoughmore Commission that they were not interested in improvements giving them a little more autonomy, but they wanted Swaraj and in fact the Jaffna Youth League organized a boycott of elections under the Donoughmore Constitution and the Northern Province was not represented in the State Council for almost two years consequently. That was the passion that the Tamil people in this country had to achieve independence. It was no less than the passion that the Sinhalese had or the Muslims had or anybody else had. But unfortunately, after the country gained Independence, various matters that took place in regard to citizenship, in regard to language, in regard to colonization of the Tamil-speaking areas, in regard to employment, in regard to education and in regard to economic opportunities, compelled the Tamil people to demand that there must be a change in the structure of government in this country that their right to self-determination must be recognized in the areas of our historical habitation and it was the denial of that demand, a refusal to accommodate that demand that has led to the present situation. In fact, I might even go further and say that the right to self-determination is the most valuable human right of our people. We were denied the most valuable human right and all that is taking place in this country today is in consequence of that denial. If that denial had not persisted for such a long period of time there would have been no need for this country to be in its present position. I might now commence to state Madam Chairperson, my views particularly in regard to the human rights situation in this country. I am glad the Hon. Minister in charge of Human Rights, our good Friend the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe is present here. I know he has a difficult job, a particularly difficult job defending this

Government in its record on human rights. I must say, you are doing your best. But, I must say that the human rights situation in this country is not merely horrendous, it is probably, if not, the worst in any part of the world; one of the worst. Abductions, enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings are a continuing phenomenon particularly not only in the Eastern Province but also elsewhere; both in the Northern Province and in other parts of the country. Killings by aerial bombing, multi-barrel rocket launcher fire in the Vanni are also a continuing phenomenon. Displaced Tamil civilians running into several hundreds of thousands suffer much deprivation and are facing immense human suffering. I have with me, Madam, a statement in regard to deaths that have occurred between 14th of November and 29th of November, 2008. Twenty two extra-judicial killings have taken place just within those two weeks. Between the months of June and November 2008, 63 persons have gone missing - 10 in June, 12 in July, 11 in August, 11 in September, 13 in October and 6 in November. That is only in the Batticaloa District, both the killings and the persons who have gone missing. In the Ampara District 20 deaths have occurred, 12 persons have gone missing and in the Trincomalee District five persons have gone missing. This is the position, Madam. Of course, hardly anything comes to light. The media has no access to the Vanni. The media is muzzled. The media is frightened. They are extremely cautious. They have come under attack. They have been subjected to violence and they have even been killed - a number of media persons. Madam, I will substantiate the submissions that I make in regard to some of these matters by referring to some reports that have been filed in regard to these matters by independent organizations. I will start with the report that has been filed by Members of the European Parliament who were here between the 20th and 26th of July, 2008 and this is what they say in their report. Madam, I will place this on record because this is important. It states, I quote: The GoSL has acknowledged these accusations. - meaning the human rights accusations. ..are not prima facie unfounded as, to address them, a National Human Rights Commission was established back in 1997. There are solid fears however, that the NHRC has since lost its independence and impartiality. I think the NHRC has become not merely ineffective, it has become pusillanimous and are worthless. Madam, I further quote: This led to a Commission of Inquiry (Col) being established in 2006 to investigate cases such as the Muttur/Action Contre la Faim massacre, without a report being submitted yet and with many of its Members having since resigned on various grounds. In a recent rather traumatic move, Sri Lanka also failed, in May 2008, to be re-elected as a member of the newly-established UN Human Rights Council. This followed heavy criticism of its human rights record, most notably by three Nobel Peace Prize winners.

One was Bishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, the other was former US President, Jimmy Carter and the third was Mr. Perez Esquivel, the Argentinian Human Rights Defender. These were the three Nobel prize winners who hauled the coals over Sri Lankas Human Rights record. Madam, I further quote: The Independent International Group of Eminent Persons (IIGEP) that was working with the CoI at the invitation of the GoSL, had already decided to terminate its work deploring the absence of political will and interference in the CoI activities by the Attorney Generals office. In its final statement, the IIGEP stressed, in startlingly frank terms, that it was lamentable that the GoSL continued to divert attention from the central truth - that is, the problem of impunity for serious human rights violations and the need for the CoI to get to the bottom of that impunity. The Delegation raised these issues at all appropriate meetings, with both civil society and the authorities, and would have been extremely pleased to report that, upon leaving the country, some of its fears had been quelled. Unfortunately, this would simply not be true with the contrary view being strengthened. More worryingly, the widespread belief that the military and police enjoy impunity also fuels LTTE sympathies. The climate is such that every time there is a Human Rights violation that goes unpunished, a new terrorist may emerge. They went on to say, Madam, that they would focus on two domains where the delegation felt that action is needed urgently. The first was the freedom of the press. Madam, I further quote: The delegation met independently with a number of media associations, and counter-checked the statements made on this occasion during the talks it had in Colombo. The detailed statistics it was presented with were rather grim, for in the last 4 years, 14 media workers (13 Tamil, 1 Sinhalese) have lost their lives without a single case being effectively prosecuted. In addition 15 media workers have been detained under emergency regulations, most of them without charges even being pressed. Then in regard to the second matter that they were concerned and which they wanted to bring into the public domain, that pertains to disappearances, abductions and impunity. The Commission Report states, I quote: According to statistics, since the resumption of conflict, on average, five people every day are either killed or disappear in Sri Lanka. Human Rights Watch has reported that hundreds of enforced disappearances committed since 2006 have already placed Sri Lanka among the countries with the highest number of new cases in the world. These findings were confirmed in its 2008 report, where it was stated that while the LTTE has long been responsible for abductions, most recent reported disappearances implicate Government forces or armed groups acting with Government complicity, who target young Tamil men deemed to be a part of the LTTEs civilian support network'. This can refer to any Tamil who is a supporter of Tamil nationalism or a supporter of Tamil autonomy or a supporter of Tamil self-rule, every single Tamil can be brought within this category. The Delegation held meetings with the UN agencies who confirmed that the personnel operating in the North, (Vavuniya) are increasingly worried by the very strong paramilitary activity and the renewed frequency of abductions. The problem is exacerbated by the

2309 2310

fact that the military structure seems to be fragmented, meaning that it is not always clear whether the personnel on checkpoints belong to the Sri Lankan Army or to a local unaccountable militia. Furthermore, it is alarming that, according to the reports received by the Delegation, in the first semester of 2008, whilst the trend may be downwards in Colombo itself, it is increasing everywhere else in the country. A new expression has now entered everyday language as a synonym of abduction, eerily reminding of the Ford Falcons used for similar purposes during the Argentinean guerra sucia of the seventies - 'white van'. The motives for abductions, allegedly committed mainly by paramilitary factions, are not always purely political - sometimes the aim is just extortion (although even in the cases of ransoms being paid, the victims sometimes re-surface in mass graves.) What seems to be clear, however, is that despite daily incidents, extremely few cases have ever been investigated by the security forces - they are just systematically attributed to 'unknown gunmen'. More generally, the Delegation observed that the October 2007 words of Louise Arbour, then UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, are probably more valid than ever, when she said the 'prevalence of impunity' in Sri Lanka had reached alarming levels. This theme was raised directly with the Presidential Advisor, who insisted that 500 members of the security forces/police had been indicted and 100 prosecuted. These numbers, the GoSL insists, all concern cases having been reported in the past few years. Despite being promised precise information on these alleged 500 recent indictments that would refute fears that most of them relate to cases dating years ago, the EP Delegation regrets having received from the GoSL partial explanations on a handful of recent cases only (8), instead of a comprehensive list that would substantiate its claims. You talk of 500 cases which have been investigated of which 100 persons have been indicted and you are pressed for accurate information to a delegation, that is the European Parliamentary Delegation, that had meetings with you at the highest top levels. They met the Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights also, you were only able to give partial explanations in regard to eight cases. That speaks of your record. Then of course, Madam, I have with me, here, the Report of the Amnesty International in regard to the situation in the Vanni. The Report was released as late as 19th of November, 2008. I would like to read and place on record before this House, some excerpts of that Report. It states, I quote: The humanitarian crisis in the Vanni region of northern Sri Lanka is worsening as the government fails to provide shelter and protect over 300,000 displaced civilians. Tens of thousands of families are now enduring the monsoon season with limited food, shelter, water or sanitation. They fled their homes to escape the fighting between the Sri Lankan military and the opposing Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The Report further says, I quote: In September, the Sri Lankan government ordered the United Nationsand non-governmental aid workers to leave the region. The government then assumed total responsibility for ensuring the needs of the civilian population affected by the hostilities are met. As yet, despite assurances that it has the situation under control, there is evidence to suggest that the Government of Sri Lanka lacks the capacity to provide the required humanitarian relief to displaced people and the civilian population in the Wanni.

In particular, the government agencies and their staff will face difficulties in responding to the needs of the displaced without assistance of the humanitarian agencies. The Indian government has recognized the gravity of the situation by choosing to send 2,000 tonnes of relief material to Sri Lanka. The deliveries are to be managed through the International Committee of the Red Cross.. The Sri Lankan government has refused to allow independent international monitors into the Wanni to oversee and ensure that convoys with food, medical and other essential supplies enter into the area, as well as to oversee the distribution of such supplies. Why are you preventing independent international monitors to go into the Wanni and oversee these matters? Even the Indian Government is distributing its relief through the ICRC. One cannot understand why the Sri Lankan Government wanted the UN agencies and the international NGOs who were working in the Wanni to come out of the Wanni in September. Whom were you harming by that decision? Certainly not the LTTE, the civilians of the Wanni were gravely harmed. Going further, Sir, the Report says, I quote : According to the World Food Programme standard food list, approximately 773 tonnes of food is required per week to feed the 230,000 currently registered under the WFP scheme in the Wanni. The last three convoys only carried 650 tonnes, 750 tonnes and 462 tonnes of food each. So, immediate and long term food security remains an issue. We are shown some lorries going and we are told food is being taken. But when you read the reports of persons who know, you know that there is a question in regard to food. The report goes on and says, I quote : Tens of thousands without shelter. By the time aid agencies had left on 16 September, they had built 2,100 temporary shelters. Government agents for the Kilinochchi andMulaithivu districts have estimated that at least 20,000 families are in need of shelter. The Government of Sri Lankas recent suggestion that cadjanis appropriate shelter does not live up to the minimum standards required for the shelter needs of the displaced. Many families are living in the open under makeshift shelters. The aid agencies by 16th September had built 2,100 shelters and you asked them to leave resulting in people having to live without shelter. What have you done after that? Nothing. I will come to that. It goes on and says, I quote : Recent images from the Wanni show that people have torn up rice sacks to hang over bits of wood in a desperate attempt to make their own shelters. People are tearing rice sacks and hang them over bits of wood as their shelter against inclement weather. It further goes on, I quote : Without proper shelter people are having problems keeping food and other essentials dry and are more vulnerable to snakes.

[ . ]

2008 01 2311 2312

Lack of sanitation, safe drinking water and medicine are yet other problems our people are faced with. It goes on, I quote : Local authorities have estimated 5,230 temporary toilets are needed. "Ninety five per cent of the displaced do not have proper latrine facilities, leave aside having separate toilet and sanitation facilities to meet the practical gender needs of women, according to local NGO workers who were engaged in constructing temporary toilets. Acute shortage of safe drinking water has already precipitated a crisis resulting in the development of various waterborne ailments including diarrhoea. Health officials said the safe water and sanitation in the region has become a major problem causing infections. Amnesty International is calling upon the Sri Lankan Government to give assurances of unimpeded humanitarian access to provide for the immediate material needs of the displaced and assure their safety. The government must ensure the safety and support of humanitarian workers and their families, especially those who remain in the Vanni. Why are you reluctant to permit the humanitarian workers to go and work in the Vanni as freely as they want to and as many of them as are prepared to go when the people are in this most desperate state? At this point, Madam, I must read something that has been said by the Army in regard to shelters. Here are people who do not have proper shelters and they have to tear up sacks and hang them on pieces of wood to have some sort of a shelter. I read the "Daily Mirror", Madam, of the 20th of November, 2008 and this is what Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara, the Military Spokesman had to say. I quote: The Military said it is being compelled to restrict shelter materials into the Vanni as the LTTE could use it for military purposes against the security forces. People are living, Madam, under trees, under bits of sack and the Military Spokesman says that they are restricting the supply of shelter materials, because the LTTE can use it against the military for military purposes. Can anything, Madam, be more scandalous? The article goes on and says further, I quote: Mullativu Government Agent Emilda Sukumar, had earlier told the Daily Mirror civilians in the Vanni were in urgent need of shelter as an increasing number cross into the District each day to flee the intense fighting in Kilinochchi. Ms. Sukumar said that currently, schools in Mullaitivu had been transformed into temporary shelters to accommodate those fleeing the fighting while many displaced people also continue to sleep under trees and on strawboard. According to the Government Agent of Mullaitivu, people are sleeping under trees and shelter is much required. At the same time, the Military Spokesman says, We cannot let shelter go in, because the LTTE can use that against the Government for military purposes. Very well, Madam.

I will now read, Madam, certain paragraphs about the human rights situation particularly in the Eastern Province, from the report that has been issued by the famous reputed Human Rights Organization, Human Rights Watch, on 24th November, 2008, just a week ago. It states, I quote: The Sri Lankan government should take immediate steps to address the deteriorating human rights situation in the countrys Eastern Province, where there has been an increase in killings and abductions in recent weeks, Human Rights Watch said today. The Sri Lankan government says that the liberated East is an example of democracy in action and a model for areas recaptured from the LTTE, said Brad Adams, Asia Director at Human Rights Watch. 'But killings and abductions are rife, and there is total impunity for horrific abuses.' You claim to the world that you have liberated the Eastern Province. Only a couple of days ago, we heard that the secretary and advisor to the Chief Minister of the Eastern Province had been shot dead in Colombo and here is the Human Rights Watch which says that the Human Rights situation in the Eastern Province is horrific and that disappearances and extra-judicial killings are rife. I quote further:

Human Rights Watch investigations have found that there have been at least 30 extra judicial killings in the Eastern Province since September. In one recent case, the bodies of two young Tamil men who had been detained by the police on October 3, 2008, during a security roundup in the town of Batticaloa were found on a beach six days later with their hands and legs tied to a concrete pole, and showing signs of severe torture.

Persons who were held in custody were subsequently found on the beach with their hands and feet tied and with signs of severe torture. It further states, I quote:

The police claimed that the men, Kandasamy Kugathas, 18, and A. Gunaseelan, 26, were released on the morning of October 4. But a family member of one of the men saw them at the police station that evening. A Human Rights Watch investigation found that the two were taken from their cells at about mid night by men in civilian clothing who had demanded the two by name. Since the killings, the police have intimidated witnesses into changing their account of the killings and falsified important evidence.

See what is happening, Madam? Reputed international organizations give you an account of the situation that is prevalent in the Eastern Province in Batticaloa which you claim to have liberated. Are you not ashamed of yourself? The report further states:

In a case investigated by Human Rights Watch in Ampara in October, a young man previously detained, beaten, and released by the group was reported missing soon after his release. As in a number of other cases, family members did not report the case to the authorities out of fear that harm would come to the victim.

People do not even complain. People are afraid to complain. People think that if they complain about a missing family member could disappear thereafter. That is the situation prevalent in the Eastern Province which you claim to have liberated.

2313 2314

The report further states:

Members of civil society organizations and journalists in the East have also been threatened and attacked. On October 29, Sankarapillai Shantha Kumar, a member of the NGO Consortium in Akkaraipattu, was abducted around mid night from his home. Although a complaint was filed, there has been no credible investigation and he is still missing.

The report goes on, Madam Presiding Member,

Many in the East believe that the government has given its blessing for these abuses, said Adams. 'It is important for the government to take action against perpetrators to demonstrate that this is not the case.'

You will not take action. One can be quite certain about it. You allow this impunity to prevail and continue because you cannot take action against the persons who are committing these crimes. They are working hand in glove with you. They are the persons who have joined with you in your claim that you have liberated the East. Therefore, you cannot take action against them. They are your partners. You are in alliance with them. But, do remember that your talking of liberation is not something which the world will any longer believe. Today, I think you have come to a stage when you do not care two hoots, we have to stand here and talk. You do not even listen or you would listen and would not take it to heart. You do not pay any attention to it; you take no action whatever on the basis of reports of famous independent international human rights organizations, which you very heavily depend upon when you need them against the LTTE. You do not actually bother about what we say in Parliament. You just carry on. You have come to a stage when your position is, you can say what you like, but we will do what we like.

Before I get on to anything else, Madam, I must read to you something that has been recited in poetic verse about the position prevalent in the Eastern Province and the liberation of the Eastern Province - the statement made by the Asian Human Rights Commission. I think they have got so tired of complaining with no action being taken on their complaints that, I think, somebody in that organization decided to write a verse about the situation prevalent in Sri Lanka. I hope, my good Friend, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, would listen to this. It is very interesting. It states, I quote: In the No Fact Zone of Sri Lanka flowers are blooming, the country is flowing with milk and honey and the old paradise still remains the old paradise. Internally displaced people are all smiling and enjoying their lives as never before; ....... That is what you believe. .under the trees, in the flood, bitten by snakes, they are living as if they were in the Garden of Eden before the fall. They have nothing but gratitude to the government for the liberation they have achieved.

They are living in the water; they are living under trees; they are starving; they are bitten by snakes, but they have gratitude towards the Government because you have "liberated" them. That is what you want the world to believe. I will not read the whole thing because it is too long, but I think I must put on record another paragraph. I quote: In the No Fact Zone the east is also now an extension of that paradise where people happily submit themselves to extortion and armed gangs of angels protect their security. Even the doctors can leave the place when they get threatening letters to vacate the area because the people no longer fall sick. A poor doctor was killed recently. It further states, I quote: Complaints of electoral violence are of no consequence at all, for the people can achieve their happiness without being burdened with such things as elections. What does the murder of a few people matter when the majority lives in this wonderful state of bliss, security, peace, prosperity and happiness?" This is what you believe. So, you see the world, having complained about your human rights abuses and finding that you are not showing any concern whatever, not taking any action whatever on the complaints they make, has now come to a stage when, rather than complaining to you, they are stating in poetic verse the actual situation in Sri Lanka and how you have liberated these people. Sir, when I spoke on the Votes of the President sometime ago, I placed on record in this House a list of persons who have been killed and who have been injured and the houses and the temples damaged - even the Kilinochchi Hospital was damaged - by aerial bombardment and multi-barrel rocket launch fire after the Presidents Adviser, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, had gone and given an assurance to the Indian Prime Minister and the Indian Government that civilians would not be harmed in the course of the military operations. I want to place before the House, Madam, a report that appeared in the Thinakkural newspaper of 30th November, yesterday. It states in Tamil, I quote : - , , , 18 . Three persons were killed including two children and one adult and 18 persons including eight females and eight children were injured in the course of aerial bombardment. It goes on to state, I quote: , 1.35 .

[ . ]

2008 01 2315 2316

At 1.35 in the morning, this aerial bombardment took place on a refugee camp in a place called Kallaru at Nanaddankudiyiruppu where a large number of people had taken refuge. Madam, it further states, I quote: . While those people were in deep slumber, in deep sleep, the planes had come and bombed a refugee camp where people were resting at 1.35 in the morning. The "Virakesari" newspaper has published some pictures of the injured people on the same day. So, this is what you are doing. You are liberating people; you are in the process of liberating the Wanni. Bombing refugee camps in the Wanni at 1.30 in the morning and killing infants and adults and injuring a large number of children and women, you are liberating the people of the Vanni. This is what you want us to believe. The Hon. Basil Rajapaksa has gone to India and he has done his bit and come back, but things are going on in the Vanni as before. There is aerial bombing; there is multi-barrel rocket launch fire; people are being killed; people are being injured, all these things are happening and you are in the process of liberating the people. You do not care because your liberation operation must continue. Madam, I would like to raise with my Friend, the Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights, certain matters pertaining to the Commission of Inquiry that is presently functioning. Two persons have resigned from the Commission of Inquiry. One of them was a very respected Tamil individual, a civil servant, who, I think, was compelled to resign, was asked to tender his resignation. The other gentleman, I believe, is also a person from the minority communities. The International Independent Group of Eminent Persons have withdrawn. They made a statement in regard to this matter, which I shall read out to the House as I go on. This Commission of Inquiry, Madam, with the International Independent Group of Eminent Persons was the Governments showpiece; it was the Governments alternative to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, which had become ineffective, which had become spineless, pusillanimous, worthless people sitting on it, not investigating seriously and purposefully any one case of human rights violation in this country. In fact, they have lost their status in the international body of human rights commissions; they are no longer a member. They are made an observer now on account of their bad track record and the persons who were primarily responsible for this were the three Nobel laureates who came out condemning the human rights situation in Sri Lanka. This was your alternative - the Commission of Inquiry and the International Independent Group of Eminent Persons - to the demand of the High Commissioner for Human Rights of the UN that there must be a UN human rights mechanism in Sri Lanka, that an office or some

monitoring mechanism be set up to monitor the human rights situation in Sri Lanka. She, Madam Louise Arbour, made the case very strongly that the culture of impunity, which had become so prevalent in Sri Lanka, which had become so much part and parcel of the system in Sri Lanka, could not be eradicated unless there was an independent human rights mechanism. But, you would not agree to that. You rejected their efforts, saying that you are a sovereign nation. A sovereign nation does not mean that you can violate human rights, get away with it and not be answerable. If Sri Lanka does not conform to international norms and standards in regard to human rights, it cannot sustain its sovereignty. That is quite clear. Because one of the components of sovereignty is fundamental rights, which include human rights. In fact, I can remember, Madam, when Justice Bhagwati, the Chairman of the International Independent Group of Eminent Persons, came to Sri Lanka and became the Chairman of the IIGEP, he said that this mechanism - the Commission of Inquiry and the IIGEP - cannot be a substitute for a robust mechanism in Sri Lanka to monitor human rights. Now, what is happening to the Commission of Inquiry? The IIGEP expressed the view that the Attorney-General should not play a role in the affairs of the Commission. The Attorney-General goes with you to Geneva to defend your human rights record. The Attorney-General advises the army, the police and all persons concerned in regard to human rights violations and he also plays that role. The IIGEP clearly expressed the view that there was a conflict of interest and therefore, the Attorney-General should not play a role before the Commission of Inquiry and that evidence before the Commission of Inquiry should be lead by independent persons. In fact, the IIGEP even took the pains to consult some local independent jurists in regard to the matter and they gave a written opinion to the Commission of Inquiry, which I have quoted in Parliament before. Those jurists stated that there was clearly a case of conflict of interest and the Attorney-General should not play a role in matters before the Commission of Inquiry. But, what happened? The President gave a directive to the Commission of Inquiry that there was nothing wrong in the Attorney-General playing a role. In fact, the President gave his directive by a letter dated 05th November, 2007. I have got the whole directive here with me. I will not take the time of the House reading that. The President told the Commission of Inquiry that the Attorney-General must play a role and that even if the Attorney-General has played a role in regard to some of the matters before the Commission whatever role the Attorney-General played in regard to that matter should not be investigated by the Commission. Then, you passed the law in Parliament, in fact most of us did not know what you were up to, institutionalizing the role of the Attorney-General and giving the Attorney-General a formal status before every Commission of Inquiry, that the Commission of Inquiry had to entertain the Attorney-General and listen to him.

2317 2318

You summoned an International Independent Group of Eminent Persons to this country to ensure that your Commission of Inquiry functioned in terms of international norms and standards. And this Group of Eminent persons from all parts of the world expressed the opinion that international norms and standards have not been observed. If your Government is a responsible Government; a Government that wants to keep its obligations; a Government that is committed to Human Rights when you invite an International Independent Group of Eminent Persons to give you a report on whether international norms and standards are being observed and if they say that there is a default in regard to any particular area, you must accept their report. Otherwise, why call them here. You did not want to accept their report and you go and give a direction to the Commission by a letter and subsequently you passed a Bill in Parliament directly contradicting the position taken up by the IIGEP in regard to the role of the Attorney-General. The IIGEP, Madam, made a statement to the media, I do not want to go into all that but, the IIGEP very clearly stated that the Sri Lankan Government did not have the political or institutional will to determine the truth in regard to the human rights situation prevalent in Sri Lanka in keeping with international norms and standards. Then there was this question of video-conferencing; evidence had been recorded, but regarding the two cases that were before the Commission at that point of time - the five students being killed in Trincomalee and the 17 aid-workers being killed in Mutur, evidence had been recorded through video- conferencing because many witnesses had left the country through fear. They were intimidated. Suddenly it stopped because, two gentlemen who were appearing for the possible suspects and the possible accused before the Commission wrote a letter to the President raising some objections in regard to evidence being recorded by video-conferencing and the Presidential Secretariat wrote to the Commission of Inquiry raising various queries in regard to the recording of evidence by video- conferencing and virtually telling the Commission that the recording of evidence by video-conferencing cannot take place and that has now come to an end. But, the Commission of Inquiry is continuing to record evidence and the Commission of Inquiry which initially said that they would submit their report in regard to those two matters; the five students being killed in Trincomalee and the 17 aid-workers being killed in Mutur by September 2008, has still not completed their work and they are still recording evidence. What has happened to the Assistance and Protection to Victims of Crime and Witnesses Bill that you brought to Parliament as an urgent Bill? In fact you referred the matter to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court delivered judgment in regard to that matter and wanted certain amendments made and there was the Second

Reading of the Bill in this House, the Debate took place but suddenly the Bill has gone into limbo, why? Will the Minister in the course of his reply kindly tell this House, what has happened to the Assistance and Protection to Victims of Crime and Witnesses Bill which the Government introduced in this House with much fanfare claiming that they were interested in protecting the witnesses who could have testified before the Commission of Inquiry in these two deadly dastardly crimes; the killing of five students in Trincomalee and 17 aid workers killed in Mutur. I think the Minister owes it to Parliament and to this country to speak the truth in regard to that matter and say why that Bill has gone into limbo. Why that Bill has not been debated and enacted in this House. In fact, I might read out to you some of the reports in regard to this matter - video-conferencing - because the President of the Commission of Inquiry said, I quote: The CoI cannot be funded by aid. I will read the Daily Mirror of 18th June, 2008, which states, I quote: Although one of the main reasons for the temporary suspension of video conferencing is the lack of funds, we cannot accept aid from foreign countries... I think America, Canada and the EU were prepared to fund the video conferencing at that point of time. It further states, I quote: He added: one of the reasons for temporary suspension is the lack of funds. Video conferencing at this end was funded by the presidential secretariat; it is the lack of funds at the witnesses end that has caused the suspension. This was earlier funded by the IIGEP. So, you see, Madam Chairperson, they could not find funding at the other end. But the American Government, the Canadian Government and the European Union were prepared to provide the funding for the video conferencing at the other end. But these two gentlemen whom I referred to earlier who were appearing for these accused - suspects or accused ; not accused still but suspects - sent a letter to the President complaining about this video conferencing and the Presidential Secretariat wrote to the Commission of Inquiry reprimanding the Commission of Inquiry for trying to record evidence through video conferencing and thereafter recording of evidence through video conferencing has been terminated. It is not happening. But though that is not happening and though the President of the Commission of Inquiry has stated that they are hoping to submit their report by September on the killing of five youth in Trincomalee and 17 aid workers of the French NGO in Mutur in a statement he made to the Daily Mirror on 29th July, 2008 and he confirmed that in a further statement he made

[ . ]

2008 01 2319 2320

to Daily Mirror on 28th August 2008 saying that the Commission expects to submit an Interim Report of the two massacres to the President by October with our recommendations, those reports have not yet been submitted. But, the Commission is now recording evidence of persons who are trying to exculpate the armed forces. I have with me, Madam, a report of theDaily Mirror of 25th November, where a high army official has gone and testified before the Commission of Inquiry that the army were not there at the time that the massacre occurred. This news item appears in the Daily Mirrorof 25th, November. So, you keep the Attorney-General, a person whose hands are tainted to lead evidence on behalf of the victims before the Commission of Inquiry and the IIGEP is sent out. You prevent video- conferencing and avoid the recording of evidence. The President intervenes at the request of two gentlemen who are appearing on behalf of possible suspects and the Commission of Inquiry which says, Our report will be coming in September, in October, does not submit their report and now we have the evidence of people in November on behalf of the armed forces, trying to exculpate the armed forces. What are you up to? Whom are you hoodwinking? Do you think that you are cheating the world? Are you not cheating yourselves? Are you not ashamed that you are engaged in such diabolical, despicable conduct trying to portray that this Commission of Inquiry will do everything and still preventing a proper investigation? I wrote to the President, Madam, on the 10th of August, 2006 in regard to this particular massacre. Madam, I will not take the time of the House to read this letter. I will table* this letter. I want to kindly request you to include this letter in Hansard in which I referred to this matter. I was in touch with the Head of the Mission, the Head of the Action Contre la Faim in Trincomalee everyday and I knew exactly what was happening. I specifically told the President, I quote the letter which states: These 17 Tamil speaking persons worked with an International Non-Governmental Organization Action Contre la Faim which functioned in the (Trincomalee) District. The Organization was in touch with them by radio contact regularly on Tuesday the 1st, Wednesday the 2nd, Thursday the 3rd and until 7.00 a.m. on Friday the 4th. After that the youth could not be contacted. They had been shot and killed. The Postmortem Reports reveal that all 17 persons were killed consequent to gun shot injuries. I would request that this letter be included in Hansard after my speech.

The Head of the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission in Trincomalee, at that point of time, was a person by the name of General Henricsson. He gave an interview shortly after the massacre and what did he say? He says, I quote: " 'I have experienced this in the Balkans before. When youre not let in, its a sign that theres something they want to hide,' retired Maj. Gen. Ulf (Henricsson), who heads the unarmed Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) told Reuters." He wanted to go there and see for himself what had happened. But, the armed forces prevented him and said that he could not go. He goes on to state further, I quote: "You have a lot of time to clear it up. If there was clear evidence for the LTTE to have done it, why not let us in to see it? I think the government makes the situation worse for themselves, because the truth will come out. They are denying us access to the whole area, so we cannot monitor. There were journalist trips arranged to Mutur last Saturday and Sunday. That was possible, but we had no access. Why? For security reasons? Of course not. There are other reasons. So, this is what is happening, Madam, in regard to this Commission of Inquiry. I would not take much of your time. I have got a little time more. They are in fact, bungling up the inquiry. An officer by the name of S.P. Mark was in charge of this investigation. He was doing a splendid job but you suddenly sent him overseas. Then what happens. The bullets recovered from the bodies of the victims were taken by the police from the then JMO who conducted the postmortem thereby preventing a proper chain of custody in regard to those bullets. So, you are subverting the investigation down the line at every point and at every turn. But, you are trying to pretend to the world that you are conducting an investigation in an independent way and this is your showpiece to the whole world. You want GSP Plus; that will ensure billions of dollars, hundreds of thousands of jobs in the textile sector. If you do not get GSP Plus you will lose 100,000 jobs. There are not any Tamil children or Muslims children. They are all Sinhala children. But, this does not matter. They are our children. We are interested in them. You will lose 100,000 jobs if you do not get GSP Plus. The European Union only wants to do an investigation. Why are you oppose to it? You have acceded to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The European Union only wants to come here and do an investigation and ascertain whether you have in fact, conformed to the Covenant; whether you have implemented the Covenant. You do not want the investigation. You do not want them to come in. You know that if they come in you would open a can of worms, you have got far too many skeletons in your cupboard. You cannot expose them. Therefore, you do not want them to come in and you think that by preventing these people coming here, by doing this type of thing, you can hide the truth for ever. Please, do not think that you can sweep under the carpet the massacre of the 17 aid workers in Mutur. Dr. Bernard Kouchner, the present Foreign Minister of

France was a member of the International Independent Group of Eminent Persons. He knows exactly what happened. I have not the slightest doubt that he is following the case. Dr. Bernard Kouchner in fact worked for Segolene Royal who was the opponent of Sarkozy, the present President of France at the Presidential Election in France. When Sarkozy telephoned Dr. Bernard Kouchner and wanted him to become the Foreign Minister, Bernard Kouchner responded by saying, Mr. President, I worked against you. Why do you want me as Foreign Minister? He said, I want you because I want a good man on this job. So, please do not think that you can sweep the inquiry pertaining to the massacre of the 17 aid workers in Mutur under the carpet. That will not happen. There will be an international investigation into this matter. The truth will be ascertained and if you sweep things under the carpet I can assure you that there will be serious consequences. Please, remember that. Now, Madam, I get letters from my good Friend in Sinhala. I am a Tamil-speaking person. I talk Sinhala. But, I do not read Sinhala or write Sinhala. That I did not learn because of the Sinhala Only Act. Otherwise I would have learnt that also. But, the Secretary to the Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rights writes to me only in Sinhala. I have got several letters from him here. Why do you do this? The Secretary to the Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rights, you say that you are implementing the language provisions. You expect us to cooperate with you and bring about peace in this country. But, you write to me only in Sinhala. Hon. Minister, you must be glad that I have not thrown this into the wastepaper basket. I kept them only for the reason that I wanted to table this in Parliament. But, I would not table them, I will show them to you. And I believe you are going to appoint two committees. According to some friends of mine, one to investigate the question of abductions and disappearances and one in regard to child conscription. I do not know whether you have appointed those committees and before I conclude, Madam, I want to say this to my good Friend, Risath Badhiutheen, Minister of Resettlement and Disaster Relief Services who is present here. He spoke this morning and told us about all that he is doing. I wish you well. Help the people in the North and the East as much as you can. The Sinhalese, the Muslims and the Tamils, help them as much as you can. ; . . , . . . . . ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have only two minutes more.

Madam, I am winding up. I placed in the House the names of 261 Tamil persons who were killed during the military activities in Mutur. About 300 persons were killed but with great difficulty I was able to track down the names of 261 people. You are talking of compensation being paid to various people. Every single Sinhalese person killed in Trincomalee has been compensated, every single Muslim person killed in Trincomlee has been compensated. Why have these 261 Tamil persons from Trincomalee and Batticaloa not been compensated? Why have you not inquired into the matter? I would earnestly request you to kindly inquire into the matter and do justice and do the correct thing. And in regard to the persons who have not yet been resettled in the so-called high security zone, that is our ancestral property, the property in which we have lived for generations and centuries. That is not state property. That is property that belongs to our families and our people who have been living there for generations and centuries. You cannot keep us out of that land. To live in that land is our birth right. There may be an emergency today; there may be a war today. But it must come to an end at some point of time. It cannot go on indefinitely. We must go back to our land. Please remember that and please take action in regard to that matter too. I thank you, Madam.

011-2559787 Trincomalee. PARLIAMENT 2D Summit Flats, Keppetipola Road, Colombo - 05, 10th August, 2006. His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapakse, President, Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, Presidential Secretariat, Colombo - 01. Dear Mr. President, The following seventeen Tamil speaking persons - 16 Tamils and one Muslim13 Males and 4 females, have been shot and killed by the Armed forces at Muthur on Friday August 4th. 16 of them are youth, one is an elderly person. The L. T. T. E withdrew from the Muthur area on the midnight of Thursday August 3rd. The Armed Forces entered the Muthur area on Friday the 4th morning. The massacre took place at the hands of the Armed Forces on the morning of Friday the 4th. These 17 Tamil speaking persons worked with an International Non Governmental Organisation Action Contre la Faim which functioned in the Trincomalee District. The Organisation was in touch with them by Radio contact regularly on Tuesday the 1st, Wednesday the 2nd, Thursday the 3rd and until 7 A. M. on Friday the 4th. After that the youth could not be contacted. They had been shot and killed. The Post Mortem Reports reveal that all 17 persons were killed consequent to gun shot injuries.

These persons normally returned to Trincomalee every evening from Muthur. They could not do so on this visit, in view of the heavy artillery shelling and the confrontation between the Armed Forces and the L. T. T. E. The particulars of the persons are as follows :- S.

These persons were all unarmed Tamil civilians engaged in legitimate duties. You will not deny that this is yet another instance of named state terrorism, as in the case of murder of 5 Tamil students at Trincomalee in January. These persons hail from families in Trincomalee. You cannot be unaware that Tamil speaking youth are discriminated against in the matter of employment in the public services. Though the Tamil speaking people are around 25% of the population, and adequately qualified, they do not have even 10% employment in public services. Non governmental organizations working in the North East provide them with some measure of employment and succour. You are aware that there are forces in this country who are against international non governmental organizations working in the North East. Was this an attack both against the Tamil speaking youth and also the non governmental organizations. Was this meant to prevent the Tamil people from receiving the assistance of non-governmental organizations. These are matters of grave concern. Though bullets were recovered from the bodies of the students killed in January, and though proper investigations could have resulted in the recovery of the guns from which those bullets were fired and thence to the identity of the assailant the investigations have been deliberately botched so as to cover up the crime, though both you and the Inspector General of Police assured me that the investigations will be properly carried out and the assailants brought to justice. When reputed journalist D. Sivaram was murdered, I urged that there should be impartial international involvement in the investigation. That was not accepted. There is no doubt that the present proceedings will end in a fiasco, primarly due to lack of proper investigations. We have to urge that there by competent impartial international participation in the investigations pertaining to this heinous crime relating to seventeen Tamil speaking persons. I consider it my duty to bring this recent massacre to your notice, as we fear that the killing of Tamil speaking people particularly Tamil civilians will continue. We urge you to restrain the armed forces from killing innocent Tamil civilians, and ensure that proper action is taken against those responsible for this crime. Your sincerely, Sgd. R. Sampanthan Member of Parliament Trincomalee District Parliamentary Group Leader Illankai Tamil Arasu Katchi

Only a few can acquire that advanced knowledge. But, animals have that. Hon. Minister, you know that. I have mentioned that at the Forty-two Member Country

Workshop. In Yala, the animals left the area before the tsunami. Even in the Galle Park, a tamed deer saw the sea and started to run. The gardener started chasing behind him and he survived. After that I asked, Why do you ladies and gentlemen not make use of the sixth sense of animals? There is a saying, Rats desert a sinking ship. I had some details on the sixth sense with me. Then, they started to discuss this subject with me. You do not have that knowledge and I do not have that knowledge. The advanced technological instruments also cannot predict it. Why do we not make use of the sixth sense of animals? The cat has that; the dog has that. I have some documents collected from websites. One is, Sixth sense in the animal kingdom; PET PASSION- one Nilanjanaa has written an article on Sri Lanka. Then, there is another article, Seismic Sentries Disaster Prediction at Ark Animals and Animal instincts can save by Prerna Singh Bindra in New Delhi. Likewise, there are lot of articles. Even in China, they are studying the behaviour of animals to know about earthquakes. When dogs and other animals are behaving in a peculiar way, they take precautions. Then there is another article, A Sense of Doom: Animal Instinct for Disaster, Scientists Investigate Wildlifes possible warning systems written by Don Oldenburg, Washington Post Staff Writer. Hon. Minister, we spend billions for disaster management, refugee camps and people. What you should do is to make use of animals' sixth sense. Even in Yala, birds have behaved in a peculiar way before the tsunami. Even the deer watching the sea started to run. The guides had told the people, Do not be near the sea, let us go and those who went further survived, others died. So likewise it is very important I think, Hon. Minister, that we learn from the animals' sixth sense and take precautions. , . early warning . ? film . .

Take the Victoria, Randenigala and Kotmale Reservoirs. If something unforeseen happens to these reservoirs - we pray that nothing of that sort should take place. But, in such an event, do you have a plan to evacuate people living in those areas, before a catastrophe takes place? Do you have early emergency action plans? No. Hon. Minister, what you should do is, prepare a long term vision plan; create awareness about earthquakes and breaches of dams because disasters of this nature are possible. We cannot predict the future. You have got experts and professionals. I am glad that you have a good Secretary, who is an able man. You have a very good team of officers and experts, I know. In 2003, when the disaster due to heavy rain took place in Ratnapura, Kalutara and Matara, you were with us. I was directly involved in that with some of the officers. We planned it out. After 2003, how many times did Ratnapura experience floods? How many billions of rupees have you paid as compensation? I ask you, Hon. Minister, what action have you taken? I have the concept paper prepared by the irrigation officers at that time for protection of Ratnapura from floods in the Kalu Ganga Basin. What action have you taken? We pay money in billions for the affected masses resulting in government revenue being drained. That is why I am asking you this. What precautions have you taken with regard to the protection of floods, I ask you? My engineers at that time drew up a master plan for the protection of the Colombo Municipal area from floods. We planned a drainage system and so on. But, you have not implemented or even considered it at all. I am talking of prevention. What we are doing is all nonsense and rubbish. We talk of facts and figures. This is the countrys saddest situation. So, you have to take into consideration all this and the other disasters that we may face in future. Hon. Minister due to the floods in Ratnapura in 2003, the ADRC Japanese project proposal was prepared. What action have you taken to implement that, I ask you and your officers? I am not criticizing the Minister. The officers are the ones who guide the Minister. You are the professionals. You cannot just escape from that. In India,

when the terrorist attacked the Taj Hotel and other places, the Indian Home Minister and the officers resigned. That kind of a policy should be there in this country because officers are also responsible. They just cannot put the blame on the Minister and stay away.

When we were in government, I prepared the report, "Colombo Municipal Council Drainage Division : Flooding locations within the City of Colombo and Proposed Improvements", - Disaster Management. But, within two years, you know, our government was dissolved. If we had another two years, you would not have gone to that side. You were our Chief Government Whip. You were aspiring for the position of Prime Minister, I know. Hon. Minister, what happened? If we had another two years, we would have done marvellous things. With the dawn of peace, we went into the interior of Jaffna, Mannar and Batticoloa. We drew up plans for disaster flood protection and also new irrigation schemes for the first time after 106 years of irrigation history. So, it is very important. Your job is not to spend money only to settle down victims of disasters. Take precautionary measures. Work out a plan with other ministries. It is a very sad situation. How many subject ministers are there? About 106 Ministers. They all are puppets. They do not know their subjects. The ministers have become peons in this country. That is the saddest situation. There are no targets; there are no plan. These are facts which I am telling you.

Take the Randenigala area. I pointed out to the Minister of Environment about the earthslip that took place in Randenigala. I went there recently. No action has been taken. The soil that had come down with the landslide is still there. We are only talking. Your Department has got a fabulous research section. They say 85 percent of earth slips take place due to human errors. What action have you taken regarding this in consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture, the Forest Department and the Mahaweli Authority? To get a quotation is important. This is what you lack. This is what I am talking about. We, the UNP are not going to create hundreds of ministries. We will create only a few ministries and within that we will create the framework and structure of the organization to work out and take necessary precautions. That is our policy. Here, you are trying to satisfy your ministers.

I am going to bring in an Adjournment Motion. Hon. Members of Parliament should know that Rs. 6,000 billion has been set apart. For what? For Mihin Air. Rupees 3,000 million of EPF/Trust Funds have been spent on a certain Minister who had gone for a workshop in Seoul, Korea. This is corruption and wastage. An airbus was kept waiting for this Minister like a car parked until he finished his assignment. I am bringing a proposal that Rs. 6,000 million meant for Mihin Air should be transferred to the Disaster Relief Fund to help those who are affected in the tea, rubber and coconunt industries or otherwise we will go to courts.

2008 01 2375 2376

We will challenge you. These are all corruption. This is what has happened. That is why I am saying this. You are our Colleague though you are on that side. This country is more important for us than politics; whether it is green or yellow is not what matters. Hon. Minister, in your Ministry you have talented officers. When you draw up a plan to put up a house, the Local Government has to approve it. , . , . , , . ? . . , . . . . , . . . . , . . , . , , ? . . . . 6,000 trust fund . . . .

( - , ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe - Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights) Mr. Deputy Chairman, I want to thank all those Members of Parliament and Ministers who participated in the Discussion throughout the day on the Votes of our two Ministries. I will not be talking about the performance of my Ministry throughout the year because all that is included in the Performance Report printed in all three languages and distributed to all of the Members of this House. So, I do not want to waste time reiterating what is already there in print and I urge all of you, Members, to read this Performance Report and familiarize yourselves with all the work our Ministry has done throughout the year. Instead, Sir, I will take my time to reply to some of the observations made by several speakers who participated

in the Discussion today. Foremost of the Members who participated is of course, my good Friend, the Hon. Sampanthan whom I have known for a very, very long time and whom I have a lot of regard for as a very experienced and a committed politician. The Hon. Sampanthan, during the course of his contribution which lasted for just over an hour, put on record certain grievances, accusations and read out various documents that he had brought with him. In turn, I listened to him very patiently, I did not disturb him during his intervention, and noted down some of the most salient and important points that he had raised during his one-hour speech. One of the issues that the Hon. Sampanthan raised, Sir, was in respect of the Commission of Inquiry that His Excellency the President put in place just over two years ago to look into certain selected cases of disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Along with the setting up of the Commission of Inquiry, the Government decided to invite what we termed as the "International Independent Group of Eminent Persons" sourced from both bilateral as well as multilateral partners of Sri Lanka who had displayed an interest in some of the incidents which has been selected for further investigations under the Terms of Reference of the Commission of Inquiry. The Hon. Sampanthan read out the last report of the IIGEP stating that the IIGEP had in the course of that statement deplored the absence of political will of the Government and accused the Government of not being committed. Now, Sir, there were quite a number of statements that the IIGEP made during the course of its one-year of working here observing the conduct of the Commission of Inquiry that His Excellency the President has set up and this was the final statement and as soon as that statement was put out, we, naturally as a Government, wanted a clarification on whether this had been issued officially or not. Because, as I remember, it was issued from Colombo by a group of assistants that the IIGEP themselves had nominated to assist them in the discharge of their mandate and we wanted a clarification. We asked the Chairman of the IIGEP, former Chief Justice of India, the Hon. P.N. Bhagwati whether this statement had the sanction of him as the Chairman of the IIGEP and Justice Bhagwati wrote to us on the 26th of April, 2008. In fact, Hon. Sampanthan, this letter is addressed to His Excellency the President. I will table* this letter, Sir, so that the Hon. Sampanthan can also have a look at it and I would just like to quote the relevant paragraph where he addresses this issue of lack of political will that the IIGEP had referred to.

It states, I quote :

I would like to point out to Your Excellency that if you would kindly look at the Public Statement at the relevant part, you will find that IIGEP has not accused the Government of Sri Lanka of any lack of political will insofar as the functioning of C.O.I. is concerned.

* . . Placed in the Library. 8 - PL 003603 - (2009/01)

2389 2390

[ ]

And he goes on to say, I quote : IIGEP has never alleged that there was absence of political will on the part of the Government of Sri Lanka.

.

( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

If they have a mandate why did they leave?

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)

That, you have to ask them. Hon. Sampanthan, I am just giving you further information in response to a statement quoted. You may not have been aware of this letter. That is why I took the trouble of getting down this letter. You quoted their statement but subsequent to that statement, the Chairman of the IIGEP, Justice Bhagwati himself wrote to His Excellency the President stating that they had never said that. I will share this letter with you because sometimes, Hon. Sampanthan, you are approached by various people and you are given information and sometimes they fall short of the information that they do not like to put before people such as you, so that you have an objective view point. I am not for a moment saying that you were subjective. I think the problem was that you did not have this letter and therefore you read out that particular statement. Sir, after this statement was made by Justice Bhagwati the whole fuss about this lack of political will and lack of commitment stopped there. The IIGEP never said anything thereafter and let it rest there because I think Justice Bhagwati has put the record straight. Sir, the Hon. Sampanthan also quoted extensively from the report of the EU delegation. I do not know whether the Hon. Sampanthan is aware that the EU delegation which came to Sri Lanka also visited various other countries in South Asia and the person who led this particular - ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

You read out a letter of Justice Bhagwati - ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)

I have limited time but because you are my Friend, I will give you some time. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

I will just finish. Now what about the chief law officer of the country, the Attorney - General who had a very vituperative exchange of letters with the IIGEP? What

does that indicate? That was very unbecoming of the Attorney - General to have got involved with an international commission in this picture.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)

Hon. Rauff Hakeem, the Attorney-Generals Department in this country has always been an independent institution, as you know, and it has been a very highly respected institution - [Interruption.] You might say that. But, this is our point of view. We do not let that side down. The IIGEP also made some very scathing attacks on the AG, on the AGs Department without basing those accusations on proper facts and it was incumbent on the AG to reply. He replied and that is that. Whether the AG is right or whether the IIGEP is right, it is up to the people who read these exchanges to decide. - [Interruption.] No. Sir, please, I cannot give way, because I have only another 20 minutes and there are a number of allegations - . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

But, I want to ask you a question- [Interruption.] You say that the AG is a neutral person. He went to Geneva to defend the human rights record of your Government, defending the army and the police in regard to their misdeeds. And, now he is going before the Commission and trying to lead on behalf of the victims. Was the AG acting as a neutral person?

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)

Of course, the AG has to do that, because he is always in the service of the Government and as much as he has defended the Government, when it was necessary to do so, he has also at the same time used his office and his officials to prosecute Government officials. There are number of such instances that we can put on record, Sir. So, this is something - [Interruption.] Hon. Rauff Hakeem, I know that the truth hurts. So, please let me respond to the Hon. Sampanthan who made some very valid observations and I would like to share with him that extra information which he obviously did not have when he made those statements. Sir, I was referring to some sections from the EU statement that the Hon. Sampanthan was reading out from. I do not know whether the Hon. R. Sampanthan is aware that the EU delegation which came to Sri Lanka was led by a gentleman, actually a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) called Robert Evans. Robert Evans is a very well known character. Robert Evans after leaving Colombo on the 25th of July, attended the British Tamil Forum, which everyone knows as a front organization of the proscribed LTTE which was held in Harrow, South London on the 25th of August which is a

2008 01 2391 2392

part of his own EU Parliamentary Constituency. Now, this gentleman is obviously facing an election and he wants to make sure that the votes are got, so that he can be re-elected to the European Parliament - [Interruption.] No. Please, do not try to defend Robert Evans, because you do not know him; I do not know him. I am reading from what Mr. Ravinatha Aryasinha, our Ambassador in Brussels has sent through Brussels to the EU in response to this very subjective report that Robert Evans has put forward as part of his delegation report. - [Interruption.] I can quote the things that Niranjan Devadithya has said as part of that report. He has not agreed, by the way. Now, Sir, there is another quote here that Mr. Ravinatha Aryasinha, Ambassador of Sri Lanka to Brussels has very pertinently put down in his statement at the discussion on Sri Lanka at the Session of the South Asia Delegation of the European Parliament on 7th October, 2008. He says, I quote: These however do not correspond with your statement at the pro-LTTE rally in Harrow, where you gallantly explained amidst cheers it seems, that the EU delegation did not visit the East . I quote here what Robert Evans says: ."I refused to give only a photo opportunity of shaking hands with Pillayan, the Chief Minister of the Eastern Province". Sir, this is something that he says when he addresses that pro-LTTE forum which is called, The British Tamil Forum in Harrow, London which is a part of his constituency.So, obviously you can see the subjectivity of this man. He comes to Sri Lanka, heads this delegation, then he goes and presents a report and then at the same time goes and gives a speech at this pro-LTTE rally and says that he did not go to the East because he did not want to shake hands with the Chief Minister. Now, is that subjective or not? What is more interesting, Sir, is that he in his report says that the reason why he could not go to the East was because we did not give him a plane to go to the East and that we blocked him at Ratmalana. He made a huge hue and cry to say that he was prevented from going and -

( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake)

They hide the reality.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)

These are the types of people they send here and they ask us to give them facilitation. When we give them facilitation, they go back and write these subjective reports thinking that they can put us down like that. We are not going to bow our heads again to these kinds of people, Sir. We will not do that. We will ensure that

those who come are certainly facilitated, but we will also demand from them accurate reports of the real situation in Sri Lanka. Now, Sir, I am tabling* this statement that our own Ambassador Mr. Ravinatha Aryasinha has sent in response to the report that this very biased personality obviously has authored and put forward, so that this also goes into Hansard, Sir.The Hon. Sampanthan has tabled the EU Report and I am tabling the response of our Ambassador to the EU, Sir - [Interruption.] Hon. Sampanthan, I am for a moment not blaming you. You are carrying out a brief. That is fine. There is no problem. Please let me also share with you the information that I have. That is all and at the end of the day, you and I will go to the canteen and have a cup of tea and shake hands. That is how Parliament should be. Now, Sir, the Hon. Sampanthan also quoted extensively from the Amnesty International Report. Now, let me tell you Hon. Sampanthan, this Amnesty International Report is one of the most biased subjective articles that I have ever come across.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Have you not - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)

You are talking about the Human Rights Watch. Now, Sir, when this Amnesty International Report was published, there was a response from our Ministry. I would just like to quote one or two paragraphs from it. First of all they are talking about 300,000 persons who are IDPs in the Vanni, but there is not even a population of 300,000 in the Vanni. It is very much less and we have said so and we have given the figure here. I am tabling* this statement, so that the Hon. Sampanthan, at his leisure, can read this. Sir, they said that only three convoys had been sent by the WFP, when they made this statement last week. Sir, the statement issued by the Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rights states, I quote: Since 02 October, the WFP has sent 6 convoys into uncleared areas - the latest being today (21 November). This statement was issued on the 21st of November, Sir. It further states, I quote: "The amount of food sent to the uncleared areas in a 6 to 7 week period exceeds 240 truckloads delivering 3,500 MT under this Emergency Food Delivery Programme.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

That is what India - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)

No. Why should we wait for Indias concern? We are more worried about our people than India. We are not going to wait for the Indian statements. Hon. Member of Parliament, we are not dictated by any country. I will tell you that we are a sovereign nation. They are our people and we will look after them. Now, Sir, the statement by the Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rights further states, I quote:

The AI statement, however, does not mention relief items sourced by the Government and delivered directly through the Government Agent/ District Secretaries as special food relief amounting to over 700 MT during this period, to complement the WFP supplies and build up buffer stocks.

Neither does it mention the almost daily consignments of consumer items including food, textiles and kerosene that are dispatched for sale to consumers in uncleared areas through Government retail outlets. These supplies, over a 28 month period, which are being consigned by the Commissioner-General for Essential Services, amount to nearly 11,000 MT delivered by over 8,000 truckloads. The GA convoy that left Vavuniya today included 106,000 litres of kerosene and 126 MT of food supplies as a continuation of this initiative. The AI statement also displays its acute lack of awareness of realities in these areas by completely ignoring the supply of nearly 1,400 MT for the fourth quarter of 2008, of food supplies to Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu Districts by the Ministry of Resettlement and Disaster Relief Services. - whose Minister is here today. Sir, again I quote :

The UN who were facilitated by the Government of Sri Lanka to conduct a multi-agency assessment of needs in mid-October...

I do not know whether the Hon. Sampanthan knows it. We sent a UN team in mid-October, without our people being a part of it, to do an independent needs assessment - [Interruption.] Obviously we gave them - [Interruption.] Hon. Sampanthan you know why we told them to come out. So, I am not going to answer that question - [Interruption.] I will tell you something. We discussed with them. We told them that we cannot guarantee their security because of the situation there. They agreed but we also told the UN that we can allow the WFP and the UNHCR to continue to be there and they said, No. We will all come to Vavuniya. Give us three weeks and we will relocate and they have relocated. So, it is not as if we forced all of them to come - [Interruption.] Are you telling us to keep them there when some of them are not doing a damn thing? Those who are working, we will certainly facilitate. But, there were a lot of people in the Vanni who just took the money and were looking up and waiting, Hon. Sampanthan, and we have got reports of that.

Sir, it further states, I quote: "They also concluded that medical and educational services are being adequately supplied and serviced by Government. Indeed the UN noted that despite relocation of some medical facilities, all necessary supplies of medicines have been dispatched by the Medical Supplies Division of the Ministry of Health, based on the requirements of regional health authorities. Supplies for all four quarters of 2008 have been dispatched based on annual projected needs by District health authorities. Furthermore, supplementary supplies including anti-venom and anti-malaria medical supplies have been dispatched upon request. You referred to it saying that there were snakebites. Yes, of course, there are snakebites. There are snakebites in Monaragala also; there are snakebites all over the country and we accept the fact that there are snakes there like in other parts of the country - [Interruption.] Frankly there are snakes here also. Be careful of snakes in this House as well. Again I quote: In contrast the AIs statements hint of a dire situation and epidemics which the UN has found no evidence of. This is the UN saying in October, when they went in and did a needs assessment. I am giving you an independent report. Amnesty International stays in London and gets some guy to write something which is completely subjective and untrue of the situation here. The UN goes into the Vanni, looks at the situation and says that there is no grave threat, that there is enough food and that there is enough medical supplies and other items - [Interruption.] Sir, this Zarifi or whoever it is who writes on behalf Amnesty International puts out another statement in todays "Blog" under Zarifi. He corrects his earlier statement. Earlier he was saying that everyone is under trees, everyone is by the side of the roads, there is no shelter, people are - . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Your Government Agent in Mannar is saying - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) No, the Government Agent in Mannar does not say that. I am telling you every month I chair the Consultative Committee on Disaster Management and Human Rights and they come for those meetings. I have asked them very specifically to tell me whether there are people living under the trees. They have categorically said No. Even Sam Zarifi, Asia-Pacific Director of Amnesty International says No and that he is going to correct himself by saying that these IDPs are in fact staying in school buildings and in abandoned buildings. He admits that there are no people living under trees and

2008 01 2395 2396

suffering in that manner as he said in his first statement. So, all what I am saying is, Hon. R. Sampanthan, do not believe every statement that the Amnesty International issues - [Interruption]. ( ) (An Hon. Member) That is his duty. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) At least I am accessible to you; you are my Friend, just take the telephone and ask me whether this is true. Then I will tell you - [Interruption.]. By the way, Sir, as I have explained above, the Hon. R. Sampanthan has the benefit of looking at both sides of the story. The Hon. R. Sampanthan also mentioned something which is important. He was talking about the Kallari camp and he said, that at 1.30 p.m. in the morning, the Kallari camp came under aerial bombardment. This is something which appears in - [Interruption.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) That is horrible, horrendous. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Obviously, the first thing you must be looking at in the morning is the TamilNet. That is fine. I do not blame you for that - [Interruption.] The TamilNet says that 3 people have been killed, 18 people have been wounded including children and females. The UN in fact contacted me yesterday, Sunday and asked me - they also had seen this in the TamilNet - whether this is correct. I phoned up the CDS, the Chief of Defence Staff and told him yesterday, please inquire into this matter, call me back and let me know whether this is the correct position, because if it was correct, it is something which cannot be condoned. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) You have taken - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Yes. Now, Sir, they have looked into it and they came back to us in writing. They said that the Air Force had bombed the training camp at a place called Piramanthakulama" near Kilinochchi and that they were right on target. Now, Sir, I do not think we can blame the Air Force for bombing a training camp which is used to kill innocent people - [Interruption.]

Sir, we know how these pictures can be manufactured. This is not the first and the last time that the LTTE propagandists put out pictures and distorted the real situation. They have done that, Hon. Sampanthan, over and over again many, many times. So, I do not want to even talk about that.

Now, Sir, the Hon. R. Sampanthan talked about Louis Arbour, who had asked for an office for the High Commission of Human Rights in Sri Lanka. I am telling you that even now the consolidated position of the Government of Sri Lanka is that we do not see a necessity at the moment for an office of the High Commission of Human Rights to be opened in Sri Lanka - . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) You do not want that because - [Interruption] ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) What we are saying is, instead we have the national institutions to do this. So, help us to build capacity in those national institutions. We will deliver, because once again, Sir, these are our people whom we are talking about, may be the Sinhalese, may be the Tamils, may be the Muslims. But, they are all Sri Lankans and their human rights should be the concern of everyone - [Interruption.] Now very interestingly, Hon. Sampanthan, once again due to lack of Information at your disposal, you very rightly referred to this letter that Mr. Lalith Weeratunga, in his capacity as Secretary to the President had sent on the AGs continued role. You quoted from that letter and said that the President had told the Commission of Inquiry that the Commission of Inquiry should not investigate or inquire into the conduct of the Attorney General. Now, there was such a letter which was sent. I will table* that letter. But you were not aware of a subsequent letter. [Interruption.] No, no. You were not aware of it because - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I am aware of that - [Interrutpion.]

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Okay. Tell me what is in that letter? [Interruption.] No. what is in that letter ? Tell me.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) The Presidential Secretariat wrote to the Chairman of the Commission of Inquiry asking the Commission of Inquiry why they had met the European Union, the Canadian Ambassador and the American Ambassador in regard to aid for the hearing of evidence of these witnesses by teleconferencing. That letter was written after two individuals, two lawyers appearing for the possible suspects before the Commission of Inquiry. Wrote to the President. The two lawyers wrote to the President. The letter by the Presidents Secretary was based upon that. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Hon. Sampanthan, that is another letter you are referring to. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I am talking about the teleconferencing. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) No. I am not talking about teleconferencing. - [Interruption.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Your President - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)

I have only six more minutes. ( ) (The Chairman) No, Hon. Minister, you have only four minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) I will quote from this letter. It states, I quote : when stating his intention, His Excellency the President is conscious of the fact that, the Commission of Inquiry would continue to enjoy the legal authority to investigate and inquire into the conduct of any person (who is amenable to the authority of the Commission) who may have been involved in the commission of a serious human rights violations stipulated in the warrant of the Commission. In this regard, the Attorney-General and his officers would not be exempt from the authority of the Commission, nor would they enjoy any immunity.

You read a letter earlier on and you quoted extensively from that. You painted a picture as if the President is safeguarding the Attorney General. But, His Excellency the President has very clearly stated in this letter that no one is above the law. Even summons can be issued on any member of the Attorney -Generals office. I am tabling this letter so that it will be once again extra information to the Hon. Sampantaha. - [Interruption.] Hon. Sampanthan, please excuse me. There are so many other very interesting points that you made. Let us discuss all those over a cup of coffee. Otherwise, I do not have the time to reply to all those. I hope I gave you sufficient time because you do deserve sufficient time as you are a good man. You are not a bad person. You are a good person but unfortunately, the problem with you is that when you get up in the morning, you look at TamilNet first. Look at other things also so that you can get a [Interruption.] I would like to say this very quickly with regard to the Assistance and Protection to Victims of Crime and Witnesses Bill. Hon. Sampanthan, as much as I would have liked it, it is not my bill - [Interruption.] It is a Bill presented by the Ministry of Justice and Law Reforms. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Chairman) . Please conclude your speech. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Okay. It was on the request of the Opposition that it was held back. The Leader of the House is present here. If you want to take up that Bill, please take that matter up at the Party Leaders meeting and have it scheduled. The Member of Parliament of the JVP who spoke, questioned the mandate of this Ministry to work in the areas of human rights. I would refer him to the Gazette notification which very clearly states what our mandate is and we are now implementing that mandate.

Hon. Minister, please conclude your speech.

Sir, there is one more matter with regard to the right to life. I am tabling* a document once again which we submitted to the UPR, Universal Periodic Review. The Hon.

They have done a fantastic job. There is a lot of information here. I want to thank the army who did that work in Jaffna and in the Vanni. This is the kind of work that we expect from them, Sir. Thank you, very much. * : : Statement tabled : THE EMBASSY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA TO BELGIUM, LUXEMBOURG AND THE EUROPEAN UNION

27, RUE JULES LEJEUNE, 1050 BRUSSELS, BELGIUM Statement of H. E. Mr. Ravinatha Aryasinha , Ambassador of Sri Lanka to the EU at a discussion on Sri Lanka at the Session of the South Asia Delegation of the European Parliament - 7th October 2008 Mr. Chairman, I thank you for affording the Government of Sri Lanka an opportunity to be heard, as you exchange views on the 5th European Parliament/Sri Lanka Inter Parliamentary Meeting (IPM) which took place on 20-26 July, 2008. I do so in the context that Sri Lanka. Values the cordial relations it has with all European Institutions and, as you are aware, has in recent times intensified its engagement with the European Parliament. Mr. Chairman, so much has been said about this visit, mainly by yourself, that I am not sure whether I should respond here to the press statement and comments you made in Colombo on 25th July, to your widely reported speech on 25th August 2008 at an event organized by the British Tamil Forum (BTF), a front organization it would seem of the proscribed LTTE, held in Harrow, South London, a part of your EU Parliamentary constituency, or to this draft report which has been placed before this body. At the outset, I am instructed by my Government to place on record our strong protest about the damage which may have been done to the good relations between my country and the European Union through the aspersions cast on the Government of Sri Lanka through your statement issued and comments at the Colombo press conference, which I note is also part of this report. Among other matters, it stated in relation to the planned visit to the Eastern Province the last minute cancellation and a catalogue of chaos and confusion meant that the delegation did not fly to Trincomalee. Despite repeated assurances; endless complications resulted in the party being turned back from Ratmalana Airport, destroying months of preparation, time and expense. I note that your draft report itself, is less critical in explaining the reasons for the delegation aborting the scheduled two-day visit to the East in saying when the authorization (for the UN plane) was eventually received, in a best case scenario, the field trip would have had to be shortened drastically. These however do not correspond with your statement at the pro - LTTE rally in Harrow, where you gallantly explained amidst cheers it seems, that the EU delegation did not visit the East because I refused to give only a photo opportunity of shaking hands with Pillayan, the Chief Minister of the Eastern Province. The Government of Sri Lanka sees these contradictory messages communicated to different audiences as an attempt to sully the good name of Sri Lanka in the European eye. And an exercise at scoring brownie points with a constituency due to vote in the upcoming European Parliamentary election. Let me state categorically that the Government was very keen to ensure that the delegation had the opportunity to experience first-hand the transformation that had taken place in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka over the past year. As I stated even prior to your embarking on this visit, it was particularly keen that you did so, as it seemed that the EU had been reluctant to appreciate the winds of change blowing through Eastern Sri Lanka in recent times and in June 2008 the European Commission (EC) office in Colombo, had prevented a member of the EC delegation attending the Joint Commission from even interacting with the newly elected Chief Minister of the Eastern Province.

For your visit the Government had initially offered air-transportation but this was refused by you Mr. Chairman on the basis of wanting to demonstrate impartiality (although between whom it is unclear). Nevertheless the Government did everything within its power to make the journey possible to your satisfaction. What it did not know was that, instead of flying with a local company which had earlier been booked by the EC office in Colombo (to be cancelled with a cancellation fee of US$2,500/- paid by the European taxpayer doubtless), you decided to embark on a UN plane flown all the way from South Africa, arriving in Sri Lanka 48 hours prior to your scheduled departure to Trincomalee, which incidentally is only five hours by road. You would understand that the Sri Lanka aviation authorities were obliged as per international civil aviation safety regulations to assess the air-worthiness of this rather old aircraft and familiarize a foreign crew that had never flown in Sri Lanka with the route to be taken. This they did in record time and, as your draft report now confirms, authorization for the flight was granted only 45 minutes later than your estimated departure time. You were assured of this, but you chose to leave the airport and return to the hotel. Why you chose to abort this journey, when you could still have had a clear day and a half in the East, and done all you wanted, will remain known only to you. However, Mr. Chairman, to the Government of Sri Lanka it would seems obvious that by avoiding the visit to the East, members of the delegation were deprived of experiencing first-hand one of the proudest achievements of Sri Lanka in recent times. We have not only cleared the East of any significant terrorist presence, our forces did this without any civilian casualties during their operations, and our citizens who were displaced were almost all resettled to the satisfaction of UNHCER, followed by democratic elections and restoration of the provincial council-all within a year. Such a record is unparalleled, in other theatres of the fight against terror and the Sri Lanka example has been commended not only as an instructive model in transforming former terrorists to the democratic way of life, but also as a case study in post-conflict development. Turning to your draft report, it is disappointing that, despite what you acknowledge to have been a substantial and extensive program, the report is replete with unsubstantiated allegations, deliberate distortions and blatant falsehoods and seeks merely to highlight negatives, ignore positives, and disregard the context and environment prevailing in Sri Lanka today - a country fighting one of the most dangerous terrorist groups in the world - the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). This is terrorist group the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has described as among the most dangerous and deadly extremists in the world. A truism once again demonstrated only yesterday in Anuradhapura, through the dastardly LTTE terrorist attack on the Opposition Leader of the North Central Provincial Council who belonged to the United National Party (UNP) Major General Janaka Perera and several others. Despite these challenges we have maintained a resilient economy in an inhospitable international climate and above all ensured levels of socio-economic development akin to developed nations, keeping apace in meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) towards which development partners, including the EU have made significant contribution. I will address the report section by section. With reference to Section A- the peace process collapse.. Let me make very clear that, contrary to your report, the Government of Sri Lanka has not chosen an all - war strategy nor abandoned any idea of peace talks before a complete military victory. As President, Mahinda Rajapaksa stated at the 63rd session of the UNGA on 24th September 2008 our Government has always been ready to address the causes of these issues and effectively implement political and constitutional solutions to meet the aspirations and rights of all communities. What the Government would not, and could not do is to let an illegal and armed terrorist group, the LTTE, to hold a fraction of our population, a part of the Tamil Community, hostage to such terror in the Northern part of Sri Lanka and deny those people their democratic rights and free elections The problem is that some people still believe that peace talks can only be with terrorists, forgetting that in Sri Lanka there

2401 2402

are several pluralist democratic Tamil forces which are happy, and in fact now emboldened, to discuss with us the political reforms that are essential. We will not let them be intimidated again by the forces you addressed in London, we will not let them be killed by the LTTE as so many tamil political leaders have been over the last several decades. With reference to Section B - ...followed by a clear deterioration of the humanitarian situation the unsourced assertion in the report that in July 2008 there were approximately 610,000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) in Sri Lanka is an exaggeration. The correct current figure of IDPs - which accounts for those displaced and living in Welfare Centres or with family and friends, is far less, and includes approximately 300,000 displaced before 2006. When the Eastern province was cleared of the LTTE in 2006/2007, it is true that the IDPs in the East came to over 2,90,000 but, following prompt action by the Government, certified by the UNHCR as having satisfied international standards, today only 28,000 remain as IDPs this too is because their places of residence are yet to be cleared of the landmines laid by the LTTE. All others have been re-settled in their original homes or in alternate dwellings, With regard to IDPs in LTTE dominated areas in the Killinochchi and Mullativu districts, the current estimate is around 250,000 of which there are 110,000 pre 2006 IDPs brought to the Vanni by the LTTE at the time they fled the Jaffna peninsula, another 90,000 who were displaced between 2006 and june 2008 and the rest displaced due to the on-going operations. There are about 200,000 IDPs in Jaffna, Vavuniya and Mannar districts, two thirds of them of the pre-2006 category. There is also a significant number of pre-2006 IDPs in the Puttalam District, resulting from the deliberate policy of ethnic cleansing by the LTTE in 1990 when some 75,000 Muslims were overnight driven out of Jaffna by the LTTE, The process of finding durable solutions for them was begun by this Government, assisted by the World Bank with a housing project, and most recently by the Prof. Walter Kalin, the Representative of the UN Secretary General on the Human Rights of IDPs, who contributed to a national consultation on the subject. Merely citing figures does not do justice to the fact that, in the midst of dealing with our terrorist problem, the current Government has shown itself determined to deal with these tragic victims of LTTE atrocities. Whatever your constituents in Harrow might say, Mr Chairman, we will care for these are our citizens. In discussing IDPs in the present context, it is important that we bear in mind that those displaced due to the on-going military operations in the Vanni are, as previously in the case of the East, merely a temporary this location. They are being encouraged to move out of these areas through humanitarian corridors created in order that the security forces can put an end to terrorism in Sri Lanka and in order that they avoid being used by the LTTE as human shields. If the authors of this report had any genuine concern for those people who have for decades been exploited in the clutches of the LTTE, It remains a question why they have not, either in this report or in their many public utterances, joined the chorus of international opinion including British Foreign Office Minister Lord Malloch Brown and International Development Minister, Shahid Malik, the Catholic Bishops Conference and even organizations including Amnesty International, that has called upon the LTTE to take urgent action to allow free movement of civilians and not to hold them as human shields Instead of joining in our plea to let our people go, the import of the draft report in this section is tantamount to putting pressure in the Government to stop its military operations against the LTTE terrorists - effectively throwing a lifeline to the terrorists. The draft report goes on to describe as an extremely disturbing move, the Governments instruction to NGOs and the UN to relocate their staff and equipment from the Vanni (where military operations are on-going, development work is not possible and the LTTE was known to be conscripting staff of these organizations and forcefully taking over their assets) to Vavuniya, where a new Humanitarian hub has been established and they can continue their work. It fails to acknowledge that the ICRC continues to remain in the operational area playing an important role, and that the UNHCR and WFP, though they too were initially meant to remain, chose to leave the area on the grounds that other UN agencies were not permitted to remain. However, at their

request, their staff will be permitted to go into the Vanni with convoys transporting supplies to the displaced. The Vanni continues to be looked after by our Government also provides free education health an other social services to all our people. Naturally, we are deeply troubled by the fact that, a section of our people have had their lives for many decades disrupted by the continuing conflict situation, and that this will persist only for a little while longer. But I want to allay the fear raised in the draft report, about the conditions of the IDPs presently in the Vanni, held by force by the LTTE. It was former UNICEF Executive Director James Grant who described the Sri Lankan example as uniquely humanitarian in a conflict situation, while Dr. Francis Deng, former UN Secretary Generals Special Representative on IDPs who noted that Sri Lanka represents the unusual situation of a central government providing relief aid to persons under the control of the main opposition group. In a world replete with examples of Governments and rebel groups using food as a weapon against civilian populations, the situation in Sri Lanka is one that deserves closer attention if not more publicity as an important precedent. Sri Lanka is proud that, notwithstanding the ongoing intensive military operations in the North against the LTTE, in continues to live up to these cherished values. This was re-confirmed in comments made during a visit to Colombo on 26 September 2008 by Prof. Walter Kalin, who commended the political will at various levels of Government in Sri Lanka to find durable solutions to the concerns of IDPs, and that despite facing many challenges, Sri Lanka is heading it the right direction overall. Obviously, the authors of this report didnt want to see it that way. I am glad to report to you that on 2 October 2008, 07 UN staffers and 3 persons from the Consortium of Humanitarian Agencies (CHA) accompanied a convoy of 51 trucks with 650 MT of Food, clothing, shelter and medical needs to the Vanni. I can assure you that the Government of Sri Lanka is Committed to ensuring that at least one conoy per week will be undertaken with an approximate delivery of around 3,500 MT of food per month. The government will do so, while not compromising on security and with limited restrictions to avoid material used in th conflict from reaching the LTTE. In fact, I wish to note that 3 of the trucks that were scheduled to make the journey to Vanni last week did not do so, as the security forces found concealed in them 2.5 kilo grams of plastic explosives, batteries and GPS systems respectively - acts the UN has also condemned. Although not pointed out by your selective sources, these ae the realities average Sri Lankans have to grapple with on a daily basis, as Sri Lanka continues to care for its people, amidst facing terrorism. With respect to Section C, Human Rights situation the report states that the Sri Lanka Constitution nominally ensures the protection of fundamental human rights. It fails to acknowledge that in Sri Lanka, Fundamental rights are fully justiciable and the exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine related questions is vested with the Supreme Court, which has in recent years vastly enhanced its jurisdiction by giving wide and purposeful interpretations - including reversing policy decisions taken by the security forces. The draft report also ignores the Sri Lanka Governments consistent policy of openness, transparency and constructive engagement with the international community, including receiving rapporteurs and voluntarily submitting itself to the Universal periodic Review (UPR) of the UN Human Rights Council. Let me reiterate the Sri Lanka Governments firm conviction that those who violate human rights or break laws will nto be excused. Such persons will be prosecuted accoridngo the law and the Government is committed to ensuring investigation into an prosecution of alleged offenders within the legal Prame work operative in Sri Lanka. It is in this spirit that the Government established a Commission of Inquiry (COI) in 2006 to inquire into 16 incidents of alleged serious violations of human rights, including the ACF case referred to in the report. However, the report fails to acknowledge the action being taken by the COI, which in respect of the cases of the Trincomalee students and the ACF have since early this year held public hearings. The investigation into the Trincomalee case has been concluded and the COI is expected to submit a report to the President shortly. The investigation into the ACF case is continuing and a representative of the French Government is observing the proceedings.

2008 01 2403 2404

The draft report makes much of Sri Lankas not being re-elected to the UN Human Rights Council in May 2008 when, as members should know well enough, failure to be re-elected means nothing in a context in which a more popular competitor got more votes. It is pertinent to note that in terms of actual numbers of votes Sri Lanka got only a few votes less than some European countries who were also engaged in tight competitions. With regard to the COI, contrary to what is stated in the report, four members did not resign from the COI sayingthat the GOSL had shown little willingness to help them in their work. Mr. U. Yapa, a former Solicitor General, resigned due to ill health and later passed away; Mr. K. C. Logeswaran resigned for personal reasons as he wanted to be out of the country and upon his return continues to function as a member; Dr. D. Nesiah resigned after his role as a Commissioner was challenged by private Counsel on the grounds of conflict of interest; M. Javid Yusuf also resigned as he had other personal commitments. As for the Independent International Group of Eminent Per Eminent Persons (IIGEP) which was mandaed to observe the workings of the COI, it certainly did not claim that it was interfered with by the Attorney Generals Office. The claim was that the COI was interfered with , whereas the the COI has made it clear that this is not its view, and that it continued to require the assistance of the AGs Department in certain respects. It must be noted that unlike in the Us, the Attorney General is not a political appointee in Sri Lanka and cannot according to the law of the land be replaced in such proceedings by a private lawyer as is done in some countries. It should be further noted that the COI has exercised the liberty to additionally choose lawyers from the official or unofficial bar in the conduct of its inquiry. With respect to the IIGEP, it is the Governments position that the mandate given to the Eminent Persons was abused by their Assistants, who took upon themselves authority they did not have, to the extent of issuing statements contraty to agreed guidelines and timed to embarrass Sri Lanka before meetings of the UN Human Rights Council and Other International fora. The reports reference to the final IIGEP withdrawal, and claims by some of its members about a lack of political will, should be seen in the context of the final statement by Justice P. N. Bhagwati, Chair of the IIGEP who in a letter addressed to the President of Sri Lanka on 26th April 2008, categorically stated you will find that the II GEP has not accused the Government of Sri Lanka of any lack of political will in so far as the functioning of the COI is concerned. What has been recited in the Public Statement is about IIGEPs apprehensions regarding absence of political will. Relating to media freedom, it is important to note that of over 25 media outlets in Sri Lanka, only 4 are stated owned. Despite the intensity of the conflict, there is not media censorship and a reading of most newspapers in Sri Lanka, or viewing of most television programmes shoul proide a useful litmus test for one to ascertain the veracity or otherwise of what the delegation heard on what is expressly forbidden for journalists to do. T his is not to claim that journalists have not fallen victim to assassins nor been arrested when suspected of wrong doing that needed to be clarified. Pursuing such investigations transparently is in the interest of all concerned, as well as the country. With reference to the case of journalist J. S. Tissanayagam which the draft report, refers to, following a period of detention he was produced before judicial authorities who authorized his further detention. He was subsequenltly indicted, and the case is pending before the High Court. While in detention Mr. Tissanyagam in a petition to the Supreme Court challenged his detention. This case is currently being heard. Let me also assure you that Mr. Tissanayagam has been examined and treated by eye specialists at the Colombo National Hospital and has been produced before the Judicial Medical Officer at the Colombo Judicial Medical Office for check-ups. In relation to alleged abductions and disappearances, the position of the Government is that the situation has considerably improved form what was highlighted in the latter part of 2006 and early, 2007, when following the earlier decimation of non-LTTE Tamil groups at the hands of the LTTE, these groups re-established themselves following the weakening of LTTE authority, and responded as they thought appropriate. The government was soon able however to being that situation under control, and though internecine attacks continue, these are far fewer than before. As for exact number, the Government faces difficulty in arriving at a figure due to the multiplicity of lists provided by many agencies - often without any rationalization, supporting evidence or even details of those alleged to have disappeared, that could give investigators a starting point.

Further, investigations in areas in the North have been hampered due to the security situation and lack of access to the LTTE dominated areas. It must also be noted that since mid-2007 following vigorous operations mounted by the Government against a number of groups operating in Colombo who had been allegedly responsible for disappearances, and abductions for the extortion of money, a downward trend was noted. However, it is regrettable that agencies such as Human Rights Watch which is quoted in the draft report, having produced figures for a year in 2007, in 2008 produced figures for an 18 month period, which deliberately ignores this downward trend. As was pointed out with regard to its last report, it is no coincidence that, in claiming that there were over 1500 disappearances in the two years that ended in December 2007, HRW records 1300 of them as having occurred in 2006 or the first four months of 2007. Again, of the 97 cases documented in detail in its full report, just three occurred in the calendar year before the report was issued, early in 2008. As to the allegation of the prevalence of impunity, the statistics quoted in the draft report as stated by Sri Lankan spokespersons is accurate over a period, which includes the past few years. Since 2004, it is noted that indictments have been served by the Attorney General of Sri Lanka against nearly 100 persons for Human rights violations (including allegations of torture.) Among the prominent recent cases where indictments had been served are that of an Army Corporal and Police Constable alleged to be responsible for the murder of 5 students in Thandikulam on 18th November 2006, and 6 members of the police and the armed forces including a Wing Commander (both retired and currently serving), who were arrested in June 2007 for a sense of abductions for ransom and murder. With respect to Section D, Talks on Power Devolution The draft report makes much of the absence of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) from the APRC process at present, which I am informed by APRC Chairman Prof. Tissa Vitharana, was perfectly well explained to you during your discussions with him. Since the draft report avoids mentioning it, let me repeat the very simple explanation for this. The setting up of the All Party Representative Committee (APRC) was primarily intended to build a consensus within the southern polity of Sri Lanka on the nature and extent of devolution of power that could be put forward in negotiations with the LTTE. The original non-inclusion of the TNA in this process, was since the TNA had acknowledged their dependence on the LTTE, it made no sense to negotiate twice with the same perspectives. However, as Prof. Vitharana told you in Colombo, midway in the APRC process, he had explicitly asked the TNA leader whether they would be willing to join the process and that the President was ready to extend invitation to them. The answer was that they felt it inadvisable at that time, and would consider it when talks were held with the LTTE While the United National Party (UNP) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) have withdrawn from attending sessions but remain engaged with the Chairman of the APRC, the Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal (TMVP) which recently entered the political mainstream has recently joined the process. It is important to note that it is the termination of the Ceasefire Agreement (CFA) which ended the LTTE monopoly of Tamil politics, that enabled the Government to introduce a political process to the North and East as recommended by the APRC and embark on ensuring the full implementation of the thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, in the areas for which it was most intended but where it remained unimplemented for 20 years following the categorical rejection of it by the LTTE. The re-establishment of the Eastern Provincial Council through the holding of elections in May 2008, measures to ensure proper implementation of the constitutional provisions relating to official languages, the recruitment of Tamil-Speaking police officers, interpreters and translators are all tangihl results of the full inmplementation policy the draft report questions. With respect Section E The Situation in the East having avoided experiencing fast-hand the developments on the ground, the draft report obtusely refuses to acknowledge the massive strides that have been made by the Government, along with all communities that share the East the Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims to restore nomally in an area wher just over a year ago, the LTTE held the peoples lives to ranson. Even as many international development partners have become engaged with this process, the European Union continues to stay aloof, refusing to accept

2405 2406

that, when a fact does not fita theory, it is the theory that must change, The draft report makes no effort to contribute to the winds of chage; instead it prefers to stand against the tide of history, Incidentaly, it should be noted that a year ago, the European Commission had the ternerity to call in my predecessor and advise against holding elections in the Eastern Province, claiming that the EU report on the 2004 parliamentary election indicated that fair elections could not be held. The Ground reality has disproved this misperception. The draft report also goes on to allege that the TMVP has not completely stopped its former practice to recruit child soldiers In this context, it is noteworthy that, according to UNICF, as of 31st January 2008, the number of children recruited by the Karuna faction was reported as 234 which included 164 children who were yet under 18 years. According to report of a Committee set-up to monitor the recruitment of children chaired by the Justice Scretary which includes UNICEF, only 66 child recruits of the Karuna faction remained as at September 2008. While 20 child recruits have been located and released with the assistance of UNICEF, the others could not be located, the TMVP had earlier facilitated the release 39. The US Ambasseador in Sri Lanka, as well as UNICEF, has commended the progress made by the Government in securing the release of child soldiers held by the TMVP, The TMVP claims that there are no more in its custody and has invited UNICEF and the Government to visit and investigate all alleged cases. The logistics of this are still being worked out, but as UNICEF itself has declared, this is not a major problem. The tears shed in the draft report them seem irnci, since it makes no reference to the main Culprit of child recruitment in Sri Lanka - the LTTE, who since 2002, had recruited over 5,700 children and that according to UNICEF, there were 1,430 outstanding cases of child recruitment by the LTTE as of 31st January, 2008. With respect to section F, GSPX Issues in comparison to the strident statements made by the Chairman in Colombo that if he had the choice Sri Lanka would not be given GSP and, at the pro-LTTE rally in Harrow where he stated that Sri Lanka would lose its GSPX concessions, the observations made in the draft report are more measured Howerver ,the authors of the draft report are deliberately distoring truth or being badly misled when they state that it would be extremely difficult to accept that Sri Lanka has been making progress if the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) remains non-ratified through domestic legislations, or indeed if need be, by way of a constitutional amendment. Such a development would pave the way for rights recognized in the ICCPR to find real protection in Sri Lanka courts - which the Delegation knows is not the case today How could the drafters of this report pretend they did not know the most crucial fact about the operationalization of the ICCPR in Sri Lanka, namely that earlier this year, upon President Mahinda Rajapaksa seeking its opinion on the recognition and justifiability of the ICCPR in Sri Lanka, the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka expressed its opinion following public hearings held on 17th March 2008 affirming the following: (i) The provisions of the constitution, the ICCPR Act and other laws, including decisions of the Superior Court of Sri Lanka give adequate recognition to the civil and political rights contained in the ICCPR, and adhere to the general premise of the Covenant that individuals within the territory of Sri Lanka derive the benefit and guarantee of rights contained in the ICCPR; (ii) Rights recognized in the ICCPR are justiciable through the medium of legal and constitutional processes prevailing in Sri Lanka. On the basis of the above, it would be fair to conclude that the Delegation clearly does not know. Furthermore, footnote 23 of the report relating to this section states that the EP Delegation welcomes the proposals made by the business community of Sri Lanka such as the joint Apparel Association in this respect and notes that at least one of the two major political parties has decided to support this initiative, making the necessary 2/3 majority reasier to obtain in the Sri Lankan Parliament. I have checked this information with the Joint Apparel Association and have been told that the joint Apparel Association it no stage made any proposal to anyone regarding seeking support to change the constitution, which suggests that the delegation is going on the basis of a false premise, It must be noted

that in any event a constitutional amendment does not become necessary in view of the clear ruling of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka that the rights recognized in the ICCPR are justifiable. With respect to Final Recommendations while the status of journalist Mr. J. S. Tissanayagam has already been referred to, I want to assure you that active investigations into the cases involving Parliamentarians, including the assassinations of former Foreign Minister, Lakshman Kadirgamar, of MP, Joseph Pararajsingham and MP, Nadarajah Raviraj which are additionally before the Commission of Inquiry, are being fully investigated. On the Constitutional Council; it should be noted that the Seventeenth Amendment introduced hastily in 2001 was flawed from the start, with some appointments recommended by a fully constituted Council not being made in the early years of this decade, while the Council itself could not be constituted for a long time because of uncenainty over membership, and the inability of the Speaker to resolve the issue. A Parliamentary Select Committee has recently been appointed to review this matter and once this process is completed, action would be taken to constitute the body. Installation to Witness Protection legislation, I am glad to bring to your notice that following concerns raised at the time the draft legislation was introduced in the Parliament earlier this year, revisions have now been made and the legislation is scheduled to be re-introduced in Parliament shortly. In conclusion, I wish to reiterate the considerable damage done to the good relations between my country and the European Union, and to the high esteem the European Parliament was held in Sri Lanka, following the visit of the delegation to Colombo. This situation appears to have been compounded by this draft report, which as I have documented is replete with unsubstantiated allegations, deliberate distortions and blatant falsehoods, and underlines the patent bias of its authors against Sri Lanka. Even at this late stage, Sri Lanka hopes that the concerns that have been flagged in my presentation, of which a comprehensive submission will be shared with those present here, will be carefully considered by the members of this committee before finalizing this report. Without being guided by parochial self-serving interests of the authors of the present document, I trust you will take it upon yourselves, the task of making a more objective evaluation of development in Sri Lanka, in order that the damage caused by the present action is repaired, and the Government of Sri Lanka can continue to engage with the President and Members of the European Parliament, as a credible body. I thank you. * : : Letter tabled:

PRESIDENTIAL SECRETARIAT November 30 2007 Justice N K. Udalagama Chairman Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire in to Allged Serious Violations of Human Rights Dear Sir, Clarification regarding letter dated November 5, 2007 I refer to my letter to you dated November 5, 2007 His Excellency wishes the honourable Commissioners to note that, the afore-stated letter dated November 5, 2007, does not contain an amendment to the terms of reference of the Commission, nor was it intended to be perceived as containing suck an amendment.

His Excellency is fully conscious that officers of the Attorney Generals Department do not get involved in the conduct of investigations by the police, and only provide legal advice, particularly when such advice, is sought by the police. Upon the completion of investigations, the Attorney General considers the investigational findings with the view to instituting criminal proceedings if the available material so warrant. If criminal proceedings are instituted in the High Court, officers of the Attorney Generals Department would conduct the prosecution. Therefore,, His Excellency does not see a legal basis in which officers of the Attorney Generals Department could be subject to inquiry by the Commission for the purpose of considering and commenting on the nature, propriety and efficacy of the investigations conducted by the police into the incidents investigated and inquired into by the Commissions of Inquiry. When stating his intention, His Excellency the President is conscious of the fact that, the Commission of Inquiry would continue to enjoy the legal authority to investigate and inquire into the conduct of any person (who is amenable to the authority of the Commission) who may have been involved in the commission of a serious human rights violation stipulated in the warrant of the Commission. In this regard, the Attorney General and his officers would not be exempt from the authority of the Commission, nor would they enjoy any immunity. Furthemore, His Excellendy the President is conscious of the fact that, with the view to collecting information or material pertaining to the afore-stated incidents and investigations conducted by the police such incidents the Commission of Inquiry may if deemed necessary issue surmons to any person including to officers of the Attorney Generas Department who may be in possession of such information or material which the Commission considers relevant to its investigations and inquiries being conducted within the scope of the terms of reference of the Commission. The afore-stated clarifications were explained of Members of the HGEP who met with His Excellency the President, and they were notified that a communication to this effect would be forwarded to you and copied to them. In view of the foregoing, His Excellency believes that the issue raised by the HGEP pertaining to my letter dated 5th November 2007 are herby sufficiently clarified, and that the Commission could continue to function in terms of the Warrant without any impediment.

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Sir, thank you for giving me this opportunity to move the following adjournment Motion on some important matters pertaining to the Muslim community displaced form the Northern Province:

2008 01 2415 2416

From time to time there have been efforts to address the situation of those Northern Muslims living in welfare centres, the displaced have faced numerous problems. 1. The housing conditions have been poor, with inadequate access to water and sanitation facilities. 2. The rations provided to the displaced are set on a pricing system from the 1990s and does not reflect the current price of goods. 3. There are limited livelihood opportunities in sites of displacement. The expelled Muslims have attempted to return and resettle from time to time but they have been unable to for a variety of reasons: *. They were unable to secure the necessary security guarantees and the much needed assurance that they would not be re-expelled. * Majority of the houses have been rendered inhabitable, some houses and properties were occupied by others.

* Returnees faces significant challenges in re-starting livelihoods.

* Total neglect and damage to infrastructure. Whereas there have been various efforts by the Government and other groups to assist resettlement of the expelled Muslims. Efforts should be undertaken by all to ensure that steps are taken to support their return and resettlement. This Parliament also calls for due attention be ensure the protection of the rights and the recognition of the needs of all returnee communities. Parliament should resolve to ensure that is addresses the plight of all displaced persons especially in their effort to return and resettle in their lands and guarantees the protection that is due to them without any political bias or prejudice. The Muslims of the Northern Province are greatly worried about the lack of an institutional or legal framework for the protection of the land and property that had been left abandoned at the time of their expulsion. They are unable to have recourse through the courts with speedy legal remedies due to jurisdictional issue and also due to the fact that court of law are not functioning properly in certain areas or they are already overburdened with the existing case load. Action should be initiated to grant protection to the and to protect the legal rights of the owners. As mentioned earlier, a large extent of land belonging to the Muslims is left abandoned or forcibly occupied by others. Such land are open to misuse and even liable for transfer on forged documents. The following measures are suggested to overcome those problems. The first is, to have a complete audit and a list of abandoned of forcibly occupied land on a divisional basis. The second is, to give some form of physical protection by the Government to such land. The third is, to introduce laws similar to the REPPIA Act. The fourth is, to bring in an amendment to the Prescription Ordinance to exempt such lands form the purview of the law. With regard to law and policy reform, new legislation should be introduced to protect the rights of the displaced regarding land and property. New laws also should be introduced to deal with land alienation made under duress.

The existing legal provisions are not adequate to arrest this situation. In addition, a legal framework for the restitution and restoration or properry abandoned by the Muslims of the Northern province too should be developed. Therefore, we recommend that the Government formulates a comprehensive set of guideline and action plans with regard to the return and resettlement of the displaced Muslims. The views of the affected persons and other stakeholders also must be sought before finalizing such guidelines and plans. Resettlement should be voluntary and must adhere to all norms governing resettlement of the displaces. With regard to collective planning, the Government must spearhead the formulation of a strategy to plan out comprehensive resettlement. The international community, the civil society and the affected to should be stakeholders in the exercise. The Government should appoint a Presidential Commission to inquire into the circumstances that led to the expulsion and incidental matters. Also, the appointment of a commission like that is South Africa can elicit the underlying causes and recommend necessary measure to strengthen intercommunity relationships. The Muslims of the Northern Province are internally displaced persons according to internationally accepted definitions. However, the circumstances that led to their displacement was unique. Therefore, the Government and the international community should confer on them a special status. It is up to all the stakeholders-the Government, the LTTE, the Tamil political leadership, the international community, the Muslim political and civil society and the evicted persons themselves-to work out a comprehensive strategy to solve the issue sooner than late. It this regard, a few suggestions are made. Firstly, the Government and all other stakeholders should recognize the right or return of the Muslims of the Northern Province. Secondly, the appointment of a take force to study and recommend necessary measures on the following matters: the creation of a conducive climate for the resumption of social life, economic activities and livelihoods; the payment of compensation or any other assistance for the loss of life, the injuries sustained and for damaged or destroyed property under the supervision of a committee comprising of all stakeholder representatives; the implementation of schemes of assistance of commence agricultural and business activates on return; the resolution of issues related to landlessness and agricultural land. Thirdly, we suggest the preparation of a master plan for reconstruction and development. Fourthly, the granting of legal assistance to returnees and finally, we suggest to bring about confidence-building measures aimed at reintegration.

2417 2418

We, therefore, request the Government to set up a time frame to implement the above measures immediately without any further delay.
