[..1.26] . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. M. M. Naoshaad) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem Hon. Presiding member, let me begin first by congratulating the Minister of Environment and Natural Resources, the Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, on his being unanimously elected as the President of the Conference of Parties to Vienna Convention at its eight convention held in Doha Qatar recently. As Sri Lankans, we are proud of your election and wish you the very best in the position. I will also fail in my duty if I do not place on record the appreciation of the people of Sri Lanka for the interest and effort you are taking to protect the environment and our natural resources. It is not an easy task, but an important one, and I will advise you not to be deterred by all the criticism that will come your way, when you make attempts at changing the way we do things that are causing irreparable damage to the environment we live in. The key environmental issues we face today as you know, in order, are: air pollution, climate change, land degradation due to soil erosion, loss of bio-diversity, water scarcity and pollution, waste disposal, pollution of inland waters, depletion of coastal resources and the end resultant, poverty. There is no doubt a growing awareness in our country and even globally that environmental considerations must be taken into account in all spheres of economic development. An essential factor to achieve the objectives of sustainable environmental management is the co-operation and involvement of all stakeholders, which I feel is still not forthcoming as it should in this country. You are on record as saying that island nations, which are highly vulnerable to climate change, are faced with the dual challenge of achieving economic development and responding to the effects of climate change at the same time. Globally, a critical paradigm shift is needed, even at this late stage, to ensure that huge environmental problems we face today do not get passed down to future generations. If the current blame game continues - as you referred to - along with business as usual, at least two more planets would be required to sustain the present growth. As I said before, it is not an easy task in this country where we have been having the luxury of being blessed with natural resources in abundance, and not appreciating it. As my time is limited, let me get to a subject that I have been taking up with you quite often; that is the human-elephant conflict, which is becoming very critical in my electorate.

With its imposing size, high level of intelligence and complex social behaviour, very few wild species evoke as much attention and varied emotions from us humans as much as elephants, though their tendency to raid crops and sometimes aggressive behaviour also instills animosity and fear. You would have watched on Sirasa how a cow-elephant chased and trampled a man to death. If I had a gun, I would have shot it down. That would have been the normal human reaction. Experts are on record as saying that most measures currently being used to alleviate these conflicts are just akin to bandaging the wounds and not treating the root cause. I have learnt that elephants are considered an edge-species and the best environment for optimal habitat for whom is not an undisturbed mature forest, but a landscape mosaic of secondary and regenerating forest patches and open plains. This is something about which people have to be educated. We all say that there is an elephant menace. But, if we really understand why that is happening, I think it will change our reactions to what is happening. This explains why most of the elephants do not confine themselves to the reserves and constantly raid plantations, new settlements and chenas. In a lighter vein, it may be these same reasons that compel our two-legged types also to keep breaking out of their crowded party ranks and foraging in the ruling ranks where fodder is in plenty. Coming back to the subject, I believe that we have to take a more pragmatic look at the situation that faces us. I am aware of the many moves your Ministry is making to resolve this issue. Clearing of elephants from their areas of habitat by driving them away has been an ongoing exercise for ages and probably has contributed heavily to the decline of elephants in our country. In my view, it is a very controversial subject although culling is not an acceptable method of management both in terms of elephant conservation and our socio-cultural climate. Killing of raiding elephants by farmers which is a regular occurrence where hundreds of elephants die annually is, in fact, de facto culling. Where translocation, capture and domestication or capture and semi-captive management of such problem animals is not an option, elimination of the problem animals by official culling is probably a better and more humane alternative than a prolonged death from infected and festering wounds inflicted by gunshots and traps set by farmers. Good land-use planning that takes, where both people and elephant needs, into account is the only long-term solution as propounded by your experts and in my view, also the most practical approach. But, that is where we need to ensure that we do not create more frictions that could bring about other conflicts. I am aware that there is an issue in Pottuvil, at Karango Kandam area - the Hon. Rauff Hakeem also took up this issue - where land that had been cultivated over a

1459 1460

[ . . . ]

long period of time is being taken over as forest reserve. There is also a move to carve out an elephant corridor through this land, which could effectively deprive those who have been cultivating it of its use. You have to handle these issues very carefully. On a personal note, you have created an image of yourself as someone who is not too appreciative of other nationalities who belong to this country. This is the root cause of the problems you will face in the execution of your duties. I would like to table* for Hansard, an article written by one Dehigaha Kotuwegedera Abdul Latheef Mohamed Farook which might be of educative use to you. You are no longer just plain Patali Champika Ranawaka, but an Hon. Member of Parliament who is under oath to honour and uphold the Constitution of this country and a responsible member of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Government of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa. You cannot express your personal feelings on issues that challenge the description of the status of a citizen of this country and his rights as enshrined in the Constitution. Article 26 (1) of the Constitution very clearly states, I quote:

There shall be one status of citizenship known as the status of a citizen of Sri Lanka. Article 26 (3) of the Constitution states:

No distinction shall be drawn between citizens of Sri Lanka for any purpose by reference to the mode of acquisition of such status, as to whether acquired by descent or by virtue of registration. Every person is entitled to freedom of thought, conscience and religion and has a right to equality under Articles 10 and 12 of the Constitution. I would advise you as someone who is much older than you and has grown up as a proud Sri Lankan, to be mindful of your new status and that we should strive together towards the convergence of competing nationalities to forge a Sri Lankan identity rather than have a divergence of competing nationalities that has been the curse of this nation for so long. I have heard you frequently referring to all those who voted against this Government, as traitors. But, what you must remember is that in the year 1994, the ex-President, Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga won the election on a platform of peace. At the Parliamentary Election of 2001, 50.82 per cent of our people voted for peace. In the Parliamentary Election of 2004, 46.69 per cent voted for peace and even at the Presidential Election of 2005, 48.43 per cent voted for peace. It is to your credit

that today you have turned the majority towards war as a solution, the result of which we will enjoy or curse in the years to come. But, what is important is that just because we oppose the war or oppose the killing of people, that does not in anyway brand us as traitors. Thank you, Sir.

* : : Document tabled: With Champika Ranawaka and his JHU colleagues openly claiming that the country belongs to the Sinhala only, a question now being asked is: What is the Govts stand on this issue? By Dehigaha Kotuwegedera Abdul Latheef Mohamed Farook Our beautiful island Sri Lanka continues to bleed owing to the ethnic conflict created by politicians, who have used racism to win elections without thinking of the consequences. As a result we continue to lose precious lives. The islands limited resources, with this years earmarked defense budget exceeding Rs. 177 billion, which otherwise could have been utilized for economic and social development, are instead being wasted for the benefit of politicians, their side kicks and the merchants of death who thrive on our misery. While the countries in the region have been moving ahead under the globalized economic environment, our country has been stagnating because of this long drawn ethnic war. As a result Sri Lanka, a source of inspiration and role model for Third World countries during our Independence in 1948, has earned the sobriquet of a Killing field. India which was far behind us, is an emerging economic giant and even Maldives Islands which depended on Sri Lanka for almost everything, is enjoying a per capita income three times that of Sri Lanka. We have all the required qualifications to perform more than India and Maldives Islands, but our time, talent and resources have been wasted. Under the circumstance the entire population, Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims and all others, are praying and dreaming for the day when they could live in peace. Sinhala only claim In the midst of this, time and again Minister Champika Ranawaka and his JHU colleagues openly claim that this country belongs to the Sinhalese, and the Tamils and the Muslims should go to Tamil Nadu and Saudi Arabia respectively. What has the Sri Lankan Muslims got to do with Saudi Arabia which is only the land of Islam and the site of two of the three most important cities of Islam, Makkah and Madina? Minister Champikas latest claim is that, the Sinhalese are the only organic race of Sri Lanka. Other communities are all visitors to the country, whose arrival was never challenged out of the compassion of Buddhists. But they

* . Produced at end of speech.

2008 25 1461 1462

must not take this compassion for granted. The Muslims are here because our kings let them trade and the Tamils because they were allowed to take refuge when the Moguls were invading them in India. What is happening today is pure ingratitude on the part of these visitors. The question is who gave him the title deed of ownership to the island and the Sinhalese community? Is he speaking on behalf of the entire Sinhalese community? If so who gave him the mandate to do so? I am sure Minister Champika in no way represents the righteous Sinhalese community. Destructive This destructive ideology, in complete violation of Buddhist teachings, principles and values and the Sinhalese culture, is nothing but sheer racism which has all the potentials to beat the drum of communal discord and turn the country into a graveyard jeopardizing the lives of the future generations. Moreover is it realistic to export a quarter of the islands population? Hitler tried this on the Jews and failed. Now the Jews, with the backing of the entire West, have been trying on Palestinians for more than three quarter century without success. Isnt it time for Minister Champika learn a few lessons from history without fanning the flame of communal discord for petty political gains. If he cares to read his own history, Mahawamsa, he would realize that Sinhalese too came from India and we are all migrants settled down here during different periods. In fact the priest who wrote Mahawamsa was a Budhist monk from present day Tamil Nadu. So how can the JHU describe Muslims and Tamils who have been living here for more than one thousands years as visitors? In that case Sinhalse, Tamils, Muslims and all others should leave the country handing over the island to its rightful owners - Nagas, Yakas Veddas and others. After all human civilization began all over the world with migration of people for various reasons. I am sure he is aware that civilized countries provide citizenship to even those migrants who have lived for a brief period of ten years. The mere thought of ethnic cleansing of one fourth of the population demonstrates the outdated sick mindset which cannot fit into a modern world - especially in a multiracial, multireligious, multicultural and multilingual country like Sri Lanka. Cancer of racism It appears that the cancer of racism has spread to bureaucracy too with reports of indifference and discrimination. People still remember how the despicable and disgusting kidnapping of Muslim businessmen sent shockwaves throughout the community. In the East, Muslims who were mainly involved in trade, fishing, cultivation and farming complain of numerous problems. Restrictions on fishing, inaccessibility to their lands for cultivation and the decline in trade threaten their very livelihood. They complain that the liberation of the East has not brought any relief but, instead, replaced one set of oppression with another.

Citing an example they point out that the entire population of Mutur was a contented lot as farmers, fishermen and traders, with a literacy rate of 95 percent. They did not demand anything from the Government. All they wanted was to be left alone to live in peace. But the on going war destroyed Mutur and impacted adversely on the population as a whole. Do the Muslim Parliamentarians who, for all practical purposes, no more represent the Muslim community, subscribe to Minister Champikas views? They have not even raised any question about this, while the United National Party condemned it as violation of fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution. As a result the Muslims have drawn the inference that these Parliamentarians endorse the views of Minister Champika! They are being accused of being worried about their positions, powerless power, perks, prados, comforts and of sacrificing the interests of helpless and voiceless community. Govts views Meanwhile the Muslims are keen to know whether the Government subscribes to the JHUs views since they are constituent members of the Government, and supposed to be in its driving seat. Muslims have no problem with Sinhalese, or for that matter even with the Tmils, though the LTTE mercilessly massacred Eastern Muslims and drove the entire Northern Muslim population at gun point, turning them within hours into penniless refugees. If the Sinhalese have any problems with the Muslims on any issue these could be sorted out in a civilized manner thus helping to create a better understanding between the communities. This in fact is the need of the hour. It should be noted that around 70 per cent of the islands Muslims live below poverty line; ten per cent of them live in appalling conditions in refugee camps in and around Puttalam, while around five per cent of them have become refugees in their own homes in Mutur and Puttur. Their mood is one of deep frustration as in the case of the Eastern Muslims as a whole. The overall uncertainty and the gripping fear of the community remain the most talked about topic at almost every social gathering from wedding parties to funerals. Steadfast Yet Muslims have always been steadfast in their support to the territorial integrity of the island, and opposed separation. It was this policy that made them undergo immense sufferings in the hands of the LTTE. Despite all their sufferings, they remain a peaceful community, which prompted the Chief Justice Sarath N Silva to pay a rich tribute to them during the YMMA anniversary at Mahaweli Centre last June. Rather than provoking them, it is time therefore, to take measures to undo the injustices and give them hope for the future.

Enough is enough! Enough is enough, Minister Champika. we are all paying the price with blood, flesh, and lives, due to chauvinism and racism. For far too long, a small coterie of ruling elite who hijacked power since independence, has been exploiting religion and racism, in order to remain in or come to power. No Tamil or Muslim will ever leave this island. This is not what the silent majority of compassionate and peace loving Sinhalese want. Therefore, instead of provoking innocent people, please help unite communities and ensure peace and harmony to turn this country once again into a paradise. I am sure God will reward you and your colleagues. It is also time that the righteous and peace loving Sinhalese come forward to avert the rising trend of racism, and save the country.

You must adjust your fares accordingly. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

No, no, this is a budget airline. We have to sustain the airline. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

So, you must adjust your fares accordingly. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

That is where the issue lies. In order to adjust the fares, we must have a sustainable airline in our hands. We cannot just terminate it at the end of 12 months and say, Look here, now there is a loss and therefore, we cannot go on. There is no going back on these commerical ventures. You have to recoup- ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

It is at a standstill. You had to suspend your services for a couple of months as there were no funds. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

That is the very issue. That is why we have to subscribe sufficiently in terms of capital infusion to an airline or for that matter, for any other enterprise, you need capital infusion. You cannot just let them do it alone.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

Can Sri Lanka afford that ? ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

We can afford that. I will show you how we can afford that. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

Not millions, but here you are trying to put Rupees six billion into it with a luxury airliner. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

I am sure, if my learned Friend reads the forecast that has been prepared by Mihin Air in terms of monthly financial projections for another year beginning from December, 2008, he would find that it clearly gives how we are going to operate. All cost factors have been taken into account. That is why we are confident that we can carry this through. The investment is still, in my opinion, not adequate to sustain a wider operation. But, with the number of aircraft the current management is going to utilize, we could still sustain it, making a profit in due course and towards that, we are very much complemented by the lowering oil prices.

Did you allow the Auditor-General to audit the accounts? ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

Having held the chairmanship of the COPE, you and I both know how the Auditor-General has to deal with their accounts. Even the Sri Lankan Airlines is not under the Auditor-Generals purview. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

That is because of the Emirates. But, here Mihin Air is one hundred per cent funded by monies approved by Parliament. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

So, these are matters we can address in due course.

1483 1484

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

Why are you shy to allow the Auditor-General to audit the accounts? That is our cry. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

There is a department called the Department of Public Enterprises in the Treasury. They will take the responsibility for that. And, it is a matter for the Department of Public Enterprises to deal with. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

That is why previously Mihin Air crashed. There was no proper control; it was mismanaged. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

There was no crash in Mihin Air. It was only suspended for a while. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

If not, we will have to got to courts. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

In any event, if we kept on running it, you would have said that we accumulated the loss further and further. ( ) (The Presiding Member) . . ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

Bring it under parliamentary control. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

Definitely, you can always move that. But, the responsibility lies with the Department of Public Enterprises of the Treasury to subject any account of an enterprise to come within the Auditor-Generals purview. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

If you are beringing it before Parliament for approval, we want parlimentary control over it and the Auditor-General to audit the accounts.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

That is a matter you can address separately. Under this Vote, we are seeking approval from the House for a very justifiable cause - to set up a peoples airline. This is what you term a peoples airline. In the event we do not make way for such enterprises to come up, we will never be able to - ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

[. . 2.54] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera - Minister of Justice and Minister of Ports Development) Hon. Deputy Chairman, it gives me great pleasure to speak on the Votes of the Ministry of Ports and Aviation. The pleasure is heightened by the fact that this portfolio was once held by His Excellency the President - even more heightened by the fact that my Minister today is none other than the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa - and this may account for port development having a significant portion in the Mahinda Chintana. It is appropriate that the main portfolio is under the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa. Under the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa, a substantial work programme on port development is being undertaken, as I will be explaining in a moment. From the time of recorded history, that is from the days of Mahavamsa, ports have played an important part of the economic activity of Sri Lanka. In the earliest days, the ports in the Northern part of Sri Lanka, especially the Mantota Port, present day Mannar, was playing the role of todays Colombo Port. There is extensive evidence that Sri Lanka being a resource-rich country was part of the then global market, supplying high-valued items like gems, sandalwood and elephants. There is evidence of Sri Lankan products being available in Rome. Hannibal, in the first century BC, during the time of King Dutuge-mune, invaded Rome using elephants. These elephants were from Sri Lanka. They could only have been exported from Mantota. I can only imagine what the high technol-ogy was to load this bulk item. Never mind, that Hanni-bals elephant venture failed, as all elephant ventures have failed in this country. What has to be emphasized is that from time immemorial, Sri Lanka has been part of the globalized economy, an economy in which ports played an indispensable role. The world today has become one economy. World trade is increasing by 10 per cent a year. Producers go round the world searching for raw materials and manufac-tured sub-components which could be assembled and sold, mostly in the developed economy. We must be un-emotional. Twenty five per cent of global GDP is in the USA. Another 25 per cent is in the European Union. Ten per cent is in Japan. There is also China and India. It is a little-known fact that in the 2,000 years of human history, China was the richest country in the world for 1,800 years. It was only in the last two hundred years that she became poor, but no longer. With her 10 per cent average growth which continues despite the current crisis, she is growing and so is India. When the European impact was felt on India, she had a higher per capita income than Europe. India, with her 10 per cent growth, is rapidly re-gaining her prospertity. These are the centres of consump-tion to whom the world must sell.

Air transport is prohibitively expensive for bulk trans-port. The only economical means of transport is by sea. Sri Lanka is very favourably located on the sea lanes of the world, even better in Asia. The sea port locations in Asia are the Middle East, Sri Lanka, Singapore and Hong Kong. In South Asia, Sri Lanka has a favourable position. It could service both transiting ships as well as be a hub for South Asia for transshipment. I would draw the atten-tion of the House to the central role played by the Singa-pore Harbour in the development of the nation of Singa-pore. There is a ship entering or departing Singapore Har-bour every four seconds. It is the dream of His Excellency the President that the Port of Colombo be leveraged for it to perform such a central role in the economy of Sri Lanka. Accordingly, his vision is to consolidate Sri Lankas position as the premier maritime logistics centre in the Asian region. The details as to how this is to be achieved are in the report Performance 2008, Programme 2009 submitted to the House. For further development of the Colombo Harbour, sev-eral infrastructural investments have to be made. It is ex-pected that the capacity of the Colombo Harbour to han-dle incoming and outgoing traffic will be achieved by the end of 2011. A massive South Harbour Development Pro-ject has been commissioned with the ADB assistance and the participation of the private sector. It will, once in full operation, be treble the size of the existing Colombo Har-bour. I will invite the House to see the photographs on page 18 in the Sinhala and English versions, and on page 22 in the Tamil version of the Progress Report. It will have a breakwater, the length of which is almost seven kilometers, a distance from Fort to Wellawatte. The depth of the harbour basin will be 18 metres. , . . . [ ] , , . . , .

I wish to digress for a moment to discuss the Sethusamudram Project There is much uneducated speculation that the Sethusamudram Project will badly affect Colombo Harbour. This is furthest from the truth. The depth of its channel is 12 metres. Even if it is as-sumed that this depth could be maintained through very heavy and espensive dredging the boats that would transit the channel would be vallams and buggalows. These are certainly not the traffic that Colombo is seeking to attract. These vallams and buggalows will be using the transship-ment capability of the Colombo Harbour to relocate small shipments to the smaller coves of India. Sethusamudram should not be considered a competitor to Colombo. We should make it complementary to Colombo and strengthen Colombos vision of being a hub of South Asia. This is the way to be positive, take advantage of market opportunities for Sri Lankas benefit.

The worlds mercantile ships, in their search for eco-nomics of large-scale, are increasing in capacity. Todays technology permits ships of 16 to 18 metre capacity, to cross the worlds oceans. Recognizing the danger, the Suez Canal is being dredged and deepened to permit such ships to cross. Otherwise, these huge ships will use the Cape of Good Hope route to go across to Malacca and onto China and Japan, thus bypassing the Suez Canal and Sri Lanka. Let us hope that such an eventuality does not take place, though the pirates off Somalia are a worry. But, Sri Lanka in order to maintain its preeminence, has to provide for berthing these large capacity ships. This is exactly what the Colombo South Harbour Project is ex-pecting to do. This does not mean that the Government is concentrating only on developing Colombo Harbour. We have an active policy of diversification. Encouraging ar-eas which have comparative advantages, to maximize on their resource skills. Hambantota which probably was the landing point of the great flect of the Chinese Cheng Ho in the fifteenth century, had a history going back to Maha-vamsa days. Hambantota has now found a new role. Be-ing at the southernmost point of the land mass of the sub-continent of India, there is no land from this point to the Antartica. The heaviest used shipping lanes of the world, transit this region, being on the cross roads from Europe to East Asia, for example, China and Japan. His Excel-lency the President spotted a market opportunity, to pro-vide bunkering facilities to the ships crossing these sea lanes. A massive project was formulated to construct a harbour for bunkering provide storage tanks with facilities for blending and mixing and the associated infrastructural facilities. The progress is well on target and the project is expected to be operational by 2010. The Galle Port Development Project is also on track. This will provide two berths of 14 metre depth. The ob-jective is to meet the shippers needs outside Colombo Harbour. Work has started on the Oluvil Harbour Project. This will serve the needs of the agricultural region of the South East, whose produce find it difficult to have access to markets. Harbours do not merely provide facilities for shippers. They could be used as tools for national development. The Mahapola Training Institute of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority had a limited purpose, that of upgrading the skills of the workforce of the port. It had facilities which could give it a wider national function. Accodingly, under the direction of the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa, this institute will be developed into a wider vision, of eventu-ally becoming a Maritime University of Sri Lanka. By the end of this year, its first cohort of engineering students will start studies. Over the years, the curriculum will be widened and deepend to achieve the vision of being a Maritime University. One of the many tragedies of the open economy intro-duced by the UNP in 1977, was the collapse of the Sri Lankan mercantile fleet. This Collapse would have given the UNP much satisfaction because of its class association

2008 25 1501 1502

with comprador capitalism. If Sri Lanka does not have a national mercantile fleet, foreign capitalists increase prof-its and the effect on the country would be tragic. Because of the policy framework of Sirimavo Bandaranaike Gov-ernment of 1972, a Sri Lankan maritime fleet grew and by 1977, had 17 ocean-going ships roaming all over the world. This was made possible by the political direction of the late Hon. Kalugalla and administrative direction of Mr. P. B. Karandawala. A part of this policy was the es-tablishment of the Central Freight Bureau. Both the Cey-lon Shipping Corporation and the Central Freight Bureau exist in skeleton form today. It is the intention of the Gov-ernment to give these institutions a new life and a direc-tion as well. , . , , . ; . , COPE , . . ( ) (The Hon. Sunil Handunnetti) , - [ ] ( ) (The Hon.

Mr. Deputy Chairman, I am glad to follow my Friend, the Hon. Dilan Perera who has taken a few swipes at me as well in his hard - hitting speech. First of all, let me come to one issue he dealt with before I come to the prof-its of the Sri Lanka Pots Authority and the conflicting figures that he is supposed to have produced. May I talk about the Sethusamudram Project. The Hon. Dilan Perera says that there is absolutely no harm to this country be-cause the Sethusamudram Project - [Interruption.] In or-der to please India - [Interruption.] Everybody wants to be friendly with India. That is a different matter. But, the harm that the Sethusamudram Project would cause us economically, environmentally and in every other way is so immense that we need to talk about it. We need to be very forthright - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera)

Let us fully look at the positive side of it. Do not say, Manthram, manthram. There is no use of talking about that. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Whether India stops it or not is a different issue. If there is a change in government of Tamil Nadu in South India, it might happen This has become a pet project of the DMK government and, therefore, the Congress - led Centre is unable to resist the pressure. But, then the late Minister, the Hon. Kadirgamar was very forthright and he

2008 25 1505 1506

stood up for our rights, for our countrys benefit and we set up a joint committee to go into some of these matters. But, all of which has now gone into virtual hibernation in order to please our great neighbour. I do not think this Government is making much of a fuss about the serious impact the Sethusamudram Project is going to cause. Now, you are talking about the draft being only 12 metres. A 12 - metre draft is more than enough for all the feeder vessels to bypass Colombo. Deputy Minister, as you know, the biggest benefit that our Colombo port en-joys is that the feeder vessels from Indian ports are com-ing because our port is situated in a very strategic loca-tion and Indian containerization is so slow that we are able to benefit from all that and our hub status depends very much on the traffic that we are expecting from sev-eral ports in India. Now, all over the western coast and the eastern coast several ports are developing, developing at such a fast pace that we are going to be overtaken. We would become virtually redundant if this pace continues. What has happened to the South Port habour Project? [Interruption.] No, no. it is not my wish. We started all these projects. now you have been hibernating. The Con-cession Agreement of the Colombo South Terminal of the Colombo South Harbour has been surrounded with a to of controversy. As evident from the print media, there has been manipulation taking place to tailor - make the Re-quest for Proposals to suit a particular port operator. The Colombo South Terminal will be the life blood of the Port of Colombo if we are to sustain our position as a Maritime hub of south Asia. [Interruption.] Please let me finish. Whilst the Government has cancelled the original tender on the pretext of national interest, you have cancelled the tender on the pretext of national interest. So, what is this issue? I am expecting the Minister to answer when he gets up. You have finished you speech. The Government has cancelled the original tender on the pretext of national interest when it could have anyway incorporated the na-tional interest in the Concession Agreement. In the event the government fails to attract an offer which is above the bid placed by the port operator in the previous bid, the Minster would be accountable for the loss to the Govern-ment and the people. This is an issue that we have to look into. Now. you talked about the Oluvil Harbour Project. As the party leader who represents the Eastern Province elected from the Ampara District, I would say I am very Happy that the Minister has taken steps to implement the project. But, however, I see that there has been a re - ne-gotiation of the price. Originally, when we agreed with DANIDA, it was 33.3 million euros. Now it has shot up to 46 million euros. Why is such a large escalation of price being permitted by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority? Within two years. how can one - third the amount of the original price agreed be enhanced? And, definitely there is some-thing hanky - panky here and this also has to be replied as to why there was such a large price escalation that was permitted in the Oluvil Harbvour. In implementing the

project itself, there appears to be some strange things tak-ing place. The entire Oluvil area has become as if it is a big garrison, army camp. Virtually, loads, of army and STF personnel have come and landed in Oluvil and they are checking every citizen who passes by. I do not under-stand why you have to take such an attitude because there has been some dispute with some labour contractors. Ulti-mately, now the whole place has been turned into a virtual military camp. You can send all those soldiers to fight in the North rather than keeping them to guard Oluvil Port? And the adjacent Oluvil University is also another garri-son, full of STF personnel and police personnel. I see there is something absolutely fishy about the whole thing. Why do you not take the people into confidence? People are terrified. They feel that they do not want the port now. They feel as if this whole thing is going to result in losing all the freedom and the tranquility that was being enjoyed in the past. Now the whole area has been turned into a virtual military camp and I do not understand why this has to happen. In the meantime, talking of corruption, several em-ployees have been saying this. The Sri Lanka Ports Au-thority employees, if they are to get quarters they have to pay Rs. 150,000 to 200,000 to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Trade Union. This is not a secret. [Interruption.] There are several employees of the Ports Authority who would come and testify, but unfortunately, these fellows are so petrified that the moment they bring out all this, there will be some inquiry and they will be thrown out. Therefore, they are not prepared to talk, but this is common knowledge. That Sri Lanka freedom Party Trade Union office has not be paid Rs. 150,000 or 200,000 in order to get their quarters changed or allocated.
