(b) Will he state (i) whether the Batticaloa landing strip in cleared area was controlled by the Government;

(ii) if so, how the LTTE mortars were able to attack on the landed helicopter;

(iii) whether it is correct that the Deputy Inspector General Nimal Lewke had confirmed that aforesaid attack took place at 7.45 a.m. and 7.52 a.m. before the delegation landed;

(iv) if so, the reason for going further and landing; (v) whether it is correct that the helicopter was circling in the air for 20 minutes before landing; and (vi) as to what the investigation proven to date on this recent mishap of the foreign diplomats? (c) Will he also state (i) whether the Sunday Times, the Sunday Leader, the Nation, the Sunday Island news papers of 4th March 2007 stated that the Minister of Foreign Affairs had not been informed and the Minister of disaster Management and Human Rights must take the full responsibility of this incident; an (ii) if so, had he apologized to the Ambassadors concerned? (d) If not, why?

( )

( - ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila-Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs) Mr. Speaker, I answer the Question No. 1.

(a) Yes.

(b) (i) Yes.

(ii) It is well known that mortars can be launched from a distance, in this case an uncontrolled area, towards the controlled areas depending on the range of the mortars.

(iii) Not correct. The landing location came under attack only after the landing of the helicopter.

(iv) Not applicable.

(v) Yes, the landing was delayed until such time the security of the helipad was confirmed by Ground commander (STF) at Batticaloa.

(vi) It was reveled that LTTe has fired artillery towards Batticaloa town on that day.

(i) I did not make such a comment.

(ii) At a diplomatic briefing which was convened soon after the said incident, it was assured to the diplomatic commumity that the Government would take immediate measures to enhance security for embassies or international organizations that were to request such a stepping up of their security and expressed the commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka to the security of the diplomatic community.

(d) Does not arise.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Deputy Minister, would you be able to answer to this House as to how mortars had been fired in areas that had been cleared? A lot of noise had been made by the Government to that effect and that is what led the European Ambassadors to go to this area. When such a clearance had been given how is it that mortars had been fired? ( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila)

If you refer to my answer (b) (ii), it is a well-known fact that mortars can be fired from various distances and in this case also, it was fired from an uncontrolled area towards a controlled area. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Minister. The government says that the entire east has been cleared. ( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila) Are you now asking Supplementary Question No. 2?

1525 1526

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

No. Question No. 1. ( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila)

I just answered Supplementary Question No. 1. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Minister, do not hide behind the wrong answer You are a jovial Minister who answers even ten to twelve questions. Why are you getting stymied early in the morning? -[Interruption] That is why he is called Bhaila That is right. Hon, Minister, please answer this question from your brain and not from your heart How can mortars be fired from two. Three, four, five or ten kilo metres when you have said that the entire east has been cleared? So is it that it was fired from the sea or has it been fired from Tamil Nadu? From where was it fired? ( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila)

That is why I said that mortars can be fired from a distance depending on the range of the mortar. Therefore it has been fired from an un cleared area at that time. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Deputy Minister, it is incumbent on the Government to provide security to ambassadors whenever they go there. They were accompanied by a Cabinet Minister, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe. With him, nine ambassadors went to the East. What is the step taken after such an attack had taken place? What has the Government done? Have you found from where that attack came? Have you captured that bunker also and have you recaptured the East again. ( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila)

Again, if you could refer to my answer (b) (vi), we have mentioned there that investigations have revealed that the LTTE had fired artillery towards the Batticaloa town on that day. That was not from the Government controlled area. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

The American Ambassador says that in Batticaloa. The TMVP is having arms. Have you disarmed them?

Otherwise in future, during the election if there are mortar attacks on a polling booth, you will again say that mortar attacks and other attacks have been made by the LTTE. ( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila)

Hon. Speaker, that is not a part if the Question. The question he is asking [Interruption] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am asking what the American Ambassador said. This is related to foreign affairs. ( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila)

You will have to ask that from the American Ambassador. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

I cannot ask, the Hon. Minister [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila)

Third Supplementary Question, please. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

It is a pathetic display even in the morning. Can you not give a straight answer? We are in a convoluted situation. You will have to answer such question. ( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila)

We have given answers according to the Standing orders of Parliament. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Never mind, I hope the ambassadors are safe hereafter when they go there. : , : MINISTER OF PORTS AND AVIATION:OVERSEAS TRIPS 1645/07 2.

: , TENDERS FOR PETROLEUM EXPLORATION : STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF PETROLEUM AND PETROLEUM RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT . . . ( )

( . . . - , ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie - Minister of Petroleum and Petroleum Resources Development) Hon. Speaker, on the 7th of this month my good Friend, the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa, Member of Parliament raised questions and expressed views regarding petroleum exploration. Sir, let me answer his questions. I believe the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa, Member of Parliament, had not forgotten my suggestion to postpone the tender for oil exploration by another two months when he was delivering his speech at the Committee Stage of the last Budget in this House. However, when I discussed this matter with my officials, I was made to understand that

such a decision would negatively affect the Mannar Basin licensing round. We have given wide publicity to our oil exploration activities worldwide. Sri Lanka is a country which has never produced natural gas or oil before. Our current petroleum exploration activities will be in the offshore area. Further, we have called for tenders for a relatively small area of 12,000 square kilometres in three exploration blocks. However, by this time, six other countries, some of which are oil producing countries and attractive investors, have also called for tenders for oil exploration in a much bigger land area. I will now give you the information about those countries. With regard to the United Kingdom, the closing date of the tenders was 06.02.2008. The exploration block is a wider onshore area. With regard to Australia, the closing date of the tenders is 06.03.2008. The number of exploration blocks is eight. In the case of Angola, the closing date of the tenders is 13.03.2008. The number of exploration blocks is 10. With regard to the USA, the closing date of the tender is 19.03.2008. The exploration block is a wider offshore area. In the case of Barbados, the closing date of the tenders is 04.04.2008. The number of exploration blocks is 26. Then, with regard to India, the closing date of the tenders is 04.11.2008. The number of exploration blocks is 57. Hon. Speaker, you would also understand, when compared to other countries, the less importance of Sri Lanka's strategic positioning for the oil industry as a new entrant. Under this situation, the oil exploring companies in the world will give a higher priority to the other tenderers. The only advantage we had was that we were the early birds - our tender was closed earlier than that of the others. We would have lost that opportunity if we had postponed our bid round. As you may understand, if such a thing happened, it is very difficult to win back the confidence of the international oil companies. Considering all these factors, I requested for a date to meet the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa with my officials of the Ministry and the PRDS. I met him on 08.01.2008 in Parliament together with my officials. At that time, we discussed these matters. Having realized the facts elaborated by me and my officials, the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa did not insist on postponing the bid round. I informed him that I would initiate action to appoint a committee comprising of Members of Parliament to monitor the activities of petroleum exploration. This matter was further discussed at length at the Economic Council Meeting held on 25th January, 2008 chaired by His Excellency the President and after receiving the opinion and views of the Council Members, a clear directive was given by him to proceed with the tender as it is. Accordingly, the oil exploration tenders were opened on 31.01.2008. Hon. Speaker, my staff and I are operating the activities of petroleum exploration as per the provisions of the Petroleum Resources Act, No. 26 of 2003, which was

2008 21 1631 1632

passed by this House. We are working according to a time schedule to ensure uninterrupted and speedy delivery of work programmes. The Cabinet has already appointed a Negotiating Committee. The Cabinet has also granted approval for the appointment of a Technical Evaluation Committee to assist the CANC. The Cabinet of Ministers instructed me to appoint a few more experts in the field of petroleum exploration in addition to the persons whose names have been submitted to the Cabinet. I am looking for such qualified persons. I have already informed the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa to nominate an expert so that I could appoint him to the Committee. I also request the Hon. (Prof.)Tissa Vitharana, Minister of Science and Technology and the Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, Minister of Environment and Natural Resources to nominate suitable persons to be appointed to the Technical Evaluation Committee. The TEC appointed will study all the tenders and evaluate them. The results will then be submitted to the Cabinet-Appointed Negotiating Committee. Then the CANC will explore which company would bring most benefits to the country. The recommendations of the CANC will be submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers to make the final decision. I like very much if this Parliamentary Committee would continuously supervise and ensure that the legal procedures are properly followed and transparency maintained. That is why with due respect, I accepted the proposal made by the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa to appoint such a Committee. Also, I requested the Party Leaders to nominate Members from all parties to this Committee. Once again, I request you to nominate Members from the respective parties. Furthermore, when the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa raised a Question in Parliament on petroleum exploration in the Mannar Basin, I made a detailed submission to this House explaining the action taken by my Ministry in this regard. All actual facts were given in that report and it is kept in the Parliament library for perusal by anyone interested. Hon. Speaker, with great responsibility I state to this House that my Ministry has done all the work related to oil exploration with maximum transparency. You all know that most media criticize me. I was featured in many cartoons. But, I would like to cite an extract from the editorial of the "Daily News" of 2nd February, 2008. It states, I quote, We salute the Minister for maintaining transparency and accountability at every stage of the oil quest. This is essential for a massive project of this nature and there will be no room for any allegations. I hope that the commendation given by the media about our transparency is very important. I am requesting the Members of this House, media personnel, and the general public to be vigilant about our activities related to oil exploration.

We love our country and we are bound to do the utmost best for this country. I, with responsibility, emphatically state that we are committed to bring the maximum possible benefits to our country through oil exploration. Moreover, I expect direction and cooperation of His Excellency the President, the Cabinet of Ministers, the Members of this House, media personnel and all others in proceeding with this huge task. Also, all constructive criticism from the Members of this House is welcome as a guidance to our activities. I thank the Hon. Speaker and the Members of this House for your valuable time and patient hearing.

[.. 12.04] . . ( . . ) (The Hon. K. N. Choksy) Madam Chairperson, the fact that there are 11 Bills affecting finance, gives me the opportunity of making three points generally affecting the collection of revenue by means of taxes. These matters have occurred to me as a taxpayer over several years and later as Minister of Finance.

The very first public tax to collect revenue to finance governmental expenditure was Income Tax imposed in the 1930s. Since then, a large and varied number of taxes have been added from time to time to the system. The collection of these taxes is varied. The taxpayer is called upon to complete and submit returns relating to each of these different taxes at regular intervals. Payments have to be made at different points of time. Penalties are imposed for delay in making returns in due time and for delay in making payments. The system, as it exists, is hopelessly complicated. Particularly, the large number of smaller proprietary businesses that have sprung up find it difficult to keep pace with them. Apart from direct taxation, a host of indirect taxes have also crept into the system. Madam Chairperson, what is the result of this? I say, it is threefold. I shall identify them. Firstly, the taxpayer looks upon the existence of a large number of taxes as a nuisance in that, servicing them consumes time and effort which could well be saved and diverted to more gainful purposes. Secondly, collection by the authorities itself becomes complicated and delayed. Thirdly, in view of what I have just stated, the taxpayers look upon tax evasion as the easier path. It is therefore necessary to rationalize the system in order to overcome the three matters I have just referred to. Madam Chairperson, as Minister of Finance in the previous UNP regime, I did give attention to find a cure for the difficulties that have arisen and which I have just referred to. We reviewed the local scenario and examined the systems in other countries with economies similar to ours. The setting up of a single Revenue Authority appeared to be both the most efficient and paying manner in which to bring about a tax and revenue collecting system which would cause least trouble to the taxpayer and also to collect maximum revenue. The Revenue Authority which we contemplated was one which would be an apex body to coordinate the collection of all direct taxes, that is, income tax, customs and excise duties and VAT. There were undoubtedly obstacles that had to be cleared in setting up this Authority. Firstly, the requisite amendments to the existing laws. Secondly, those taxes which should survive and those which should be removed and done away with. Thirdly, simplifying the mode of collection and yet attaining maximum collection. And further, collecting the existing large arrears from defaulting taxpayers. It appears to me, Madam Chairperson, that we have now reached the stage when it is advisable to set up a Presidential Commission or a Committee which is mandated to examine and report on the matters which I have just spoken of. A time limit should be fixed for the completion of this work. The Commission should also report on the manner of collecting the existing arrears from defaulting taxpayers which runs into a very large sum of money. Perhaps, Madam Chairperson, it may be advisable to discuss these matters at the next meeting of the Consultative Committee on Finance and Planning and thereafter refer the same to this House for decision and further implementation. I thank you.

[ ] UNSG asked to send special envoy Q : IN January the Government of Sri Lanka has withdrawn from the Ceasefire Agreement. What can Europe and the world do? A: The international community must influence both parties to the conflict both parties to the conflict to seek a political solution and withdraw form the war which brings only suffering to the people. In the beginning of March a EU-Troika will travel to Sri Lanka. If the Sri Lankan government continues to insist on a military option. I will demand that the EU should withdraw the General System of Preference (GSP) offered to Sri Lanka. This concession enables Sri Lanka to export its goods and products to the EU at reduced or exempted tax and duty levies. This step will really bring economic pressure on the GoSL. For Sir Lanka a preference system plus is in place until the end of 2008 which however, requires good governance. It the EU continues to accept the present situation the plus is meaningless. The biggest portion of Sir Lankas exports consists of textile exports. Only garment product exports to the EU markets are valued at US S 1-2 billion annually. The other part is exported to the United States. It is also important to consult with the US which has also taken up a very critical position towards Sir Lanka in the past weeks. Q: And development cooperation? A: For the past two years we have not concluded any new agreements on cooperation as projects cannot be implemented due to the security situation. We are only engaged in completing what we have started earlier. We could make new agreement over *38 million, but we shall not do so at this point. Q: How should the United Nations act? A: It would be encouraging if the UN Security Council takes up this issue. However. It seems that it is difficult at the moment for the UN Security Council to act. However, what the UN Secretary General. Ban Ki Moon can do without a formal decision of the Security Councial is to send a special envoy to Sri Lanka. After the departure of the Norwegian monitors who were in place since the Ceasefire Agreement of 2002 there is nobody to document human rights violations. The war is how again in full swing. Q: Why has Sri Lanka failed to achieve peace after the tsunami of 2004 as it has happened in the Aceh Province of Indonesia? A: After the tsunami I had greater hopes of Sri Lanka achieving peace than in Indonesia. There were so many initiatives from people from around the world. But it turned out to be different. The reconstruction in Aceh is successful and there is a responsible government set up even in the province of Aceh. In the north and the east of Sri Lanka where many Tamils live we practically cannot further undertake development projects. I presume both parties to the conflict believe they can solve the conflict which continues from 1983 by military means. However, this is unrealistic. It will result only in more deaths numbering thousands. Since 1983 more than 75,000 lives have been lost in the fighting between the government and the LTTE. The LTTE considers itself as a freedom movement but the EU banned the LTTE as a terrorist organization almost two years ago. It is such a beautiful its people are very motivated. I feel a genuine responsibility for the people of this country. If the violence increases the international community has a responsibility to act. Q: Should tourists travel to Sri Lanka? A: It is up to the Federal Foreign Office of Germany to issue travel recommendations. However we are withdrawing half of the personnel working in development cooperation and we will close the office of the German Development Bank (Kreditanstalt fuer Wicderaufbau) because the very critical

( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) Yes, Hon. Srikantha. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) I do not propose to argue with you, Hon. Minister. But, you would agree with me that the crux of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case you have just referred to is that the merger of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces was not effected in accordance with the Constitution. That is the crux of the judgment. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) The procedure was wrong. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) That means, the Supreme Court did not give a ruling - . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) The Supreme Court has not adjudicated on - ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) What the Supreme Court said was that the amalgamation was illegal. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) Please, bear with me. The Supreme Court has not adjudicated on the propriety or for that matter, the legality of merging the North and the East or demerging them. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) No, no. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) The only issue that was adjudicated on was the manner in which it was effected. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) The procedure. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) The procedure that was followed in that matter - both the provinces were merged by virtue of a presidential

proclamation issued by the then President under the Emergency Regulations - was not in accordance with the law and more particularly, the Constitution. The main party of the Opposition - the United National Party - immediately thereafter volunteered to support the Government in the event the Government decided to go ahead with the merger as indicated by the Supreme Court. We are here to support you on that matter. You are prepared to bring in an amendment in accordance with the Constitution. You will have the necessary majority. Not by a two-thirds majority, but even by a simple majority you can do that. But what are you doing? You are proposing to go ahead with the demerged status. That is the issue now. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) No, we do not want to go against the Supreme Court judgment, Hon. Srikantha. We have to obey the Supreme Court judgement; we have to adhere to it. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) It is very convenient for you. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) Maybe or maybe not. It does not matter. But, we are not here to criticize that judgment. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) Furthermore, Hon. Minister, the Government is now talking much about the Thirteenth Amendment. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) Yes. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) But, what was the basis of it? What was the crucible - ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) What about your position with regard to - . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) Please, bear with me for a moment. - [Interruption.] Please, bear with me. What was the crucible, in which powers were sought to be devolved to the provinces

under the Thirteenth Amendment, meant to be in relation to the North-East? A merged North-East Province. You have knocked out the very bottom of the political agreement as envisaged by the Indo-Lanka Accord. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) No, no. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) This is a sinister campaign; this is a sinister attempt on your part. You are now talking about the Thirteenth Amendment. - [Interruption.] Please, bear with me. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) With the implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment, after one year, you have to go for a Referendum. That was postponed by a Presidential order. [Interruption.] . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) During the Premadasa regime, there was an All Party Conference. Thereafter, there was a Select Committee of Parliament headed by the Hon. Mangala Moonesinghe. Then, the President who succeeded, His Excellency D. B. Wijetunga, came out with political proposals. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) The Hon. Mangala Moonesinghe did not study about - . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) What was the meaning of all that? Now you are talking about the Thirteenth Amendment. ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella - Minister of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) Is it not political hypocrisy, Hon. Minister? ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) No, no.

. ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) Is it not political hypocrisy on your part? What are your proposals? Leave aside the LTTE. What are your proposals? ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) I think the merits and the demerits of the Supreme Court case should not be discussed here. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) Now you are going back. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) What is your position with regard to the Thirteenth Amendment? Tell me. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) I will answer you. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) Are you against the Thirteenth Amendment? . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) I will answer your question directly. If you go ahead with the implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment, we are not at all concerned about it for the simple reason - ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) Then, what are you concerned about? . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) I am coming to that, Hon. Minister. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) You are concerned about a separate State. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) I will come to that, Hon. Minister. Please, bear with me. That has been there in the Constitution for the last twenty years.

( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) But that was not implemented. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) What were you doing since 1994? ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) The Thirteenth Amendment was not fully implemented. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) Go ahead, we are not here to quarrel. Go ahead! But, that cannot be the solution. That is our position. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) Only 10 per cent of the Thirteenth Amendment was implemented. We are going to implement it 100 per cent. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) So, go ahead. We have no quarrel. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) Now what is your position? You are not prepared to - . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) Our position is that you have got to come out with a political solution going beyond the extended scope of the Thirteenth Amendment. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) This is a political solution. No, we will not go for a federal State. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) Please understand. You are a lawyer and you will understand. Please, do not pretend. Hon. Fernandopulle, please do not pretend. I know, you are a man of substance. You are arguing against your own conscience, I know that. Please, do understand that. Please, understand that.

( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) Hon. Srikantha, I know that you are against the Thirteenth Amendment. I know that you are against whatever proposal whichever Government, it may be, the UNP Government or the SLFP Government, brings. . . . ( ) ( . . . - , ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne - Minister of Power and Energy) They are against any amendment. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) You are against any amendment or any proposal, unless it is endorsed by those in Kilinochchi. - [Interruption.] . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) If the Tamil aspirations are fulfilled, we are prepared to tell the LTTE to give up their demand. I throw it as a political challenge. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) We also understand the Tamil aspirations. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Are you talking about the Tamil aspirations or the LTTE aspirations? Make a clear distinction between the two. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) If it can be solved within the framework of a united Sri Lanka, we will be readily telling the LTTE, Look, give up your Tamil Eelam demand. We are prepared to do that. I throw it as a challenge to you, a challenge to the Government. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) You do what the LTTE says. - [Interruption.] You are bound to accept what the LTTE says. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) We have fought the LTTE.

( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) That was long ago. You fought the LTTE when you were in the TELO. Now you are not a Member of the TELO. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) I am with the TELO. Still I am talking to you as a Member of the TELO, which is a constituent member of the larger Tamil National Alliance. Do not forget that. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) I know that. But now you are not fighting against the LTTE. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) Hon. Minister, the ball is in your court. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) You do not talk against the LTTE. My dear Friend, you are scared to talk against the LTTE. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) Why? ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) Why not? . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) I will tell you, we have opposed the LTTE time and again in the past. You know that. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) When? That was long ago; 20 years ago, not now. You are not a Member of Parliament of the TELO. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) Not now because of your failure; because of your hypocrisy; because of your racism; because of your stance in coming to grips with the reality. That is where we are.

1713 1714

( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) At that time, the TELO was not backed by the LTTE. The present TELO headed by you - [Interruption.] That is the problem. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) Come out with a proposal. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) We have come out with a proposal, which you are not prepared to accept. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) We would deal with the LTTE politically. I challenge you. Come out with a political package that would be satisfactory to the Tamil people. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne) Hon. Srikantha, all right, we accept your challenge. Say what happened to the Draft Constitution that was brought in the year 2000? All of you got together and did not allow us to even take a vote in the House. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) Yes. It was not even allowed to be discussed in the House. - [ Interruption.] . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne) Wait, wait. Let me speak. The UNP took it, tore it and expressed their disapproval. - [ Interruption.] At that time the Hon. Sampanthan was in the House. He did not utter a word in support of it. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) Even the UNP was against it. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne) That is right, the UNP was against it. The Hon. Sampanthan, who was in the House at that time, did not utter a word about that and that was very much beyond the Thirteenth Amendment. - [ Interruption.] Now we are bringing the Thirteenth Amendment because there is

nothing much we can do in the absence of a two-thirds majority. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Members, Order please! We have to get through eight Bills. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) Hon. Srikantha, as the Hon. Minister said, the year 2000 Draft Proposals were far beyond the Thirteenth Amendment, to which you did not agree. - [ Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) I think we must bring the Debate to a conclusion. ( ) (The Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle) We will finish it. We will stop. We will discuss this on some other day. , . . , 19 , 14 . , . . , . , . Question put, and agreed to.

, , , , GRAVE SITUATION FACED BY TAMIL CIVILIANS IN DISTRICTS OF VAVUNIYA, KILINOCHCHI, MANNAR AND MULLAITIVU . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Deputy Speaker, before I start, may I just mention this? Since we are starting this Debate ten minutes late, might we go on for one hour from now? ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Okay. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I have given notice of the following Motion to be taken up at the Adjournment

1741 1742

of the House today as a matter of urgent public importance. I move, A grave situation has arisen consequent to the extreme deprivations and hardships presently faced by the Tamil civilian population in the Districts of Vavuniya, Kilinochchi, Mannar and Mullaitivu and request that in order to alleviate the deprivations and hardships of the Tamil civilian population, the Government takes appropriate action in respect of particularly the following matters. (1) The distribution of items of food under the World Food Programme to 20,256 displaced families comprising of 76,148 persons in the Kilinochchi District though approved by the Ministry of Nation Building is not being implemented as such distribution is not permitted by the Joint Services Command of the armed forces or the armed forces at some level in the Kilinochchi District. A similar situation prevails in the Mullaitivu District. This has resulted in starvation and immense human suffering. (2) Essential medicines required for use in medical institutions in areas not under Government control in Mannar and Vavuniya Districts, though approved to be taken to such areas by the Commissioner-General of Essential Services, are not permitted to be taken by the Joint Services Command or by some level of the army command in the districts concerned. This has resulted in the civilian population in these areas being denied urgent medical treatment with grave consequences. (3) Vehicles of medical personnel, ambulances, vehicles of recognized international and national institutions and organizations engaged in providing urgent relief and services and vehicles of senior public officials like Government Agents should be permitted quick passage at the Medawachchiya checkpoint so that they have access without delay and difficulty to the civilian population affected by the conflict and are able to alleviate the deprivation and suffering of such people. (4) Medical personnel attached to Vavuniya and Mannar Districts should not be impeded in their free movement at the checkpoint at Medawachchiya. Such impediment to medical personnel has adverse consequences on persons requiring their services. (5) The termination of the train service between Vavuniya and Colombo causes immense difficulties to the civilian population and is a denial of the right to freedom of movement. The civilian population are consequently gravely inconvenienced." As regards the passage of vehicles at the Medawachchiya checkpoint, I am told that there has been some relaxation in regard to ambulances recently. I might mention, Sir, that as at mid December, 2007 the total number of displaced persons in the Northern Province was 247,917 which is approximately, 250,000 people, and that in the course of the conflict that has taken place subsequently in the rest of December, the month of January and the month of February 2008 we have every reason to conclude that the numbers would have increased considerably from the earlier figure of 250,000. Sir, in regard to food, there is starvation and human suffering. In regard to medicines, there is ill-health and even death caused consequent to the required medicines not being available.

2008 21

I may mention, Sir, that these matters which have caused much suffering, even death in some instances and much deprivation to the Tamil civilian population in these areas, constitute a serious violation of their basic human rights. And it is a violation by the State of the Covenants which have been ratified by the Sri Lankan State and which Covenants the Sri Lankan State is obliged to uphold and implement. The Sri Lankan State, Sir, cannot seek refuge and claim that these actions are being done by the armed forces at the level of these districts on the ground. It is my submission that the State is under a responsibility to ensure that food, medicine, access of relief workers and organizations in providing assistance and relief to persons affected by the conflict, movement of medical personnel, movement of vehicles to ensure the services and movement of other civilians and administrative staff required to ensure that the needs of the people in the area are addressed sufficiently is not in any way impeded by any agency of the Government. We have a duty, Sir, to bring these matters to the notice of the Government and request that appropriate action be taken to ensure that the civilian population are not denied of their basic human rights. These actions of the Government if persisted in, will result in not merely a violation of domestic law but it will also be a violation of international humanitarian law. I think, the Government should ensure that such violations do not continue because that would be unacceptable. In fact, the Co-chairs, Sir, recently in a statement has specifically stated that access must be made available freely to persons who are engaged in providing services and essentials to victims of the conflict and that there must not be any impediment to such services being freely available. I would therefore, appeal to the Government to ensure that appropriate action is taken to guarantee that food is made available in terms of the decision of the Ministry of Nation Building and under the World Food Programme to all persons who will be displaced by the conflict and that medicine is made available to institutions in uncleared areas for use by the civilian population at those institutions and that there is access available to medical personnel, civilians, officials and domestic national and international organizations engaged in providing relief to these persons in the areas affected by the conflict and that the Government also at the same time take early action to enable the reopening of the train service between Vavuniya and Colombo. The Motion will be seconded, Sir, by my Colleague, Hon. Annamalai Nadesu Sivasakthi. Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Annamalai Nadesu Sivasakthi) , , ,

Now, I have made a complaint that there is some problem in regard to the distribution of food, under the World Food Programme, to the displaced people in Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu. Similarly, there is a problem in regard to the distribution of medicines to the medical institutions in Mannar and Vavuniya. If there is such a problem, please sort it out. That is all I am saying. Please make sure that the people get food under the World Food Programme; please make sure that the medical institutions in Mannar and Vavuniya get the medicine as per the directions of the Commissioner-General of Essential Services. That is what we want. Please get that done. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Abeygunawardena) , . . . . . . . , . , . , . , . . , , . . , , . . , .
