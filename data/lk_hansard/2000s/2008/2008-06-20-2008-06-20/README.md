Hon. Minister you are not a stranger to Batticaloa. You have been in Batticaloa for some time in the 1970s or 1980s. You know the conditions of Batticaloa very well. I am well aware of the difficulties the Hon. Minister had in bringing this Bill to the House. We met in the Consultative Committee. It was argued several times and we were able to study this Bill. This is a very progressive Bill. It should have been introduced a little earlier, but however, you are very successful. Our congratulations to you, Hon. Minister. The second thing I want to say is that when I met you, Hon. Minister, sometime back, you called the Chairman and some of his officers and said, "I say, whenever necessary you consult the MP of the area". For that we are very thankful to you because in Batticaloa and especially in my electorate, we are putting up a big building costing about Rs. 102 million to house the Vocational Training Institute for the Paddiruppu Electorate.

I have to tell you, Hon. Minister, that with great difficulty I have found two acres of prime land in the Kaluwanchikudi Town. Normally we go for Crown lands, Government lands, but I was able to get two acres of prime land worth millions of rupees and we have handed over it to your Vocational Training Authority. Some of your officers were very helpful and the trustees of the Kaluwanchikudi Hindu Temple were also very helpful to us.

. ( . ) (The Hon. T. Kanagasabai) . Hon. Minister, you have a big responsibility on your shoulder. When we say vocational training, it is not only providing machinery, training in masonry, carpentry, in the field of electricity and all that but, even in hairdressing and laundering, we have to learn a lot of things. I have seen some booklets and pamphlets about how to iron

clothes, which say that the heat for certain clothes should be a certain number of degrees. On every job, every profession, a lot of research is being done. So, there is a lot of new knowledge to be gathered and that must be imparted to our people. We must make these people skilled; their skills must be improved. Another important thing is, as I said in Tamil, we must train the instructors and the instructors must train the people. They must be dedicated people; just training would not do. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees)

, . . ( . ) (The Hon. T. Kanagasabai) Training must be done; they must be found jobs. The end result should be jobs for them. Thank you, Sir. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) . 1.00 . , .. 1.00 [ ] .

Piyasena Gamage, Minister of Vocational and Technical Training, for introducing this vital and fundamental piece of legislation with which a University of Vocational Technology is to be set up in this country. This, in my view, Mr. Deputy Speaker, is some kind of a proletarian university; a university for certain segments of the working class of this country. This, in my view, is a

747 748

different kind of a university. It is very much different from the conventional universities in Sri Lanka and its purpose, as the Hon. Minister explained in the course of his speech in the morning, is to provide opportunities for those persons who have acquired technical and vocational training and education to obtain a higher educational qualification. Yet another purpose, Mr. Deputy Speaker, is to provide such persons with a qualification which is recognized in Sri Lanka as well as outside Sri Lanka. The idea is to produce persons with technical and vocational skills. There are skilled persons but they do not possess the recognized qualification in the particular field which could be marketed in a competitive world. In other words, though they have the required training they do not possess a marketable qualification.

In Part II of the Bill, the objectives of the University have been enlisted. I do not want to read them since all of them have been discussed by the Hon. Minister. It is at this stage that I need to draw your attention to some of the issues affecting university education in this country. Tertiary education in Sri Lanka, particularly in the initial phase, was confined to university education and the University of Ceylon which was established in 1942 remained the apex of the educational pyramid in the country because of which both technical and vocational education suffered. Both sectors did not receive the required recognition from the policy-makers as well as from the politicians. The situation began to undergo a change with changes in the process of economic and social development in this country. The country began to look for skilled personnel to accelerate the process of economic and social development. Though the Technical College was established in Sri Lanka in 1893, not much attention was paid to the expansion of opportunities for technical education in this country. As far as my memory goes, it was in the early 1950s and 1960s, that an attempt was made by the then Government to expand the opportunities for technical education in this country. Though certain steps were taken on the basis of the recommendations of the Technical Education Commission of 1963 to expand the opportunities for technical education, there was not much progress in the field of vocational education. It was included in the school curriculum but the system of education remained attuned to the scholastic education. Parents and students were interested in scholastic education. Both students and parents in their preferences and perceptions always thought in terms of scholastic attainments. This was a major impediment because of which it became difficult to motivate students to follow vocational courses till the establishment of technical colleges specializing in courses of craft and trade. Most of the students who entered such colleges, Mr. Deputy Speaker, were drop-outs at the G.C.E. (Ordinary Level) and the G.C.E. (Advanced Level) Examinations.

The perception of vocational education and preferences for it began to change with the employment opportunities abroad, especially with the opening of employment opportunities in the Middle-East. Technical Colleges began to conduct courses in vocational subjects and the country needed lower level technicians. In the last 20 years, the opportunities for technical and vocational education expanded, and today, there are a number of training colleges and training centres associated with different ministries. The public sector training institutions are handled by a number of organizations, and all of them, in my view, should come under one central organization. The relevant policy needs to be framed on the basis of the country's economic and social development requirements. The Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission (TVEC), is the apex body engaged in vocational education and training . Under this piece of legislation, Mr. Deputy Speaker, all institutions providing technical and vocational education are required to register with the TVEC. It is in relation to this that new policy initiatives are necessary to address such issues and I am sure the Hon. Minister is going to do this. The issues which need to be addressed are: the quality of training; high drop-out rates in the technical colleges; and the linkages with industry, which is very vital and fundamental. A linkage has to be established with the industry. The proposed new University of Vocational Technology could address these issues. Today, Mr. Deputy Speaker, the major problem within the technical education sector is the annual rate of drop-outs and this is related to, as I mentioned a little while ago, occupational aspirations of young people who prefer to get into white-collar jobs; they do not want to get into skilled jobs; they still prefer to get into white-collar jobs. This is the general perception among the student community in this country. Nearly 20 per cent of those who enter the system come within the category of drop-outs, and it could be attributed to the internal inefficiencies within the system which needs to be immediately corrected, if the technical colleges are to function efficiently and effectively for the development of the country. The aim of vocational training is to produce higher level technicians and they require a specific training. The higher level technician is the skilled worker and such persons should get an intermediate qualification and this kind of training can be given only by a vocational institution. The establishment of this Vocational University shows that the countrys level of development has been taken into consideration in formulating its objectives. Its objectives have been formulated on the basis of the level of development in the country. Education, especially in this sphere, could be treated as a

[ . . ]

2008 20 749 750

ticket for the workplace, a passport for the workplace. It is with such training that one can access the job market. That is one of the primary objectives - to access the job market. With the establishment of this University of Vocational Technology, Vocational Training is to become an important component of tertiary education in this country. In the past it was not so, it has never been treated as an important component of tertiary education. With the establishment of this university, it is to be given that kind of significance and that kind of recognition. It is only with such an institution that proper human and social capacity of the Sri Lankan State could be enhanced. Mr. Deputy Speaker, today most of the developing countries are of the view that the conventional model of the university is not suited to meet the multiple demands of economic and social development. This philosophy has been recognized today by many developing countries. The philosophy behind this strategy is to bring about a diversification of tertiary institutions, primarily with a view to meeting the growing social demand for higher education. In other words, the system needs to be made more responsive to the changing labour market needs. In addition to the established universities, the system needs to be diversified with the introduction of more and more tertiary institutions for the purpose of expanding access to higher education. The central problem in our own system, Mr. Deputy Speaker, is the question of access. We cannot provide places to all those students who aspire to get into the system. For instance, more than 210,000 students sit the Advanced Level Examination, out of which more than 100,000 qualify to enter the Universities in Sri Lanka and the annual intake is less than 20,000. This year we planned to take 19,650 students and now we have increased it to 20,203 students. This is all what we could take annually. This year, we propose to take 20,203 students and this is the major challenge facing us. It is enormous; it is an enormous challenge which needs to be met by realistic policies. We need to devise ways and means of improving access and this is why the system needs to be diversified. Distance Education and the concept of open learning are used to expand educational opportunities. The Open University which has done an excellent service, an excellent job, in the last 20 years is making use of the modern technology to provide access to talented youth of the country. It is only through the Distance Mode that access to higher educational opportunities could be widened and expanded. As I mentioned earlier, Mr. Deputy Speaker, the central problem in our higher education system is the question of access. Nearly 100,000 students are denied annually access to the conventional universities, but in fact, nearly 50,000 students are in different non-university tertiary institutions. They are in the private sector. The private institutions in different areas of academic lives are serving nearly 50,000 students. Therefore, the need of the hour is to find an alternative path to get a tertiary

qualification. Sri Lanka at this point of time has to ensure a more efficient use of its limited public resources to open up more opportunities for higher education. Non-university institutions need to be utilized to meet the demand for improved access to higher education and such institutions, in my view, Mr. Deputy Speaker, must provide opportunities for at least 40 per cent of those who are leaving the secondary schools. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, the time allotted to you is over. . . ( . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala) Can I have five more minutes, please? I was allotted 20 minutes. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You have been allotted 13 minutes. . . ( . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala) I cannot finish within 13 minutes. So, can you please give me five more minutes? ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) We will accommodate the written text of your speech in Hansard. . . ( . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala) Then, do you want me to wind up now? ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) No, you wind up in a couple of minutes. . . ( . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala) Okay. If Sri Lanka is interested in a development framework that can support knowledge-driven growth, it needs an expanded and inclusive system of education. In other words, we need a system that can reach a larger segment of the countrys population. The University of Vocational Technology would help us to reach a larger segment of the population because its focus is different. A National Vocational Qualification is to be awarded to craftsmen who are already in employment. A National Vocational Qualification framework has been established under which seven levels of qualifications have been recognized. The Hon. Minister of Vocational and Technical Training explained all these aspects in the

751 752

morning. There are four certificate courses, two diploma courses and one degree course. Competency standards for 64 occupations have been developed for the first time in the history of this country and the aim is to produce middle-level technicians. They are the people whom we need for the development of the country. It is through this scheme that craftsmen will have access to obtain middle-level technical qualifications. Therefore, this pertains to both the structure and the method and it has been tried in different countries, especially in Australia and Singapore this kind of experiment has been successfully tried. The changes in the training establishment could be brought about with the development of non-academic programmes in tertiary education. This is precisely the function of the University of Vocational Technology. The intermediate training programmes have had a tremendous impact on development in the industrialized world. They now account for large percentage of jobs. Today competency is defined as the ability to implement technical qualifications in a given professional environment. Concluding, Sir, I would like to say that the establishment of this university will not pave the way for privatization. That charge is only a slogan with which certain elements were trying to destabilize the universities. This university is a creditable attempt on the part of the Government to raise the level of technical education in this country and it, therefore, agrees with the educational ideas expounded in the "Mahinda Chintana".

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. M. M. Naoshaad)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem Hon. Presiding member, I think I am privileged to speak on this Bill as one who started life as a teacher and continued for six years and was in the private sector for 29 years of which, I think about 18 years was in a managerial position and having a different outlook towards vocational training. In this country, I think the Hon. Minister will admit, that vocational training has been downgraded in society. People feel, that to go to a technical college or to the vocational institutions in this country, is a demotion because when we talk of vocational training and technical education, we say that it is aimed at drop-outs, those who cannot enter university. So, the approach itself is not marketable. You are not marketing vocational training and technical education as something that you are proud to own.

We have so many institutes of vocational studies in this country. We have the VTA Centres. We have technical colleges. We have the SLIATE, the NAITA and colleges of technology. With all these, I feel that there is a lot of overlap. A student who wants to take on a vocation is not sure as to which route he should choose and he picks whatever he gets. I am sure, after the Mahaweli Project, the highest amount of foreign funding has been received for vocational education. Now, the question before us is, have we used this funding to benefit those who are jobless? We have got millions of rupees and I am sure, if all the Ministers who have been involved in education go into these statistics and analyse, we would have spent 70 to 80 per cent of that in administering all these different types of institutions we have for training and vocational studies. So, we need to change this approach. You do not choose a vocation because you do not have any other choice. You choose a vocation because you love it or you want to become what that vocation targets you to be.

So, now we talk of the NVQ, the National Vocational Qualification. There are seven levels in it. Level one is for a basic craft skill, a basic mason, a carpenter, a mechanic or whatever. Level two is for a craftsman who needs direct and regular supervision. Then, you come to level three. It is for a craftsman who needs vocational supervision and level four is for a craftsman who can work independently. Basically, these are craftsmen, people who work under supervision or who are managed by others. We must understand as to what they need to be a good craftsman. The first thing is that they need the right aptitude. Then, they need the right attitude. Otherwise, he will just be a mechanical robot, somebody who has got onto this field, because he has nothing else to do.

Today, the world market is abound with job opportunities. So, how do we prepare these four levels of craftsmen to gainfully seek employment overseas? What level of foreign language proficiency should they have? Would it not be better for somebody who is going to the Middle East to have a basic knowledge of spoken Arabic? Would it not be better for somebody who is going to Korea to be able to converse in the Korean language or for somebody who is going to Japan to converse in Japanese? We would look at it and say, No. Why should we teach a language to a baasunnehe? Because, the baasunnehe has to be supervised and he has to be told. So, for him to survive in this environment, he needs to understand what his superiors want of him. The next level is the fifth level which is the diploma level, NDT is aimed at supervisors. The sixth level is the highest diploma which is aimed at the managers.

Then, of course, the new level that we are talking of is the degree level. What do these people need? Do we give them the same thing, the same basic foundation as we give the craftsmen or do we take them to the next level? This approach will make this aim, which is a noble venture, successful. We should not do this just because we want to add on another university, another degree. No. We should do it so that we create a new brand of craftsmen or skilled people who are proud of calling themselves, Skilled people. If you go overseas, you find that there is no class distinction. Somebody who goes as a plumber, will go, get down from a Mercedes Benz in full suit, change his overall, do his work, collect his money and back into his original jacket.

( ) (The Presiding Member)

Hon. Member, you have only two more minutes.

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. M. M. Naoshaad)

I think a big problem that we have in this country is with regard to teachers. We need to find that. When we cannot find teachers, what we do is, we make those who pass out to be instructors. Then, look at the wages and the resources. In Samanthurai, there is a SLIATE branch which is functioning without a building. The Technical College has 30 acres of land. So, I call upon the Minister to make use of these 30 acres. We have a Technical College. We have a SLIATE branch. We have a VTA Centre which is coming up. We can put all together. I am sure that is an ideal site for a campus, not because it is my village, but it is the only place where there is spacious land. So, we need to take vocational training and technical education to a level where the people who want to become technicians would feel proud of. Thank you.

( . - ) (The Hon. P. Radhakrishnan - Deputy Minister of Vocational Training)

Mr. Presiding Member, I am very pleased and delighted to take part in todays Debate. My Minister, the Hon. Piyasena Gamage, conceived the idea of establishing a University of Vocational Technology. He conceived the idea, nursed it, laboured over that and today he has delivered it. I think he is the most happiest man today. Not only that, he has turned another leaf in the history of education in Sri Lanka. We are keeping pace with the moving world. Today, technical education has become one of the most important aspects of education. More than the traditional education,

technical education has become very important and it is a necessity. The world is moving fast. Technology is growing and the countries are developing at a very high speed. If you take for instance, developed countries like the USA, the UK, Europe, Germany, Japan and Singapore, they have been giving more importance to technical education from the beginning. If you take the figures available, 65 per cent of the population of the USA is technically qualified. The UK has a technically qualified population of more than 35 per cent. It is similar in the other said countries also. Our neighbouring country, India, which has shown a phenomenal growth in industry, now has a technically qualified population of 130 million. That is enormous. Therefore, my Minister has taken a step in the right direction in establishing this university. We have two classic examples. One is, a Minister, the Hon. P. Dayaratna, who spoke earlier. He never entered a university. He had only gone to the Technical College at Maradana and now he is a graduate. Similarly, there is another classic example. Professor Wijesekara, I suppose. He is also a product of the Technical College at Maradana and from there, he went overseas. He had been the Vice-Chancellor of the Open University, I think for more than nine years. Those are classic examples of how a person could obtain a degree or become a graduate without entering a proper university. So, this will open an avenue for so many people who cannot pursue higher education due to various reasons. This will open an avenue for them to enter this University of Vocational Technology and become graduates. I think every previous speaker mentioned about the global demand. Especially, the Hon (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne mentioned that the world needs more technically-qualified people to keep pace with the development. Now, our country is also developing fast. There are a lot of people who are setting up industries. I know there is a shortage of qualified technicians in this country too. So, we will have to produce them. It is the responsibility of our Ministry to produce more and more technically-qualified people. Our countrys economy is also transforming itself from an agriculture-based economy to an industrialized economy. To support that, our Ministry has to carry out various programmes to produce more and more technically-qualified people. Not only that, these qualifications give respectability and dignity to the persons who pass out from this institution. Various speakers have been mentioning about baasunnehes, carpenters, masons and various other people. When these people are equipped with a certificate, a diploma or any other NVQ qualification, they can be proud of that; they will be respected in the society. Therefore, what we are doing today is a most important thing. . 38 . , .
