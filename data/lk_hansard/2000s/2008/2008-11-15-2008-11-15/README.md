APPROPRIATION BILL, 2009 . [ 06] '' '' [ ] . . - [ 06] " [ ] . Order read for resuming Adjourned Debate on Question - [ 06th November ] "That the Bill be now read a Second time".- [His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa] Question again proposed.

[.. 10.05] ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa)

Hon. Speaker, at this critical and pivotal juncture in our nations political and economic history, I am pleased to have this opportunity to make a constructive and progressive contribution to the Debate on the annual Budget that has been presented to Parliament. When the winds of change have embraced and engulfed the democratic polity of the United States, as the economic minnows of yesterday are transforming themselves into hubs of economic prosperity of tomorrow, the plethora of innocent expectations of the people of Sri Lanka continue to be full of unrealized dreams and dashed hopes. As such, it was my sincere expectation that the present governing administration of our country would have the courage, the foresight and the determination to formulate a forward-looking Budget in order to fast-track the path to peace and prosperity for all Sri Lankans. But, what has actually taken place is a crude and overt attempt to hoodwink the people of our country into a false sense of belief and security that the glorious days of tomorrow will be realized by the obnoxious proposals presented in the Budget of 2008. Mr. Speaker, let me remind this House what President Abraham Lincoln once stated. I quote: You may fool all the people some of the time; you can even fool some of the people all the time; but you can't fool all of the people all the time. A careful and intricate examination of the prevailing economic conditions through a thorough analysis of the macroeconomic indicators and economic trends amply exemplifies the dire situation that Sri Lankans from all walks of life will endure in the short, medium and long term. Let me take up the pertinent indicators one by one to sustain my argument. In recent times, many politicians and economic analysts have extolled the virtues of high economic growth rates that our country has achieved.

Many have interpreted these figures as exhibiting the underlying economic strength of the family households of Sri Lanka. A more careful look at the figures illustrates a totally different picture which confirms the ever-expanding economic and social divide that is surreptitiously promoted through the existing economic path by the present rulers of our country. When we inspect the figures stated in the Household Income and Expenditure Survey of 2006/2007 conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics in a scrupulous manner, we find that while the richest 20 per cent of our society receive 53.8 per cent of income, the poorest 20 per cent receive a meagre 4.8 per cent of income. This anomaly, which I consider to be an unacceptable and profound abnormality and an incongruity that impacts on the society in a deleterious manner, has to be corrected sooner rather than later. The present Budget Proposals fail miserably to recognize this glaring shortcoming. There are no significant proposals in place that address this monumental aberration in a productive manner. If one is to assume that the economic growth rate in itself is an automatic cure for the economic ills of our country, let me remind this august Assembly that it was the UNP administration under the able leadership of the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe during the period 2002-2004 that propelled this country into achieving high rates of economic growth from a position of economic malaise and stagnation. If the underlying macroeconomic precepts and principles of the Ranil Wickremasinghe era were continued, our growth rate today would have far exceeded the double digit levels that are presently experienced by a larger number of States in India and India as a whole. Today, we see a lowering of our countrys growth projections in the Budget as a direct result of the inept and incompetent economic decision-making processes and the policy resultants of the present administration. Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to table* Chart 1 which denotes trends of economic growth rates of our country in recent times. When we look at the current inflation levels and trends in the recent past, the amateurishness and the clumsiness of government policy is further evident. The whole country is well aware of the fact that the prudent monetary policy of the Ranil Wickremasinghe era was instrumental in curtailing inflation levels and the cost of living, hence providing gigantic relief to millions of Sri Lankans. It was the sound policies of the Ranil Wickremasinghe administration that curtailed the sky-rocketing inflation levels that the country inherited form the PA administration in 2001. Inflation, which was at 14.9 per cent in November, 2001, was meticulously brought down to 2.5 per cent in March, 2004. In fact, at the beginning of 2004, Sri Lanka

had the rare distinction of experiencing zero inflation levels, which were unprecedented in the interdependent and interconnected world that we live in. Such record levels of inflation, which can actually be called "deflation", were achieved even in the phase of drastic price increases in petroleum products, which rose by 91 per cent during the 2001-2004 period. Mr. Speaker, there is an attempt by Government circles to state that there is a direct correlation between price increases in petroleum products and inflation. Once again, the figures that I possess exhibit that such a deduction is misleading and erroneous. Let me explain to you in further detail. I have statistics to point out that between November, 2001 and March, 2004 petroleum prices increased by 91 per cent. But, the inflation level came down during the same period from 14.9 to 2.5 per cent. During the period April, 2004 to February, 2005, the prices of petroleum products rose by 53 per cent. Inflation rose from 2.5 to 15.9 per cent. Between March, 2005 and March, 2006, the rise in the price of petroleum products was 26.8 per cent. However, inflation came down from 15.9 to 6.4 per cent. From April, 2006 to June, 2008 prices of petroleum products rose by 110 per cent. Inflation rose from 6.4 to 29.9 per cent. I would like to table* Chart 2 for the information of the Hon. Members of the House. The figures that I just depicted amply exemplify the fact that it would be utterly fallacious to link the rise in oil price to the increase in cost of living. It is time that the present defenders of the Government refrain from forwarding such bankrupt theories to justify the high level of inflation which certainly has a direct link to irresponsible and reckless printing of money and over-indulgence in deficit spending facilitated through excessive borrowings at exorbitant rates of interest. In other words, the spending binge on unproductive, wasteful and corrupt activities backed by an enthusiastic money printing frenzy has resulted in spiralling inflation and hence imposed unbearable economic hardship on the millions of common men and women of Sri Lanka. Hon. Speaker, at this time I would like to table* Chart 3 which denotes the inflation trends from 2000 to 2008 for the information of this House. How does this high inflation impact on the society? We all know that inflation has a detrimental impact on the purchasing power of people. The purchasing power of the people actually goes down. Also, the value of savings reduces. In addition to all that, the cost of production of the business sector goes up and our products lose price competitiveness. Merely changing the way inflation is calculated from CCPI to CCPI (N) will not suffice to control inflation. Once again it will be another futile exercise in misleading the Sri Lankan people.

Let me at this juncture give you a bit of historical background of the various economic models that have been followed by various regimes in the international arena. In the 1930s, we had the Keynesian economic demand management model which promoted deficit spending. However, with the failure of such a system in the 1980s and the1990s, the Monetarists theory, which was propounded by Milton Friedman, was used by various governmental leaders. But we all know, Sir, that we need to have a proper balance between the Keynesian model and the Monetarist model to have a successful system of economic governance.

If I may now turn to the key issue of unemployment which, at present stands at approximately 5.8 to 6 per cent, I cannot see any comprehensive effort on the part of the present administration to address this issue in an overarching manner. May I remind this House about the 200 Garment Factory Programme that was championed by the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa precisely to tackle this issue of unemployment. That was a concerted, focused approach to eradicate unemployment and bridge the urban-rural social and economic divide. He recognized the issue of youth unrest and disenchantment that is linked with the traditional political framework and the economic order. Consequently, with the launch of the revolutionary 200 Garment Factory Programme, a new industrial manufacturing metamorphosis commenced in our country. At that time, I must remind this House that this project was criticized as an utter failure. There were many an intellectual who claimed expertise and specialization in economics who rubbished this scheme, anointing it as a wasteful political project confined to hype and propaganda. His political detractors resorted to virulent, vituperative vilification of the scheme calling it a programme, To get our village boys and girls to stitch knickers for foreign women.

However, what is the present situation, the progress the garment trade has made to date? It has become the highest foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka earning US Dollars 3.2 billion annually. Presently 270,000 people - young girls and boys - are directly employed and another 700,00 are indirectly employed; a total of one million benefactors exist from this garment trade.

Let me once again remind you how world leaders acted at times of high unemployment. I want to remind this House how Margaret Thatcher in the late 1970s, during the winter of discontent, formulated the Enterprise Zone policy, the youth training scheme to tackle unemployment. Similarly, when the same problem occurred in the aftermath of the administration of Bush Snr. in the United States, President Clinton followed fiscal and monetary pragmatism to tackle the problem of unemployment. Similarly, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghes administration during the 2002-2004 period established the Yowun Senanka programme which gave new hope to the youth.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to present to this House a comparison of the jobs created between 2001 and 2004 by the UNF administration and the current UPFA administration. The Central Bank statistics show that during the 2001-2004 period, a total of 1,084,000 new jobs were created - 452,000 in the agricultural sector; 116,000 in the industrial sector and 516,000 in the service sector. Now, let us compare this with the jobs created under the Rata Perata" and the "Mahinda Chintana" programmes which commenced in 2004. Records show that during the 2004-2007 period, there was a total negative growth of 349,000 jobs. In the agricultural sector, we lost 273,000 jobs; in the industrial sector, we gained 185,000 jobs and in the service sector, we lost 261,000 jobs. So, we have a negative growth of 349,000 jobs during the Mahinda Chintana era. I would like to table* Charts 4 and 5 for the information of this House. Let me also quickly run through some of the salient issues pertaining to the economy. Let us look at the interest rates. This is one of the main tools of the monetary policy. However, presently the Government has embarked on utilizing high interest rates as a tool in controlling inflation. While this has succeeded in reducing inflation from 29 to 20 per cent or thereabouts, high interest rates have resulted in crowding out private investment. When the country was in economic doldrums in 2001, the interest rates were as high as 13.7 per cent. However, the then Ranil Wickremasinghe administration gradually brought it down to 7.24 per cent in 2004 creating a propitious environment for the inflow of valuable capital and resources into the country. Today, the interest rates are at 25 per cent and this is inimical to promoting private investment which is universally accepted as the engine of economic growth. I would like to table* Chart 6 which consists of the interest rates from 2001 to 2006 for the information of this House. Mr. Speaker, because of irresponsible money printing and excessive budget deficit spending, inflation has risen. Therefore we have high interest rates and now there is a crowding out effect on private investment. The Government is presently committing a cardinal sin in economic policy formulation. Why is promoting private investment so important when compared with public expenditure? I would like to table* Chart 7 for the information of this House which shows a distinct comparison in private investment and public investment. If we look at recent trends in public and private investments as a proportion of GNP, private investment has invariably made a larger contribution numbering 20 to 25 per cent of GNP compared with public investment which has never risen above 9 per cent and today it is around 6 to 7 per cent of GNP.

Let me reiterate that high interest rates are a disincentive to investment. Therefore, in order to spur economic growth and promote economic prosperity and therefore to reduce unemployment, low interest rates are an essential prerequisite for any economy with growth ambitions. This fact is amply illustrated by the substantial cuts in interest rates throughout the major economies in the world from the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Japan and South Korea in order to counter the impending global recession. Let us now look at the issue of foreign exchange reserves. Presently the status of foreign exchange reserves is precarious to say the least. Recent months have seen precipitous drop in foreign exchange reserves from US Dollars 3.4 billion in August to US Dollars 3.1 billion in September and US Dollars 2.6 billion in October. One of the main reasons for this is the Capital Flight" syndrome as markets and investors deem Sri Lanka as a high risk country to invest. Let me, at this juncture, table* Document 7.5 for the information of this House which gives an analysis the Citibank has done in recent times, as recent as last month on the precarious internal and international outlook of Sri Lanka. In addition, because the Central Bank is selling US Dollars to buy Sri Lankan Rupees in order to maintain the value of the rupee, devaluation has a direct impact on inflation and cost of living. This is also one of the reasons as to why our foreign exchange reserves are dwindling by the day. Mr. Speaker, it is essential to maintain currency stability. However, this should take place at a realistic currency value that does not have an adverse impact on export competitiveness and import costs. Apart from the underlying weaknesses in the macro economic indicators, there are grievous policy omissions in the Budget Proposals that do not bode well for the future of Sri Lanka. The GSP Plus issue is an impending economic and national disaster of enormous proportion, a volcano waiting to erupt. This facility bestowed upon us by the European Union provides Sri Lanka with preferential tariff-free access to the worlds largest market numbering US Dollars 16 trillion. The exponential rise in Sri Lankan exports to the European Union from US Dollars 1.3 billion to US Dollars 2.8 billion after the implementation of the GSP Plus scheme which is a clear indication of the immense value of the scheme to our country. In 2007 alone, Sri Lankas apparel exports to the EU amounted to Euro 1.1 billion. With the expiration of these concessions coming to fruition in a few months time, I believe the Government has completely mishandled and botched up the negotiation process with haphazard decision-making - a tendency the Government has excelled in displaying on a number of important occasions. Right at the inception there was high intensity ministerial conflict and bureaucratic wrangling as to who should get the credit if negotiations were successful. Ultimately, the policy

prescription prescribed by the Government amounted to a bailout package with one-off payment amounting to US Dollars 150 million in return for the Government obtaining redeemable preference shares in each company to the value of the investment. All I can say with great alacrity is the fact that the late Hon. Ranasinghe Premadasa would have handled this issue in a totally different manner. That would have been in the long-term interest of the industry and the country. The brain-drain issue continues to be an important policy issue that is consistently ignored by this Government. The possession of a highly skilled, capable, talented work force is an indispensable prerequisite to the functioning of a successful economy. As Sir Winston Churchill once observed 43 years ago, The empires of the future will be the empires of the mind. In guiding Singapore to its success, Lee Kuan Yew once stated, Trained talent is the yeast that transforms a society and makes it rise.

Statistical evidence with regard to brain-drain paints a sorry picture as far as Sri Lanka is concerned. According to the figures of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment, 1,541 professional workers left the country in 2003 and this figure rose to 2,678 in 2005. Between 2003 and 2005, 45,590 skilled workers have left the country. Presently 50 per cent of the 1,969 CIMA-SL members are working overseas. Out of the 120 management accountants Sri Lanka produces annually, 60 accountants leave the country annually in search of more lucrative opportunities and greener pastures. What policy prescription has the Government designed to address this fundamental issue of national importance? What innovative steps have they taken to ameliorate the situation without further exacerbation? Mr. Speaker, I am lost in a labyrinth in searching for answers for such paramount issues of national interest. There is universal acceptance within the global community that providing support to sustain high nutritional standards especially amongst the most vulnerable sectors of our society - that is infants, mothers and children - is of superlative importance if a country is to succeed and prosper. Here again, statistics indicate the persistence of acute and chronic malnutrition among the vulnerable sectors in Sri Lanka. As far as children are concerned, let us look at the figures relevant to stunting, wasting and underweight. Let me table* Chart 8 for the information of this House. If you look at children under five-years old, the percentage of stunting is 18 per cent. The percentage with regard to underweight is 21.6 per cent. The percentage with regard to wasting is 15 per cent. In Sri Lanka low birth weight problem is suffered by 17 per cent of the children. When you look at the maternal nutrition among mothers who are 15 to 49 years, the underweight problem is 30 per cent among mothers and anaemia problem is 30 per cent among all mothers. Anaemia among children aged 6 to 11 months amounts to 58 per cent and anaemia among children from 12 to 23 months amounts to 38 per

cent. Under these circumstances, why has the Government failed to formulate and implement a comprehensive integrated National Nutrition Policy? I do understand that a National Nutrition Policy has been discussed for over three years and I have a copy of that document which I will table* for the information of this House. But yet the Government has been unable to put forth such a policy document as Government policy.

Mr. Speaker, when the nutritional status of the governors of this country is at an all time high, is it not time that the Government paid due attention to the nutritional needs of those who are governed? Mr. Speaker, poverty alleviation is a national priority that I consider to be sacrosanct and inviolable. The Samurdhi programme that has been apparently designed to achieve this objective, I believe is a dismal and an absolute failure. Extreme politicization, waste and corruption have made this programme a national liability. The measly amounts that are dished out to the poor in the form of Samurdhi stamps are totally and woefully inadequate in providing adequate resources to the target groups to overcome poverty. The inefficiency and the wastage is amply exemplified when figures show that sums spent on stamps are lower than funds allocated for running the programme. That is in terms of recurrent expenditure and expenditure on Samurdhi stamps. I would like to table* Chart 9, which illustrates this fact for the information of this House.

Therefore, there is a clear need for a more strong and vibrant poverty alleviation strategy that provides more resources to the hands of the poor in order to overcome poverty rather than the miniscule amounts that certainly contribute to sustaining poverty rather than its eradication. Mr. Speaker, now I would like to focus my attention on Sri Lankas Information and Communication Technology policy which is often talked about by most politicians on political and electoral platforms. When one examines the record of the Government in this field, there is a visible disparity in rhetoric and reality. When our neighbour and friend India has made significant strides in the ICT arena - where the ICT industry grew to US Dollars 51 billion in 2006/2007 - Sri Lanka continues to vacillate and hesitate to take the next great leap forward. When States such as Karnataka with nearly 2000 IT firms including Wipro, Infosys, and Microsoft operational as of 2007 contributed US Dollars 12.5 billion in 2006 - 2007 to the Indian Information Technology export total, the Mahawillachchiya Project initiated - thanks to the individual brilliance of a private individual - is the only flagship programme that the Government can boast about in terms of ICT advancement in rural Sri Lanka.

His Excellency the President, Mahinda Rajapaksa in this year's Independence Day speech claimed that Sri Lanka has attained 25 per cent computer literacy. But the figures provided by the Department of Census and Statistics clearly show that computer literacy has increased only from 9.7 per cent in 2004 to 16.1 per cent in 2006 - 2007.

The DCS survey also asserts that 46.9 per cent of Sri Lankan households cannot afford to purchase a computer. How imaginative and constructive it would be if the Government introduced a subsidized scheme for computer purchases and the expansion of computer literacy projects instead of allocating billions of rupees to re-ignite failed ventures such as Mihin Lanka?

Similarly, DCS figures show that there is a visible geographical bias in the little progress that has taken place in ICT development in Sri Lanka.

A distinct digital divide has taken place which has to be addressed through direct Government intervention and through the promotion of private/public partnership projects. I would like to table* Chart 10 which denotes these facts. Mr. Speaker, let me present some stark statistics to prove my point. Today, while 17.9 per cent of urban households own a computer, the comparative figure for rural areas is 6.9 per cent, and it is 1.1 per cent in the estate sector. Mr. Speaker, in the whole of Sri Lanka, 8.2 per cent of all households have a computer. But when we extrapolate these figures, 16.4 per cent of such households are located in the Western Province. But the comparative figures for Uva is 2.7 per cent. The comparative figures for North Central Province is 2.7 per cent. Mr. Speaker, 5.7 per cent of the households in the Western Province have internet facilities. However, when we take all the other provinces of the country together, the figure is less than 1.5 per cent. Considering the above stated facts I believe it would have been more fruitful to have a national programme of upgrading ICT infrastructure facilities throughout Sri Lanka and the setting up of ICT institutes of international repute at district levels rather than squandering billions on wasteful inefficient pet projects. Furthermore, the Government should take a keen interest in upgrading ICT infrastructure on a national scale. For example, India has set up its own institutions like the Indian Institute of Technology and the Indian Institute of Management. Likewise, we can set up our own institutions. We should learn how to promote the BPO - Business Process Outsourcing - sector, and there are many lessons to learn in this regard from the different States of India. Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and even Tamil Nadu are excellent examples for Sri Lanka to

follow. I would like to table* the Information and Communication Technology Policy documents of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu for the information of this House. When we examine these documents, we see extreme incentives, tax reliefs, tax rebates, administrative support, land concessions, financial support and low-interest loans that are provided by the State to support the ICT sector. When we look at cost competitiveness, Sri Lanka lags behind. Let us look at two examples. If we are to get a 2mbps 100-kilometre leased line, the cost in Sri Lanka is US Dollars 6,350 per annum, the comparative cost in India is a measly US Dollars 3,423 per annum. If we look at a 2Mbps two-kilometre leased line, the cost in Sri Lanka is US Dollars 3,249 per annum, the Indian figure is a measly US Dollars 330 per annum. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, it is obvious to any lay person that the current administration has totally ignored the external economic and political environment prevailing globally in formulating its economic policy. As a responsible and an accountable administration, it should have taken into account the impending global meltdown with has been aptly called, Once in a Century Economic Tsunami by Allan Greenspan, the former Chairman of the US Federal Reserve. It is my humble premise that Sri Lankas economy is in dire straits. Due to the ineptness, maladministration and inability of the Government to look beyond political gimmickry and embark on a pathbreaking voyage to correct fundamental structural imbalances pervading the economic strata, there is bound to be prodigious detrimental impacts on the silent majority of Sri Lanka. If one dares to question whether the situation is redeemable, the frank answer to that is Of course it is possible. However, it would take a paradigmatic shift in the design, structure and substance of public policy to achieve this monumental task. As Martin Luther King once stated, The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy. This is the time that Sri Lanka needs innovative, pioneering, imaginative, groundbreaking leadership to guide this country out of this economic and social quagmire. The UNP, astutely led by the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe and its enlightened membership, is willing to bear any burden, to pay any price, meet any hardship, support any friend and oppose any foe to bring about prosperity and economic advancement to all Sri Lankans. Mr. Speaker, to use former President John F. Kennedys words, We stand today on the edge of a new frontier, a frontier of unknown opportunities and perils, a frontier of unfulfilled hopes and threats." Let all of us combine our efforts to try to do our utmost to save our Motherland from despotism, nepotism, corruption, tyranny, economic and social cataclysm. I thank you.

[.. 10.39] ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama - Minister of Enterprise Development and Investment Promotion)

Hon. Speaker, I am very fond of the previous speaker, the Hon. Sajith Premadasa whom I have known from his young days. But, I strongly advise him to change his speech writer because in his speech there were so many contradictory statements that at the end of it, one does not know which part of the economic prescription we should adopt. But I must also ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa)

Can I explain, Hon. Minister? ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

No, I do not have much time. I will explain. Now, I want to point out a few examples of this type of contradictory approach in his speech though I must compliment him on the latter part of it when he was talk-ing about IT and the very necessary growth in that area.

Now, Sir, he spoke about inflation. I want to remind my good Friend that the highest recorded inflation in Sri Lanka was in during the 1977-1979 period when the late Mr. J.R. Jayewardene was the President and his beloved father was the Prime Minister of this country. So, we have to look at inflation in terms of many factors, not merely the digital divide, as my good Friend, the Hon. Sajith Premadasa mentioned. Sir, I want to tell you, as far as we are concerned, - [Interruption.] I know. That is why I am being sarcastic. Do not provoke me because I am trying to be nice to you. I am entitled to be sarcastic in my speech. Sir, today in my speech I want to deal with all the criticisms that were made on this Budget. I have recorded that and I am going to answer each and every one of those questions. Sir, let me take up the question of inflation. The fact of the matter is that during 1977-1978, there were exter-nal factors which led to high inflation; for example, the devaluation. The very realistic devaluation of the rupee was one of the first acts of the 1977 Government which got a more realistic rupee rate for the dollar at that time. Before that, we had what was called the FEEC scheme, a very realistic and a very laudable step though it led to high inflation. Now, look at the situation in Sri Lanka. If

1285 1286

you look at the Colombo Consumer Price Index for the month of October, it has now come down from 28.2 to 20. 2 per cent and by 2009 or 2010, we hope to go for a single digit inflation. -[Interruption.] Please, do not in-terrupt me. Now, part of the inflation, as my good Friend, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake will know - as he knows these things much better - is what is called ex-ternally induced inflation. When you have very high pe-troleum prices, when you have very high food prices, naturally it impacts on local prices, on the consumer index and it is registered by way of high inflation. That is quite normal. Due to the global downturn, commodity prices are coming down and I will explain in answer to some of your questions, how this will lead to the lowering of prices, particularly in the food and agricultural sector. So, in addition to the monetary policy, there are external factors which will help us to bring down inflation as we go along. [Interruption.] No, you cannot. Sir, I am so confident that by the middle of next year, there will be a very strong deceleration process as far as inflation is concerned; we have already come down from 28 to 20 per cent. So, that is a matter which is under discussion and has to be examined not only in terms of local factors but also external factors. Earlier, the external factor was disadvantageous to us; there was high inflation and now when there is deceleration of growth in the West, when commodity prices are tum-bling down, it is quite possible for us to reduce the infla-tion rate in this country. That is quite normal. That is happening everywhere. So, please, do now come here and read out something written by people who do not know what is going on. - [Interruption.] You may take objection but let me go on.

[.. 12.22] . . ( ) ( .. - , ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of Export Development and International Trade) Mr. Presiding Member, the Hon. Sajith Premadasa opening the Debate on behalf of the Opposition this morning made the criticism that this was not a Budget that addressed the issue of social equity. I think that is the opposite of the truth, Mr. Presiding Member. It is conceded by everyone that this Budget has been introduced under exceedingly difficult circumstances which have been brought about principally by developments which have occurred with regard to the global economy. In that situation, the essential ingredient of the Budget I would suggest is a sense of balance. It is necessary to take into account the different priorities which should govern the formulation of monetary and fiscal policy in this country and to endeavour to strike a balance among these different components. If you ask me, Sir, what I regard as the central theme underpinning this Budget, I would say that it is an emphasis on development, on production, but not as an absolute objective that has been tampered at every point by reference to welfare measures and issues that have to do with social equity. Production today undoubtedly is the need of the hour and the central feature of this Budget is the emphasis that it has given to the development of local industry, local agriculture and the stimulation of local production. This has been attempted by a variety of methods. One of the means employed has been the tariffs and the duties that have been imposed on imported items like wheat flour, furniture, sugar, salt and so on. The levies have been increased. This does not mean that there is a total ban on these goods; they simply become more expensive, in the sense that there is a disincentive. Now, the principal criticism which has been levelled against this measure by the Opposition is that it would lead to an increase in the cost of living. The Opposition has said that these measures will be appropriate only after a very high threshold has been reached in respect of the development of local agriculture, local industry and local manufacturing. In other words the Opposition is saying, You do that first. You achieve this very high level of development and it is only at that point that it would be justifiable to consider the imposition of these import tariffs and levies. I would like to say that that is a totally impractical policy. If we are to wait until that happens, then we would have to wait for ever. If foreign goods are allowed to come into this country without any restrictions, if they are freely available, then there is no incentive for local production. If there has to be local production at the level that we desire, then there has to be substantial investment. Local entrepreneurs must be enthused. They must be motivated to contribute to the increase of local production in a substantial manner. That will not happen

[ ]

2008 15 1315 1316

until and unless some measures are taken in order to impose a disincentive with regard to the inflow of foreign goods. I would like, Sir, with your permission to give you an example from my own experience, not in politics, but in academic life as a teacher of law. When I returned with my doctorate from the University of Oxford in 1971 and I was a junior lecturer in the Faculty of Law of the University of Colombo, a decision was made by the then government headed by the late Prime Minister, the Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike, to begin for the first time, teaching in the Faculty of Law in Sinhala and Tamil. Up to that time, instruction in the Faculty of Law was available only in English. It was during the period of the late Prime Minister (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike that the decision was made to switch over to Sinhala and Tamil. My very distinguished predecessor in the post of Professor of Law in that University, the late Prof. T. Nadarajah, went before the then Government together with the senior staff and made a very fervent appeal to the Government not to implement this decision. The argument was that there would inevitably be a decline in standards if instruction was begun in the Sinhala and Tamil languages without sufficient literature being available to students in those media. Professor Nadarajah very strongly argued, Produce the literature first. Let there be enough books on the laws of this country in Sinhala and Tamil and it is only when this literature is available that the university should begin teaching law in the Sinhala and Tamil languages . The Hon. (Dr.) Al-Haj Badiuddin Mahmud, the Minister of Education in that government rejected that argument. He explained that that would not be a practical way of setting about it. The then government told the Faculty of Law that "Necessity is the Mother of Invention". You begin teaching in Sinhala; you begin teaching in Tamil and the literature will appear. But, if you say that you will make the switch over only after the literature has appeared, then there will never be sufficient stimulus for the production of literature in the national languages. Mr. Presiding Member, that proved exactly correct because over time, literature did appear and students from rural backgrounds who entered the portals of the Faculty of Law were able to read law and to graduate in their own language. My own books were translated into Sinhala. So, this happened because of a very prudent and timely decision that was made by the then government at that time. I think, Sir, there is a definite analogy; there is a parallel here. We cannot wait without doing anything in respect of imports. I think these things have to go parallel and that is what this Budget has done. I would also like to emphasize, Sir, that His Excellency the President, in his capacity as Minister of Finance and Planning, presenting this Budget did not stop at the point of imposing disincentives with regard to the import of foreign goods. There have been very significant measures incorporated into this Budget in

order to stimulate local production. There was a theory sometime ago that was supported by economists at the time that all you need to concentrate on is the growth of the economy. If you concentrate on growth, then all sections of the community will automatically benefit. That is not the prevailing view. Today it is accepted, particularly in countries of South Asia, that mere growth per se will not result in adequate percolation of benefits down to the grass-roots level. There has to be active intervention on the part of the State; there has to be affirmative action. That is exactly what His Excellency the President has endeavoured to do in the Budget Speech which he made in this august Assembly on the 6th of November. We are proud of the fact, Sir, that the per capita income of our country is today at the level of approximately US Dollars 1,630. That puts us ahead even of countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. Apart from the Maldives, Sri Lanka is a country that enjoys the highest per capita income among all the SAARC nations. That is a considerable achievement, but there is no room for complacency. The Government is very concerned to ensure that the fruits of this development reach the rural areas of this country. It is necessary that the disparities, the differences with regard to income and resources between Colombo and the environs, on the one hand, and the remoter regions of the Island on the other, must be reduced. That will not automatically happen. It has to be done as a matter of conscious and deliberate policy. So, that is the role of State intervention in order to accomplish these objectives. One of the main instruments through which this objective is sought to be attained, Sir, are the agro-villages which are being established in different parts of the country. This has received quite legitimately and justifiably a very sharp focus in the Budget. His Excellency the President has allocated Rs. 500 million directly to the Export Development Board in order to strengthen these export promotion villages. We have a very successful project with regard to the production of fruits and vegetables in Tambuttegama in the Anuradhapura District. Aquarium fish projects are very popular in Polonnaruwa. In the Coconut Triangle - Chilaw, Kurunegala and Negombo - we are emphasizing coir related projects. Naturally in the Sabaragamuwa region, in the Ratnapura District in particular, priority is given to the gem and jewellery industry. In Galle, we are concentrating on beeralu lace and kiri ala. In Ambilipitiya and Kollonna, we are involved with a variety of projects which have to do with plantains and juggery. So, to support these projects and to ensure that economic and social conditions in the rural sector are uplifted, there has been conscious intervention on the part of the State and that is one of the themes pervading this Budget. I would also like to deal with some of the other criticisms which have been made. Sir, the Hon. Sajith Premadasa referred to the question of social equity. But

1317 1318

there is unimpeachable evidence from sources such as the International Monetary Fund that the alleviation of poverty has seen very considerable progress during the last few years. According to the International Monetary Fund, poverty has been reduced from approximately 22 per cent to about 15 per cent. There has also been an emphasis on providing relief to those segments of the community which are most in need of that relief. In these difficult circumstances, there has to be an identification of priorities. But, I think that some of the hardest-hit sections of the community today are, for example, the pensioners and those who live on interest income. This Budget provides very substantial relief to as many as 500,000 pensioners and those who live on interest income are also benefited to a very considerable extent because the concessionary rate of 2.5 per cent tax, which was available up to now up to the threshold of only Rs. 600,000 a year as annual income, has now been increased to Rupees one million. So, these are measures which reflect a certain spirit of social empathy and that is one of the ingredients of the Budget. There has also been some criticism, Sir, that because of the dramatic fall in oil prices in the world market, more concessions could have been made available to the public. I do not think that that is a criticism which is rationally defensible. In that case, we have to adopt the formula that price determination in this country with regard to fuel will automatically depend on the prevailing world market prices. Is that acceptable? Is that a policy that will benefit the people of our country? We have to remember, Sir, that in July this year the price of oil went up to US Dollars 147 per barrel in the world market. Are we then prepared to hand over the entirety of that burden to the consumer? That is simply not a pragmatic policy. It is not a policy which has been followed in India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan or in any country of this region. There has to be a cushion which we provide for the consumer. This applies not only to oil, but it also applies to fertilizer. There is a very considerable subsidy that farmers in this country enjoy in respect of the use of fertilizer. The Government is providing a 50 kilogram bag of fertilizer to the farmer at Rs. 350. At the time, Sir, this Rs. 350 price was determined, the world market price of fertilizer was Rs. 950. Subsequently, the world market price increased very sharply. It reached the level of Rs. 6,000. So, when the world market price of fertilizer was Rs. 6,000, the Government was making available fertilizer to the farmer at Rs. 350. So, those who argue that there must be a mechanical application of a formula which is based upon the prevailing world price and the exchange rate forget the fact that you cannot have only one half of the argument. In that case, if there is a drastic decline in the prices, then you hand over that benefit to the consumer. Equally, if the world market price rises to very exorbitant levels, then that burden also has to fall upon the

consumer. So, that is simply not a practical policy. That is why, Sir, the Government has adopted a balanced approach to this matter providing a cushion to the community at a time when that is needed. So, in accordance with that policy, the price of diesel comes down from Rs.110 to Rs. 80, the price of petrol comes down from Rs.157 to Rs.142 and the price of kerosene comes down from Rs.80 to Rs.60. There is yet another measure which has been immensely beneficial to local industry. That is the reduction of the price of furnace oil. I am personally aware how much of a benefit this will confer particularly on sectors like the apparel sector and the ceramic sector which make use of very large quantities of furnace oil. The reduction in the price of furnace oil will enable the companies that are engaged in these spheres to sell their product at a much lower price. This is because their cost of production will be reduced drastically. It means that these industries will be competitive in an exceedingly hostile global environment and the consumer benefits to the extent that there would be a reduction in the price of the commodity that is produced. So, the point I am making in short, Sir, is that the Budget looks at all these different facets and endeavours to do justice to each of these areas in a balanced way. We heard this morning about the victory of the armed forces in Pooneryn. That has been made possible by the allocation of very substantial resources. So, there has to be the provision of financial resources for defence. Then, what is equally important is the question of development. The military expenditure has been incurred without any reduction of the provision that has been made particularly in respect of major schemes in the irrigation and the power and energy sectors. Large projects like Kerawalapitiya, Uma Oya, Sapugaskanda and Moragahakanda are going ahead, providing a much needed stimulus to development. One of the essential features of the thinking of the Government, Sir, is that there is no exclusive focus only on mega projects. I think one of the most refreshing features of the Budget is the provision relating to 600 small electricity projects, which will result in the addition of about 300 megawatts of power to the national grid. So, all of this has been done together with the decision on the part of the Government to provide enhanced resources for military purposes. So, you have on the one hand, the allocation for defence and on the other, a very sharp focus on development and also welfare has not been by any means neglected. I think in a country like Sri Lanka, social development is very essential and there are several features of the Budget which require emphasis from that point of view. For example, there has been the provocation of the provision of almost Rs. 1,000 million - the exact figure is Rs. 950 million - has been provided for the improvement of facilities in universities outside Colombo. Universities like Peradeniya and Colombo are already sufficiently

[ . . ]

2008 15 1319 1320

developed but there is a need to bring up the other universities situated in the remoter regions of the country in order to ensure equality of opportunity for all. I think the Hon. Sajith Premadasa will particularly appreciate this because one of the main reasons for disenchantment among youth has been denial of opportunities. Youth in Sri Lanka have said that they are prepared to put up with adversity but what they do not want is injustice. Our people are talented; I can say that not as a politician but as one who has taught two generations of our students within the university system of Sri Lanka. The creativity and the potential that is all too evident in the younger generation of this country is not matched by what we encounter teaching students in the most developed universities of the West, like Oxford and Cambridge. Now, what they require is access to opportunity and equality of opportunity. This has been done by means of a proposal that is embodied in the Budget which has provided for the allocation of Rs. 950 million for the development of smaller universities such as Rajarata University, Wayamba University, Sabaragamuwa University, Uva-Wellessa University, the Northern University, South-Eastern University and the University of Jaffna. Our sportsmen have also demonstrated exceptional talent, as you know, when they participate in international events. It is therefore, the responsibility of the Government to put at their disposal, all the facilities which they need for this purpose. It is with this objective in view that a sum of Rs. 300 million has been allocated for these facilities to be provided for rural sportsmen. Then again, Sir, in keeping with the policy which I referred to earlier, that is not being content simply to achieve a certain rate of growth - the Sri Lankan economy has grown by almost 7 per cent during the last three years. But in order to ensure that every citizen of this country becomes a full participant and beneficiary in that developmental process, there has to be an active intervention on the part of the State in certain selected areas. This is why provision has been made for milk to be provided to less affluent families and financial provision has been made for that purpose. Health is as important as education. These are the abiding achievements of successive governments in this country. Today, not only in Asia but even in the developed world, we can be proud of our achievements in the sectors of health and education. In order to sustain these achievements, it must not become Sir, a thing of the past, it is our responsibility to hand these achievements over to posterity. In order to make that a reality, His Excellency the President has made provision for health to be developed in regions of the country outside the Colombo District and particular mention has been made in the Budget Speech for the development of these health facilities not only in western medicine but also in indigenous medicine in the Districts of Akkaraipattu, Monaragala, Nuwara Eliya, Kegalle and Ratnapura - the district that is led by my distinguished Friend, the Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne. So, all of that finds expression, Sir, in the Budget.

Then also, a man does not live by bread alone. His Excellency the President has recognized that there must not be an exclusive focus on the economic aspect of things. Sri Lanka has a rich and varied culture. One of the principal characteristics of that culture is our unremitting commitment to an holistic view of human development and that again is amply provided for by several provisions that are contained in this Budget. Alcoholism is not in Sri Lanka a serious a problem as it is in some developed countries of the West, for example in Russia, but and it is necessary that we take action well in time to prevent aggravation of problems before they reach alarming levels. That is why, the programme connected with "Mathata Thitha" has received considerable emphasis in the Budget provisions. Also, Mr. Presiding Member, Sri Lanka has a rich heritage with regard to the arts and culture. So, that has not been neglected in the Budget. There has been ample financial provision which has been made in that regard. When you look at the Budget as a whole, it is therefore clear that every facet has been catered for. The Hon. Sajith Premadasa referred to some of the problems encountered in the developed world and he quoted Alan Greenspan. When Greenspan appeared before the United States Senate about two weeks ago, he made a very significant statement. It amounted to a mea culpa. Here, was the man who, for 30 long years guided monetary policy in the United States of America and he, then told the Senate Committee that as he looked back on that experience, his reaction was one of "shocked disbelief". "Shocked disbelief" was the word used by Alan Greenspan in describing his own reactions to the unfolding scenario which he saw in the financial world around. It is therefore clear, Sir, that there are no universal panaceas to these problems. There are no longer models that we can emulate with total fidelity. We have to consider the circumstances of a particular situation. The efficacy, the utility of a remedy will depend upon that remedy being fashioned having regard to the combination of circumstances that is characteristic of our national situation. That, I think, Sir, is the principal merit of this Budget. His Excellency the President has taken into account the priorities of this nation at this particular time. I do not mean to suggest that we have nothing to learn from elsewhere. There is no need to reinvent the wheel. There is a large element of commonality in the economic issues that confront the world today. Therefore, by all means let us learn from the empirical experience of others, what His Excellencys Budget has endeavoured to do. But, at the same time, if you are to serve adequately the people of our country, we have to ensure that these lessons we learn from other cultures, from other civilizations and from other situations, are suitably adapted to cater to these specific problems that we need to grapple with in Sri Lanka today.

the Hon. Sajith Premadasa. Sir, it is my submission that that has been the spirit in which the formulation of this Budget has been attempted. We are particularly proud of the phenomenal developments which are taking place in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka. This is a unique window of opportunity. When I go abroad and talk to foreign audiences, I tell them that the military action is not an end in itself but it has made possible the holding of elections after 20 years in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka, the people of that part of the Island have been able to exercise their universal franchise, the most cherished and the most basic of human rights and freedom. They have been able to elect a provincial council of their choice after 20 years. That has paved the way, Sir, to an economic renaissance. Today, we have electricity going to villages up and down the Eastern Province. Independent observers, I do not mind mentioning the name Dr. Anula Wijesundara - ( ) (The Presiding Member)

Hon. Minister, you have only one more minute. . . ( .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Dr. Anula Wijesundara is not a politician, a very respected social worker who has seen for herself the magnitude of the development that has taken place throughout the Eastern Province. There are companies investing there. The USAID is a partner with us in developing that region and in restoring the livelihoods of people who have suffered enormous anguish over the last 20 years. So, these are achievements of which the Government is justifiably proud and that is the backdrop against which this Budget has been presented. I would like therefore, Sir, to conclude on this note. This is not a matter of partisanship. It is not a question of claiming exclusive credit. I think today, as we confront the formidable challenges that face Sri Lanka at this particular juncture in our contemporary history, there is an overwhelming need for consensus, for all men and women of goodwill who love their country to try to discover common ground to face together the challenges of the future and to that end, I humbly request the co-operation of all Members of Parliament, irrespective of social or political prejudices and divisions. On that note, Sir, I would like to commend this Budget to the House. Thank you very much.

[.. 2.23] ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera - Minister of Justice and Minister of Ports Development) Hon. Presiding Member, thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak on the Budget Proposals before this House. I take particular note that these Budget Proposals were made at a time when the entire world is being threatened by a recession, which may become a Depression worse than that of 1929. I will argue that these Budget Proposals are a change - as they should be - as fundamental as the change initiated in 1977. The policy change made in 1977 inaugurated the much- condemned open economy. This has played havoc with the economic sovereignty and economic development of Sri Lanka. I do not for a moment say that I am for a closed economy but due to the extremes that we went in following the open economy, today we are paying the price for it. The 1977 Budget Proposals were based on what was called the Washington Consensus. This Consensus was based on the theory that the market was the sole signaller of the economic activity. There were five elements in this Consensus. They were: Balanced Budgets, Privatization, Tariff Equalization, Open Monetary Arrangements and Globalization. Its economics were an economics of consumption. In place of building a culture of patriotism, it led to a culture of buy, buy, buy and conspicuous consumption, very often by borrowing, the same disease that has now laid low the United States. The consumer debt in the United States is higher than her GDP, her GDP being quarter of the worlds GDP. When the United States has a cold, we say the world gets pneumonia.

1343 1344

[ ] The intellectual arguments supporting the Washington Consensus were provided by Milton Friedman of the University of Chicago, for whose efforts he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics. The country that pushed most of the Washington Consensus was the United States. It used its control over the three major international financial institutions, the IMF, the WTO and the World Bank, to bully the helpless developing world to accept the Washington Consensus. But, where is the Washington Consensus in the United States today? Eight years ago, President Clinton, when he relinquished after his two-term period, left behind a budget surplus of US Dollars 200 billion. Today, President Bush is leaving behind a budget deficit of US Dollars 700 billion or possibly very much more, once the figures are finalized. Where is this theory of Balanced Budgets in the United States? It has been abandoned. The Washington Consensus was strongly against nationalization. It was for privatization and privatization only, with a blank cheque without a date. But what is happening in the United States today? It has nationalized the two largest housing mortgage banks in the world, Fannie May and Freddie Mac. It has nationalized the largest insurance company in the world, AIG, American Insurance Group. Both General Motors and Chrysler are on the verge of bankruptcy. The American Government is almost nationalizing both of them, though the principle of market determination lays down that if an organization is bankrupt, it should be closed down. But what happened with the 1977 Budget Proposals in Sri Lanka? Agencies undertaking socio-economic services like the Marketing Department, were closed down. The Hon. Members of the House would remember the great service the Marketing Department did. It provided a fair price for the rural agricultural products while ensuring a fair price for the urban consumer. With the closure of the Marketing Department, the private sector-managed Manning Market in Pettah is exploiting the consumers. A similar disaster was about to happen to the CWE under the UNP regime in 2001. Fortunately, it was narrowly averted. The Budget Proposals that we are discussing today, are meant to reverse the Budget Proposals of 1977 to a certain extent which led to the open economy. In fact, the formation of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party by the late Mr. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, on the economic side, was to build a national self-sufficient economy through local entrepreneurs. Naturally, these entrepreneurs were great supporters of the SLFP. The economic proposals of the UNP were the opposite, that Sri Lanka be part of the world, globalized economy. They wanted to be stooges of world capitalism hoping that some crumbs will fall their way. The 1977 Budget Proposals made us poorer and income gaps widened alarmingly. The second prong of the SLFP economic policy was to build public corporations since local entrepreneurs may not have sufficient capital, mastery of technology and management skills to run large, complex entities. A large number of such corporations were

established. What did the UNP do? It privatized them to their cronies. Before Russia produced oligarchs, we produced them in Sri Lanka. Anything big, they privatized. That is why I am scared even to go to the toilet with people like the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake and the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara fearing the same fate will befall me. The Washington Consensus was based on supply side economics. Todays Budget Proposals are based on demand side economics. Keynes, in his article Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren, said that there are absolute needs and relative needs. Absolute needs are food, clothing, shelter, health, education, environment and good governance. The invisible hand does not give guidance on these. Guidance is given by representatives of the people like us in the Government. Relative needs are met by the market. This Budget addresses all these segments. It has addressed national productivity. , . Washington Consensus , . . . , , , " " . , . . ? . . , . ? . . . , . . , . . . . . . . level playing-field . ,
