There are several highlights which I would like to bring to the notice of the House. The recent Household Literacy Survey, up to the period 2007, published by the Department of Census and Statistics shows the recent upsurge in the usage and adoption of Information Technology in Sri Lanka. According to that, computer literacy rate has increased from 9.7 per cent in 2004 to 16.1 per cent in 2007. This

is the country average. The ownership of computers and access to internet facilities have also risen. For example, in 2004 the level of computer literacy was 9.7 per cent and in 2007 it has risen to 16.1 per cent. Then, with regard to the ability to use different software packages, there was no recorded level in 2004, and this has gone up to 11.4 per cent. This survey itself clearly indicates that the development of the ICT sector has been advanced and the main factor which has contributed to this is the role played by the ICT Agency. We have been able to bring in various essential policy reforms and the House has approved the Electronic Transactions Act, No. 19 of 2006, which I presented and I must acknowledge here that the legislation was framed by the ICT Agency. Last year, we also introduced the Computer Crimes Act, No. 24 of 2007 and this again was an essential piece of legislation to ensure that the criminal side of information technology is addressed in a comprehensive manner and for this, I must thank the ICT Agency and in particular the legal expert, Mr. Jayantha Fernando. The Government has also initiated the preparation of the Data Protection Rules, which will help the expansion of the business process outsourcing sector, which has brought in a large number of job opportunities in countries like India and which is now beginning to develop in Sri Lanka. So these are some of the essential activities that ICT Agency has contributed to. The other area is the Nenasala or Telecentre initiative. Up to now, 570 Nenasalas or Telecentres have been set up countrywide and this includes cleared areas of the Northern and Eastern Provinces, thus giving access to information technology to the marginalized communities as well. I am happy to say that some of these Nenasalas have now been linked to the Vidhartha Centres which come under the Ministry of Science and Technology as part of the Vidhartha Programmes so that the computer operators at the Vidhartha Centres can overlook the activities of the Nenasalas and ensure that the public make maximum use out of that. Now, another important area that ICTA has played a vital role is the e-Government programme. This is towards improving public access to Government services. The ICTA has successfully implemented the Lanka Government Network (LGN). This connects 325 Government offices countrywide and provides a special type of VOIP connectivity, that is via internet so that the telephone cost to Government can be cut considerably. The direct impact of this has resulted in inter-connecting 46 ministries, 82 Government departments, 13 district secretariats, 177 divisional secretariats and five provincial councils, enabling easier and faster communications between Government institutions.

[ ]

2008 23 829 830

As part of this LGN programme, there have been 36 training and capacity development workshops which have been conducted for over 1,000 Government officials in various grades in different parts of the Island. The Government Information Centre (GIC) or call centre was established by ICTA and has tremendously improved accessibility of Government information to all our citizens in Sinhala, Tamil and English, by providing them with the opportunity of simply dialling 1919 from any telephone. Previously citizens had to travel long distances to Government offices to obtain basic information. From the 15th of September this year, several major e-Government projects have been launched. I will just give a brief account of them. One is the e-Population Register Project. This Project creates and maintains a consolidated database comprising basic information of all Sri Lankans. This Register Project will maintain an up to date record of each citizen of Sri Lanka, containing his or her basic information such as the personal identification number which is similar to the existing National Identity Card number, name, date of birth, gender, civil status and current and residential address. Once such information is available centrally for any Government institute to access, it will no longer be necessary for citizens of Sri Lanka to produce various documents to prove their identities when obtaining Government services. Therefore, this project promises to make the Government more citizen-centric and citizen-friendly. The Civil Registration System of Sri Lanka which registers life events such as births, marriages and deaths will also be automated so that there will be ease in accessing records in future. By July 2009, the e-Population Register System will be rolled out in the Attanagalla, Beruwala and Dehiwala Divisional Secretariats as a pilot project. Subsequently, it will be implemented in other divisional secretariats in a phased out manner. Secondly, there is the e-Divisional Secretariat. We know the importance of the divisional secretariat which handles about 90 per cent of Government services to the citizen. This has become a one-stop shop for citizen services. By computerization, these services can be readily accessed by the citizens speedily so that all their needs can be attended to expeditiously. Having considered the importance and high involvement in providing citizen services, the e-Divisional Secretariat Project was initiated by ICTA and the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs jointly as a pilot project to be implemented in three Divisional Secretariats of the Colombo District - Colombo, Hanwella and Moratuwa. Then, there is the e-Pensions project. There are approximately 600,000 Public Sector pensioners and roughly Rs. 250 million of funds are disbursed among

them monthly as pension payments. Although pension grants are worked out at the Department of Pensions, the monthly pension payments are made at divisional secretariats which are scattered across the Island. Due to the absence of an integrated system which can expedite the application processing, computation of pension grants and file tracking, the Department of Pensions is experiencing long delays in application processing and attending to the pensioners grievances. The irregularities in various pension schemes have gone unattended as the complaints are numerous for the limited number of staff to attend. This has compelled pensioners to visit the Department of Pensions several times to attend to their pension issues. The proposed computerized e-Pension system launched in September this year will bring in a new pension management system which needs to be practised entirely in ICT-based systems and procedures. The data exchange between the Department of Pensions and divisional secretariats would be accomplished by using data communication lines resulting in the up-to-date information at both ends. The staff of the Department of Pensions and divisional secretariats has already been transformed into a skilled workforce who could use the new pension system. Then, there is the e-Foreign Employment Bureau. The objective of the project is to increase efficiency and effectiveness of the entire process of foreign employment registration and placement through an ICT-driven system of management. The system will provide a web-based solution for the management of foreign employment registration, faster and more efficient methods for job order approval, and easier access to the Bureau. In addition to this, there is the e-Society programme. Under a development programme known as the e-Society programme, the ICTA which seeks to use ICT as a lever for socio-economic development has initiated 122 grassroots technology projects as well as 23 other projects focusing on developing innovative technology - ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . , [ ] .

( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana)

With your permission, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I will continue with what I was stating. There are 23 other projects focusing on developing innovative technology applications for disadvantaged communities. Some of the socio-economic needs being addressed by these initiatives cover several sectors such as health, education, income generation, agriculture, communication and even the preservation of cultural heritage. I must say that these projects have now reached international heights and the Shilpa Sayura, a local language digital learning system with interactive content has been the most notable with several international awards to its credit; for instance, the Stockholm Challenge Award 2008 as well as the e-India 2007 and the GKP Award. The ICT Agency has also played a vital role in the ICT Private Sector Development Programme. The ICT Private Sector Development Programme is driven by the ICT Industry Associations of Sri Lanka. It has been able to mobilize private sector associations so that the private sector has been promoted as a result and actively involved in developing ICT in our country. There is a three-pronged strategy aimed at in this respect. Firstly, there is ICT human resource development because we have to develop the necessary know-how in the people for them to participate in developing the ICT sector in our country. That is an essential part and the private sector has been mobilized for this purpose. Then, there is the need to promote the industry both in the software sector as well as the hardware sector and this again is being done through this ICT Private Sector Development Programme. Then, promotion of competitiveness in the private sector through grants and scholarships. This will induce them to improve their performance and output. Through this component, 60 ICT companies received quality certification grants, 82 grants were given to SMEs to address in-house training needs, 183 training scholarships were given to IT enabled service sector and there are several others which I will not mention here. Now, in this way, one can see how the ICT Agency has played a vital role in the past period in taking ICT forward in this country. There are a number of other areas which I will not go into at this time. I think the ICT Agency has laid a platform on which we can develop ICT and I am happy to mention here that His Excellency the President has declared the year 2009 as the ICT Year and the platform is ready for take off in this sector so that our economy can profit by a large number of jobs being created. Here, I must acknowledge the support given by the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya, Minister of Public Administration who together with me has played a role in making next year the ICT Year. There have been several misunderstandings with regard to the organizational structure of the ICT Agency. For instance, there were references made in the media by the

Opposition Members on several occasions of a CEO drawing an excessive salary and that there are disparities in salaries within the ICTA set-up. I must mention here that when Prof. V.K. Samaranayake became the Chairman of ICTA in 2006, steps were taken to rationalize and introduce a salary policy taking into consideration the rates applicable in Sri Lankas private sector and now those disparities and those unusually large salary payments have been largely sorted out. I am happy to say that the present Chairman, Prof. Epasinghe is continuing the good work that has been done by Prof. V.K. Samaranayake. I must also pay a tribute to Mr. Devapura, the present CEO who is now giving efficient leadership to the team that is working in ICTA and the way in which they have been handling a number of critical issues is to be commended. For instance, the ICT Agency, while maintaining good relations and promoting the key players in the computer field coming in to our country, is attracting investments in the ICT sector and the expansion of this sector - ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , . ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana) , . With regard to the ICT management, take for instance, the system of Open Source Software. It has been encouraged so that the users can access the benefits of the computer software free of charge and I am very glad that they are doing it. Then, with regard to this whole question of the amendment to the Act, I must acknowledge the support that has been given by the legal expert at the ICT Agency, Mr. Jayantha Fernando, and I am sure that the Opposition will also support this amendment as it is in the common good of our country and in developing our economy to benefit all our people. Thank you. . . Question proposed. [. . 11.14 ] . ( . ) (The Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera) , , .

[.. 12.13] . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. M. M. Naoshaad)

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak on an important Bill that is before the House. When we speak of Information and Communication Technology in this country, we must remember Prof. V.K. Samaranayake who contributed vastly to what we have achieved today and I am happy that we have the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana - someone whom I have the highest regard - in charge of this subject today. Looking at the amendments that are sought, it gives me the feeling that after five years of operation, the ICTA is now ready to gallop. When we look at the long title of the Bill, at one point it states that the ICTA of Sri Lanka - I quote: .CHARGED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NATIONAL POLICY IN BOTH THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS." The amendment sought now spells out that the ICTA of Sri Lanka - I quote: .WITH AUTHORITY TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES AND PROGRAMMES ON INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY IN BOTH THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS". The difference is that, earlier they were the implementors and now we are also giving them the powers to develop and implement strategies. So, development as well as implementation is now being passed on to the ICTA, which is a big difference. It is like earlier we were learning to walk and now we are ready to run. It is at the stage of running that we need to be careful. When we walk, we measure every step.

2008 23 849 850

We know what we are doing. But when we start to run, we tend to take short cuts because we sometimes cannot control the speed with which we run. Following on, if you look at the changes that are made, from it being a national committee to an inter-ministerial committee, the national committee is more encompassing. I believe at the formulation stage - that is what we wanted - a larger gamut of agencies and interested people were getting involved in the formulation. Now we have made it an inter-ministerial committee which basically would be more a watchdog committee or a control committee. That is where I find a few issues. One, is in the composition of the committee. I feel that the Minister of Telecommunication should also be included in this because in the implementation of Information and Communication Technology, the media through which you would be doing this has a lot to do with telecommunication and with that subject minister not being in this committee, it would not be a complete committee. The other issue of real importance is that earlier, the Minister in charge of the subject of Information and Communication Technology was to chair the meetings. Now that need has been taken away and in fact the composition has been diluted to a certain extent. It states that there shall be established an Inter-Ministerial Committee appointed by the Cabinet of Ministers which shall consist of the Minister in charge of the subject of Information and Communication Technology or his nominee. Sir, as long as you are there, your nominee, I am sure, would be a competent person. But I am not sure whether we could leave that to the discretion of the Minister or confine it to the next person with authority in the Ministry; that is, the Secretary to the Ministry. If it is not the Minister, it should be the Secretary to the Ministry who is empowered to represent the Minister and not his nominee because his nominee is open; it can be even his private secretary and that would devalue the Inter-Ministerial Committee and in fact stall this whole process or if I say further, it could even politicize this. So, I feel that when you are replacing Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the principal enactment, you need to bring in the Minister of Telecommunication and also remove, ..or his nominee.. and say or the Secretary to the relevant Ministry", which then gives more weightage to this Committee. We all know that Information and Telecommunication Technology is very relevant today and I must commend the ICTA for the progress that has been made nationally. We do not have to keep back praise where it is due; we need to give that. The ICTA is doing a fantastic job and they need to continue that. But the importance of the effort of the ICTA must be backed up by this Inter-Ministerial Committee. Now, if the Inter-Ministerial Committee is required to meet only once a year, I think that is not fair by the ICTA. There should be a

compulsion for this back-up team or the monitoring team to meet at least every three months; four times a year, because this industry is evolving so fast that if the Committee is required to sit only once a year, we would miss the bus.

Of course, all the others are sort of minor issues. I do not want to dwell on those. I am sure the Hon. Minister would have taken note of what I have said and I am glad that the Hon. Minister announced that His Excellency the President would be declaring 2009 as the "ICT Year". Now, when we declare 2009 as the "ICT Year", it should not be a mere declaration. It should be a year in which Information and Communication Technology is taken to the place where it was envisioned. In fact, I was just going through the internet today and under "Our Vision" of the ICTA website, it states, I quote:

To harness ICT as a lever for economic and social advancement by taking the dividends of ICT to every village, to every citizen, to every business & to re-engineer the way Government thinks & works.

I am sure up to the point of "&", we have gone quite far. But after that, ..to re-engineer the way Government thinks & works", there is a big question mark. If you open the websites of Ministries you will find that except for a few which are very current, most of them are not being updated. So, these websites have been launched because the Government has made an announcement that we should have official websites. But why do we need official websites? Because, as "Our Vision" of the ICTA website states that we need websites to re-engineer the way we think and work. If people are informed of the responsibilities of the Ministries, of what is happening in the Ministries, then governance becomes easier because you can get more feedback.

When I opened the website of Parliament, I found it is very current, of course, Hansards are still lagging behind. That is what we are trying to achieve. Just by having 102 websites, as we have a large number of Ministries, does not serve the purpose. I can narrate an example. Once I walked into the Divisional Secretariat in Samanthurai. While talking to the officers there, I said, Give me the data of the village. You are supposed to have all these details. Where is it? That officer showed me a bundle of papers with a lot of dust and said, Sir, we have gathered all the information. Then, I asked, When did you gather it? He said, We gathered it last year. We have only one computer and one data entry operator. Therefore, I am planning to finish it by 2009. I had to but laugh and tell him, By the time you finish it in 2009, that information would be irrelevant; many people would have died, their civil status would have changed. This is the seriousness with which this technology is being taken to the village. What is required in this regard is proper implementation of the programme.

851 852

[ . . . ]

I come from the private sector. I have been in the private sector for almost 35 years. I do not believe in data entry operators because they are merely punchers of statistics. The relevant subject clerk should be the one who enters the data because he is the one who understands it and his superior should be checking it. But now what happens is, they pass data to a data entry operator who keeps entering data and he does not get the hang of what he is entering. He is just entering data because that is the job given to him. That is why we find conflicting information and inaccurate information. Therefore, the education of the clerical staff should be taken to a level where they should be sitting and punching the information, like the Hansard Reporters here in Parliament should not only be writing, they should be punching. If they are punching it and if we have a screen on our table, we should be able to read our speeches tomorrow. That is the level which we should attain. I have seen on TV news that in African countries each Member of Parliament has a laptop on his table. So, to be current - I just got a note saying the statements and records should be given in CD form. All this can happen only if the information is current. If the information is not current, whatever format you give it in, it is of no use.

The Nenasala is a very good concept. But the implementation has to differ in keeping with the cultures of the people. I remember, the Presidential Secretariat started Nenasalas in pansalas. It is welcome. But what happened in Samanthurai? His Excellency the President came to Samanthurai sometime back and a Nenasala was opened in the main mosque without the consent of the people. Then, there was a mini riot after His Excellency the President left the place and the plaque had to be taken off and today that Nenasala is not functioning there. It was acceptable to the pansala but not to the mosque. So, what is the use of establishing Nenasalas if the people do not take it in? They start using it only if they accept it. In my view these Nenasalas should be centred around the public libraries. The Ampara District has almost 32 Nenasalas and there are two in Samanthurai. I do not want to comment on those. But for it to be effective and to be used, and if we are to take Government to the village and give access to the people, then it should be established in such a way that it is accepted by the people.

Going further, actually today Information Technology has taken such great strides. I can quote a classic example. Up to last year the TamilNet was accessible in this country and I can say openly in this House that it is after the TamilNet started disseminating information that the Defence Ministry got activated in having their own website. Till then it was dormant. It is the TamilNet that spurred on the other side. Unfortunately,

without having both running parallel, it was barred and only one side of the story is given. But you must remember that now there are so many ways of getting at the TamilNet. To be informed, to get the right information, we have to access every mode available to us. Not that we are against the war; not that we are against eradication of terrorism but information should not be blocked because if we politicize every sphere of life, then we encourage another form of terrorism. When you do not have access, you have to find new ways. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) ! . . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. M. M. Naoshaad) So, what I am saying is, I know your stand on the ethnic issue, I know your stand on good governance, I know your stand on democracy. Fine, but what you need to do is to take this country to the speed at which the world is evolving. It should not be just confined to the villages and to the Acts in Parliament but taken right down to the village. Thank you.
