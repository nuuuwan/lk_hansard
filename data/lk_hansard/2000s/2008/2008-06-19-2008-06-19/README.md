( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , credit cards limits . within the limits only you can draw. - - . , there is a Tiger paw in the credit card scam which the Government has found and we are investigating into this. So, there are so many other areas also that the Government is investigating at the moment. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

That was also one of the reasons that I asked this Question.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena)

Good. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Pyramid scam , . Tiger . . ?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Central Bank . We are conducting some inquiries even with the FBI and other international monetary agencies. As you would know, even in the United States, there is a big credit card fraud amounting to 01 billion dollars which the US is investigating now. So, internationally some arrangements are being made which the Central Bank is also following. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, you are moving away from the shores of Sri Lanka to America.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena)

I have to move away because the frauds relating to credit cards are not only limited to Sri Lanka. This is an international transaction.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Why do you not resort to the reverse course in terms of the economic activities?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena)

Because even in the US it is a multi billion dollar fraud and the US has accepted that it contributes to inflationary pressures and foreign exchange problems. There are two aspects.

( )

( - , ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa - Minister of Mass Media and Information)

Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, why are you talking against your conscience and political belief?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Did you read the Question and follow the Supplementary question I asked?

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana)

No. I just -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

I only went against the belief of the Peoples Alliance that is ruining this country, - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) . .

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana)

Wonderful ! Wonderful!

471 472

( )

( - ) (The Hon. Hemakumara Nanayakkara - Minister of Agriculture) You have ruined this country enough. The Peoples Alliance is trying to take the country onto the correct path.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , . .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

If you use the external conditions to give an answer to an internal matter, why do you not resort to the reverse course also? The rate of inflation in this country is 33 per cent while in India it is 7 per cent. Why do you not resort to the reverse course? I am only taking a leaf out of your own book.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena)

No. The question that you asked was related to the international situation. It was regarding the external funding. The credit card business, originated in the US. Even the frauds relating to credit cards in the US have come to billions dollars. I think it is about US Dollars 900 billion fraud, which is now being investigated. In Sri Lanka, it is a small amount. But we are linked to the international monetary transactions. Therefore, the Central Bank is going into this matter.

It has come down. I am saying that it has come down.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena)

There is a surplus in the market.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Your own imformation that you gave me shows that the import of cars has reduced by 300 per cent, buses by 24 per cent, motorbikes by 18 per cent and also vans by over 50 per cent. So, it has reduced.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena)

No. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

With this the external trade deficit was US Dollars 640 million in May, 2008. so with the reduction, if this is the case, are we not heading towards an economic chaos?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena)

If there are no vehicles in the market, Hon. Member, to purchase then there is a crisis. If there are enough vehicles, motorcycles and tractors in the market to purchase, and if the State sector also has introduced 2000 new buses, there is enough in the market for people to purchase. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Minister, even the import of buses has reduced. I am not taking my -

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena)

The State sector has come in. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

So here the State sector is included.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena)

The CTB has been revamped. The State Sector has come into the bus transport System. That is one of the reasons why the private sector is not importing the same percentage. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

asked the Minister of Education:

(a) Is he aware that an injustice has been caused to the officers who have been recruited for the posts in the Sri Lanka Principals Service on the results of the limited competitive ex-amination held in 1999, as a result of grant-ing the relevant appointments with effect from 01.01.2002?

(b) As the appointments were granted on the results of the limited competitive examina-tion held in 1996 with effect from the date on which the aforesaid examination was held, will he take steps to grant appointments to the persons who sat for the examination in 1999 with effect from the date on which that ex-amination was held?

(c) Will he admit that

(i) the salaries of most of the princi-pals who have been appointed for these posts are lower than the sal-ary scale of the officers of the Sri Lanka Teachers Service; and

(ii) in certain cases, they draw a salary which is lower than the salary of the assistant teachers of those schools?

(d) Will he therefore, take the necessary action to rectify this salary anomaly in order to avoid the difficulties faced in the school administration? (e) If not, why? . . ( )

Hon. Speaker, I have a question to ask from the Hon. Minister. Sir, this is about the appointment of principals to schools in the Batticaloa District. The examination was held. After that, an interview was held and papers were sent to the Provincial Council. Since then there has been a long delay. So who is responsible, Sir? Is it the Central Government or the Provincial Council?

. . ( . . ) (The Hon. A. D. Susil Premajayantha)

Hon. Member, are you referring to the new graduate recruitments?

. ( . ) (The Hon. T. Kanagasabai)

Yes.

. . ( . . ) (The Hon. A. D. Susil Premajayantha)

Actually, we could not hold interviews because of the Eastern Provincial Council Election. But after that we held interviews and within a couple of weeks they will issue letter of appointments.

: : , ECONOMIC CRISIS PREVALENT IN THE COUNTRY: STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF PETROLEUM AND PETROLEUM RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT . . . ( )

( . . . - , ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie - Minister of Petroleum and Petroleum Resources Development)

Hon. Speaker, on the 5th June, 2008, the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake made a statement under Question by Private Notice in this House pertaining to serious economic problems faced by the country consequent to the world oil price hike. Let me therefore, thank you for giving me this opportunity to clarify certain matters in that statement falling within the purview of my Ministry. At the outset I must say, I agree with many of the matters raised in his statement, particularly the fact that the fuel price increase has an adverse impact on all aspects of the peoples lives. However, it is not something we have done of our own will. It is a well-known fact that even many countries with stronger economy have been affected by this oil price increase in the world market. I wish to inform this House that the price increase on oil in our country has been a well-considered decision by a committee and by the Cabinet. They have taken into consideration various aspects to see that it does not affect the people very badly. I must say that the statement of the Hon. Member that the Government has been increasing the price of petrol and diesel instantly after every price increase in the world market is far from the truth. The whole country knows that the last price increase was in May which was five months after the previous increase in January. During this period crude oil price has been rising gradually from US Dollars 92.8 a barrel up to US Dollars 137 a barrel and the loss the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation had incurred in January was Rs. 1,191 million; in February it was Rs. 1,216 million; in March it was Rs. 2,960 million; in April it was Rs. 4,497 million and up to the second quarter of May it was Rs. 4,471 million totalling up to about Rs. 14 billion.

2008 19 521 522

It is true that following the discussion His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa had with the President of Iran, we have been given a concession of a four-month interest free period to purchase crude oil, the benefit value of which is calculated to be about US Dollars nine million per year. We have been able to resist from increasing the price during this period because of the profit accrued from this concession and also profit made in the hedging at the refinery and sale of bitumen and other solvents.

The Hon. Member of Parliament has also stated that we have bought crude oil at US Dollars 92.8 a barrel in January when the price of crude oil was US Dollars 87.96 a barrel. I wish to reiterate the fact that we bought crude oil in January paying US Dollars 87.96 a barrel. I am happy that the Hon. Member has stated the true position of the CPC at the time this Government came into power.

Different sections such as sale of bunker fuel, lubricants, LP gas had been split and sold to the private sector, thus depriving a large amount of additional income gained by the CPC. If this relative income was available, it could have helped to set off the losses and we could have further reduced the consumer burdens. I am also happy to state that we are initiating action to launch on those business activities again. We have already started bunkering and almost ready to start LP gas business. Lubricant business too has been set to commence and the consumer will benefit from cheaper prices than earlier. Agro-chemical business recommenced a year ago and our farmers have benefited very much. The sale of agro-chemicals in the first five months of this year has trebled compared to the same period last year. In addition to all this, additional income is also gained by the CPC through the sale of bitumen. In this way, we have set the reversal process of the privatization and I wish to emphasize that the privatization concept is an anathema to "Mahinda Chintana". We have also adopted various strategies to set off the price increase and for this purpose we have entered into Hedging Contracts. We have been very successful in this and been able to earn an income of Rs. 2,300 million additionally. This has helped us to partly face the oil price fluctuation in the world market.

It should be stated here that following the request made by His Excellency the President, the Iranian Government has come forward to help modernize our refinery at Sapugaskanda. This is a major modernizing programme after it was established in 1969. The income from the refinery between February and May this year has been Rs. 4,300 million, which I must say, is due to the hard work of all employees and the good management by the authorities. Once this modernizing task is completed, we will be able to produce the entire petrol and diesel requirements of our country. In addition, we will be able to produce 40 per cent of our domestic LP gas requirements.

The Hon. Member also referred to the splitting of CPC filling stations into three parts and the privatization done by the UNP regime in 2003, leaving only one-third part with the CPC and another one-third part with the Treasury. We have taken action to reverse this process as well. The Treasury has already handed over its share to the CPC and we are doing renovations and it will be physically taken charge of in January 2009. I admit the fact that a certain amount of tax is levied on petrol. However, compared to diesel, the petrol consumption is very much less. Hence, it is incorrect to say that the Government is setting off the loss incurred by the sale of diesel by imposing a tax on petrol. Our pricing formula has taken the high cost of living of our people into consideration since our price increase in January this year. We have lost Rs. 14 billion up to mid-May. We have been able to cover this loss by this price increase, by hedging and sale of other products. In this way, we have taken several measures to protect the consumers without placing much burden on them. I am confident that the Members of this august Assembly will appreciate the policy of the Government in trying its best to take control of the State resources and State institutions already privatized. I can rest assure that the CPC and petroleum resources will continue to be State-owned and managed. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Speaker, we did mention in this House last week about the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act which is the most important Act in terms of finance. By 1st June, 2008, the Hon. Minister of Finance should table in this House, a statement about the fiscal position of the country. Today is the 19th of June. But, still it has not been tabled. It is a breach of the Constitution. Therefore, Hon. Speaker, would you kindly ensure that these type of fundamental matters, at a time when the economy is in dire straits, are brought to the House because we are borrowing from commercial banks.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha - Deputy Minister of Tourism) Hon. Presiding Member, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe pointed out this Bill has a twin focus: one, which deals with the victims of crime and the violations of human rights; the other, the protection of witnesses, which are very closely interlinked.

This Bill is a further step to strengthen the rule of law in this country, whilst we have an independent Judiciary and an effective judicial system. Criminals, on numerous occasions, have escaped from conviction due to threat, harassment and intimidation of victims and witnesses.

So, I think this Bill will further strengthen the protection of victims and witnesses coming before the court to give evidence and promote an effective judicial system in this country. This Government has at all times, introduced legislation to give effect to appropriate laws and not due to pressure from outside forces. The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella stated in this House that this Government is going to implement this Bill only as an exercise to show the international community that it is protecting human rights, and I wish to say that there is no rational reason for that as this Government has, at no time bowed down to international pressure and has always acted in the interest of safeguarding the territorial integrity of this country.

Hon. Presiding Member, various false attacks had been made against this Government - there are allegations of human rights violations - but it will not be detracted by those allegations. At all times, this Government has acted to safeguard the human rights as well as the territorial integrity and the sovereignty of this country. One should not forget that the people of the Eastern Province of this country did not have political rights or human rights over a period of 20 years. It is this Government that set up an administration by bringing about a Provincial Council in the Eastern Province, thereby giving the people in the East political, human and all other rights.

Hon. Presiding Member, today human rights have become a profitable business for NGOs, locally and internationally. The NGOs are making statements here and at internationally fora for big perks and privileges. Meanwhile, we see some nations criticizing the human rights violations in various other countries. But one should look at how their forces have acted in the instance of war and I think today, some western countries are using human rights to whitewash their own sins. As there is no substantive debate on the contents of this Bill, it further proves the fact that this Bill is a way forward to strengthen the rule of law in the administration of criminal justice in this country.

Madam Presiding Member, I would like to briefly outline the objects of this Bill. It sets out the rights and entitlements of victims of crime and witnesses. It provides for the rendering of assistance and protection to victims of crime and witnesses. It provides for the payment of compensation to victims of crime, which is a major step, enabling such victims to obtain compensation from persons convicted of having committed offences. Further, this Bill provides for obtaining redress by victims of crime and also sets out duties and responsibilities for judicial and

535 536

public officers towards the promotion and protection of rights and entitlements of victims of crime and witnesses. It also stipulates offences that may be committed against victims of crime and witnesses and the penal sanctions that may be imposed on persons who commit such offences.

This Bill also provides for legal representation for victims at inquiries including criminal, forensic and magisterial inquiries. There is provision for a victim, following the conviction of the offender and prior to the sentence, either personally or through a legal counsel, to submit to court the manner in which the offence concerned had impacted on his body or state of mind, employment, profession or occupation, income, quality of life or property. This too is a major step.

By this Bill, provision is made for a victim to receive from the Authority, a Court or a Commission the actual financial losses or expenses incurred by him as a result of his participation in any judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings pertaining to the alleged commission of an offence or an infringement of human rights.

Another major provision is where necessary resources are available with the State, a victim of crime shall be entitled to claim and obtain any required medical treatment or medical care for physical or mental injury suffered as a result of being a victim of crime.

As regards witnesses, a witness is entitled to receive from investigational quasi-judicial and judicial authorities, fair and respectful treatment with due regard to his dignity and privacy. A witness will also be entitled to protection against real or possible harm, threat or intimidation, thereby - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) May I interrupt you for a moment? You are talking quite passionately about the human rights situation. Are you saying that there is no violation of human rights in this country? Muslims are being abducted; Tamils are being abducted and Sinhalese are being abducted. I mean, there is an issue. How we address it, is a different matter. But to say that there is no issue in regard to human rights is a travesty of justice.

( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha) May I be permitted to say this, Hon. Member. Whenever there is violation of human rights, this provides a mechanism to take it before the court. So, I would like to say-

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So many people - Muslims and Tamils - have been abducted.

( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha) All those abductions have been proved to be false and they have been carried out for political reasons. I say, whenever there had been an abduction, the law has taken its course.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yesterday, five people have been abducted in the Colombo District. Two Tamils, one Sinhalese and one Muslim were abducted at 12 noon. What is going on? I am asking, irrespective of politics, is that permissible? Three media people were intimidated the day before yesterday. Is that permissible? I am not colourizing them. I am asking, is that permissible?

( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha) Hon. Member, do not make this a political platform to raise such issues. - [Interruption.] The law will take its course. Whenever a citizen of this country has a legal problem, there is the Constitution, the Criminal Procedure Code, the Penal Code to redress that; the law will take its course. The Opposition is making this a political platform for no reason and I can tell you with responsibility - there were various allegations that Muslim businessmen had been abducted - that the majority of those were proved to be false. Whenever there had been such instances, the law had taken its course. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Are you sincerely saying that the allegations are false? Muslim businessmen, the owner of Hameedia, Akram - [Interruption.] Are you saying that those people have been faked as Muslims and they basically lied?

( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha) With regard to the Hameedia incident, I spoke to the owners and they said that there was no such incident. You all are making statements just for political benefit when some of them have not even made a police complaint. Hon. Member, you have to act with responsibility, not to make this a communal issue. For political gain, you are trying to say that Muslims are being targeted and Tamils are being targeted.

[ ]

2008 19 537 538

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Is there a Muslim Jihad not coming up owing to this type of action? I am not colourizing it. I want a social fabric consisting of Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Burghers and Malays. But, please do not say that there is no problem. Highlighting of these incidents can grow out of proportion. But if you say that no Tamils are being abducted, no Muslims are being abducted and no Sinhalese are being abducted, that will be a travesty of justice. ( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha) Whenever you say that, you should say that Sri Lankans have been abducted. You are making this an issue by separating them as Muslims, Tamils and Sinhalese when they are all Sri Lankans.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Are you speaking of a Sri Lankan identity? It is the UNP that has a Sri Lankan identity.

( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha) Hon. Member, do not make this a political platform to - [Interruption.] You are making this a political platform to raise those issues because you have no other issues.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, your father is one of the best lawyers on human rights in this country. Are you saying that he is fighting on bogus cases?

( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha) My father had fought for human rights even during the UNP regime. Human rights are enshrined in the Constitution. Whenever there has been a violation of human rights, my father has gone to court. Not only my father, but I also have gone to court. Human rights are not restricted to any particular government.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You are a person who is concerned about human rights; the Hon. Dilan Perera and the Hon. D. M. Jayaratne are also concerned about that. All I am saying is, do not say that there is no problem. Ensure that there

is no colourization. If there is an NGO criticizing you unnecessarily, knock it out; take it to court, but do not say that there is no problem. Then, you are creating problems for the media, the Tamils, the Sinhalese

( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha) Whenever there is an issue, the law can take its course. Media personnel can be attacked. But, unless they lodge a complaint, nobody would know who did it. All what I am trying to say, Hon. Member, is that the law will take its course. I think I have satisfied you with my answer. You do not seem to be wanting to listen to me any more.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am listening. I can do two things at the same time. Do not worry about that. ( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha) I am very happy that you can do two things at the same time. But all I am saying is, do not use the words "Muslims", "Sinhalese" and "Tamils". We all are Sri Lankans. - [Interruption.] You seem to be forgetting that we all are Sri Lankans. You seem to be always targeting them as Muslims, Tamils and Sinhalese. Why do you not talk about Sri Lankans? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) We do. ( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha) No. You always say that Muslims are being abducted, Tamils are being abducted. Say that Sri Lankans are being abducted. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, you are the one who said that Mr. Hisbullah is a Muslim and Pillayan would be a Tamil Chief Minister. We are the only ones who said he would be a Sri Lankan Chief Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha) Whatever decision made, it has been made in the best interest of this country. Whatever decision my party takes, I will stand by that. You do not have to comment on decisions taken by us. You lost the Eastern Provincial Council Election; you got defeated at that Election.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Opportunists!

( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha) I do not know whether they are opportunists or rationally-thinking people. Why do you also not become rationally-thinking and come on to this side? They have come in the interest of this country. They did not want to be on that side and become leaders of the UNP in another 10 or 12 years' time. They thought of the benefit this country would get. So, I invite you also to come on to this side in the interest of this country. Can I continue?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You should speak from your heart.

( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha) I think you are very happy that a majority of them came to this side because you are the UNP organizer for the Colombo District today. We congratulate you on that. ( ) (An Hon. Member) ?

( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha) I am not doing myself justice. I do justice to the country. I do not pay lip-service.

Hon. Presiding Member, in terms of this Bill, a witness is entitled to protection against real or possible harm, threat or intimidation, which is also a major step. Threatening, intimidating, bodily harming or wrongfully restraining a victim of crime or a witness is also made a punishable offence with a mandatory jail sentence, making it a major safeguard with regard to a witness coming before the court and giving evidence. Therefore, intimidation or threatening is an offence in terms of this Bill. It is also a non-bailable offence if a witness or a victim of crime is threatened or intimidated.

This Bill proposes the establishment of a National Authority for the Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses. The duty of the Authority is to promote the recognition of and respect for the rights and entitlement of victims of crime and witnesses, to cause the protection of the rights and entitlements of victims of crime and witnesses and to investigate on a complaint or information received as regards to any alleged infringement of any right or entitlement of a victim of crime or a witness and take necessary action to protect them. Where a victim of crime or a witness has reasonable grounds to believe that any harm is inflicted on him, he could seek protection from the Authority, which is also another major step.

With regard to financial compensation, prior to this Bill, the Magistrate's Court could award a maximum of Rs. 100,000 to a victim in judicial proceedings, but with this Bill coming into place, a victim could obtain a sum upto Rs. 1 million as compensation in addition to a penal sanction made against the offender.

So, Hon. Presiding Member, I think this Bill will be a major step in strengthening human rights in addition to strengthening the administration of criminal justice in this country.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Madam Chairperson, we were just listening to a cross-argument and I am sorry to say that my learned Friend is unaware of what is happening around the country; either he is misinformed or disinformed.

Madam, before I start commenting on the Bill, I must refer to a very serious incident that took place yesterday. A Commonwealth Human Rights Activist had come to Sri Lanka to ascertain as to what is taking place in the country and to learn about the legislation that is now in force in Sri Lanka. His name is Mr. Sanjay Patel. This gentleman had a couple of interviews with one of your Ministers and some others who are concerned about human rights. The CID took this man into custody yesterday. They came to his hotel. He was at the Intercontinental Hotel and the CID started questioning him on his rights to make investigations. This is a very serious matter. Here we are trying to debate a very important Bill concerning the assistance and protection to victims of crime and witnesses and human right abuses. At the same time, a journalist who has come from the Commonwealth Institute to inquire and to see what is happening in Sri Lanka is being taken into police custody. Even today he is being interrogated by the CID. What is the meaning of this? How are you going to face the international community? This Mr. Sanjay is a person who is highly respected by the Indian Government because he was the person who was responsible for bringing in the Right to Information Act in India. He has done a wonderful job and that piece of legislation is giving absolute protection to all journalists and all the people who are involved in the information sector. So, I cannot understand the rationale behind this. I think when this person goes back to India, he will paint a very bad picture of Sri Lanka. The Indian Government also will raise objection to this. This is a very serious situation and I would like to urge the Government not to harass this person further.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Is he in custody? ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Virtually in custody. - [Interruption.] That is right. He cannot come. The CID has said, No you cannot go, you have to wait. We want to question you. Some false

543 544

allegations have also been made against him that he took some photographs of the Galle Face and that he said something against His Excellency the President, which is all nonsense. So this is the type of thing that is happening. What is the use of bringing all this legislation? We are here wasting time, debating, so on and so forth. If this is the attitude of the Government adopted particularly towards people who are concerned about human rights, what is the meaning of this Debate? He is a Commonwealth associate. So this is something that I thought I should mention before I start this Debate.

Secondly, I think we have to congratulate the Chairman of the Law Commission, Professor Marasinghe, for having considered the provisions of this Bill. This is a very important Bill. There is no doubt about it. It was mooted somewhere in 2005. I do not know why we took all this time to bring this Bill up before this House and to have it implemented. It should have been done long ago. There are so many people who have suffered as a result of this legislation not being in place. A large number of people - victims, witnesses, victims of human right abuses and so on. Nevertheless, even at this stage, I think it is important that this Bill be brought to this House. But I am sorry to say that I do not see any of the Ministers who are connected with this Bill in the House today. I can understand the Minister of Justice - [Interruption.]

. ( ) ( . - ) (The Hon. V. Puththirasigamoney - Deputy Minister of Justice ) Hon. Member, I am here.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Yes. I know, I am sorry. But it has to be at Cabinet level. At least the Minister of Human Rights should have been here. He is the one who initiated the Bill.

Then, Sir, having referred to the importance of this Bill, I would also like to thank Mr. Kodagoda, the Deputy Solicitor-General. We had a discussion last Tuesday evening on this Bill. I must say that he made a wonderful presentation, a very good presentation on the objectives of this Bill. It was very clear. The objectives are very important and useful, provided they are being implemented bona fide. Whether the intention is there to implement it, we have our serious doubts. We seriously doubt whether the provisions that are being discussed today in this House and the implementation of the Bill in

a couple of days will have the desired effect. The objectives which are referred to in the Bill are very encouraging. It gives a great deal of relief to the victims, the witnesses and victims of human right abuses and all such people who are connected.

What is important in this Bill? If you read through the paragraphs of the Bill and its amendments, ultimately it is the police who has to implement the majority of it. The implementation arm is the police. Of course the judiciary is involved and there are certain other bodies that the Government is contemplating to appoint. If the police is not independent, I do not think we could expect the desired results or the effects of this Bill. The objectives will never be achieved. As pointed out by the Hon. Kiriella, we have enough laws and provisions in this country but unfortunately they are not implemented. If you read the Bill, you can see that the objectives are very good. It shows as if something marvellous is going to happen for the benefit and safety of the people of this country. But, the fact is that the implementing authority, mainly at the initial stages, is the Police Department - which is unfortunately not independent today.

Madam, as you know, during the two years that we were in power, under the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution an independent National Police Commission was appointed. I was the Minister in charge of the Police Department during that period and I would not say it was one hundred per cent but at least 90 per cent independent. The police officers were very happy. They did their very best. The people were very happy. The police had a free hand to deal with the criminals, with the witnesses and all other affairs connected with crime. I ask the Government today, why are you not implementing the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution? Why can you not bring back an independent National Police Commission? We will support you on every issue that you are now confronted with in the international forum. There are so many problems. My Friend who spoke before me said there are no problems and the Government is doing well. That is all nonsense. Why did you lose your seat in the United Nations Human Rights Council? Why is the European Union now threatening to withdraw the GSP Plus facility? Why is the Aid Group concerned about Sri Lankas violation of Human Rights? All these problems are there purely because there is no independent National Police Commission, no independent Election Commission and so on. Implement the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution today and tomorrow we will wholeheartedly support you in all your efforts that you are fighting against the international forum. If not, very sorry to say, we will have to keep on exposing what is happening in this country. This is the situation. So, just having this Bill in place with all these amendments I think, is not going to take you anywhere unless the National Police Commission is established.

[ ]

2008 19 545 546

Now look at the challenges that this Bill will face. Here I have a note under the heading "Challenges for the future" that has been put forward by the Attorney-Generals Department on this Bill. It is very clear. It states, To ensure that the new law is adopted by Parliament. Certainly these amendments that we are suggesting and the amendments that have come up will have to pass through the passage of Parliament. Then it states, "To ensure comprehensive implementation of the law and the establishment of the National Authority and the Police Protection Division". Now these two Authorities have to be established. Then the most important thing is to have proper personnel appointed to the several bodies. Now there again, if you are going to appoint your political stooges, if you are going to appoint people who would say yes to you and raise the hand, then of course you will not achieve anything. ( ) (The Presiding Member) . ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) . Then it says, "To create awareness of the rights and entitlements of victims of crime and witnesses." So, there are so many other things. Even at the very inception they have identified the areas where they will find it difficult to implement. From the point of commission of the crime to the point of bringing it to the courts, it is the police who are handling the entire process. Then, of course there are delays in laws. That is another problem. However much you may implement these laws, you will not get the desired effect or what is being anticipated if there are laws delays. Therefore, Sir, I fully urge that even now it is not too late and that the Government should immediately proceed with the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution and see that the independent commissions are set up. If not, this law will be of no use. It will, like any other law, go into the dustbin of this country. Thank you. ( ) (The Presiding Member) . . . . ( ) ( . . - ) (The Hon. D. M.

For the last 25 years, they could not implement the language policy. You see, they could not even allocate money for that. That is what is happening. Actually, if any government has any sincerity, simply they could say, Sinhala and Tamil are the Official Languages. But, here Sinhala is the Official Language. Tamil is also an Official Language. So, any administrator has a loophole to play. This is what is happening. ,

[ ] . , . [ ] . . . , . ? , . Mr. Deputy Speaker, in July 2006, this House resolved that a Select Committee should be appointed to go into the infirmities associated with the Seventeenth Amendment. Now, what are these infirmities that have been discussed? Why did all the parties including the United National Party agree to the appointment of a Select Committee by true and sheer admission that the Seventeenth Amendment needs further consideration, further improvements and the need for it to be made effective in line with the proposed amendments of a Select Committee? Now, Sir, if I may be permitted to quote the resolution that was brought before Parliament on the appointment of a Select Committee on the Seventeenth Amendment, it states, I quote: "Recognizing that the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution of the Democratic Socialistic Republic of Sri Lanka has been pivotal to strengthening democratic governance in the country by providing for the establishment of Independent Commissions; And recognizing that subsequent to its passage, political parties and civil society groups have made suggestions with regard to further strengthening the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution; This Parliament resolves that a Select Committee of Parliament be appointed to look into the operation of the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution and make recommendations to resolve its procedural shortcomings and further strengthen its objectives;

[ . ]

2008 19 569 570

This Select Committee was appointed in July 2006 and since then it has been progressing looking into all these aspects. This Committee comprises members nominated by all parties represented in Parliament. The first meeting of this Select Committee took place in 2006 and has been continuing to date, over a period of two years, with the participation of the nominees of all political parties represented in Parliament. The UNP could have easily assisted the expeditious finalization of the Select Committee report if they only looked at it beyond party considerations. Particularly, when some of the Members, including the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya who previously served as Members of the UNP were sitting in the Select Committee, there were certain concerns expressed over their participation and the UNP wanted them to be taken out of its nomination list to enable them to participate in the deliberations. But, could it be done? When the members are nominated to a Select Committee, it is done in terms of the nominations received at the time of appointment. But, subsequently, they have agreed to participate in the deliberations which is a welcome gesture. But, what I am trying to make known to the Opposition is, if you are saying that there are infirmities in the Seventeen Amendment which you have conceded in the resolution, the only way out would have been to have an expeditious conclusion of the Select Committee deliberations thus making it available for a more comprehensive functioning of the Articles of the Seventeenth Amendment with a further amendment. Now, without doing that, if we keep on saying that in spite of infirmities, let us go against the rules and other accepted norms that would strengthen the democratic apparatus which you all have been subscribing to in the very resolution, for the appointment of the Select Committee and if you delay the very process by your own actions, could you complain and make allegations against the Government? That is what I want to point out in the first phase of my speech. Thereby, the Opposition has a responsibility to respond to the Select Committee deliberations and have a more comprehensive approach being adopted in this House where all of us are parties to the Seventeenth Amendment. There is no debate on our not being a party to the Seventeenth Amendment and it should be part of this Constitution. The only thing is, when it passes through the passage of time, it lacks the purposes being served. Then, we have to address those issues as this Select Committee is currently doing. Then, Sir, I will get on to another aspect. The UNP administration was in office from December 2001 to February 2004. But, was it possible to appoint the Election Commission under the Seventeenth Amendment that you are alleging today has not been appointed by the current administration? Even the UNP administration at that time failed to appoint the Election Commission since December 2001 and February 2004 till it ceased to function under the administration of the former President Chandrika Kumaratunga.

If there was a better regime under the UNP for 17 years, if they held elections properly in the North without ransacking and stealing the votes of the people of the Jaffna Peninsula at the District Development Council Elections, today the reputation of our countrys

democracy would have been greater. I am sure it will be endorsed by my Friends in the TNA. Why did they make those mistakes? And since then, were there not free and fair elections? There were free and fair elections. Was there an election petition on the Presidential Election of 2005? This very Commissioner of Elections held that election without an Election Commission being established and today an allegation is being made by the United National Party that the Commissioner of Elections is biased. Why did you not make that allegation at the end of the Presidential Election held in November 2005 and since then how many elections have been held in this country? Did we go to courts challenging the General Election of 2004? That election too was held by this very Commissioner of Elections. Did we make that allegation when the UNP lost in 2004? Did we go to courts and say that it was a corrupt election practised by the PA? No. That very Commissioner of Elections in 2006 held the Local Government Election. Did we make allegations and go to Courts? No, we did not. Now, the UNP is in desperation because of the internal conflicts confronting their Party and in order to divert attention, allegations are being made on the Government. Get your in-house issues settled first. The UNP needs better attention on their housekeeping issues before attending to the national issues that we are confronted with. That is what I am advocating here today. What is important for us is to look into the issues that matter most to the people. That is, democracy, the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary and the independence of the press. This is how everything gets highlighted. Allegations can be made and met. That is what transparency means. The Government is transparent. There can be allegations but the allegations are equally met in terms of our responses. Therefore, Sir, it is very important for us to look at the core issues that ultimately centre round this Debate and the Adjournment Motion that has been brought in. In the absence of the Seventeenth Amendment being fully implemented, the Constitutional Council cannot be constituted. The infirmities in the appointment of the Constitutional Council are being currently addressed by the Select Committee to look into the operation of the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution. In spite of the appointment of the independent Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, was there not bribery in this country? These commissions can be there. At the same time, what is important is to address the issues in the country. That is what ultimately the people expect. We cannot evade from our responsibility by appointing the Constitutional Council. If it is free of infirmities, then we can make it operational and effective. But the responsibility lies with the Government elected by the people. That is the responsibility and we are not wavering in our responsibilities. That is the responsibility that we are entrusted with and that is the responsibility that we are discharging. That is my argument. When the Opposition was in Government from December 2001 to February

2008 19 573 574

2004, did the Government not function at that time irrespective of the Election Commission being there or not? Did we not go ahead with the administrative responsibility? Ultimately, the people decided who is best to govern. That is how the UNP lost and the PA came into power with the JVP in the General Eletion of 2004. Today the JVP is sitting away from the Government. But, in spite of that, the Government is addressing the issues of the country in terms of the mandate received at the 2004 General Election coupled with the 2005 Presidential Election and it is our responsibility to take it forward. What is best for us today is to join hands in addressing the infirmities of the Seventeenth Amendment and have a very comprehensive formula through the Select Committee process whereby we can bring in lasting solutions to the issues and conflicts associated with the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution. This process will ultimately usher in lasting recommendations that will only cure the deficiencies in the constitution of the Constitutional Council. The constitution of it has to be put in place first together with the representation and the quorum. Then comes the other issues that are not in conflict with the governance and they have to get into a fully-fledged arrangement whereby once it gets incorporated, it will stand the test of time. Today it has not stood the test of time. Within three years infirmities got highlighted and in the first year itself, the appointment of the Election Commission failed miserably in the hands of the former President Kumaratunga on the nomination of Justice Ranjit Dheeraratne to chair the Election Commission. In spite of nine members being there in the Constitutional Council, it could not be resolved even at that time. So, that means the Constitutional Council needs a type of a strengthening process and that can only be addressed through the deliberations of the Select Committee to look into the operation of the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution. I think young Members like the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara should be a part of that Constitutional Council reform process and must advocate for the reforms to be brought in so that this type of piecemeal debates will not arise. But we can address the greater needs of the country in the correct perspective according to our requirements. Sir, in line with the issues that are confronting the country, let me come out with the efforts taken by the Government. What is more important is to safeguard the territorial integrity, the sovereignty of the State and the national security of our country. Today, the efforts of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa are seen right across the globe. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . , .

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) " " . , . . Question put, and agreed to. , . , , . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. JINADASA KITULAGODA took the Chair. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member. What is important today, Sir, is the need for us to make things happen from a pragmatic approach against dogmatism. Politics is not the art of dogmatism. It is purely an art of pragmatic solutions being found to the statecraft. In that direction, what is confronting Sri Lanka today has to be dealt with adequately. It can be seen how we are going to liberate the North for the Tamil community from the fascist elements of the LTTE as done by us at the recently concluded Eastern Provincial Council Election by getting the convergence of all forces into the democratic path from that of a terrorist-struck area; how we are going to bring about the economic prosperity and economic advancement to the people of our country; how we are going to meet the fuel price hike faced by the world and how we are going to respond to that and also how we are going to address the issue of food security? These are matters that would ultimately transcend to our society in this country. How are we going to look at the delivery mechanism in terms of democracy? Democratic elections are being held today and this country has a record of holding elections within a period of five years at a given time and we have had more than six elections being held. All these elections are a credit to the people of our country; to the political system of our country; to all political parties in our country and to the civil society. Sir, from the year 2000 to date, how many elections have been held in this country? In 2000, we had a General Election. In 2001, we had a General Election. In 2002, we had a Provincial Council Election. In 2004, we had a General Election. In 2005, we had a Presidential Election. In 2006, we had a Local Government Election. In 2008, we had the Eastern Provincial Council Election for the first time in the history after bringing in the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Now, with this, about seven elections have been held. There will be two more elections in the year 2008 for the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council and the North Central Provincial Council. What does it speak of ? The vibrancy of our democracy. The vibrancy of our democracy is being tested all the time and endorsed by both the local populace and the international community. That is the

575 576

yardstick to measure. Are we to get stuck by a mere proviso that is being provided for a Constitutional Council to be there due to the non-functionability of the Seventeenth Amendment? At the end of it, they are also sons of men who are going to sit in that Constitutional Council. They are also the politicians who are ultimately going to be part of that Constitutional Council. The Hon. Speaker is a politician. He is not a judge of the Supreme Court for that matter. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition is a politician. The Hon. Prime Minister is a politician. Other Members get appointed by the political parties. Is there not a biasness in the nomination of each of those members whom you want to appoint to the Constitutional Council? Is it going to be the ultimate solution to our issues? His Excellency the President is being entrusted with responsibilities in terms of the Constitution that was introduced by the United National Party. Why is this sudden clamour for the lack of a Constitutional Council and governance in our country? This is the political agenda practised by the United National Party both when they were in Government as well as now in the Opposition. That is why I said, when they were in Government, they themselves could not get the Election Commission constituted in spite of the Constitutional Council being operational. Now, here is where the UNP must take the responsibility for having got a mandate from the people when they got elected to run the administration of the country. Now, these are the infirmities that need immediate curing and this is the very purpose for which the Select Committee to look into the Operation of the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution was constituted by all parties in this House. This Select Committee comprises of Members from the UNP, Members from the PA administration and Members from the JVP. It is a fully composite Select Committee comprising of the Hon. Dew Gunasekara, the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, the Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, the Hon. Douglas Devananda, the Hon. (Mrs.) Ferial Ashraff, the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana, the Hon. (Prof.) W.A. Wiswa Warnapala, the Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera, the Hon. K.N. Choksy, the Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, the Hon. Bimal Ratnayake, the Hon. Piyasiri Wijenayake, the Hon. V. Puththirasigamoney, the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam and the Hon.(Ven.) Athuraliye Rathana Thero. So this is an all- party Select Committee. That is how Select Committees are appointed. Here is a forum for these matters to be brought in and addressed, and immediately thereafter the Select Committee Report will be submitted to this House so that we could ultimately bring in the composite amendments needed to cure the infirmities associated with the Seventeenth Amendment. The Seventeenth Amendment is vital for our governance because we believe that we were the ones who brought in the Seventeenth Amendment, the very

Government to which the President Mahinda Rajapaksa belonged to in the year 2000. That is the Government that brought in the Seventeenth Amendment. Our President being an advocate of liberal democracy, a person who has stood for the masses of this country; who is being confronted with terrorism and is trying to overtake terrorism and replace it with democracy in all parts of our country, has to be given the fullest co-operation to navigate this country through these difficult times and support him by bringing in proposals through the Select Committee process. Having an Adjournment Debate on this matter is a good thing as it enables us to participate and exchange ideas. But why should these ideas not be associated with the proceedings of the Select Committee to look into the Operation of the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution? Then the report can be presented. It is up to these Hon. Members to insist that the report of the Select Committee be tabled in this House before long. This is how we look at this matter from the point of view of the Government. That is how I respond on behalf of the Government. The need of the hour is to uphold democracy whilst combating terrorism. That is evident from the continuous holding of elections during our period of governance. We have trust in the Commissioner of Elections. He is a seasoned public servant. His independence has not got eroded. In the declaration of election results, he has not been biased. That is the job of the Commissioner of Elections in the absence of any corrupt practices. There is recourse to the judicial system of our country in the event people want to canvass any election results. That is the process that is available. Why hold back the actions of the Government and tighten the procedure by limiting the application of the executive powers of the President merely because we, in the Parliament cannot agree on suitable amendments to the Constitution? This is what we have before us today. I would advocate in this House that all measures be taken collectively to address these issues in a comprehensive manner by the Opposition and the Government at the Select Committee forum. This Government will always go ahead to address the values of democracy, human rights and propagation of the empowerment of people as implemented in terms of the Thirteenth Amendment. We must speak more about the Thirteenth Amendment. The Thirteenth Amendment was something that we all agreed on and brought in but not implemented. Did the UNP administration implement the Thirteenth Amendment comprehensively in spite of their bringing in the very Thirteenth Amendment in 1987? After 20 years, our Government gave a pledge to the country. We are bringing the APRC proposals to fruition and we are implementing that. We were able to incorporate the proposals made by the All Party Representative Committee and implement the Thirteenth Amendment in full. We held the Provincial Council Election as per the proposal put forward by the All Party Representative Committee. We have carried out the proposals coming from Committees represented by the

[ ]

2008 19 577 578

polity of this country. We did not say that they are our proposals. We say that they are proposals coming from the polity of our country for resolution of issues confronting us. We are looking at these matters to strengthen the overall democratic agenda. Democratic agendas can only be strengthened not by words but by implementing decisions and carrying it out as we have shown in the Eastern Province. That is how we look forward to continuing our governance, by empowering the people through democracy. Thank you, Sir.

I know your style. But, what to do? You are going to - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) I am telling this House that appropriate action will be taken. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You did not answer my question, Hon. Minister. You basically allowed Dayan Jayatilleke like a loose canon to fire from there and then, you bring the British High Commissioner to the Foreign Ministry and say "I am sorry. Do not take seriously what he said". Did you not give an apology? ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

Our bilateral relationship with Great Britain remains at the highest order and in the event there are certain misgivings on the part of our ambassadors or representatives, the responsibility lies on me as the Foreign Minister of the country to make matters known to the relevant countries in the correct perspective. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, you make it a public apology unless you accept what Dayan has said. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

I have not accepted what Dayan Jayatilleke said. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Then, you must make a public apology.

From what appears in the press, there is a deeper matter in terms of the content. So, the content will be gone into by me and appropriate action will be taken. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You are holding the portfolio as the Foreign Minister. Before you bring disrespect to the country, ensure you reprimand people who basically open their mouths without knowing what they utter. That is the same guy who basically wanted Eelam in this country. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

I have stated in this House with great responsibility, what action I contemplate in response to the issue raised by my good Friend. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

I accept what you say but whether you will be permitted to say that, is another question. That is the problem. When you went there, Kshenuka Seneviratne, the High Commissioner in England was asked to return, I know. These are the internal problems of the heterogeneous alliance. The heterogeneous alliance does not allow you to do what you want. So, your left hand does not know what your right hand is doing. Unfortunately, you are in the middle and you do not know whether to go left or right. That is the problem. So, Hon. Foreign Minister, you came at the wrong time. But, at least you helped to clear one area. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

I was listening to you from office and I came to the House in order to respond to your queries. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Gunasekara is also listening. I know he will at least try to do something. Ensure that you stand up. Get the Seventeenth Amendment put into place. Look at the Hon. G.L. Peiris. Is he able to get this done? I am sure that if it was given to you, in 72 hours you will get it done. You will say that you need to legislate. You will ask help from the Opposition. We will say, yes, and it is done. There is no debate on that. But, you give an opinion saying that you do not need to do it and then you basically go and fire-fight around it. Then, you get Ajith Nivard Cabraal to shout and say, "Whether you get it or not, you had better learn to live without it". What on earth are you doing? If you have an independent Public Service Commission, there would not have been a Governor talking like that. You will not have a problem owing to this salary commission that is there. I was basically telling before you came in that the judges have got a 25 per cent salary increase. I appreciate that because they need it. Twenty five per cent is not enough, I say. There are 800,000 government servants. Ensure that the innocent armed forces personnel, the police, the teachers, the doctors, all of them get a minimum of Rs. 7,500 or a 25 per cent increase. If it is good for the judges why not for the rest? ( ) (The Deputy Speaker)

Hon. Member, please conclude. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I will conclude in one minute. You are cutting me down here too. Now, see the human rights. Look at the innocent Tamils who are suffering and the Sinhalese who are suffering. If they are married to a Tamil they have a problem. Look at the Muslims who are suffering. I am talking of the Sri Lankan identity. Please ensure that human rights are upheld. There is no point in whacking the heads of the NGOs. If they are bad, do not let them come in. But, 90 per cent of them are good people. Look at the European Ambassadors who have come, Hon. Minister. They are having a very wrong opinion. You need to correct that. Being the Foreign Minister with a bad brief, what can you do? You can only explain. I know the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe is keeping his mouth shut because he cannot afford to have a Government within the Government. This Government does not know what the small government is doing. That is the problem. This is the interpretation the Ambassadors give when they come here. You need to correct this. The mess you create will definitely have to be cleaned by the United National Party. That is always what happened. We had to bring in cleaners like the CMC garbage cleaners to clean the mess.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) You are talking about the Government's mess that you will have to clean. Have you also cleaned the mess in the United National Party? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

We have cleaned it up. We have no problem at all. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Is that so? ( ) (An Hon. Member)

We have already cleaned it up. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

That is something to listen to. I must congratulate you. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

We have vacuumed it. We have no problem at all. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) I am so happy. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Please bring your speech to a conclusion, Hon. Member. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

We had an open situation. It was an open surgery; there was no bypass surgery. We have corrected it. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker)

Thank you. The Hon. Srikantha, please.

[..4.02] . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I am very happy to participate in this Debate at its tail end on behalf of the Tamil National Alliance. In fact, Sir, having observed the proceedings in regard to this Debate right from its inception, I have been able to see that there have been serious deviations on the part of most of the speakers from both sides of this House from the very matter that is at the core of this Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera. I would like to deal with the Motion confining myself, Sir, to the parameters of his very wordings so that, I do believe, I would be able to do justice to the topic that is in my hands now. It has been stated by some speakers on behalf of the Government and more particularly by my Good Friend, the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama, the Foreign Minister, that since a Select Committee has already been appointed in July, 2006 to go into the shortcomings of the Seventeenth Amendment and also the necessary improvements and amendments needed for its effective operation, if I have understood him correctly - I do believe that I have understood the Hon. Minister correctly as I used to do always whenever it comes to him - there is no duty cast upon the President and by extension on the Government headed by His Excellency the President to appoint the Constitutional Council. I have always found the Hon. Foreign Minister coming out with very sound arguments whenever he used to hold the Floor on behalf of the Government. But I am rather disappointed, I say with due respect to my Hon. Friend, that this occasion, in fact, has been a very rare exception in that regard. The Hon. Foreign Minister stated that the Select Committee has been going into this. This House has agreed to appoint a Select Committee; the proceedings are not yet over, therefore, according to him, we have to wait for the outcome of the proceedings of the Select Committee, for its findings to act upon it. Sir, on behalf of the Tamil National Alliance, I say that we reject flatly this argument advanced on behalf of the Government. There is no point, Sir, in dealing with the Seventeenth Amendment separately as if it is of a separate, distinct and independent existence away from the Constitution itself. The Seventeenth Amendment is indeed part and parcel of the Constitution. I do not think there would be any dispute when I say that when an amendment has been proposed to the Constitution and after due deliberations and debate, passed by this House with a two-thirds majority as mandated by the self-fame Constitution and certified in accordance with the Constitution, it is incorporated into the Constitution and becomes an inseparable part of it. According to this portion of the Constitution, namely what we have in the form of the Seventeenth Amendment, or in other words, as far as the

Constitution, duly amended by the Seventeenth Amendment, stands today, there cannot be any shirking of duty on the part of His Excellency the President in appointing the Constitutional Council or constituting the Constitutional Council when nominations under Article 41A(e) and (f) are received by him. That is, in other words, when five persons are nominated together by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition and also another Member as agreed between the political parties and the independent groups other than the parties to which the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition belong to respectively to be the members of the Constitutional Council, it is the duty of His Excellency the President to constitute the Constitutional Council. There cannot be any other interpretation that can be accorded to Article 41A of the Constitution as it stands today amended by the Seventeenth Amendment. But, what has happened in this instance? There is no Constitutional Council just because the House had agreed in July, 2006 to have a Select Committee. The Select Committee so appointed is still going on, the Government ranks trot out the defence that they are not duty-bound to rush into constituting the Constitutional Council; in other words, the President need not rush into constituting the Constitutional Council. I beg to state, Sir, let us not play politics with the Constitutional Council. I am not treating this Constitution as if it is a sacred document. It is a Constitution that was promulgated in 1978 by the so-called political genius, who was also known as a political jackal, I do not mean any disrespect, former President Junius Richard Jayewardene as if it is bound to be there and we all are bound by that. I am not saying that. Because this Constitution was framed, put into place and promulgated without the participation of the duly elected Representatives of our people, who were at that time represented by the Tamil United Liberation Front, which is one of the constituent members of our Tamil National Alliance today, the Tamil people rejected this Constitution. That is a different matter altogether. We have a Constitution and under this Constitution, we have this House, this august Assembly and we all are Members of this august Assembly and therefore, we are expected to play the game in accordance with the rules. If we play football, we have to play football as it is football. If we are going to play rugby or rugger, as it is known, it is entirely a different proposition altogether. Here, we have the Constitution and under the Constitution, we have this august Assembly duly elected and duly constituted. We have the Office of the President or the Presidency as a Constitutional institution. But we find that there is an adamant refusal and atrocious disregard in implementing what is mandated under the Constitution in regard to the Constitutional Council. It is a very serious matter. It is a very serious matter, Sir, because the Constitutional Council is no joke. The Constitutional Council has been granted immense powers, in that, it is involved even in regard to the appointment of the Chief Justice and other

[ . ]

Judges of the Supreme Court; it is concerned under the Constitution with the appointment of the President and the other Judges of the Court of Appeal. What has happened now? We have had appointments made to the Supreme Court without the approval of the Constitutional Council because there was no Constitutional Council. We have had appointments made to the Court of Appeal and those judges are functioning as Judges of the Court of Appeal and those appointments have been made without the approval of the Constitutional Council for the simple reason that there was no Constitutional Council. Sir, as I told you at the very outset, confining myself to the parameters of the topic that is in my hands at this moment, I would like to quote Article 41C of the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution. No person shall be appointed by the President to any of the Offices specified in the Schedule to this Article, unless such appointment has been approved by the Council upon a recommendation made to the Council by the President. Now I would read out the Schedule, Part I. It states as follows: I quote: (a) The Chief Justice and the Judges of the Supreme Court (b) The President and the Judges of the Court of Appeal (c ) The Members of the Judicial Service Commission other than the Chairman And there is Part II also. I am not going into that. Now Mr. Deputy Speaker, if a citizen of this country goes before the Supreme Court and says that a particular Judge of the Supreme Court cannot hold office for the simple reason that his appointment by His Excellency the President was not approved by the Constitutional Council, what would be the outcome? By the same logic and by the same argument, if another citizen goes before the Supreme Court and challenges the appointment of a particular Judge of the Court of Appeal who has been so appointed without the approval of the Constitutional Council, what would be the ensuing scenario? I am very sorry, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that a constitutional crisis is being fomented by the adamant attitude that has been exhibited by the Government in this regard. If such a situation arises and a challenge is thrown in regard to the appointments of some of the Judges of the Supreme Court who have been so appointed and also some of the Judges of the Court of Appeal who have been so appointed, I am rather sad to state that there will be a constitutional confrontation between the Government, or rather the Executive including His Excellency the President on the one hand and the judiciary on the other. There will be a constitutional confrontation ultimately leading to a constitutional crisis and eventually making way for a constitutional deadlock. I wish the Government and its Head, His Excellency the President, would take a serious note of this.

What happened in Pakistan recently? There has been a vibrant judiciary headed by an aggressively independent Chief Justice and an alert unofficial bar, which is still agitating for the constitutional rights of the people of Pakistan. We have witnessed enough in Pakistan. It might have been Pakistan yesterday, it is Pakistan today and I wonder whether it would be Sri Lanka tomorrow. Therefore, let us not play with the very creator of all these institutions, including this august Assembly of which all of us are Members. If the creation tries to be funny with the creator the end result would be very unfortunate. I do believe, Mr. Deputy Speaker, according to our own mythology - not that I am a believer of mythology but I am only quoting - there are quite a good number of instances of the creation having been funny with the creator and ended up with something very unfortunate. Let us not play political games. I am rather sorry to state that even from this side irrelevant matters were trotted out. I expected the Opposition to be very sharp and be straight in their arguments in relation to this Bill. There are matters that may be incidental to the Bill and now we would have occasion to deal with them. Here I wonder whether the Government is conscious of what is in stock. If there is a crisis, I think all those who are involved would be answerable - if not today, if not tomorrow, some day in future - because the offices they hold are in fact the creations of this Constitution. Mr. Deputy Speaker, having said that, I would like to deal with another aspect of this matter. That is where I really started. The fact that the select committee, which is going into any possibility of incorporating improvements in order to deal with any insufficiencies that are there, has nothing to do with the issue that is before us. Let us remember that no article of the Constitution, no chapter of the Constitution or for that matter, no part of the Constitution can be suspended even for a fraction of a second by the appointment of any number of select committees. There can be any number of select committees comprising of any number of honourables - I say that without any disrespect to anyone of us or anyone of them there. There can be any number of select committees consisting of any number of honourables, but no select committee can have the power, can arrogate to itself the power to suspend the Constitution, because the Constitution is the basis and the bedrock of the democratic functioning of this country; of the system of governance in this country. It is the very basis of all what we have in the name of law and order. It is the very basis of all what we have in regard to the institutions of governance. A select committee can go into that. This House has the power to appoint such a select committee. But that cannot put a break to the ever functioning constitutional mechanism. The Constitution is a living document. It is in black and white. I would not agree with this article or that article. I would rather like to see this Constitution be

639 640

2008 19

* . . Produced at end of speech.

replaced by another constitution that recognizes the principles of equality in full measure, that recognizes the principle of the right to self-determination of the different peoples of this country including the Tamil- speaking people. That is another matter. But, the fact that the Constitution cannot be tampered with, no article of the Constitution can be wished away, should not be lost sight of; is the message that I would like to register today on the Floor of this august Assembly - that too is a creation of this Constitution. But, as if the appointment of the select committee has suspended the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution, or rather halted the operation of the Seventeenth Amendment, or in other words the appointment of the select committee has suspended the relevant articles of the Constitution that mandate the constitution of the Constitutional Council by His Excellency the President - I do believe or I am rather sad to state that the Government is, in fact, groping in the dark. With the numerical strength the Government has, the Government Members may say this and that. But when it comes to a constitutional test, when it comes to a trial of strength in pure constitutional terms, I do believe, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that it is the Constitution that matters and it is only the Constitution that matters and the number in regard to one side or the numerical strength this side has, would be totally irrelevant. That is exactly why, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I would like to impress upon the Hon. Members of the Government ranks, including the Hon. Ministers who are here or who have rather been responsible to ensure their presence on behalf of the Government today in the ongoing Debate, to understand this issue very clearly. There is a proverb in my own sweet Tamil language, that a dutiful wife should act as a dutiful friend, as a good minister and also as a good counsellor. I expect at least some of the responsible Members of the Government to play that role in dealing with His Excellency the President. I wish that they would impress upon His Excellency the President that there is an impending crisis in this regard. A crisis is in the offing. That is, the nucleus is already there. The seeds have already been sown. They only have to germinate. If this matter is taken before the Supreme Court - please remember, we have a Chief Justice who is quite bold, independent minded and also have proven himself as one who would never hesitate to act if there is a necessity to act. If this matter is taken before the Supreme Court I think, the Government has to face the music. Let us stop living in our own dreamy lands. It is easy to live so, quite easy to live so. Come and sit here and just go on floating in the air as everything is permanent. People who had been adorning the front ranks of the Government a few years back are in political oblivion now. That is politics. Nothing is permanent.

We find the former President - I do say so with due respect to that fair lady whom I still find as very fair and attractive - lamenting now for the three mistakes that she has made in her political career while holding the office of Presidency and she is spelling out only two and reserving the third for a more opportune moment. I do not want that to happen to anybody else in this country. Mr. Deputy Speaker, even to fight the war, I think, the Government can act only in accordance with the Constitution. Nobody can go beyond the four walls of the Constitution; go beyond the parameters of the Constitution. There is no question of anybody subverting the Constitution from within. There cannot be anybody, however mighty he or she may be, tampering with the Constitution while being the creation of the very Constitution. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Thank you, Hon. Member. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) Having said that, I would like to conclude by saying that the Government and the Head of the Government, His Excellency the President, should do a rethinking on the matter and rise to the occasion, leaving aside meaningless pride and trivial political consideration and act in accordance with the Constitution. I thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Thank you. . 15 . [.. 4.29] ( )

( - , ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe - Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights) Hon. Deputy Speaker, to avoid repetition, I would like to seek your permission, to table* the text of my speech because there is a lot of history that I have gone into and I do not want to repeat that because some Members have already mentioned that in the course of their speeches. But, I would like to deal with two or three salient points which I have incorporated in the text of this speech.

I could not agree more with the Hon. Srikantha when he said some Members have spoken to the point and others have brought as usual various other issues using the time allotted for this very important Debate. I was one of those Members of Parliament who were involved right from the inception when this Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution was formulated. In fact, in 2001, I was the Deputy Whip of the Opposition and I can remember it was only at about 6.30 or 7.00 in the night that we brokered the deal, I mean, an agreement was reached between the Opposition and the Government, to put it for vote on a particular day. Negotiations lasted for many days and even for a few weeks, Sir, and of course it culminated on the day when the Seventeenth Amendment was to be taken up for vote and the Government wanted to have the two-thirds, as per the Constitution, to adopt this very important piece of legislation. We were negotiating, as I mentioned earlier, till about 7.00 in the night and finally we came to an agreement. I can remember it was the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa on the side of the Government and I on the side of the UNP who were the conduits for the two sides. Also, I can remember at 6.30 in the night going to the Prime Ministers office and sitting down with him because there was an amendment that we wanted to be incorporated. He agreed to it. Then, I took it to the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe and the UNP agreed. That was how the two-thirds was put together. Sir, with that kind of a rushed last minute agreement being hammered out, there were bound to be lacunas, bound to be shortcomings and it is these shortcomings that we are trying to rectify by way of the Parliamentary Select Committee that the Hon. Dew Gunasekara is chairing. There again, Sir, it was my Motion to this Parliament that was adopted unanimously by the Hon. Members of Parliament on that side including the Hon. Srikantha. I brought the Motion before Parliament as the Minister of Human Rights because I recognized at that time that there were serious lacunas, serious shortcomings in the Seventeenth Amendment. I felt that we should give thought to rectifying these shortcomings once and for all and that is how the Select Committee was formulated and the Hon. Dew Gunasekara, Minister of Constitutional Affairs was asked to chair that. Now, Sir, the shortcomings, of course, were evident even before this whole hiatus of the Constitutional Council after March 2005 came about. The first was, when the Election Commission was to be appointed there was a nominee which the Constitutional Council had decided upon and the then President did not make that appointment. Of course, she gave various reasons as to why she was not going to make that appointment and there was no provision in the Seventeenth Amendment to ensure that a selection procedure which had been gone into by the Constitutional Council and the name decided upon, and when the name was sent to the President that the President has to act within a certain time period. That

was a shortcoming which we noticed even before the second Constitutional Council was going to be appointed. That was also something which had to be gone into and now the Select Committee, I believe, has gone into that and there is a recommendation in the Interim Report which the Hon. Dew Gunasekara will be presenting shortly. This would bring in a new Clause where there would be a certain time period within which the President has to act on the nomination of people as per the Schedules in the Seventeenth Amendment coming from the Constitutional Council. This is a big shortcoming which had to be rectified and this alone would have justified the rationale for the appointment of a Select Committee. Then, many of the Members stated in the course of the Debate, as to what happened post-March 2005. I have gone into it in great detail in the text of my speech tabled and I do not want to go into that again. We all know that it was neither the fault of His Excellency the President nor the Leader of the Opposition. The smaller parties in this Parliament could not come to an agreement on the nomination of a suitable candidate and this went on for several months. Only after a considerable period was spent, nearly two years, finally all of you came to a decision and nominated a person to be appointed. . ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) Since then, about eight months have passed. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) I know. That is another shortcoming because when you have a provision in the Constitution for consensus to be reached within smaller parties, or for that matter, any political party represented in this Parliament, we know with the very charged atmosphere in which politics is done in this country that it is impossible at a practical level to come to a consensus. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) Hon. Minister, will you permit me to intervene for a moment? ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Yes. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) Once the nominations are made including that of the representative of the minor parties, the ball rolls into the court of the President. Then, the President has to act. He

643 644

2008 19

cannot shirk his responsibility. Our grievance is this. Now, the nominations have been made, but the Constitutional Council has not been constituted. But the President has appointed persons to hold offices mentioned in the Schedule. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Hon. Srikantha, I was coming to that. I was going to explain as to why the Select Committee is important because do not forget that this House unanimously agreed to the Motion that I presented for the appointment of a Parliamentary Select Committee. Parliament is sovereign. His Excellency the President cannot usurp the powers of Parliament. He does not wish to do that. There are many shortcomings in this Seventeenth Amendment and that is why it is important that we deliberate together in an objective manner, in a manner of flexibility, in a manner of give-and-take, and for goodness' sake finalize the Select Committee process and bring the Report before Parliament. The Hon. Dew Gunasekara is waiting for consensus to be reached in this House. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) Hon. Minister, suspend the working of the ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) I gave in to you. Let me finish my contribution. I did not disturb you. Now, Sir, there was also a question about as to whether the President had acted ultra vires to the Constitution in stepping in and making the appointments. I do not know whether the Hon. Srikantha is aware that there was an advice given by the Attorney-General that it is within the powers of His Excellency the President to make these appointments. I do not know whether the Hon. Srikantha is aware that the Appeal Court of Sri Lanka delivered a judgment to say that the President had acted intra vires, not ultra vires, to the Constitution in making these appointments. Now I can give you one example. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) . . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Hon. Srikantha, please wait. Please listen to me. - [Interruption.] Can you please let me speak? -[Interruption.] That, you go and sort out with the Appeal Court.

Now, I will give you one example, Hon. Srikantha, about the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka which is an institution dear to you and me both, as well as the Hon. Dew Gunasekara. There are five Commissioners who are to be appointed as Commissioners of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka. Now, Sir, when you look at the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act and when you look at the powers and functions of the Commissioners in addition to the Commission, you would see that there are specific powers which are given to the Commissioners. For example, you cannot serve summons unless it is under the signature of the Chairman of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka. If there is no Chairman, summons cannot be served. So, how do you discharge the mandate of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka?

Then, Sir, the communication of a Certificate to the Supreme Court under Section 21 (4) of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act, No. 21 of 1996 on contempt, is once again a function that cannot take place if the Commissioners are not in place. Recommendations after the investigations are completed cannot be made unless the Commissioners come into it and make the recommendations. Sir, we know how important the Human Rights Commission is for the general public of this country. If the Human Rights Commission is not functioning and if it has to function only with the officials but without the Commissioners, they would not be able to entertain, look into, investigate complaints, make recommendations, issue summons thereon and discharge their mandate. So, this is why His Excellency the President had to intervene and make these appointments. I am not afraid to say in this House that it would have been better if he had not done that because the ideal thing would have been to resort to the Constitutional Council mechanism. But at that point, there was no agreement among the smaller parties. It was only after that, the nomination was made. ( )

( - , ) (The Hon. Dew Gunasekara -Minister of Constitutional Affairs and National Integration) That was in February, 2007. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Yes. So, His Excellency the President had to intervene. Otherwise there would have been chaos. Therefore, please look at the background in which he has acted. He has not acted because he wants to manipulate the whole system. He has to run the country. He is the Head of State. We are the Government. We have to run this country. We cannot have a situation where none of these Commissions are functioning.

645 646

. ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) This document is supreme. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) It has not been violated. It has been held. It has not been violated. - [Interruption.] Let me assure you that once Parliament adopts the final report of the Select Committee on the Seventeenth Amendment, it will be brought before the Cabinet and the Cabinet will consider the amendments that Parliament wishes it to consider. Of course, once the Government takes a decision on that, the relevant Hon. Minister will bring the amendments before this House. Then, all of us can come together and give our vote to ensure that these lacunas and shortcomings are eradicated once and for all. The other point is this, Sir. Everyone is talking about small parties, big parties, the President did not nominate or the Leader of the Opposition did not nominate, but if you want this Constitutional Council to be truly independent, do you think by having representatives nominated by the political parties in the Constitutional Council that it can ever take a decision independently? Do you think if the SLFP or the UNP or the TNA or the JVP or the SLMC or whatever other party that is represented in this Parliament nominates a person to be in the Constitutional Council, that that person is going to be truly independent and divorced of those political ideologies? No. We have to take the risk that those personalities who are nominated by the political parties may not be able to act independently. I am not pointing the finger at anyone in particular. But it can happen, Sir. Therefore, this whole thing has to be revisited. Are we going to allow political parties, Hon. Minister, to nominate personalities to this very important body, the Constitutional Council? Please look at it - . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) Hon. Minister, I say this with due respect to you. You are talking about what in your view is an ideal situation. We are concerned about what is here in black and white in the Constitution. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Hon. Srikantha, I do not have any problems with what you are saying. All I am saying is, for goodness' sake, let us get it right once and for all. We have not got it right the first time round. We are now trying to get it right the second time round. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) Hon. Minister, may I pose one more question? There are a lot of grievances in regard to the Constitution

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Hon. Srikantha, please sit down and let me finish my speech. I have been very generous to you with my time. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister - ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) I am finishing; in fact I am just about to finish, Sir. All I am saying is that there are many such shortcomings which need to be rectified. The Hon. Dew Gunasekara is doing an excellent job in chairing this very important Select Committee established as a result of a Motion that I brought before this House as the Minister of Human Rights. So, I also have a vested interest to ensure that this is succeeded. I know, Sir, the type of flap that we are in when we travel abroad. When I go to Human Rights Council in Geneva, people keep on asking me, Where is the Seventeenth Amendment? When are you going to have the Constitutional Council in place? So, I am as desperate as anyone else to ensure that this is put in place. But if we are doing it, all I am saying is, Sir, let us do it properly. Thank you very much, Sir. * : : Speach tabled: Address by the Hon Mahinda Samarasinghe MP Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights on the occasion of the Adjournment Debate in Parliament on the Seventeenth Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, 19 June 2008 Mr. Deputy Speaker, this debate on the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution is both timely and of great significance. The Seventeenth Amendment, which was certified on 03rd October 2001, wrought a fundamental change in the realm of constitutional governance in Sri Lanka. Since the 1990 s there had been a cry for reform of the system of appointment of certain public institutions and offices due to perceived politicization and partisan bias in the appointment of these institutions and offices. These institutions and offices, Mr. Speaker, were no ordinary departments, boards or bureaus of Government. They were vital national institutions that, by their very nature and responsibilities, should have commanded the utmost confidence of all Sri Lankans. Any perception of political influence, partisanship or bias could damage the confidence, trust and faith reposed in them. In the event that this had happened, the consequences for our system of democratic Governance could have been drastic. It was felt at the time that added assurances of their independence, impartiality and integrity should be made. The Seventeenth Amendment was the best possible answer that the Legislature could provide. The first Constitutional Council appointed under the Seventeenth Amendment was constituted in March 2002. Its term of office therefore expired in March 2005. It is a matter of historical record that a problem arose due to the lack of consensus among eligible numerically smaller parties in Parliament as to the tenth member of the Council who would be nominated by these parties and appointed by the President. Since all ten members were not appointed,

647 648

2008 19

the Council could not commence functioning. This was not merely the view of the Government but was based on the advice of the then Attorney-General. The resulting deadlock was the creation of a situation that no fresh appointments to these critically important national institutions and offices could be made. In these circumstances the machinery of state and of Government was in danger of grinding to a complete halt. In these circumstances, His Excellency the President was compelled to make some appointments due to the fact that the Constitutional Council was not constituted. It is the view of the Government that the appointment to these national institutions and offices was of such critical significance and that their existence and functioning was of such great importance that the President was fully justified in using his residuary executive power under the Constitution to make these appointments. The question of the Presidents residuary powers being exercised in analogous circumstances has been held to be intra vires the Constitution by the courts of Sri Lanka. Mr. Deputy Speaker, take, for instance, the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka. If the appointments of the five Commissioners were not made, the Commission would cease to function as an effective institution. In these circumstances the staff of the Commission, the ordinary petitioners who sought relief, the pending matters before the Commission all could not function or be proceeded with. It is not only a question of the five individuals who were to be appointed as Commissioners. It is a question of an eleven-year old institution of State being rendered non-functional. In the absence of Commissioners the issuance of summons, recommendations of the Commission, the communication of a Certificate to the Supreme Court under section 21(4) of the act on contempt are among the functions that cannot take place in terms of the Human Rights Commission Act, No 21 of 1996. However, Mr. Deputy Speaker, these domestic legal and Constitutional questions do have repercussions outside our shores. The International. Co-ordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions (ICC) has downgraded the Human Rights Commission from Grade A (member) to B (observer) status. One of the reasons attributed was the nonconformity of the appointment process with the Paris Principles relating to the status of national institutions. These Principles were adopted by the former UN Human Rights Commission in 1992 and the UN General Assembly in 1993. The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka is now relegated to observer status by the ICC due to non-conformity. This is not to say that the Human Rights Commission has lost its independence. Indeed no-one has cast any aspersions against the Commissioners or the Commission on this score. However the deadlock over the Seventeenth Amendment has affected the recognition accorded to the Commission internationally. This creates a less than favourable image of Sri Lanka. The Seventeenth Amendment is a key factor in our response for repeated calls for the establishment in Sri Lanka of an Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to perform a monitoring cum reporting function. I have constantly reiterated the Governments consolidated position that we possess the institutional framework to promote and protect human rights. This framework includes an independent Human Rights Commission. We have said that an office of the OHCHR is not necessary in these circumstances. Our argument has been that we need to further strengthen our national institutions and that we require technical assistance and capacity building support from our international partners to strengthen then institutions to perform all functions necessary to uphold and safeguard human rights. Our position, Mr. Deputy Speaker, will be greatly strengthened if we are able to demonstrate that institutions such as the Human Rights Commission are constituted in accordance with the constitutional provisions of the Seventeenth Amendment. International interest in the Seventeenth Amendment is not limited to the Human Rights Commission alone. Mr. Deputy Speaker, in the recently concluded Universal Periodic Review of Sri Lanka at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, many member countries expressed their wish to see the reconstitution - of the Constitutional Council as a re-assurance of the independence of the Judicial service Commission, the Police Commission and other vital national institutions. This is not the first time that such pronouncements have been made at international fora. We have consistently taken the position at the Human Rights Council in Geneva and elsewherethat Sri Lanka has set in motion a process to renew and reinvigorate the Seventeenth Amendment and that we are committed to continuing to

work towards this goal. It was with the intention of initiating definite action on rectifying the deficiencies in the Seventeenth Amendment, that I proposed the establishment of the Parliamentary Select Committee to look into the operation of the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution. My resolution was unanimously endorsed by this august Assembly. The Committee, under the able stewardship of my colleague the Hon. Minister of Constitutional Affairs and National Integration, has formulated an interim report containing detailed recommendations for consideration by this House. The Select Committee has had wide ranging consultations and has, I believe addressed the core issues in a spirit of good faith, pragmatism and common-sense. His Excellency the President has expressed his confidence in the Legislatures ability to formulate a set of proposals for amendment of the Seventeenth Amendment and has assured that, once Parliament adopts and endorses the findings and recommendations of the Select Committee, he will be prepared to bring the required amendments before Cabinet for its consideration. I trust that the Select Committee will be able to address its mind to the draft report and submit a final consensus document to this House. I am certain that we will, through concerted effort and active co-operation, be able to provide a solution to the problems created by the Seventeenth Amendment. Mr. Deputy Speaker, as stated before, the national institutions mentioned in the Schedule to Article 41B and the offices mentioned in the Schedule to Article 41C contained in Chapter VIIA of the Constitution, are vital components of our national institutional framework. Our honest and sincere efforts must be directed towards ensuring that the sovereign people of Sri Lanka continue to hold these institutions in high regard. The future of our system of democratic governance could well rely on this continued confidence. We must, from this point forward, dedicate ourselves to ensuring the smooth functioning of the Seventeenth Amendment - an integral and essential part of the Constitution of Sri Lanka. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Thank you. . [..4.46] ( ) ( . - )
