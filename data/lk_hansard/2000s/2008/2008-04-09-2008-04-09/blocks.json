The Inspector General of Police, Police Hedquarters, Colombo. Dear Sir, Complaint regarding Intrusion in to my House at Wattala I am having a house at 85/9, Pokuna Road, Hendala, Wattala. Mr. T. jeyasparan a long standing member of my party, EPRLF is the Care-taker of the above house. On the 8th of April early morning at about 2.30 a.m. about five or six men all of whom were in black uniform and with their faces masked went in to the house without any prior information. They forced the Care-taker into one of the rooms and had him detained with one of whom guarding him. The rest went to the backyard of the house, and dug at several places for 15 20 minutes. Then they went off. The man who was guarding my Care-taker told him that they were from the C. I. D. After they left, the Emergency police came to my house about 4.00 a.m. My Care-taker opened the door and the police without saying anything went to backyard directly and saw the place. Then they came back and questioned my Care-taker about the intruders. Then my Care-taker was taken to the Wattala Police Station where he was detained. Later Wattala Police recorded his statement and released him at noon. This house was purchased by me long time back. The neighbours are aware of this fact. I was living there till I shifted last year to parliament Quarters. The Wattala Police also know that this house belongs to me. My Care-taker has registered his name with the Wattala Police as its resident. I have grave suspicion that some elements clothed with legal authority have been responsible for the said incident. It appears that they have acted with the sinister motive to put me into difficulty and cause disrepute to me. In these circumstances, I request you to order an immediate and full scale investigation in respect of the said incident.",

You have been a long-standing Member of this House, and you are also the father of the Captain of the Sri Lankan Cricket Team that won for this country the World Cup. I want to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by the Hon. Prime Minister in respect of the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, Minister of Highways and Road Development and Chief Government Whip when he commenced his speech this morning. There can be no question about it, that all of us are going to miss the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle. He was such an active Member of this House and he was a pleasant person to get along with. It was always interesting and pleasant to interact with him. We shall speak more about the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle when we have a Vote of Condolence in the House in regard to him. But I think it is also my duty, Sir, when we refer to the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, to also remember some of the other Members of Parliament who unfortunately came by their death, during the term of the present Parliament and the first of them was the Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham, a very senior Member of my Party who was gunned down in the Roman Catholic Church in Batticaloa on Christmas Eve when he had gone for Christmas Mass. Mr. Joseph Pararajasingham was in fact a more senior Member of this House than the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle. We also had, Sir, the Hon. Raviraj a very young and capable Member of this House who was gunned downed on a public highway in Colombo within the limits of a High Security Zone. The Hon. Raviraj was a person who got along excellently well with every Member in Parliament to whichever party the Member belonged. We had similarly the Hon. Sivanesan who was killed in a claymore mine explosion. The Hon. D.M. Dassanayake was killed also in a claymore mine explosion and there have been several such deaths, none of which we should approve. Apart from Members of Parliament, there are several young men; Sinhalese, Tamils who are dying everyday as a result of this war. There are men, women and children who have been killed by aerial bombing and multi-barrel locket launcher fire. I have got with me details of some of the more recent killings which I will not go into because I will not have sufficient time. So we must also address our minds to the substantive question of how we can bring all",

    "text": "this violence to an end collectively and what needs to be done to bring about a collective end to all these different aspects of violence that are taking place in the country today as a result of the conflict that continues to fester the body politic of this country. I propose, Sir, in the course of my speech on this Emergency Debate to deal mainly with the so-called Eastern Provincial Elections that are presently said to be taking place and how these elections came about, the dismantling of the merged North-East, the objective of such dismantling, the manner of the conduct of the present Eastern Elections and the objective of such elections. In the course of my speech, Sir, it would be inevitable that the truth be stated. It is not my intention to cause offence to anyone, certainly not to our Sinhala brethren for whom I have the utmost affection. I think, Sir, the future of this country will entirely depend upon the relationship that must develop between all the peoples inhabiting this country, the Sinhalese people, the Tamil people, the Muslim people and with the goodwill and understanding that must prevail amongst all these people. I think that would be the ultimate way to resolve our conflict and that would be a greater contribution than even what politicians can make. I do think, Sir, however that if this tragic conflict in the country is to be brought to an honourable end, the truth will have to be faced because justice cannot be meted out except on the basis of truth. Therefore, whatever I am saying in this House today, is not meant to offend anyone but to only place on record in this House the truth, as I see it, in regard to several vital questions. I had, Sir, in the course of a statement made in Parliament on 7th November, 2006 dealt with the determination of the Supreme Court pertaining to the merged North-East and it is not my intention to repeat myself. There are, however, some salient matters which need to be highlighted and placed on record. One, the merger of the North-East was effected on the recognition that the Northern and Eastern Provinces have been areas of historical habitation of the Sri Lankan Tamil-speaking peoples. Two, the petitioners in the three Fundamental Rights applications before the Court, challenging the merger were not historical inhabitants. The third one, three historical inhabitants of the Eastern Province, Tamil inhabitants, applied to intervene in the said three applications before Court and thereby acquire the opportunity to effectively deal with the alleged infringement of fundamental rights in support of which the petitioners had made several vital averments of facts in their pleadings and raised various legal issues. The petitioners wanted to state facts pertaining to their own rights as historical inhabitants and also respond fully to the several legal issues raised by the petitioners.",

    "text": "Four, the Court on 15th September, 2006 ruled that the Court is of the view that it is unnecessary to consider an application for intervention on individual basis, but that following the practice adopted by this Court in previous matters of public interest, counsel representing the intervenients could appear as amicus and make relevant submissions after the submissions of counsel for the petitioners and counsel for the respondents are concluded and prior to the final reply of counsel for the petitioners. Five, the applications for intervention by the three historical Tamil-speaking inhabitants pertained to vital issues relating to the structure of governance and the fundamental rights of the Tamil-speaking people in the country as a whole and in the North-East in particular. Despite determined efforts by the State to radically alter the demographic composition of the Eastern Province in favour of the Sinhalese, the Tamil-speaking people yet constitute 75 per cent of the population in the Eastern Province. The Tamil-speaking people are an overwhelming majority in the North-East and have a vested interest in the preservation of its linguistic and cultural identity. It must be placed on record that colonization of the Eastern Province with Sinhalese settlers from other parts of the country continued in violation of domestic law, the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact and the Dudley Senanayake-Chelvanayakam Pact, two pacts signed by the Tamil leader, Mr. S.J.V. Chelvanayakam with two Sinhala Prime Ministers in 1957 and 1965 respectively to terminate Sinhala colonization. Six, it must also be placed on record that the consequence of such continued colonization in the Eastern Province was that between 1947, the year of Independence, and 1981, the year of the last available Census for the North-East, the natural national increase in the Sinhala population in the whole country was 238 per cent while the Sinhala population in the same period increased in the Eastern Province by 883 per cent. In other words, between 1947 and 1981, the natural national increase of the Sinhala population throughout the country was just two and a half times while the increase in the Sinhala population between the same period, 1947 to 1981, in the Eastern Province was as much as nine times. This was due to colonization of Sinhala settlers from other districts being carried out by the State in the Eastern Province in violation of the domestic land alienation law, which required that first preference be given to persons living in close proximity to the land to be alienated, and the specific provisions of the two pacts earlier referred to, which were meant to ensure that injustice would not be done to the Tamil-speaking people in the matter of land alienation. Seven, the denial of the right to intervene deprived the historical Tamil-speaking inhabitants, who, despite all the Sinhala colonization, yet constitute 75 per cent of the population in the Eastern Province, the opportunity to fully and effectively state their case before the court both",

Eight, despite the issue before the court being one heavily laden with a racial dimension, the issue was, most unfortunately and tragically, heard by an all-Sinhalese court. The Tamil-speaking historical inhabitants are not satisfied in these circumstances that justice was meted out to them. Nine, according to available information, all foreigners were kept out of the court premises on the date of this particular hearing and several Members of Parliament of the ultra-Sinhala nationalist party, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna and several Buddhist monks with ultra-Sinhala nationalist links were present in court, causing much prejudice to the Tamil intervenient petitioners. Ten, in the context of the several matters referred to above, the historical Tamil-speaking inhabitants of the Eastern Province are not satisfied that the case was considered only from the perspective of securing to every person the equal protection of the law guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution, the essential corollary of such equal protection of the law being the freedom from discrimination based on grounds of race, religion, language et cetera as claimed in the judgment. It must be stated with the utmost respect that the historical Tamil-speaking inhabitants are, on the contrary, convinced that they were victims of discrimination based on race, language et cetera. Eleven, the historical Tamil-speaking inhabitants are convinced that the fundamental basis for an honourable and durable peace in the country, as a whole, has been disrupted by the purported dismantling of the merged North-East and that much injustice has been done to them. I must state, Sir, that if, despite the distinct histories of the distinct peoples who inhabit Sri Lanka, all peoples can be expected to live together in a united country with a permanent 75 per cent Sinhala majority, there can be no justification whatever for the refusal to recognize a Tamil linguistic region in the North-East wherein the position in regard to the different ethnic groups is comparatively quite similar vis--vis one another to that which is prevalent vis--vis each other throughout the country. If this is obstinately denied to the Tamil-speaking people and permitted to prevail, it would be tantamount to the imposition of Sinhala hegemony. I reiterate the position earlier enunciated in the course of my speech in the House on 7th November, 2006 in regard to the validity of the merger of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. There were other issues, Sir, that came up before the court which should have been a bar to the sustainability of the Fundamental Rights applications of the petitioners. The first issue pertained to the applications being time barred. An application to the court, as per the Constitution, must be made within one month of the alleged infringement of a fundamental right.",

    "text": "In this instance, the applications were made almost 18 years after the alleged infringement. It was strongly urged that if the original declaration pertaining to the merger in September, 1988 was bad and therefore invalid, as urged by the petitioners, the subsequent declarations pertaining to the postponement of the date for the holding of a Referendum based upon such merger over a period of 18 years must also be bad and invalid and that such postponements in regard to the date for the holding of the Referendum cannot be taken advantage of to extend the date of the alleged infringement. This contention was strangely not upheld on the question of time bar pertaining to the fundamental rights applications, enabling the petitioners to sustain their applications. The second issue pertained to the immunity of the President. Several judgments of the full benches of the Supreme Court have consistently held that the court cannot inquire into the subjective decision of the President in determining the necessity for Emergency Regulations. The Emergency Regulation framed by President Jayewardene pertaining to operations that have been commenced to secure complete surrender of arms, ammunitions, weapons, explosives or other equipment by such groups can only be construed as having been framed in the interest of public security. An illogical contrary view that by the said regulation the President intended to achieve the opposite of public security resulted in the submissions pertaining to the immunity of the President not being upheld. It would seem as if all avenues of reasoning were tailored to suit a preconceived result. Sir, it must also be pointed out that the requirement \"for the surrender of arms et cetera and the cessation of hostilities\", upon the basis of which the Presidential Proclamation relating to the merger was declared invalid, were not stipulated in the Indo-Lanka Accord of 29th July, 1987 as a precondition for the merger. The Government of India did however provide military assistance when requested by the Government of Sri Lanka as provided for in the Accord. The inclusion of a provision in Section 37 of the Provincial Councils Act for the surrender of arms and the cessation of hostilities as a precondition for the merger was tantamount to the inclusion of a provision not contained in the Indo-Lanka Accord as a precondition for merger. While Section 37 was applicable to all adjoining provinces, the provision regarding the surrender of arms and the cessation of hostilities was made applicable only to the Northern and Eastern Provinces. This was unjust and unequal treatment of the people of the Northern and Eastern Provinces. It is well known that at that time, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, JVP, an armed group, was operating freely with weapons in the adjoining Southern and Western Provinces. Under the provisions of Section 37 of the Provincial Councils Act, the Southern and Western Provinces could have been merged even though there was an armed group operating with arms as the",

    "text": "condition regarding surrender of arms and cessation of hostilities was applicable only to the Northern and Eastern Provinces. This was clearly discriminatory against and unequal treatment of the people of the North-East who are preponderantly Tamil and Tamil- speaking. The petitioner claimed the infringement of a fundamental right, which was to exercise the right to vote at an election for membership of the Eastern Province. This was a right which could accrue to the petitioner only when steps were taken for the constitution of a Provincial Council for the Eastern Province. In the implementation of the provisions of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and the Provincial Councils Act, steps were not taken for the constitution of a Provincial Council for the Eastern Province. The right to vote at an election to the Provincial Council for the Eastern Province did not accrue because no steps were taken for its constitution. When no such right had accrued, the petitioner cannot complain of the infringement of a non-existing right. The petitioner had a right to vote at the North Eastern Provincial Council Election and the Petitioners fundamental right to exercise his franchise was therefore not infringed. Assuming that the impugned Presidential Proclamation was bad and therefore invalid, nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the President had made a declaration that the provisions of Section 37 of the Provincial Councils Act, No. 42 of 1987, would apply to the Northern and Eastern Provinces. This decision and declaration of the President are a reality and cannot be denied. It is only the President who can make a declaration under Section 37. The court cannot question the merits of that declaration and the court has not in the course of its judgment questioned the merits of that decision and declaration of the President. The court has merely questioned the procedure followed in making the Proclamation. The decision and declaration of President Jayewardene that Section 37 of the Provincial Councils Act shall apply to the Northern and Eastern Provinces remains. The incumbent President has taken no action to reverse the decision and declaration of President Jayewardene. Unfortunately, he has not had the courage to cure the alleged procedural defect pointed out in the judgment, though he had assured India, the other party to the Indo-Lanka Accord, the international treaty, that he would ensure that the merger was sustained. The holding of elections to a separate Eastern Provincial Council, a non-existent institution, is in these circumstances, in my submission a farcical exercise. Parliament, Sir, has approved financial allocations in the Appropriation Bill for the North-Eastern Province for over a period of 17 years. Parliament has thereby accepted the validity of the Proclamation made by",

Both the Supreme Legislature and the Supreme Executive have for over a period of 17 years accepted the validity of the North-East merger. It surely cannot be within the power of the Judiciary after 18 years to set at nought what the Supreme Legislature and the Supreme Executive have accepted as valid, for so long. This would be tantamount to a mockery of the whole process of Governance. The mere fact that we do not have a judiciary where our case can be heard does not mean that justice can be denied to us. I table*, Sir, the Estimates in regard to the Provincial Councils including the North-Eastern Provincial Council under the Head - Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Home Affairs, from the year 1990 up to 2006, for a period of 17 years, and request, Sir, with due respect that the said Estimates be included in the Hansard. I would request, Sir, that you initial these documents and that they be handed over to be included in Hansard. The Tamil-speaking people of the North and East also state that the Indo-Lanka Accord of 29th July, 1987 is an international treaty according to the Vienna Convention of the Law of Treaties 1969. The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and the Provincial Councils Act are enabling domestic legislation, and that a party to a treaty cannot invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty. The provision for the merger of the North and the East directly follows from the recognition of the historical habitation of the Tamil-speaking peoples. This is an obligation which in terms of the Indo-Lanka Accord, an international Treaty, the Sri Lankan State cannot avoid. What then, Sir, is the objective of this purported dismantling? That is the question that must be answered. It is my submission that the objective is the taking over of the Eastern Province by ultra Sinhala nationalist groups. This is the outcome of a conspiracy that has been hatched by certain ultra Sinhala nationalist forces who have worked in cohesion for some time. They have thus far achieved, 1. The purported dismantling of the North-East merger; 2. The prevention of the setting up of an interim self-governing arrangement for the North-East;",

If either of the institutions referred to by me at two or three above had been established, it would be my submission that the way would have been opened for the evolution of a peaceful solution to the conflict. The above were all consequences of this conspiracy. The above had to be achieved before the launching of the main thrust, the main programme of this conspiracy. This is the Sinhalization of the East and the reduction of the Tamil-speaking people in the East to the position of an insignificant minority. That programme has now been launched. I would like, Sir, at this point to refer to the Fundamental Rights Application filed by the JVP in the Supreme Court. I refer to, Sir, paragraph 28 of the Fundamental Rights Application filed by the JVP in the Supreme Court - Case No. 243/06. This is what is stated in paragraph 28 of their Fundamental Rights Application. I quote: The Sinhala majority areas aggregate 12 of the Divisional Secretary areas of the Eastern Province. These areas represent 52% of the land area of the province. Sixty two per cent (62%) of the land area in the Trincomalee District and 72% of the land area in the Ampara District are Sinhala majority areas. These areas have always been inhabited by the Sinhalese, and by no other ethnic group. The Tamil majority divisions in the Eastern Province amount to only 32% of the land area. In the Trincomalee District the Tamil majority divisions amount to 6% and in the Ampara District they are only 4% That is the position of the JVP. That is what they have stated in their application filed in court. And, what is the position in regard to the ethnic composition of the Eastern Province? I will read out the figures because they say that they have occupied 62 per cent of the land area in the Trincomalee District and 72 per cent of the land area in the Ampara District and that all the time these areas have been in Sinhalese occupation. I will now read, Sir, the census figures in respect of the Eastern Province. I start with the figures in 1827. That was a religious census at which time the Sinhala population in the Eastern Province was 0.53 per cent, the Tamil population was 74.52 per cent and the Muslim population was 24.72 per cent. What were the figures in 1881 in the Eastern Province, the first official census of the country based upon ethnicity? The Sinhala population in 1881 was 4.66 per cent, the Tamil population was 59.11 per cent and the Muslim population was 33.71 per cent. I will not read out the figures in every ten years. I next move on to 1921 when the Sinhala population in the Eastern Province was 4.53 per cent, the Tamil population was 53.54 per cent and the Muslim population was 39.41 per cent. When the country attained Independence in 1948, according to the 1946 Census, the Sinhala population in the Eastern Province was 9.87 per cent, the Tamil",

We have no evidence in regard to that. I might say, Sir, that according to Sir Paul Peiris, the eminent Sinhala historian - he has written a historical treatise. I am not saying this against the Sinhala people; certainly not. But, I think if there is going to be an honourable peace in this country, certain indisputable facts must be accepted. What does Sir Paul Peiris say in his historical treatise? Long before the advent of Vijaya in this country, there were several Easwarams of Lord Siva in Sri Lanka venerated by the Hindu people, the Tamil people, Koneswaram facing the great bay of Koddiar in Trincomalee, Thiruketheeswaram in Mannar, Munneswaram in Chilaw, Thondeswaram and Naguleswaram in Jaffna. This is the position.

So, we have to, Sir, be responsible in regard to what we state and whatever my Friend might have to say, I want to also place on record certain other vital figures. I am reading from the 1881 Census of Ceylon giving you the position in regard to the Eastern Province, the Trincomalee and the Batticaloa Districts. There was no Ampara District at that point of time. In 1881, in the Batticaloa District, that is the whole of the present Batticaloa and Ampara Districts - I have got the figures AGA Division-wise - there were 5,012 Sinhalese, the Tamils were 61,014 and the Muslims were 37,255. In Trincomalee, in 1881, in all the AGA Divisions, the Sinhalese were 935, the Tamils were 14,394 and the Muslims were 5,746. Taking the Batticaloa District and the Trincomalee District together, that is the present Ampara District, the present Batticaloa District and the Trincomalee District altogether, the Sinhalese were 5,947, the Tamils were 75,408 and the Muslims were 43,001. The resulting position is that the Sinhalese-speaking population in the Eastern Province was 5,947 and the Tamil-speaking population was 118,409. Very unfortunately my Friend was not here during the earlier part of my speech. I referred to certain factual averments made by the JVP when they went to court in their Fundamental Rights application where they made certain claims and said that the Sinhalese have always been in the occupation of this territory and I was on the basis of factual incontrovertible evidence refuting that position. That was what I was doing. I do not want to be misunderstood, Sir. As I have often stated in this House, I am not against the Sinhala people for whom I have the utmost affection. But there must be justice. The truth must prevail. Whatever solution there is, it must be founded on the rock-bottom stone of justice. That cannot be denied. I only want to say this outrageous statement made by the JVP in the court only clearly defines the objective of the ultra Sinhala nationalists and their objective seems to be to devour the Eastern Province. I think this fact needs to be recorded. Seeking to take advantage of new electoral divisions and new administrative divisions they want to take control of large chunks of unoccupied lands encompassed in these divisions and make it appear that all these vacant lands are under Sinhalese occupation. This is more easily achievable in a de-merged North-East, in an East which is swamped by the Sri Lankan Sinhala armed forces supported by a Tamil paramilitary group under the control of the Sri Lankan State. I do not like to get into too many controversies, Sir, but when the LTTE split, it was the Karuna faction that emerged as a main party to that split and it is on that split that the Government seems to depend very heavily today.

So both these documents referred to the North-East as one unit which has been the political philosophy of the Tamil people from the time of the formation of the Federal Party in 1949 and has been consistently endorsed by the Tamil people at every Parliamentary Election since 1956 and at Local Authority Elections and under the DDC elections in 1981. I have got the results with me, Sir, but I will not have the time to place it before the House. In 1956, in 1960 March, in 1960 July, in 1965, in 1970 and in 1977, at all Local Authority Elections, including the Local Authority Elections held recently in the Trincomalee and Ampara Districts under the present Government. And the DDC Elections held in 1981, the first election held on the basis of some autonomy district-wise, the districts of Jaffna, Mannar, Vavuniya, Mullaitivu, Trincomalee and Batticaloa, the TULF was returned, the TULF won. Only in Ampara we could not win, the UNP won and that was because there was no Muslim Congress at that point of time. If there was the Muslim Congress at that point of time, the Muslim Congress would have won and not the UNP. That is why we say, Sir, and we say so with much repentance and much regret, that the ultra Sinhala nationalists are working overtime to sinhalasize the Eastern Province. Once before when I spoke in this House, I spoke about the land being cleared for the construction of houses for soldiers in the Eastern Province in a place called Rotawewa. The Government has been silent in regard to that matter. The Government has not spoken about that matter. But we like to know what the position is. Thousands and thousands of houses were to be built for soldiers in the Trincomalee District in the Eastern Province . Why in the Eastern Province? Why not in their respective areas where they live, from where they come, to which they belong? About 1000 acres of land close to the Shastriveli STF camp in the Pottuvil area occupied by the Muslims, is to be allocated to the Shastriveli Buddhist Temple. \"Environment\" is the buzz word now in some quarters of the Government that needs",

    "text": "to be deployed to constrict the use of land by the Tamil-speaking people in the North-East that if the land is not used by the Tamil-speaking people - the Tamils and the Muslims - it will be available for Sinhala colonization whenever required. It has been said, Sir, by a Venerable Monk that Saudi Arabia and not the Eastern Province is the homeland of the Muslims and Tamil Nadu and not the Eastern Province is the homeland of the Tamils. This is something, Sir, that we cannot accept. I say with authority and with a very clear conscience that we the Tamils have been living in this country as long as anybody else. Our Muslim brethren have also been living in this country for a very long period of time, several hundreds of years. The Eastern Province is their home. The Eastern Province has been the home of the Tamil-speaking people. We welcome the Sinhalese people there. They are our brothers. What we have always opposed is State-aided Sinhala colonization. That is what we have opposed. We have never said, the Eastern Province is exclusively the home of the Tamil-speaking people. No. I will not say it; not under any circumstances. But we have always said the Eastern Province must not be colonized. Now, I want to refer to something else, Sir. This is why I say, we must have justice. Two hundred and thirty seven \"Tharuna Aruna\" graduates have been recruited recently to be employed in various sectors in the Eastern Provincial Council. These are the persons who in due course who will assume different positions of responsibility in different sectors in the Eastern Province. Every one of these 237 graduate recruits, is a Sinhalese; not a single Tamil, not a single Muslim. How can you justify this? The 237 \"Tharuna Aruna\" graduates will come to hold responsible positions in different sectors in the Eastern Province in the years to come? Every one of them is a Sinhalese; not one Tamil, not one Muslim. Are you not trying to Sinhalasize the Eastern Province? What is the Governments answer to that? The Chairman of the Official Languages Commission recently reported that only 8 per cent of those in Public Service in the country are Tamil-speaking while the Tamil-speaking percentage in the country is around 25 per cent. This constitutes the main difficulty in implementing the provisions pertaining to the official language, particularly the use of Tamil. In the whole Public Service of the country the Tamil-speaking are only 8 per cent and today in the Eastern Province where the Tamil-speaking people are 75 per cent, you make recruitment that is 100 per cent Sinhala. When you recruit 237 graduates there is not one Tamil, not one Muslim. It does not stop there, Sir. The Sinhala colonization does not stop there. Cabinet approval had been granted in December, 2007 for a proposal for the implementation of a High Density Multi-Storey Special Housing Project in Trincomalee town, in the Love Lane area to accommodate all these new Sinhala recruits and others to be recruited in the future. A High Density Multi-Storey Special Housing Project.",

Is it not abundantly clear, Sir, that an insidious agenda is afoot in the Eastern Province? It would be outrageous to do some such thing in a merged North-East. It is no less unjust to do such a thing in the East which is 75 per cent Tamil-speaking but the belief is that you can get away with it. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You have been advised wrongly. The Love Lane Housing Project is for tsunami relocation and it will be for Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims. Please do not misinterpret facts. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Anyway, I do not think, I have got my facts wrong but if you think that it will be done in a more reasonable way, let us see. If there is a merged North-East you cannot do these things so easily and get away. In Trincomalee, today, Sir, in the Eastern Province, words such as \"conflict area\", \"war-torn area\", \"the North-East\" are taboo, because the international community is prepared to help people in the war-torn area, help people in the conflict area. The officials there, I do not want to talk about them. I am not accustomed to attacking officials on the Floor of the House. I have never done that. But they are so crazy. If someone said, \"War-torn?\", the answer would be, \"No, no\", \"Conflict\"? \"No, no\". Everybody is the same - because the international agencies are particularly kind and want to help people in the war-torn areas and conflict affected areas. This policy is being pursued particularly to harm the Tamil people and they think that the Tamil people should be harmed in this way. Before I proceed any further, Sir, and before I conclude, I would like to place on record a statement made by my good Friend, the late Hon. Anura Bandaranaike. He was not a run-of-the-mill ordinary politician, Sir, and he may have not been a very successful politician but, I think, he was a statesman who had exemplary qualities and he was after all the son of two Prime Ministers, much respected Prime Minister Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike and (Hon.) Mrs. Bandaranaike were his parents. What did he say in this House? He made this statement in this House, Sir, on the 5th of April 2007 and this is what he clearly said. I quote: As an individual, my personal belief- I am not talking about the Government or anybody else- is that the talks with the LTTE must resume without delay, that we must once again merge the North and East and maximum devolution within a united Sri Lanka is the only solution to this problem. I told him, You must get them to take the correct view.",

Bandaranaike was not allowed to live in this country. He contemplated this in 1957. In the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact, the Hon. Bandaranaike conceded the amalgamation of regions beyond provincial boundaries because he knew that was the only solution to the problem. The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike knew that four successive Presidents had accepted the merger, that the date for the holding of a Referendum had been postponed no less than 26 times by four successive Presidents; that every one of them had on every one of those occasions, accepted the validity of the merger of the North-East; that India and the international community looked upon the merged North-East as the cornerstone of the peace process; that India wanted the merger restored as per the Indo-Lanka Accord; that very clear messages had been conveyed to President Mahinda Rajapaksa and that the Governments current course of action would inevitably have perilous consequences. That history, the Hon. Anura Bandaranaike knew, Sir, for certain and I want to state on the Floor of this House that you will disregard the advice given to you by the late Hon. Anura Bandaranaike only at your own peril. I have issued a statement, Sir, in regard to the election in the Eastern Provincial Council.

May I ask you with due respect, would the Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike have ever done this? Would the Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike have ever done this, signing a pact with a paramilitary group? I am not blaming that paramilitary group. They are a young group of individuals. They are young Tamils who have some problem. They are in some difficulty. They are facing some problems and some difficulties. I am not blaming them. We would like them to come into the democratic process. We would welcome that.

It is this Government which claims to be a democratically-elected government, which is misusing that paramilitary group, using the muscle power, the gun power of that paramilitary group to compel the Tamil people in the Eastern Province, to act in a certain way politically in violation of their continuous verdicts from 1956 up to now, to show the world that you have some support amongst the Tamil people for what you are doing. I tabled in this House, in the course of an Adjournment Motion on 18th September, 2007 which followed a debate that took place sometime earlier, the names of over 260 people, all civilians, who have been killed during that war in the Eastern Province; Tamil men women and children. I want to ask the Government, \"Have you paid any compensation to any one of those people, all civilians, who were killed by aerial bombardment and multi-barrel rocket launcher fire?\" I gave you the names on the Floor of this House; I tabled those names in Parliament. Have you paid any compensation to any one of those people? Have you paid any compensation in regard to the houses destroyed? Have you paid any compensation for the plantations destroyed, the crops destroyed, the livestock destroyed, the fishing equipment destroyed and the agricultural equipment destroyed? Nothing at all. Not one cent has been paid.

Are these the policies you are going to place before the Tamil people, the Tamil-speaking people in the Eastern Province when you are asking for their vote? Is that your position? Come clean, be honest, be straight forward. No, you will not do that. You will try to use the TMVP, the muscle power and the gun power of the TMVP, to get some votes, win the election, if you can, and try to tell the world that the Tamil people are with you.

You got him a diplomatic passport, you got him a visa, you sent him for a conference in regard to climate change, probably sponsored by your new Minister of Environment and Natural Resources, who is being very clever, and that poor, bright, smart military commander is now cooling his heels in a prison in UK. Why did you do this to him? Is this fair? You used him and you dumped him. That is the truth. That is what you will do with the present TMVP leadership. Once you have used the TMVP leadership to win the election, if you can, that is what you will do with them. You will crush them like a crushed orange and you will dump them. You will probably send them to some other country; not London again because they would not give you a visa and you will get them arrested there, to cool their heels there, and you think you can go ahead with your programmes. This is what you are tying to do. Please do not try these tricks. The Tamil people are very intelligent, very resilient people. We are not against the Sinhala people. There is not one Sinhalese man in Trincomalee who will say, Sampanthan did any harm to us. Not one man will say that. I can stand in this House and say that with courage because that is the truth. They will say, Mahaththaya will talk for his people, but he will never harm us. If we would go and ask him for some help, he will speak for us\". We have been nurtured in a certain philosophy. We have grown in a certain political tradition. We are not against the country, but we want self-rule, substantial self-rule in a merged North-East which has been accepted by an international treaty as the homeland, the areas of historical habitation of the Tamil-speaking people. You cannot go against that. If you try to go against that, you will be only laying the seeds for the separation of this country which will become an inevitable, inexorable process not because we want it but because you want things to go that way. I want to ask you, your armed forces have swarmed the Eastern Province. Even the paramilitary group is with you, supporting the army and an all-pervasive military environment prevails in the Eastern Province.",

    "text": "Statement issued By Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi (I.T.A.K.) Tamil National Alliance (TNA) regarding the Eastern Elections. I. President Mahinda Rajapaksa who was elected to office in November 2005 by a wafer thin majority with the support of the Jathika Hela Urumaya. (JHU) the Mahajana Ekshath Peramuna, (MEP) and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna. (JVP) has adopted an ultra-Sinhala nationalist role and every decision that he has made whether it be political military or humanitarian has had as its objective the fostering of ultra-Sinhala nationalism. He has projected himself too, as an ultra Sinhala nationalist leader. II. So-called efforts, to evolve a political solution to the national conflict, have been merely a charade, as has been clearly demonstrated with the proposal after eighteen months of deliberations, to implement provisions which have existed in the Sri Lankan Constitution for more than 19 years. What is proposed to be implemented is less than what the existing provisions provided for; a bifurcated North-East as opposed to the original merged North-East with no police nor land powers, and even the original provisions vastly diluted by judicial interpretation. III. The preponderantly Tamil linguistic contiguous Northern and Eastern Provinces were merged following the 1987 International Treaty between India and Sri Lanka. The merged territory existed for eighteen years and was accepted by four successive Presidents of Sri Lanka. The JVP was able to obtain in a fundamental rights application, a judicial declaration, after a period of eighteen years, that there was a procedural flaw in effecting the merger. The historical Tamil inhabitants of the East who sought to intervene were denied the right to intervene and fully and effectively state their case. President Mahinda Rajapaksa was offered the required support to legislatively remedy the alleged procedural flaw, and thereby uphold an international Treaty, which had been upheld by all four of his predecessors. He was cautioned by the international community that the existing territorial arrangement pertaining to the merged North-East was the cornerstone of the peace process, and that it should not be disturbed. President Rajapaksa chose to follow the ultra-Sinhala nationalist path, and protect his image as an ultra-Sinhala nationalist leader. He thereby denied the historical Tamil-speaking inhabitants, the benefits of the Indo-Sri Lanka International Treaty. IV. The Mahinda Rajapaksa Government commenced intense Military attacks in the preponderantly Tamil Linguistic contiguous North-East accompanied by severe aerial bombardment of and the firing of multi-barrel rocket launchers into civilion populated villages. Thought it was claimed that the Military attacks were aimed at the LTTE, the victims were largely Tamil and also in some instances Muslim civilians. Very many hundreds of civilians were killed. Several hundreds of civilians were maimed and seriously injured. Civilian property inclusive of houses, plantations, crops, livestock, farming and fishing equipment, were destroyed. Over 500,000 Tamil civilians have been displaced rendered destitute and impoverished. Public buildings such as places of worship and school buildings have been destroyed. Meanwhile, extra judicial killings and enforced disappearances of individual Tamils, particularly in the North-East and also in other parts of the country, by sections of the Sri Lankan armed forces and paramilitary groups collaborating with the Sri Lankan armed forces is a regular occurrence. This is done to terrorise the Tamils and compel them to flee the country. V. The military attacks of the Rajapaksa Government are continuing and the ultimate objective of the Rajapaksa Government is to military subdue and subjugate the Tamil-speaking civilian population. Not being willing nor able to evolve an acceptable political solution, the Rajapaksa Government would attempt to impose on the Tamil-speaking people in the North-East some worthless political arrangement. VI. Hurriedly holding an election in the bifurcated East is a diabolical step in this direction. VII. As a smokescreen for all its misdeeds against the Tamil People, the Rajapaksa Government has entered into an alliance with a",

The Rajapaksa Governments clear aim is to rebut the legitimate political goals of the Tamil-speaking people, for the right to substantial self-rule based upon the principle of internal self-determination in the areas that they have historically inhabited, and to reverse whatever progress has been made in that direction. It is also the objective of the Rajapaksa Government to Sinhalise the Eastern sector of the North Eastern region, in the guise of development, and to achieve this purpose, have declared certain parts of the Eastern sector as High Security Zones, Industrial Zones, Environmental Zones and so on. The Government which needs funds to fulfill this objective of Sinhalising the Eastern sector needs a Tamil lackey as a front to raise funds for development. IX. The TMVP which is at the mercy of the Rajapaksa Government is prepared to follow the directives of the Rajapaksa Government. The Rajapaksa Government is also using the TMVP to compel and coerce the Tamil people to vote for the TMVP, which the Rajapaksa Government would claim as support by the Tamil people for the policies of his Government. The Government expects the Tamil people who have suffered immensely by reason of the military attacks and who live in a military environment, to be submissive to the demands of the armed TMVP. The TMVP is a para-military group well armed and with the license to punish the Tamil people defying their demands after the elections. The law enforcement machinery has never taken any action against the TMVP despite their frequent transgressions of the law. Both the TMVP and the Tamil people are aware of this. X. No other Government since independence has inflicted such immense harm on the Tamil people as this Government has done in the past two years. The Tamil-speaking people should not fall into the dangerous trap that is being laid to bring about their downfall in their areas of historical habitation. This is an election at which through the visible or invisible fire and muscle power of the TMVP and Government armed forces, President Rajapaksa hopes to implement his insidious political agenda. XI. The Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi (ITAK) after very careful consideration has taken the decision that it should not compromise on its fundamental political principles and be seen as being a participant in an electoral process the objective of which is diametrically opposed to such fundamental principles and a reversal of what the Tamil people have stood for, during more than the past half a century. For these reasons the I.T.A.K. will not contest the Eastern Elections. Sigd. Mavai S. Senathirajah R.
