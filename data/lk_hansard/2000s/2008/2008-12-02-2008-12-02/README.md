2433 2434

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

I cannot canvass with the Hon. Minister. No problem . But your Chief Minister says that he has absolutely no powers. If Rs. five million is given to a doctor. I appreciate that. Very good, but give the same Rs. five million to the armed forces, personnel and pollice officers as well. If the Government decides to pay Rs. five million to a doctor why not give the same benefit to those who are valiantly fighting. There should not be any distinction. Life is life. Whether it is Nimal Siripala, Somadasa Podi Menike or Ashraff or whether it is Samanthan, all are the same. ensure that its is equal to everyone.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva)

But, under your Government did you pay Rs. five million as compensation to the army personal and 168 officers attached to the military intelligence Service who were killed at the time of signing the Peace Accord. Did you pay Rs. five million to each of them? No. So, why are you now harping on it? That is wrong.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

It is this Government that has accepted that Muthaliph was killed by the army officer who is in custody who says that, it was done by him and not by anybody else. So your own investigation have found that people who do these things are within the army it self who have been bought for money. This has nothing to do with the UNP and nothing to do with the SLFP.

( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition)

The other man was killed in - [Interruption]

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva)

What did you do? You exposed the army personnel and you completely sabotaged the actions of the military intelligence of the Army.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe)

You do not talk about the Intelligence Service of the North. I will tell you what Kapila Hendavitharana is doing if, you want to come out. Certainly I will not do it because I do not want that to let down the security forces. If you want to know what happened then and what Kapila Hendavitharana did -

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva)

You have already let down the Security forces on several occasions under your government as well as now. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe)

Do not talk nonsense just sit down. ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva)

You internationally let down not only the security force but the country itself. You have such a bad reputation. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe)

You should have cancelled the CFA in 2004 if you though that was bad. You carried on and like everyone else in your party you supported me in 2005 when I was going to implement it as the Presidential candidate. What nonsense are you talking now? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

You could see that. We protected people like the late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar-he got thirty five cars and four houses-who was killed during Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas time. That was not the UNP. :

: : SRI LANKANS STRANDED IN BANGKOK : STATEMENT BY DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila - Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs) Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Hon. Leader of the Opposition raised a matter about the Sri Lankans stranded in Bangkok and we feel that it is our duty to enlighten this House on that. Following political developments and unrest and the surrounding of the two airports Suvarnabhumi, the new airport, and Don Muang, the old airport, in Thailand about 360 Sri Lankans have been stranded at these two airports. The Thai authorities deserve our gratitude for evacuating the stranded passengers and for putting them in hotels. They have graciously provided them with hotel accommodation and meals at the expense of the Thai Government. In the meantime, the Sri Lankan Embassy in Bangkok is looking at all options available to send the stranded Sri Lankans to their destination. I must thank the Chairman of the SriLankan Airlines and the Hon. Minister of Aviation for having the Sri Lankan Airlines flight diverted from Hong Kong to pick up passengers from the alternate airport given by the Thai authorities. I am happy to state that last night 103 passengers were airlifted by the SriLankan Airlines. Our Mission has assisted to obtain permission for the SriLankan Airlines flight to land at the U-Tapao Airbase in Thailand. A second flight is also scheduled to go to Thailand tonight and I expect that a further hundred passengers would be coming on that flight. Our Mission in Bangkok is also looking at the possibility of sending some of the stranded Sri Lankans by an overland route to Malaysia. In this connection, they have already made arrangements through a reputed travel agency to organize a luxury bus service to ferry the stranded passengers to Kuala Lumpur at a cost of around US Dollars 65 to 70 per passenger. The travel agency will also assist them to obtain the required transit visas to enter Malaysia. A question was raised yesterday about the military personnel returning from Haiti. We have checked and have been advised by the Defence Attache in Bangkok that he has no knowledge of any military personnel being stranded and this morning I spoke to the Ambassador who also confirmed that up to this morning no military personnel had contacted them. - [Interruption.] This morning the Ambassador has -

2465 2466

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I thought it was done by you all. Anyway, let that credit come to you.

( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila ) No, because the Ambassador confirmed with me this morning - [Interruption.] I will get the details. It must be stated that the Ambassador himself has visited the hotels where large numbers of Sri Lankans were accommodated. The Country Manager of the SriLankan Airlines has done his best to obtain whatever assistance he could from the airline and is also looking into the possibility of diverting more flights, if necessary, after today. We have also set up a hotline at the Sri Lanka Embassy in Bangkok for the next of kin of those stranded to contact, if necessary. The Ambassador, Prof. Dissanayake was personally present at the airbase when the first SriLankan Airlines flight carrying the stranded Sri Lankans took off last night. Hon. Leader of the Opposition, we are closely monitoring the situation.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) The problem is, you have delayed the rescuing of those stranded. The reason is, when you appoint non-career diplomats, they do not know how to set about it. ( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila ) That has nothing to do with this. There has been no delay. I categorically deny that. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) No. Wait, wait. ( ) (The Hon. Hussain Ahamed Bhaila ) Hon. Speaker, under Standing Order No. 23(5) a Ministerial Statement cannot be debated. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Now, look at what happened to your President. He wanted an interview with the Head of State in Italy. But, your Ambassador could not get that. He has said, " " The President has said that and it appeared in the press. What are you talking?

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( )

( - , ) (The Hon. Janaka Bandara Tennakoon - Minister of Local Government and Provincial Councils) -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The letter written by the Kolonnawa Urban Council yesterday and the letter written by Dr. P. Ramanujam on the 26th will bear testimony to that. I think an unwarranted statement was made that it is a UNP Council because the UDA had congratulated the Council for doing a service that they did not think it could have done. I only wanted to add on because I thought it was little mischievous, amiable Minister, that you should have mentioned why a UNP Councillor is doing so.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) If there is an Agreement or if he has written to you, I will accept it and I am ready to call the Chairman and the Council. Let him come with a delegation and meet me because I know that even yesterday they blocked the approval of the Kolonnawa Development Programme. The Council has postponed it by four and a half months.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) No, no. That is not the reason. - [Interruption.] Lal Peiris is an unknown character as far as we are concerned. - [Interruption.] There are so many. - [Interruption.] I will call him.

: 2008 30 " " : 2008 30 " " PRIVILEGE : THE SUNDAY LEADER REPORT OF 30TH NOVEMBER, 2008 ( )

( - , ) (The Hon. Dew Gunasekara -Minister of Constitutional Affairs and National Integration) Mr. Speaker, I thank you for permitting me to raise this matter relating to a breach of Privilege. There was a banner headline in the The Sunday Leader newspaper dated 30th November, 2008 relating to the rent allowance drawn by the Hon. Ministers. In the body of the news item there was a reference to me, which states, I quote: In another instance we find Minister of Constitutional Affairs and National Integration, D.E.W. Gunasekara who receives a monthly house rent of Rs. 100,000 receiving Rs. 2.4 million collectively as house rent between June 2004 to December 2007. Besides, Minister Gunasekara also had his comforts increased and a power generator was installed at his house at the cost of Rs. 1.75 million,.. I table* that news item, Sir, as Annex I. In this connection, I wish to refer to Columns 1987 to 1989 of Hansard of 21st October, 2008, wherein it has been recorded that I tabled an Answer in response to a Question raised by the Hon. Nihal Galappaththi on behalf of the Hon. R.P.A. Ranaweera Pathirana. I table* that Hansard of 21.10.2008 as Annex II. I verified whether my Answer has been correctly recorded in Hansard. I found that it was perfectly correct. My Answer given on the Floor of this House explicitly shows the exact position with regard to the rent allowance drawn by me and also with regard to the cost of the generator referred to. Now, Sir, I take the second matter relating to the generator. The cost of the generator was Rs. 147,000 whereas according to the The Sunday Leader newspaper of 30th November, 2008, the cost was Rs. 1.75 million. "Million" is given in words, not in figures. So, there is no jumble of figures. I must explain here, Sir, that the generator was installed at the insistence of the security for security reasons. In fact, I should recall that as early as 1988 when I was an Opposition Member of Parliament, I was given a generator by the then UNP Government similarly, at the insistence of the security. In fact, I had

the experience when the power was cut off, seven terrorists jumped over the gate with guns in their hands and I saved my life because of the generator which had been made automatically operative. So, it was installed not on my insistence but on the insistence of the security. The other thing is that the cost of the generator is Rs. 147,000 whereas it was reported that the cost is Rs. 1.75 million. Then, Sir, the same article in page 15 states, I quote:

.Minister Gunasekara also had his comforts increased and a power generator was installed at his house at the cost of Rs.1.75 million, . It is not at all a comfort. It is a discomfort when it starts working, Sir.

Now, I shall come back to the first matter relating to rent allowance. Sir, I assumed duties as the Minister of Constitutional Affairs and National Integration in June, 2004. An official residence was not available at that time. Although I applied for one I did not get it and I did not own a house in Colombo or elsewhere. Sir, I have not drawn any rent allowance, not a red cent from June 2004 till December 2006, for two and a half years. In terms of the Public Administration Circular No. 19/2006 dated 28th November, 2006, I was paid a rent allowance of Rs. 45,000 from January, 2007 to May, 2007 plus a payment in respect of water and electricity bills. As from June, 2007, I was paid a rent allowance of Rs. 100,000 including water bills and electricity bills. That was paid in terms of the Public Administration Circular No.10/2007 dated 9th May, 2007. So, Sir, the total rent allowance drawn by me from June, 2004 to December, 2007, for three and a half years, was only Rs. 925,000 whereas according to the "Sunday Leader" of 30th November, 2008, the amount that I have received as rent allowance was Rs. 2.4 million. Hypothetically, Sir, even if I had received a rent allowance at the same rate from June 2004 to December 2007, still it would not come to that figure. So, Sir, how can I draw such an amount to which I am not legally entitled to. If I have not said the truth to the House, you will have to investigate and come to a conclusion and punish me. If my Secretary has missed to inform me, then, I will have to take action against her.

These two news items relating to me are not based on facts and figures. I do not want to make any more comments at this stage. I leave it to you to decide, as you are the custodian of our rights and privileges. It is mischievous, malicious and damaging to me. My secretary who is my chief accounting officer is no less a person than the daughter of your predecessor the late Hon. K.B. Ratnayake. I am fortunate to have such a secretary of high integrity, because she will be the last person to authorize even if I wanted to, because she is a strict disciplinarian as far as finance is concerned.

* * . . Placed in the Library.

2469 2470

The worst is, Sir, this news item has originated from Parliamentary records. The press says so. That is precisely why I have raised this as a matter of Privilege. Otherwise, I would have sent a correction and left the matter at that stage. Therefore, these are apparently based on either conjectures, imaginations, manufactured stories, distortions or whatever it is, I do not know.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I know that. I am just mentioning it. But Hon. Minister, you have appointed Major General Asoka Thoradeniya as the Chairman of the CPC. I know he was a good officer as far as the Military Police is concerned. But if he is going to be the person to take over a corporation with a debt of Rupess two billion, can you make a statement on that tomorrow? That is all I want.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva)

Hon. Leader of the Opposition, I must tell you very emphatically that appointments are done according to our wish and will, and that you cannot dictate terms to us. You are not governing. You think, you are in the Government. But you are in the Opposition. Please be mindful of that and you will be in the Opposition for some further time.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe)

Hon. Speaker, all I ask is whether the Government will make a statement.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe)

Okay. Then, Hon. Speaker, I have not in anyway challenged their right to make appointments. For instance, they have appointed Mr. Nivard Cabraal as the Governor of the Central Bank to ensure 11 per cent growth under the Mahinda Chintana. All I can tell the Government is, you cannot put a donkey and win the Derby.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva)

Hon. Leader of the Opposition, he was one of your Provincial Council Members. Earlier he was a member of your party. Are you appointing donkeys to the provincial councils?

Sir, the Chairman of the Select Committee, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, in fact admitted that there were certain reservations by some of the parties. Sir, there must be some sanctity attached to the decisions taken at the Select Committee. The Chairman is aware that at the last sitting, an undertaking was given that this Bill would not be presented before it is taken up at the Consultative Committee of the Ministry. We were to discuss some of the issues of concern at the Consultative Committee and now -

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena)

You are a very senior Member of the House. The Minister is only presenting the Bill. Then, it will be referred to the Consultative Committee.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

I know but -

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena)

The Government is not going to rush tomorrow with this Bill. Please understand. That is the assurance we gave. The Hon. Minister gave the assurance that it will be discussed further in the Consultative Committee. Now, you get up and say that it was not taken up - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

My point is different, Mr. Speaker. In case we are dissatisfied with the Ministers response at the Consultative Committee, we must have sufficient time to prepare to go to courts. Now, we are being prevented and given only one weeks time. You have presented that Bill in Parliament. So, we will be out of time if the Consultative Committee does not meet. That assurance becomes futile because our recourse to courts is now limited only to one week. That is my objection here. There must be some sanctity attached to the agreements that we reach in a Committee of Parliament.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) . . .

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Speaker, the issue is different. [Interruption.] Now we have only one week to go to courts because there is no point in discussing with the Minister anymore. We know the intention of the Government because they have presented it and now it is up to the Government to reject any amendments we put forward. So, we cannot expect any justice from a Government which is not prepared to abide by its undertakings in a Select Committee. [Interruption.]

2481 2482

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Minister, all parties have to co-operate with you in resolving the ethnic issue. Now, there are parties which have reservations on this. If you are not going to work with them on this issue, how on earth can you get their support for the major issue? So, I would suggest to give him time and thereafter if you are not agreeable, you can go ahead with it. Then they can go to courts. But, if you all are not willing to deal with the smaller parties on this issue, do you think that they will be willing to deal with you on the major issues? I do not think so.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Just a few minutes ago you said that - [Interruption.] Please! now you have spoken. Give me the chance. You said that until the Seventeenth Amendment is fully implemented you cannot co-operate. Now, the position you are taking is very clear. That, we understand. The Bill has been presented. We are not going to rush. The Hon. Minister has given an assurance that it will be taken up at the Consultative Committee. The Hon. Minister will agree to discuss it even in a day or two, or even three or four days. But, if you all are only interested in blocking it by saying, Until the Seventeenth Amendment is fully implemented, we do not want electoral reforms in this country, it is a political position that you are taking. There is very little room to exchange views, to have a dialogue, if you take that position.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . -

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Minister, there are two issues. Firstly, it is the UNPs position which I explained. But in this instance I did not think of the UNP. , . - here, I did not explain the position of the UNP. I said about the small parties. They did not take up the same position. As far as we are concerned, Yes. We want the Seventeenth amendment to be implemented, because now we have discussed that with the Prime Minister and there is no problem between the two of us. I told the President, If you have any objection, let us know. He has not done it and we are going to courts the day after tomorrow. So, why do you not finish this off? Obviously, if there was an issue he would have called us. If you do that, then we also can participate. Forget about us for the time being. Whatever stand we take on this, we

have given you our views on the political solution. But, you have to work with these parties. The Muslims have to be represented, the Tamils have to be represented, other parties like JVP has to be represented. Do that. That is all I have to say. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I agree. All of them will have the chance, even at the last stage before the Minister brings it back to the House, to have a discussion and move any amendment which could be accommodated. The Hon. Minister would then accommodate it. But, you must also agree, Hon. Leader of the Opposition, that the Muslims of this country are also represented on this side of the House. It is not only the Hon. Rauff Hakeem who represents the Muslims of this country. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Even we represent the Muslims - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You represent. That is very good - [Interruption.] But, the thing is that you do not want to make a decision until the Seventeenth Amendment is implemented. That is the thing. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) We cannot stall the legislation or anything. Hon. Minister, can you look into the case of what is happening to those Muslim students after the 5th and take some action - [Interruption.] You are from the Colombo District. I am also from the Colombo District. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Muslims are represented on that side but they all faced elections under our Party and then they all have been bought over and given portfolios. That is what has happened - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You ended up in the UNP. You gave up the SLMC and went and contested under the - [Interruption.] ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . 2009 .

: : Document tabled : Sri Lanka: Road Development Authority conceded 98 percent of the countrys roads are in bad shape Thu, 2007-05-10 02-50 By Quintus Perera Asian Tribune Colombo, 10 May, (Asiantribun. Co.) : The factors leading to massive number of road accidents deaths and loss of property and major inundation of rods is now attributed to utterly improper planning of road construction. It is now evident that road constructions are planned without adequate provision for drainage or pavements for pedestrians MBS Fernando, Chairman, Road Development Authority conceded that 98 percent of the countrys roads are in bad shape suggesting that due to this fact there would be 2,500 road deaths per annum which would be more than the death toll due to the ethnic conflict. He was speaking at the Press Briefing of the Chamber of Construction Industry of Sir Lanka (CCI) held at Galle Face Hotel to announce the holding of Excon 2007-the annual trade fair of the CCI which Commence on Friday 11th and end today Sunday 13th at the BMICH. This years theme of Excon 2007 is to build capacities by promoting linkages among the industry stakeholders as CCI believes that domestic construction industry capacity building should necessary include promotion of larger companies to undertake overseas construction projects while, SME Sector of the industry which accounts for more that 80 percent should be encouraged to from consortiums, establish joint ventures and look at mergers and acquisitions. At this press Briefing CCI has arranged the representatives of the sponsors to address the media on their areas of interest. Fernando continuing said that about 10 years ago the road construction industry in the country was in the hands of the Government, but today the conditions are different. Today there are more than 50 private sector contractors involved in the road construction industry. He said that there are contractors who could even compecte with the international contractors and for the first time one contractors has won a contract for Rs. 4 1/2 billion. He said that he did not prefer super highways constructed in the country as more the super highways more the supper highways more the speed friends and more the speed friends more that accidents and death toll. His revealing of the stark realties of the heavy death toll on the roads due to had shape of the roads also suggests that important basic requirements of road construction are ignored and neglected such as proper pavements for the pedestrians and drainage. He also conceded that large portion of roads are maintained by the local authorities and they maintain those roads with the rate payers money, which is inadequate whereas though the RDA handles less roads that are getting enormous funding from various international funding agencies and thus the roads RDA maintains are better than those maintained by the local authorities. He said that out of the 100,000 kilometers of roads they maintain only 11,000 kilometers. He pointed out that private vehicles which transport only one or two occupants take much road space whereas large vehicles like buses take a large number and therefore everybody must have to be encouraged to use public transport so that less road space would be used.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) circular . , , VIP . ** . : : Letter tabled : RAVI KARUNANAYAKE F.C.M.A. MEMBER OF PARLIMAENT - UNITED NATIONAL PARTY ORGANISER - SRI JAYAWARDANAPURA KOTTE CHAIRMAN - COLOMBO DISTRICT SECRETARY - INTERNATIONA RELATIONS 17TH November 2008. Mr. Jank de Silva Senior State Counsel Attorney Generals Department Hulftsdorp Colombo 12. Dear Mr. De Silva, Borrowings made by the Government in 2008 to re-pay debts At the Meeting had today in Parliament you gave an Opinion, that borrowings by the Government during this year 2008, to re-pay debts, need not be approved by Parliament. Your contention was that the Supreme Court Detemination on the Appropriation Bill 2008, which is in respect of the Year 2009, had made no direction in relation to 2008, How could the Supreme Court have dealt with the year 2008, when the matter before the Supreme Court was the Appropriation Bill 2008 for the year 2009? In the light of the Determinatiion by the Supreme Court that re-payment of borrowings have to be included in the expenditure at Clause

2(1), if such borrowings are to be re-paid from further borrowings to be raised during the year 2009, it stands to reason that the same issue of constitutionality is applicable for this year 2008 also. In the above circumstances, please confirm your Opinion in writing, that the borrowings made during the year 2008 to re-pay debt, not included in the expenditure for the year 2008 in the Appropriation Act 2007, are constitutionally valid and need not have had the prior approval of the Parlaiment ? Since Parliament had not approved such borrowings to re-pay debts in this year 2008, how could such borrowings then be constitutionally valid? Yours faithfully, (Sgd.)

When we make this a model depot, we will be able to get more income, more revenue and more profits. . . . , train service GMR . . . , berth . . When we say, Batticaloa train, it is the train that carries the people in Kekirawa, Hingurakgoda, Polonnaruwa, Manampitiya and Welikanda to their destinations from Maho onwards. It is not only that. As you know, the people from Panama, Pottuvil, Ampara and Kalmunai also travel in this train. Sometime back, I remember there were two express buses operating from the Batticaloa Railway Station, one to Ampara and one to Hingurana. So, the people were able to reach their homes within an hours time. So, we must improve this train service because it is not only serving the people living in Batticaloa but also the people in the Ampara District. There are only a limited number of berths there. You must try to double it. If you get new compartments, kindly think about the Batticaloa train also. . . , . - I think, the Chief Executive Officer is Mr. Dammika - . . . . . staff .
