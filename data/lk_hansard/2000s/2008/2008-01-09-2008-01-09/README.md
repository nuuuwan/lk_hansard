. . . . . . 12 . 9 . 9 . . . . . . . . . . ( . . ) (The Hon. K. N. Choksy) Mr. Speaker, might I be permitted to say this. Although the Government seeks to downplay the importance of this amending Bill, it is of very great consequence to the public generally. As we all know, these Commissions of Inquiry are looked upon in two different ways. Some members of the public consider it an easy and quick method of disposing of any issue that might arise. Equally, other right-thinking members of the public look upon Commissions of Inquiry as witch-hunts. Therefore, it is necessary for this House to consider the consequences of this amending Bill carefully. Now, I wish to just point out one matter, Mr. Speaker, to indicate to the Hon. Members of this House, the importance of this amending Bill. For example, Clause 2 ( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) I rise to a point of Order, Sir. I am not trying to disturb the Hon. Member. But - . . ( . . ) (The Hon. K. N. Choksy) No. I want to point out one example - ( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Are we going to the Consultative Committee or not? Are we debating it today or are we going to the Consultative Committee? It seems that the Hon. Member is now debating the Bill.

2008 09 259 260

. . ( . . ) (The Hon. K. N. Choksy) Yes, that is right. ( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) But if you are going to the Consultative Committee, we will go there, discuss and then come back. Let us first decide whether we are going to the Consultative Committee or not. If you want to debate it now, we will start the Debate. . ( . ) (The Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera) We have to go to the Consultative Committee first. After that we will come back again. . . ( . . ) (The Hon. K. N. Choksy) They are opposing that, is it not so? ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Renuka Herath) No, they agree. ( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) We will go to the Consultative Committee. The Hon. K.N. Choksy can also come there. He can make his submissions there. . . ( . . ) (The Hon. K. N. Choksy) Then, we can go to the Consultative Committee and come back. ( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) But it seems that we are going into a debate. ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Renuka Herath) Right. It is okay. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Speaker, I am on a different point. I am possessed of what the Hon. Minister said about the difficulty in conducting inquiries with all the Commissioners sitting. That is indeed a problem and there are other attendant problems.

But then, along with this, there is another important area regarding which I am sure the Cabinet has already approved another urgent Bill. That is, the Victims and Witnesses Protection Bill. Why do we not take that along with this, because these are all interconnected, Mr. Speaker. My opinion is that there are witnesses and victims because of the reasons that the culture of impunity that has now come to stay in this country has prevented many witnesses and victims in coming forward to give evidence before these Commissions. Of course, the Commissioners have gone and had various inquiries in camera and have invited people to come. For various reasons - there are different armed groups, there are threats on various witnesses - they are showing some reluctance to come forward. Because of this they have set up a unit. I know that. You have set up an interim unit for witness protection. But then, nothing is better than having a proper legislation. ( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Hon. Member, while you were in Cabinet also, just a few months ago, knowing the importance of this Bill, it was His Excellency the President who himself brought this Bill to the Cabinet. Now, the Victims and Witnesses Protection Bill also is with the Legal Draftsmans Department in the process of being drafted. So, the Government has very clearly seen that the Victims and Witnesses Protection Bill also is very important. That is why, while you were in Cabinet, the President, himself brought this Bill before Cabinet. The Cabinet, while you were also a Member, has sent it to the Legal Draftsmans Department to draft the Bill. So, that is also a Bill where the Government feels it should be brought very urgently as a very important Bill. So, that is being done. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I stand to be corrected. If I remember correct, I think, the complete Bill came before the Cabinet and we have just sent it back in order to have it sent to Parliament. ( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) No. It is not. The Cabinet has referred it to the Legal Draftsmans Department for the Bill to be drafted. So, after that if you think that it should go before the Consultative Committee, we go to the Consultative Committee and bring it here. Or, if you are of the opinion that it should be brought in as an urgent Bill without going to the Consultative Committee, that also could be done. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) But then it will be much better if we can bring it to the Consultative Committee and discuss it along with this. There is a possibility.

261 262

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) So, we will put it to the Consultative Committee and bring it here. - [Interruption.] Yes, we cannot delay this. ( ) (The Hon. Amarasiri Dodangoda) , . . . Consultative Committee . . . . ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) I support the proposition that it goes before the Consultative Committee and - [Interruption.] Okay, we will start as soon as possible because I want to lay out the procedure in fairness to the Party Leaders. The Party Leaders fix the date on which the Second Reading is to be taken up. It is presumed by that time that you have gone through all the other procedures of going before the Consultative Committee. I do not think the Party Leaders check up. Then, you will have to have a different procedure where before a Bill is taken up, we will have to get a report if the Consultative Committee has gone into it or not. That is going to take a long time. Then, the Party Leaders work will get delayed. You have to presume that. In this case, supporting what the Leader of the JVP Parliamentary Group said, I state that this was not taken up during the Budget Debate because there was no occasion to debate it. We just could not pass it. On the other hand, since this was an urgent Bill of 29th October, 2007, the Consultative Committee could have met in November or December. Now in any case that part is over and now we are going to the Consultative Committee. If the Hon. Minister wants, after that it can be discussed by the others; briefed at the Consultative Committee where we have to be heard on two important issues. I think, I should draw the Hon. Ministers attention to that also. One is, as they said, the representation by lawyers. One of the latter Commissions has divided up between investigation and inquiry. So, if you let that stand, we may have no problem at all. We can still keep that inquiry. But, let this go before the Consultative Committee. The second is, it is possible to file a criminal prosecution without a police investigation. That is also a matter of concern for us. I will not go into detail. But

these are issues that have to be sorted out. There is a concern by the Government because this matter has been taken up by other countries also. I think, what we said here is on record and they will know that the Government has moved on it and now we are at the stage in Parliament where the other parties are raising certain issues and we have agreed to go to the Consultative Committee. So, from here onwards let the Consultative Committee and Parliament take responsibility. I think that was your concern also.

FUTURE OF SRILANKAN AIRLINES AND VIABILITY OF MIHIN AIR ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Speaker, I thank you for giving me this opportunity to move the Adjournment Motion today. At this particular moment, this country which is having a very serious economic situation is now plagued with further problems because of the mismanagement of the aviation industry by the Government. I have forwarded an Adjournment Motion today on one of the most important industries in this country, which is the aviation industry. Mr. Speaker, we are an island nation. As an island nation, tourism industry is very important to our country and tourists need to come to this country either by aircraft or by ships. Ships with passenger transportation is not as accepted as aircraft. The aviation industry in Sri Lanka, which is having two airlines namely, the Sri Lankan Airlines and the Mihin Air, at this particular moment is facing a very grave situation. On that basis, Sir, this timely Adjournment Motion has been moved in order to ensure that the Government acts promptly and the role of the Hon. Minister in charge is of paramount importance. Mr. Speaker, I would like to know as to who is going to respond, because the Hon. Minister of Ports and Aviation is not present here. ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) , , . . . .
