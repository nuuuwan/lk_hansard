This the way they take the powers of important ministries. Hon. Minister, I am sure you would accept that we, from the Opposition have always been addressing issues devoid of politics when it comes to the economy. Unfortunately, you have got certain Members who cannot even think for themselves, coming up with various political excuses that only make a bad case worse. You would say that at this particular moment the world is going through a turbulent time, so Sri Lanka getting caught up as a leaf in the wind is of no major surprise. However, what is being done to overcome this problem? That is the problem. Mr. Chairman, on behalf of the Opposition, I had the opportunity to attend a Meeting of the World Bank and the IMF three days ago in Paris. There, the Gulf countries that are selling petrol in the range of US Dollars 130 to 140 said that they have got to get more monies to overcome their fiscal deficit. Singapore has accepted that there is a recession in the world and has reduced their growth rate by one and a half percent. Taiwan, in the first couple of months of this year has re-estimated that their GDP will be less by 1.3 per cent. The Indias Rupee has depreciated against the US Dollar. Dubai says that they will help private companies to overcome their deficiencies. So, this is the international arena where major countries are facing problems. But we have a pundit in the Central Bank who says that who are not caught up in this problem; that financial problems do not arise in Sri Lanka, that either we have been living with it form day dot or we are super immune to these type of things that we do not even need to worry about it.",

    "text": "The stock Exchange is crashing, the dollar is artificially being pegged and you would see that there is a heavy pressure on the dollar, an outflow of dollar. The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie is sitting just below you in a very pensive mood. When the world oil price is coming down, taxes are imposed on oil making him carry a burden of which he is not a part. You have the Minister of Health who was a little while ago firing questions and trying to answer the problems of other ministries when he cannot solve the problems of his own Ministry. have the doctors come to work today? No. So, these are what basically tantamount to the problems of enterprise development and investment promotion. In short, this is the Ministry that stimulates growth and brings in investments to the country. Now if that is the case, what are you going to do to rectify this malaise? Mr. Rober Zoellick, last Friday in Paris told Parliamentarians who were present from all over the world that the world in facing a serious problem and the World Bank is unable to provide answers to all matters. They say that there is US Dollars 71 billion for international development assistance and only 67 per cent of the countries have pledged. So, as a result they do not know whether there will be sufficient monies to ensure that it doles out for all the 78 recipients. The IMF Managing Director, Mr. Strauss - Kahn is once again saying that the big countries, the G - 8 and the G - 20, are facing problems. So, he is basically pessimistic even though on an optimistic note, thinking that this problem will last for about a year and a half. Meanwhile we small Sri Lankans, are like a leaf cought in the wind not knowing as to which way we will get thrown around. So, your Ministry needs to come up roughriding over the other Ministries such as the Ministry of Export Development and International Trade and the Ministry of State Revenue and Finance as to how to pitch Sri Lanka into market needs. So, this is the reason why we would like to ask certain questions that we hope will receive a bona fide answer. Hon. Minister, first of all, is there a genuine commitment of this Government to take investments forward? Do you have consistent policies that are being breached? You have a Cabinet of Ministers that bring in one decision today, three months later they themselves question the matter and then they take a policy decision quite contrary to what was taken earlier. So, this is one of the first things a Government that is seriously interested in luring investments into this country should think of. Now the Government is faced with a situation where there is no investor who even looks at land that is coming from the Government. You are the Minister in charge. But, today the Government does not have the confidence to take up matters. You have got the Supreme Court which has given a judgment which quite rightly should have been given 10 years ago. On that basis, today you will not even have a person taking a drain from the Government because they will say that this drain can be a river",

    "text": "tomorrow. So, as a result why should they waste their time in taking a land from the Government ? So, the first test is a major test. You have not been able to give a confidence factor to that. The next matter is the lending rate policy. Enterprise Development and Investment Promotion means that you have got to gear the local companies to compete with the regional companies or the international companies. So, if that is the case, lending rates become a pivotal factor for which the country accepts that the inflation rates are in the range of 28 to 29 per cent. How on earth could you put a domestic company, leave alone an international company, to compete with the region? You have India with lending rates in the range of 2 to 3 per cent ; yu have Taiwan, Korea, and Singapore with almost zero interest rate. So, as a result, you are to put an even playing-field to a domestic company. Then, you have the international companies coming in and borrowing in dollars. When you are borrowing in dollars, the lending rate ranges from 7 to 8 per cent. Now, when you have a 7 to 8 per cent interest and the Government goes on with investment guilds, sovereign investment guarantee bonds at LIBOR plus 5 to 6 per cent, why should a foreign company come and invest an skills here and ensure that you take part in the economic progress, when you can sit and get a 20 to 21 per cent return on a secondary market ? In that case, you are basically discouraging investors coming to this country. Is the investment policy conducive enough to reduce inflation and is there a pro-growth or stimulus into the growth area ? No is the answer. Then, look at the other contributory factors that give a more genuine development-oriented environment. In tourism, there is a negative growth and we are basically having a drop in trade. You are having a major problem of a time bomb in your hands; GSP plus. I will deal with the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris Ministry on this matter, rather than waste my time in this. But, it is an important factor. The BOI would be selling companies to come in and ensure up-market textiles. You are unable even to control the existing textile companies in Sri Lanka such as Brandix, MAS Holdings, who have basically lost interest in Colombo and are going to India, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad to open up companies. So, you are trying to get the world to come and invest here when you are unable to develop the domestically-existing companies here. Now, the Thulhiriya textile factory which was previously acquired by Kabool Lanka Limited, when it went into liquidation or when it was in financial trouble, you had Rs. 2.5 billion owing to the Bank of Ceylon and Rs. 2.5 billion owing to the Hatton National Bank. You have the financial wizards in the Cabinet and in the Government who basically expropriated this asset right from the banks and solid it to MAS Holdings of Rupees one billion and you basically had a change of ownership. Tomorrow, if Mr. Vasudeva Nanayakkara decides to go to courts and says, Look, this is a Government asset. Rupees 2.5 billion is in the Bank of Ceylon, Rs. 2.5 billion is in the Hatton National Bank and you have taken",

Have you looked into this matter ? Coin cidentally he was on a flight coming back and when this was proposed, he nearly got a heart attack saying, Could this happen ? Well, it has already happened in the Waters Edge land matter. So, Hon. Minister, before you tag the name. Enterprise Development and Investment Promotion, you must ensure- [interruption] - in literal terms. I mean, anybody would do that. If you put Rupees one billion in and you say that asset is going to be expropriated for the simple reason that it was not properly given, anybody has a right to go to courts. Mr. Vasudeva Nanayakkara went to courts over the Lanka Marine Services Limited matter and if the courts decide that it is an asset which is in the hands of a Bank, then there is no rational thinking in this process. Sir, I am just mentioning the basic elements which are not placed on a proper foundation by your Ministry. You are just assuming that things have been put together and blaming the UNP for every damn thing that is happening in this country thinking that investors will come from the day you start scolding. I think there is a need to have a complete change. Look at what is going on in the USA. Look at the Obama phobia that has come in. They had the Recession in 1924 after the first Great Depression that took place. The second Depression has started. But they are not blaming McCain or Bush. They have got around and they are going to do the job. That is what is expected. Your job is to blame the UNP from morning till evening thinking that that will solve the problems and you get into further trouble. Then, you have to get the UNP to come and extricate the problem. That is the reality. So, Hon. Minister, I will mention another matter and that is about low taxes. Now, there is no point in saying that there is a tax-free regime in this country when the direct taxation is at 22 at 25 cent. You have taken the tax holidays away and then introduced indirect taxation. As a policy, you have said that you want to ensure that the production cost is kept low. But, indirect taxation has been very high. You have made the competitive edge of the local companies completely uncompetitive. So, considering the low cost of exchange rates",

I did not see the Minister of Enterprise Development on your right-hand side. It is not like the other Ministers who may not be visiting the Institutions - [Interruption.] Yes. A Government of inability, helped with able people from this side, but still caught in a twister not being able to deliver anything. Hon. Minister, you are talking of low exchange rates. Today, you must have either a low interest rate or low inflation rate coupled with the fact that you have a proper real effective exchange mechanism. The IMF has been quoting - I table* an article to ensure that they are looking at a devalution of 20 per cent. Is this acceptable? Is it possible? Financially who is able to take on this type of a cost factor? If not, then how are you going to help the investor to be competitive when the other factors are not competitive? So, you are basically caught up with the fact that once again another fundamental factor is flawed. Then, Hon. Minister there is the corruption factor. I think, this is the killer, Finally, after you pass all the tests you come to the corruption factor. This is accepted. You saw the corruption index where Sri Lanka is placed somewhere around 100 or 110 out of 176. It shows that we are regarded as a banana republic. We have heard of investors coming to this country - I am not referring to your Ministry, I am referring to the country as a whole - may be from Galle to Jaffna or from Colombo to Trincomalee. But, at the end of the day, lack of business knowledge is the biggest problem. Foreigners coming to this country say, Look, the Minister or the administration says they want two million dollars, when the project needs only one million dollars. That is the type of environment that you have created to the investors in the country. So, Hon. Minister, I do not need to analytically refer to each one. These are the nine critical factors that an investors would look at when considering whether to invest in Sri Lanka or not. After all, we are one of the 212 countries in the world. We are not the only girl on the beach. The investment climate is certainly not conducive towards us. So, what are the things we are going to throw to attract it?",

    "text": "Now, normally taxation is looked at as against GDP. When the UNP was in government in 2003, the total income was 14.5 per cent of GDP. That was the lowest period with the highest amount of investment taking place. So there is a direct correlation between the lowest taxes and the highest investment taking place. Then, Hon. Minister, going on further, I would like to look at the factors that lead to cost escalation. Now, look at the lending rates in this country. The Central Bank says, We will pursue a monetary policy. When there is a monetary policy, you have got to ensure that you have a real effective return. But, what is being pursued is the negative return. You have a 24 to 25 per cent inflation and you give a Treasury Bill at 17 to 18 per cent. Effectively you are telling a depositor, please do not deposit, consume. So on that basis, you have got to ensure that a company starts with a return of about 30 per cent. From that, you would see where the problem starts. The Government of Sri Lanka has a total revenue of Rs. 855 billion for the year 2009. Rupees 855 billion is the total revenue and the total expenditure is Rs. 1,790 billion resulting in a definite deficit of Rs. 935 billion. How on earth is the Government going to overcome this problem? So, this is manifested in the financial policies of the country. The Bank of Ceylon, owing to the liquidity ratio problem? Went for a debenture issue. In the debenture issue they wanted to collect Rs. 3,000 million or Ruppees three billion. Madam presiding Member, they tried to collect Rs. 3,000 million and ended up by not being able to get the public to subscribe to this. So, what did they do ? They ensured that the Army Welfare Fund comes in and invests Rs. 1,000 million. This is the captive source, the Army. Then, you said that the Bank of Ceylon Pension Fund came and put another Rs. 1,000 million. The general public, I am informed, till the 14th of November, had invested only Rs. 637 million. So, the people do not have confidence in the Governments gilt-edged securities issued by a prime bank, the Bank of Ceylon. So this shows what type of a confidence factor prevails in this country. So are you saying that this is the type of environment you have for investment in this country. Hon. Minister, this is going to be a very difficult task. You have to give attention to creation matters of importance. There is duplication of ministries and there is duplication of administration. Previously, BOI was known as a one-stop shop. Today, it is not the case, You may have a wizard as the Chairman of the BOI. I must say that with his experience, he is certainly delivering from individual perspective. But, the BOI does not carry down the line. That is the problem because the administration is sub-optimized. You have many people looking at files. Earlier during the UNP regime, you had 100 or 115 files coming a day. Whether it materialized or not is another matter, but you had files being opened. Today. You would basically be lucky to open 10 to 15 files a day so that materializes in the next six to seven moths in realistic investment. The problem lies in the BOI. You must ensure that the existing investors get the satisfaction. They are the ambassadors of the world when it comes to investment",

    "text": "in this country. But, today in is not the case. You had many German companies that have written to you and to the Chairman of the BOI. I know they are trying to get the answers but they have not been successful in certain areas. They say they have problems in the existing investment arena; whether it is from the verification unit or whether it is from the customs, they do not know exactly to whom they should take up their problems. So, Hon. Minister, before you venture out trying to bring new investments to the county. Ensure that the existing investors are made happy. The BOI is a startling success during the 1977 regime when they brought Sri Lanka into the world map by saying this is the place for investment. Unfortunately, that momentum lost its gust somewhere in 1995 and from there onwards there was no looking back. The problem is the confidence factor. Then, as I said, the Government must take into consideration the Labour GSP. Here is a Government that is unable to provide Rs. 250 million to the tea smallholders to buy their tea but it is telling the textile industry and the rest of it fisheries, tobacco, ceramic ware, shoes et cetera-that they will pay Rs. 21.5 billion per year. This benefit is for 3 years, totaling to Rs. 65 billion. Who is the pundit who said that he does not want this benefit? And, now they are running in circles saying, No, no, We will give a loan. We will give preference shares. What is the meaning of this? This is why we basically say that the Government is not sincere in its pursuit to bring in investment; is not sincere and genuine in maintaining existing investment and as a result, all you are doing is, you are gifting this type of investors to India that is waiting with open hands to embrace them, to fortify them, strengthen and take them further. We have been talking of free trade agreements in order to ensure that we have a greater market access. Then, we have been talking of regional free trade agreements, in order to ensure that regionally you get together and compete in the world. Then, you have been talking of the world organization like the World trade Organization in order to ensure that we are competitive in the world. But, what happens, you ridicule the WTO. When we were in government, we successfully managed to get free trade agreements with the US. And, you asked us why we require free trade agreements. But, when you came back, the same administration signs a free trade agreement with Pakistan. So, you have no policy. That is the problem about which we keep lamenting year after year. You thinking may be the same, but unfortunately your Government policy does not take you the along the expected long journey. As a result, we are left in the lurch of not being able to get genuine investments to this country. Now, there is a new phobia that has emerged. You are trying to show that there is more investment coming into the country today as opposed to what was there in the past. In the past, infrastructure investment was done by the Government. You opened it up on the BOO basis for",

    "text": "the rest of the private sector to come in. Now, again you cramped your style by saying. No, we will not. But, the infrastructure investment is done totally by the BOI companies. During the period of the UNP regime, investments were US Dollars 500 million to US Dollars 600 million but now it is US Dollars 1,000 million. Is that actually helpful? Look at the labour force in this country. When we left office in 2004, the total labour force was 8.1 million. At that time 1,095,000 people were in the public service and the balance were in the private sector. But today, the figures of the Central Bank-1 tabled a document in this regard just about two weeks ago show that the labour force has come down to 7.5 million. That means, there is a contraction. The public sector remains at 1,095,000 jobs; the rest of it shows that the reduction is in the private sector. So, where is the growth that is said to be taking place? Then, you say that unemployment has reduced in this country. If that is so, either people are being killed or they are leaving the country or they are missing in action. That is the stark reality. Are you able to dispute that? I am only taking figures given by the Central Bank. So, Hon. Minister, with this factor behind us and with the world recession in before us, you have got to ensure that you have a selling tool for the investors who are going to come into the country. Forget the foreigners; first look at the locals. Today the small and medium scale investors also have a right to invest with the BOI. There is a general phobia that it is restricted only to the elite investors of the country. Utter nonsense! Section 16 of the BOI Law permits any Sri Lankan company to team up, get some foreign expertise and do business. Section 17 of the BOI Law permits you to go in for joint ventures or whatever. This is not something which is there only for foreign companies. Look at our Friends in the JVP - I do not know which section of them should be referred to - one lot is with the Opposition and the other lot is with the Government. Their heart is here and their mind is there. Look at these jokers who asked, When the world prices are going up what is the purpose of having a Government? But, when the world prices are coming down, they do not even open their mouths today. These types of people are the ones who talk about policies. Today the same party is saying, Ensure that English education is not there in the country. These types of morons are the ones with whom we have to set policies. - [Interruption.] I mean these are news friends? We are the only ones who have the courage to tell where they stand. You were flirting with them for numbers and when you are caught up with them, now you say, Old friends, new friends. But, certainly at least the Friends who are remaining on this side have the guts to tell the type of nonsense you are doing. The others who were flirting, who were then giving guarantees are today neither here nor there. That is the problem we are faced with. -[Interruption.] Is that so? Well, whats to be done? We have fixed policies rather than to flirt.",

That is more difficult but certainly things are happening. Hon. Minister, as I said, when I had a personal discussion with Mr. Robert Zoellick; when I led the delegation for the Cancun discussion, he said, Ravi, this is not a problem that is isolated to Sri Lanka. I must confess that this is not something which is isolated only to the Asian region. I concede that. Then, he said, When America is caught up with this problem and when they sneeze, you get pneumonia. That is why I say that is you have officials who are pundits and do not understand how to do, what to do and how to ensure that you lure the investors into the country in the correct way, that is the starting point of the problem. When we said that we insulated against the international financial meltdown, you said your country is immune to that. Then, why is the stock exchange index down from 2,800 to 1,719? Why is that there is an outflow of dollars from the country? I read in the newspapers that the Director-General of the Securities and Exchange Control Commission has stated that you had about US Dollars 15 billion coming into this country and out of that about US Dollars seven billion has gone out. Now, if that is the case, it is true that the Central Bank, which permitted the capital market to open to a certain degree, where they came and invested in the Treasury bills is today realizing that owing to the fact that the Government is trying to reduce the inflation, there is no interest in investing. So, as a result, let us convert and take it back than creating a big problem in Sri Lanka. So, Hon. Minister, how are you going to approach this? You have to give us some categorical answers as to how you are going to take the economy forward. It is in absolute dire straits. There is no looking back. This Government is trying to conceal information. That is why they are talking of elections. You would not dare to have it! You only talk! One Minister says, No election, and the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva says they are going to hold elections in 2010. The same untruth was told by Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. Definitely, be ready for elections. That is all we have got to say because you do not want to confront tomorrow. You rather do it today. You want to conceal the military pursuit of the Army and try to think that the Government is now leading into that. US Dollars two billion is being spent on the war. Not even a police officer is earning the per capita income of this country. So, are you trying to bring in investments under this type of environment? Look at Indonesia, Vietnam and India which countries are devaluing their currencies to extract investment. Sri Lanka is artificially keeping it high neither controlling it nor giving assistance nor fillip to the exporters to do what needs to be done. Look at the growth rate. If you basically say that your growth rate is remaining at 6 per cent, there is something wrong in this country. When India is readjusting, when Singapore is readjusting, when Taiwan is readjusting, Sri Lanka is immune and you say that we have a 6 per cent growth rate which means it is only a baseless growth.

So, if you take off that 19 per cent, there is 13 per cent still built in. So, in that case, there is a negative return in this country. Let us accept this instead of just fudging around figures and massaging the egos of the officials. I must compliment the investment drive. I know the difficulties that the Chairman of the BOI and you are faced with. It is not that you have addressed the issues but it has at least stemmed the tide in certain directions giving some hope to a country that is lagging behind in investment support. Hon. Minister, look at peace as the answer to these matters. Investors come into a country only if they feel they are comfortable. I mentioned about nine economical factors which people look at when investing in a country. Those are the key factors. Beyond that is a feel-good factor. When an investor comes into this country and if he feels that there is something wrong, that a bomb will go off tomorrow or a strike will take place day after or the region is in turbulence, that is going to be a critical factor. When a foreigner comes to this country what would he feel? You have military checkpoints everywhere. Well and good. I do not question that. That is a Government policy. But, how long are going to do this? When the President got elected on the 17 of November 2005, he said that honourable peace will come in three months. Then he said, Let us sign a MoU with the UNP Then, he said , Let us have a military pursuit and finsih this off Then, by 26th of November, 2008 the Defence Secretary or the Army Commander said that there will be no war be no war in this country. Accept or not, Hon. Minister, I know you would like to conceal information but that is the stark reality. Where is the delivery? Today, you are showing certain parts of the country, which you say have been liberated. We will give credit to the army if they have captured those areas, But, others say it has been strategically retracted. We had captured Kilinochchi and Pooneryn before. When the late Mr. Lalith Athulath Mudali was there, we captured Vadamarachchi, but the problem remains. So where is the answer? Now, this",

    "text": "Government which had earlier said that they are winning everything is suddenly asking Prabhakaran to lay down arms and come for discussions. What the hell are you doing? If you can defeat these jokers, why do not do it? Why do you suddenly have a love for Prabhakaran? Why do you suddenly tell him to lay down arms and come for discussions? There is some problem in that case. The President had an interview with The Hindu three weeks ago and said that the will ensure that there is a Ceasefire Agreement. A Ceasefire Agreement needs only one condition: that Prabhakaran must give up violent activities by laying down his arms. So, in that case, the President has now accepted that LTTE is the sole representative of the Tamils. Earlier he was saying, Do not do that. Now, you can see as to how the policy of the Government is changing. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , . . So, the President now says that the LTTE is the core factor. Government representatives had gone to India three, four times, selling various stories. But, India has lost confidence. The Prime Minister of India has said, We do not want to even speak to you because you have been lying to us all this time. Suddenly, Karunanidhi stirs a scene. Then, the Hon. Keheliya Rambukkwella says, Ceasefire only if LTTE disarms itself completely. The Presisent says one thing; the Defence Affairs Spokesman says another. With this, you have two matters coming up. The Tamil Nadu matter is not something which you need to pay regard because the central Government is there. Just because Tamil Nadu shouts, the central Government need not respond to that. The Central Government wanted to send relief goods to Sri Lanka and you accepted that. During that time, you said it was a parippu drop. Now, it is an entire, commodity drop without even having diplomatic discussions. Hon. Minister, again the President, in an interview published in Junior Vikatan which was re-published in the Daily News of 21st November, 2008, said, LTTE must reject violence and entire talks. That means, they have also gone off the condition of laying own arms. So, what is happening? This is the Government that said terrorism is not there in the country anymore. We did not say that. The UNP did not even utter a word. We have been labelled inept; blamed that we are not taking a stand. We have taken a stand. We said terrorism must be eradicated and a political settlement needs to be brought in. We have the commitment as well as the courage of conviction to say so. Hon.

So, if that is the case, what has the Minister of Enterprise Development and Investment Promotion got to say? The same. You come to our country; do what we say, but do not do what we do is the policy that you have. So, Hon.

You have a bad brief, but a good presentation is only what has to be made. That would not help resuscitate the economy of this country.

    "text": "First, let me put on record, Madam, the actual figures of Foreign Direct Investment in dollar terms. In 2001, it was US Dollars 87 million; in 2002, it was US Dollars 181 million; in 2003, it was US Dollars 171 million; in 2004, it was US Dollars 233 million; in 2005, it was US Dollars 287 million; in 2006, I am happy to say, after I took over, it went up to US Dollars 604 million and last year, we had US Dollars 734 million, which was a record. we have never had this amount of Foreign Direct Investment in this country. Up to September, 2008, we have US Dollars 605 million already invested and I am confident that we will be coming very close to US Dollars one billion by the time we close the year. My good Friend, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, said that infrastructure projects are also being brought under this and that is why we are having these figures. Let me respond to that by looking into the structure of this inflow of foreign currency. If you look at that, you will find that 69 per cent of this inflow comes from telephone and telecommunication networks. So, this is not infrastructure for roads, ports and things like that you alluded to, but largely for projects in the telecommunication sector, in the services sector. The expansion of the telecommunication sector in this country, I think my good friend will agree, is a stupendous achievement. Today we have a situation where 50 per cent of the people of this country have access to mobile telephones. You remember the time - we both agreed that this is a good policy - when it was a State monopoly. You could not get a telephone; you had to wait for 10 years and also pay someone to get a telephone. Today, we have come to a situation where, in a matter of hours, you can get a telephone on demand. This, I think we both must agree, is a tremendous achievement. This was done largely through the BOI. Today we have four players in this game and very soon the fifth player, the Bharti Airlet, will also come into this country and that, I think, will totally transform the usage of telecommunication systems or telephony in this country, which will make a tremendous change in the knowledge - based industries of this country. So, we are going hard at developing the IT industry which, in my opinion, Madam, can easily become a billion dollar industry. We are starting an IT park in Malabe. We are also promoting a large number of call centres. Today, you know very well that 10,000 young people can be found employment in the IT sector. At present we can produce only 2,000 and we are making a special effort. There is a Presidential Task Force on the Usage of IT and English of which I am the Chairman and we have already drawn up plans so that there can be a rapid expansion in the IT sector. Now, Madam, I want to confirm what I said for my good Friends benefit because if you look at the breakdown of Foreign Direct Investment from where it is coming, then it will become clear that it is not from those countries which are investing largely on roads, harbours and so on, but from Malaysia, which is the number one FDI investor in this country that is largely linked to the",

In fact, this is the only piece of legislation which will help us to overcome many of the problems that you alluded to the Hon. Minister. You asked me to give a serious reply and I am going to do that. When we discussed this matter with the legal officers of the Attorney-Generals Department, they said that we must create a new instrument which would help us to argue this matter in court and that new instrument is the special investment law, which will come back to Parliament within three months and it will have Parliaments authority. The fount of this argument, of all those instances that you mentioned, was that it did not have been basic Parliamentary sanction. It may have been done by regulations; it may have been done by various other forms such as Cabinet meetings, sub Cabinet meetings, pre-Cabinet meetings. All sorts of arguments have been adduced, but finally the position of the Supreme Court was that it was not referred to the fountain of that justification, namely Parliament. So, we are addressing that issue in a very serious way. I want to tell you that we are working to a particular plan. There are thrust areas. You know that we have the thrust area policies, which I originated when I was the Minister of Finance and Planning. We have selected various clusters for special growth, for special incentives and I am glad that many of those have been brought under our Ministry.

Recently, when His Excellency had a meeting with those engaged in the tea industry, he acceded to almost all the requests that were made by them. He is very interested in developing the tourism sector. Each of these thrust areas we can identify, for example, tourism, the gem and jewellery industry, the IT sector and the tea industry, which has already gone beyond the US Dollar 1 billion mark, is basically a billion dollar industry. We have to somehow or other go into these thrust areas and create the necessary momentum. You would agree, Hon. Member, that we can easily make tourism-after all, your former Colleague is the Minister in charge and he is trying his very best-a billion dollar industry. I know very much about it because once, I was the Secretary in charge of tourism. You were talking of your good friend, the late Hon. Lalith Athulath Mudali. We went up from 200,000 tourist arrivals in 1982 to half a million tourist arrivals in 1983 in this country. Today, also we are stagnating around half a million. But, with this regional tourism-with growth of China, with the growth of Russia, with the growth of India-I think it is very realistic to think of a one-billion dollar tourism industry. Mr. Chanaka Ellawala, the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Gem and Jewellery Association and his group met me and they have assured that we can make it a one billion dollar industry by 2010. - [Interruption] You can ask them.

    "text": "I wish you had watched about two to three days ago the NDTV which had a one hour interview with the Indian Finance Minister, Mr. Chidambaram. Did you watch that? It was a very interesting interview because his condition, as you quite rightly pointed out, is closer to ours and he came up with a very interesting position. Now, I am not trying to score debating points. I am just trying to put a point of view and we can discuss that. Governments like ours have to always balance between growth and inflation. Of course, in a classical way we can reduce inflation by taking a series of measures which will stifle growth of a developing country. But, as you rightly mentioned, you cannot have a run-away inflation which will have a deleterious effect on investment, on growth, and on living standards. So, actually Hon. Member, and my good Friend, you will agree that both you and we are talking of how to balance it. We can never say, Okay, we shut down growth and we control the inflation. In European or American countries, the growth pattern is different; if you have a 2 per cent growth or a 1 per cent growth, that is a big thing. They do not go into negative growth in those countries because they are highly developed and to get a 1 per cent GDP growth is a stupendous thing in those countries. So, there, if you have inflation, that becomes a major issue. But, in countries like Sri Lanka, India and China, maybe we have to always think of a balancing act. We can debate whether the mixture is right. You might say that of a balancing act. We can debate whether the mixture is right. You might say that this mixture is not right. We might say, no, we go more for stimulating the economy. But, what I want to draw your attention to is that though we may have that debate, what did Mr. Chidambram say and what did Dr. Manmohan Singh tell the journalists when he was flying back in his new Air India One? A friend of mine who came from India told me that they were very happy because like the Americans they also now have Air India One, where the Prime Minister travels in his own aeroplane and there, in the usual American style, the Prime Minister has a chat with all the journalists who come in the aeroplane and he had said, Mark my words, we are very glad that we had a big deficit this year because a deficit in a way gets adjusted on the wider economic scene but the government is trying to commit more funds by going for a deficit financing. I am willing to agree that none of us, neither Dr. Manmohan Singh nor the Sri Lankan side, had forestalled all this. But, there is some new economic thinking that we must look into; which looks into this total area of what it means in these turbulent times to have fairly large deficits; the question of how much of inflation, how much of growth a country should have. These are big issues and I am glad you raised this issue because these are matters which Parliament must look into. I fully agree that we have to improve our incentive regime. I was just looking at the figures regarding the total FDI compared to countries in this region. It is very interesting because we are really at the bottom of the pile",

    "text": "when we consider China, India or Vietnam. If you take Vietnam or Thailand which is comparable, they are in the range of US Dollars 10 billion whereas we are struggling hard to get US Dollars one billion. But I was surprised to find, and you will also be surprised, that Bangladesh is only getting US Dollars 700 million according to these figures. So, this is a country which is having all sorts of incentives and the answer for that is what you said: that the other ancillary conditions may not be favourable. In that sense it adds to your argument that FDI depends not only on the concessions that are given but on a whole platform or a raft of assistance that has to be given to draw in the investors. So, the first one is - this is where I solicit your assistance - we have brought in the Strategic Development Projects Bill. It was not debated, but I look forward in the future, for collaboration between your side and ours because unless we jointly address this issue on important strategic investments, we will not be able to give those very incentives that you were talking of. We were advised under that Bill - as the Minister, I can recognize a project as a special project. Let us, for the convenience, call it a flagship project - in which case I can give them more concessions than under the existing BOI laws, under the existing tax laws and under the existing exchange control laws - that whole package - [Interruption.] I do not want to go into the - [Interruption.] There may be blips. I mean, this is a very unfair world. This is not a rose garden. There are problems. We have to face those problems. But I only want to say that when it comes to Foreign Direct Investment it is very important that this side and your side work together. After all, if there is a huge investment in Sri Lanka, if there is a big factory, if there is a big hotel and if there is a big garment factory, nobody is going to take it away. That is not a SLFP garment factory or a UNP garment factory or a JVP garment factory. It is something that is here. It is going to provide employment. So, I agree with what you said that when it comes to matters of investment, we should be able to talk to each other. I certainly want to give you an assurance that I will be very happy to get the Consultative Committee appointed, at which we can go into the nitty-gritty. You know very well that I have never stinted in giving information regarding the BOI. Every time you have asked a question, I have given the answer in full. Sometimes I am also amazed at the amount of information we have transmitted. I have given an assurance to the media that they can ask for any file in the BOI, any particular file, if they want, we are willing to give that. [Interruption.] No, no. But I can say wht I am doing. I am talking on the Votes of the Ministry. Now, we have to look at the question of expanding these investments outside the Western Province. Today, do you know, Hon. Member, that the World Bank has a special study done on this by one Mr. Devaraj who was the consultant, which shows that the growth in the",

    "text": "Western Province is equivalent to the best Indian and Chinese GDP figures. They have something like 12 to 14 per cent growth in the Western Province which is very good but, now we have to try to push it out to the other provinces as well. That is why we have the Nava Nipayum Programme and the growth programmes in the East and hopefully in the North; because you will agree that these are the areas, particularly the East, which has a growth potential in Sri Lanka. We have negotiated with many companies - for example, the cement factories which will come up in the Trincomalee area and also the sugar factories. I am very keen to see that belt developed. We have Hingurana, we have Kantale and all those areas which must be brought under sugar cultivation. At Kallady, in Puttalam we would be starting a new zone and an industrial estate would be set up in the Mirigama Special Economic Zone. The Henagama Investment Promotion Zone, which we want to make a Knowledge City would also come up. I must tell you though there are arguments about it, there is tremendous interest, particularly among Indian investors in Sri Lanka because here you get push and pull factors. The push factors are beginning to come up here because it is becoming more and more expensive. -[Interruption.] Earlier there was a problem of Vanaspati. Vanaspati was a big segment of those exports. At that time India quickly moved in and reduced their duties and Vanaspati, which I think was a great source of funding for many politicians, finally collapsed. So today, there is no Vanaspati factor, if I may say so. That affected the trade figures. So, we have to build it on a more solid ground. We have a fundamental problem, I mean, we have to address that, in the sense that whatever we produce, thaey can also produce. For example, I spoke to Mr. Kamalanath and he said, Well, by some strange thing, you are exporting marble. But in my own electorate, marble is the number one issue. So however much we tell, that is a big problem. You know that when the prices of pepper and cloves went up, it created a big stir in Kerala and informally they told us, Because of us trying to help you, we lost the Kerala State. This is the type of give-and-take arrangement. What I say is, there are lots of day-to-day issues that we are confronted with and I am really thinking that we must now develop out Consultative Committee into an areafor example, in our Ministry we can discuss these problems as a matter of mutual concern. So that is all I want to say about the BOI except that you yourselves recognized that there has been quite an improvement. But, I want to say that we have been recognized - ( ) (The Hon.

    "text": "Mr. Presiding Member, I wish to intervene in this Debate on the Votes of the Committee Stage discussion of the Ministry of Enterprise Development and Investment Promotion. A country like ours which lacks capital, technology, market and management expertise, requires foreign investments. Conceptually, there is nothing wrong in going in for foreign investments and we are not so dogmatic as to reject the foreign investments. We have been taking that position from the inception. This Ministry under the leadership of the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, in my view, as compared to the preceding period, has performed well since he took over the Ministry. I think the Minister will take the opportunity to reply to some of the questions raised by the Members of the Opposition later. I observe a steady rise in the Approved Investments as well as the Realized Investments for the year 2007 as far as the BOI is concerned. The total foreign investments for 2007 is in the region of Rs. 363 million and the potential is in the region of Rs. 600 million, and as compared to 2003, it is about thrice the amount when the UNP was running the BOI whilst the Ceasefire Agreement was in force. Despite predictions of gloom by the Opposition, I think the Hon. Sarath Amunugama has been successfully obtaining substantial foreign funds, almost three times what the UNP government brought in 2003 when the Ceasefire Agreement was in force.",

    "text": "I find that 65 per cent of these investments are in the service sector and that is in keeping with the trends of sectoral development and there have been generated about 60,000 employment in 2007 and this is in keeping with the general trends prevalent all over the world. However, in the context of the ongoing global financial crisis, we may face challenges in the future with regard to the capital inflows for reasons of liquidity squeeze and credit crunch. It is too early for me to predict how the global crisis would take shape at the moment. Ours is a small economy of US Dollars 35 billion GDP in the mighty ocean of the world GDP of US Dollars 60 trillion. That is US Dollars 60,000 billion. The current crisis was born in the United States in an economy of US Dollars 13 trillion GDP. It has affected the economy of the Eastern European countries whose GDP is US Dollars 14 trillion. It has influenced negatively the Continent of Asia whose GDP is US Dollars 17 trillion. The GDP of the G-20 countries with four EU countries accounts for 85 per cent of the world GDP; 19 countries account for 85 per cent of the world GDP. They met the other day in Washington to discuss the global financial crisis and dispersed without any solution. The Asia-Europe Summit took place in Beijing recently and the Asia-Pacific Summit that just ended yesterday in Lima discussed the present financial crisis. The IMF and the World Bank have met in Washington to discuss this global crisis. All these indicate the depth and the length of the global financial crisis. However, the redeeming feature, in my view, of these conferences and summits is the emergence of BRIC as a powerful group in the world economy, namely Brazil, Russia, India and China. They made a concerted and coordinated effort in these conferences to seek a solution with a concrete proposal on the need for reforms to the international financial system. BRIC accounts for US Dollars 13 trillion GDP, almost on par with the United States. Sir, you would observe that six asian countries in G-20 account for US Dollars 17 trillion GDP, China being at the top, with nearly US Dollars seven trillion GDP and Japan coming second with only US Dollars four trillion. These new economic centres are emerging and the landscape of the world",

It is necessary to bear in mind, Sir, that the striking features of this global crisis are highly volatile trade, wild fluctuations of exchange, loss of confidence and paralysis of the markets. The only blessing, in my view, is that the world is fast turning multi-polarity and the world balance of forces is shifting slowly but steadily and I think faster than we all anticipated.",

Our rate of investment in 2007 is 28 per cent of GDP while the rate of savings is only 17.6 per cent. So, it is necessary to narrow the gap. There is a savings-investment gap. In these circumstances, we have no option but to seek foreign funds so long as this gap remains wider, which will continue to produce a deficit in the balance of payments. Thanks to the worker remittances through which I think, we have been able to reduce this gap to some extent. That is where the Ministry of Enterprise Development and Investment Promotion is required to play a pivotal role in the economy in obtaining FDI inflows, grants and loans in respect of our projects. A question was raised that 60 to 70 per cent of our investments are in respect of services and that is the general pattern. We have had three economic regimes in our country since Independence. The first being the plantation regime, the second being the import substitution regime, and the next buy the export substitution regime. But, I think, Hon. Sarath Amunugama, after he took over as the Minister of Finance, is the one who initiated taking a paradigm shift in that economic strategy, giving emphasis on the rural economy, giving emphasis on the regional development and giving emphasis on the infrastructure which had been completely neglected over a period of time. That is why, when we prepared not only 10-year horizon and the medium-term programme, we have been able to make a shift from the earlier positions. In fact, I take this opportunity to congratulate him for his wise and gallant leadership given. Sir, it is also necessary to understand",

    "text": "the era in which we live today. The financial capital is the dominant factor. It dominates the world economy. Whether you like it or not, that is the reality and according to a report of the Bank for International Settlements based in Switzerland, that is the central bank of all central banks, I quote from their report there is a shadow economy of US Dollars 600 trillion today in the world economy outside the official system of international financial system. This is the remote and the root cause of this volatile financial situation and this is being discussed by all leading economists the world over, even including Alan Greenspan who had been the Chief of the Central Bank of the United States of America. He had come out with a complaint, explaining the financial situation in the world. He says, there is a financial earthquake. The man who was leading the US economy as the Chief of the Central Bank, Federal Reserve Bank of United States, immediately after he left said \"There is a financial earthquake. You will have to be careful in treading that financial earthquake\". Sir, the most important thing what I want to say is, this shadow economy of US Dollars 600 trillion as per this bank is 12 times the official world GDP. That is one fame factor. The second factor is, the official value of the world stock exchange is US Dollars 100 trillion whereas the transaction through the speculative capital amounts to US Dollars 600 trillion; that is six times. Now, you can see that this is the cumulative product of the shadow economy throughout the world; the black economy, may I say. The money is accumulated, collected and pooled and they are operating through various funds and the central bank and the central governments all over the world, however much they are powerful, including the United States of America were unable to bridle these funds which are operating outside the official financial system. This is the root cause. Although it is a remote cause, but it is the root cause. Therefore, in the mighty ocean of US Dollars 60,000 billion of world economy, a small economy like ours which is of only US Dollars 35 billion, is susceptible and vulnerable and that is why in spite of all those negative factors - having a war in the North and having all other constraints, I think last year 2007, the Hon. Minister had been able to get Rs. 600 million realized and potential investments generating about 60,000 employments. It is a difficult task under difficult circumstances. I am very happy that the Hon. Members of the Opposition raised some fundamental issues which should have been raised on the Budget proper debate. The Budget proper Debate was completely a non-event. These issues were never raised. The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama We all and the would have joined and contributed our share views and thoughts on it, if those issues were raised. It is a fact, it is a reality that our service sector is the biggest sector. If you go back to the 1950s, 60 per cent of was agriculture and it has now come down to 13 per cent. It has become the pattern throughout the world. The industries sector has come up to 27 per cent. In 1950, the service sector was less than 10 per cent and today it has come up to 60 per cent. That indicates",

    "text": "the development of the economy. Under whatever regime, whether it a socialist regime or capitalist regime or whatever it is, the development is development. Science of economics operates. You cannot get behind the science of economics. In the science of economics, unlike other sciences there are variable factors. You have to take the totality. Take the full Budget into account and see whether all the variables are there. Then only you will have to come to proper conclusions. Sometimes there are factors which completely cut across the main development process. There was a time when we had to maintain a proper surplus deficit properly. Then we must maintain the trade deficit. We must maintain the balance of payment surplus. We must maintain a particular rate of employment. All those factors are there. But, we cannot maintain a proper balance when there are so many factors operating beyond our control within the country and outside the country. Therefore, you will have to take all these factors into account and come to drow conclusions. Sir, this is why there is a growing demand today for reforms of the international financial system. The leadership has been taken by China, by India, by Brazil and all the other emerging countries. I think that is why there were completely diametrical views even in the Lima Conference which ended yesterday. The out-going President of the USA, George W. Bush insisted on the same old laissez-faire liberal system. While they are having protectionism, they are asking other countries to be completely liberal. Now a healthy dialogue is going on amongst the top leaders. In fact, the President of France said, China and India are absolutely necessary in order to salvage the world economy . It has come to that point. That is why I repeatedly said on the Floor of this House that the 21st Century belongs to the Continent of Asia. Although we are a small economy of US Dollars 35 billion, our main safeguard is the fact that we are placed geographically, historically and culturally in the continent of Asia where the two economic giants are emerging when the shift in economic power is taking place. Therefore, we have to re-orient our foreign policy; we have to re-orient our economic relations. If you go through the Central Bank reports, you will find that we have been getting funds mostly from the developing countries; emerging economies such as Iran, China and not from the traditional European countries; even from Turkey, it is a an European country, is not, a part of the European Union.

    "text": "( . . - ) (The Hon. M. H. Cegu Isadean - Minister of Export Development) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Venerable Presiding Member, I take this opportunity to thank the Hon. G.L. Peiris, Minister of Export Development and International Trade for giving me this opportunity to speak. The major objective of the Ministry of Export Development and International Trade is to accelerate export expansion as there is a strong correlation between export growth and economic growth. Export growth has indeed been satisfactory during the last few years, mainly due to the pragmatic programmes and policies adopted by the Government and due to the resilience shown by the private sector in the face of numerous adversities both internal and external. Under the leadership of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa and the guidance of the Hon. G.L. Peiris, export performance during the last five years has recorded an average growth of 10 per cent and it is expected that exports will reach US Dollars eight billion in 2008 with a growth of 10 per cent over the previous year. Non-traditional industrial exports such as textiles and garments, wooden products, rubber products, chemical and plastic products, mechanical and electronic products have been well-performed during this period. Agricultural products such as spices, fruits and vegetables, cut flowers and foliage, coir fibre have also registered a satisfactory export performance during the last five years. We cannot however be complacent with our past performance as growth of export is still inadequate to achieve the 8 per cent economic growth required to substantially reduce unemployment and alleviate poverty. Also, a cautionary word has to be mentioned here. The world, at present is passing through a recessionary period and many of our traditional export markets have been adversely affected. Therefore, we should be prepared to brace a difficult period in the near future as the demand for our products declines further. Export development is still mainly confined to metropolitan areas of the country. The contribution of 4.7 per cent to the GDP by the Eastern Province when compared to the contribution of 50 per cent by the Western Province, clearly highlights the need for shifting of focus on development to the less developed regions. This Government is firmly committed to the achievement of reduction in unemployment and alleviation of poverty while at the same time dispersing the benefits of export development into rural areas in order to reduce the gap between urban and rural income. The Government has",

    "text": "therefore formulated several strategies under the \"Mahinda Chintana\" which include the adoption of conducive macroeconomic policies that will improve the supply base in the provinces to ensure quality products for the export market. Mahinda Chintana has placed much confidence on local industry in its development agenda. During the last three years of implementation of the \"Mahinda Chintana\", measures have been introduced to protect the local industry from sub-standard cheap imports. The Budget for 2009 also proposed measures to promote domestic production. Accordingly, cess has been imposed on selected products which have greater impact on the domestic agriculture, livestock sector and the local industry. This measure will lead to build a strong domestic agriculture sector as well as a strong local industry with export potential. Disadvantaged provinces like Eastern Province where agriculture and small industries are the main livelihood will greatly benefit through this proposal. I am very happy to mention that the Budget for 2009 presented by His Excellency the President will go a long way in translating strategies to implementable programmes. In particular, I wish to mention the priority given to the development of the Northern and Eastern Provinces which have borne the brunt of war that has plagued this country for over two decades. Giving a special significance to the people in the Eastern Province which has been liberated from the clutches of terrorism, there are development programmes proposed in the Budget such as the establishment of Agro Exporting Zones and the One Village - One Crop Programme. Under the programme to establish Agro Exporting Zones, the Export Development Board proposes to establish export zones with the involvement of farmer villages in order to produce high quality value added agro products to the export market. The projects that have been identified under this programme in the Eastern Province such as the establishment of a brand for rice based products, production of value added lime based products, expansion of the supply of turmeric, expansion of the supply of organic pineapple for processing and export, expansion of the supply of fresh mangoes for export and the development of the handloom industry will contribute towards rebuilding and uplifting the lives of the people in the Eastern Province. Under the One Village - One Crop Programme, it is expected to identify a conventional crop for each province and to ensure the successful cultivation of such crops in those provinces by providing a package of facilities including extension services, quality seeds, et cetera. These programmes, no doubt will help poor farmers in the province to adopt better farm practices and thereby increase their productivity levels. We are now in a position to ensure revival of livelihood of people in Eastern Province after a long period of suffering.",

I guess matters related to trade is a very important subject and has been set aside for todays discussion. In the morning, we discussed the Votes on the Ministry of Enterprise Development and Investment Promotion coming under the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amanugama; whether it is international trade or domestic trade, all trade matters are being taken up today. Hon. Minster, I do not understand as to why you have been given three institutions when you are a person who has the capacity to handle much more. You have been given a Ministry that has been bifurcated. I actually do not understand the difference between Export Development and International Trade and Enterprise Development and Investment Promotion. It is the same thing in different jargons. Why do you need to waste two peoples talents on this? I am only paying a compliment to you because you can handle much more. There are 110 Ministers here. Some of them do not know whether they are coming or going. On your left hand side, is another able lady who is also jobless, from and executive point of view, even though she can perform much greater. These are the problems that are inherent in the Hambantota District and I guess you might have to look at adifferent district if you want to pursue your political career. Otherwise you might have to be a senior back bencher. Hon. Minister, I think we are speaking in an era which is having a rather tough business environment. I do not want to repeat myself as you were present when I was speaking on the Votes of the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugamas Ministry. But certainly, from an inter national perspective, whether it is trade or whether it is aid, both are becoming dearer to each country. Now the G-8 countries are facing problems. So, before the G-20 countries solve their problems, the G-8 countries have to solve their problems. Before the G-20 countries solve their problem, the other countries, which are vulnerable in nature, have to look after their own affairs. As I said, I came back from Paris from a World Bank Meeting which was headed by Dr. Robert Zoellick and Dr. Strauss-Kahn who is the Managing-Director of the IMF. Both of them concluded their statements saying, Finally each country has to manage their own affairs. So, when it comes to the asian region, when it comes to",

    "text": "the SAARC region or when it comes to Sri Lanka-we little Sri Lanka is a leaf caught in a wind, not knowing what way we can get blown. In normal circumstances, it can get blown into the Indian Ocean and I guess this Government is only trying to expedite that process. I guess people of your nature have to ensure that matters are taken into hands and some rational thinking is brought into the illogical thinking of this Government. I hope you are part and parcel of the progressive thinking rather than those who only accelerate the retarded thinking of the Government. Why I am saying this is because this Government does not seem to have a military policy and all of them are grouped into one. The war is a convenient excuse to suppress, to stymie every single activity that I referred to. You are a Government that came into power with almost 103 promises. Hon. Minister, you were with us but you know that none of them have been fulfilled, except for the war, which has become a rhetoric. Now, if I take the institutions that come under your Ministry, you are looking at many matters of an important nature. Let me take the regional groupings first because that is what basically stimulates a market growth in this country because the domestic growth has contracted. Look at the FTA - the Indian Free Trade Agreement which was graduated to CEPA. You know what happened six months ago. You very enthusiastically took upon yourself to take this forward and then came a cropper when you went to the Cabinet Meeting. The President, the Minister concerned, said, I am sorry. I do not know what you are talking about. We cannot go forward with the CEPA. That was not only a matter of concern for you quite rightly putting all the effort into that-but it was an embarrassment from the point if India, I think for the fourth time they have been sucked in by the Government of Sri Lanka. If India does not understand this matter, then I guess we must tell them that it is high time they open their eyes on behalf of India itself. Then you tried to convert this as if we, the United National Party, were opposing the CEPA. We certainly oppose the stealthy manner in which they were trying to bring it in but, certainly we were the people who initiated the CEPA. So, it is illogical to think that we were against it, except for the surreptitious nature in trying to bring it forward. So, on behalf of my party, the leader and ourselves, we had to explain to the Indian Embassy that this was something which was within the Presidents purview. The first opposition came from the Minister of ports and Aviation - and it happened to be the brother who opposed it. Then, it was Minister of Fisheries who opposed it. So, I guess the opposition came well within the family quarters and I think it is very unfair to put the blame on the United National Party. Be that as it may be, Hon. Minister, I think it is more practical and more important that you have a healthy dialogue on international trade. This is not something you can remove, pluck it and push it and shove it into the Government of Sri Lanka. You should be able to discuss",

    "text": "with the principal Opposition and come into a thinking which is acceptable. You certainly have the ability to speak to us. You have a leader who is very generous and we have been tagged as incompetent and inept. With all that is available, why was the CEPA dropped in such a hurry? So, I guess it is time to open up and tell the real truth behind all this, because now that it is being communicated; the Government looks naked in the manner they tried to take it forward. The Free Trade Agreements with Pakistan and India are going okay, except that the export movement from Sri Lanka is much reduced. The non-tariff barriers are becoming a problem day by day. A lot of exporters who had easy access before-owing to the pressure that we put forward during our tenure when you and I were pushing-have basically been pushed aside and they certainly do have a major problem in their hands. I think it is necessary to ensure that we take up this matter in the spirit of a true free trade agreement and take it forward with the relevant authorities. Then, look at the WTO. We do not understand the exact position of the Government because you have heterogeneous partners, you have the people who give you support - the breakaways from the JVP. In the morning, they are with the WTO and in the evening they are against the WTO. They are still looking at where to remove the plug and where to shove the plug. They do not know what position they are in, Hon. Minister. So, it is very difficult for you to formulate a policy as a Government as to whether it is open trade or whether it is domestic trade or whether it is a secluded operation-where only Sri Lanka has got to look after Sri Lanka because their general feeling is that the world is inside Sri Lanka and that is the problem with you and the partners of your Government. Then coming on to BIMSTEC, it is only a rhetoric and does not seem to be having and progress. You had a SAARC meeting and you spent almost Rs. 5.6 billion. What was the reciprocity we got? What was the SAARC dividend we got? We spent, we broke houses, and we made peoples hearts heartless for the SAARC and at the end of the day we only have the Free Trade Agreement between India and Sri Lanka that is successful. Pakistan is there too, but even if we did not have a free trade agreement, you would have been having the exports going on. So, I guess it is necessary to have a robust Department of Commerce. During our time, we basically stirred enthusiasm, stirred interest, we pushed it along and the lethargy was coming out of it. That is why I believe Anagarika Dharmapala stated that in a Country like ours, if you do some work you have got to listen to unwanted rubbish like what we are hearing today because we got them to work. Inefficiency was rooted out. Corruption was unheard of. That is why some people cannot stand on",

    "text": "at less than 20 per cent interest? In the SAARC region, in India it is about 4 or 5 per cent; in Bangladesh it is about 8 per cent; in Pakistan it may be about 10 per cent and in Maldives it is about 7 to 8 per cent. You have competitors within the region who are borrowing at far less interest then our investors. So, you are only opening the door to some blue-chip companies or to cash-rich people who need not borrow and who can compete, and breaking the backbone of the small and medium investors who are unable to borrow in the normal situation. Coming on to the EDB, I was informed that a new chairman has come in and he is trying to stir interest. But, that does not move the pace if the lending rates do not get changed. You have all the tax rebates that are working on the reverse course of operation You say. We are giving 2 per cent off the cess or 3 per cent off the capital gains tax, this, that and the other. But at the end of the day, indirect taxation and non-recoverable taxation have gone up tremendously. These are factors which ensure that you have a cost-push inflation in the country. Now, if the dollar is stagnated in the manner it has been couched in at the moment and if the exporter is unable to get any further redress, then either he has to sell it domestically or overseas at a loss. None will happen. So, Hon. Minister, you must ensure that you have a system which is more proactive in nature. Mere words is not sufficient. Nice language saying, We intend doing will not do; intentions are not good enough, the actual walk the talk has to take place. So, that is why I thought I will address the issue directly. I get the SLECIC is doing very little these days. It should be made to do a robust operation. The Department of Commerce, as I said, is something which is important. You have got some good talents there. It is only the correct direction that needs to be shown and I am sure they will move on that path. The EDB, as I said, has got to be stimulated and drawn interest. But, I think there is a conflict of interest between the BOI and the EDB. Now, where does the BOI take over? Where does the EDB take over? If the export promotion of the small and medium investors is the EDB s job, then ensure that the BOI does not step into that area. This is something which you and I had discussed when we were in the government together We were of the opinion that there should be point of departure because the two entities are pushing after the same type of investment. So, you should make it clear as to the areas of the EDB and the BOI. The EDB can be assigned to look after domestic investors or to take care of exports less them Rs. 25 million and ensure those areas are developed. You must make the call. Do not let the BOI and the EDB have a conflict in this area because at the end of the day, there will be suckers in the middle who are trying to take advantage from both and not export even an onion. Hon. Minister, I draw your attention from there onwards to a statement that you had made just a couple of days ago. You said, Economic renaissance in the East is",

    "text": "possible due to military action. Firstly, let me take the change of stance from leading the peace process to a military action and the renaissance of economic affairs that comes out of that, to the statements of Mr. Pillaayan, the Chief Minister in the Eastern Province and his rival today, karuna, one of the Tigers who has been brought into Parliament. All these days the assumption was that the UNT were the ones who had nurtured, fostered and fortified Tiger connections but suddenly you find these two legged Tigers coming to Parliament through the Government. Now what does Pillayan say? He says, Eastem Province has no powers. I am unable to employ even a peon. There is no money allocated for us. For six months we have been looking up twiddling our thumbs. Then Karuna says, :I have full confidence in the Chief Minister. So, in that sense what the Chief Minister has said has been endorsed by Karuna. So, where is the economic renaissance in the East? Now, if this is the showpiece of democracy that is there from military pursuit to a democratic and economic reform and if this is what Pillayan, who was elected by force and certainly not by democratic means says, we grant that. I am sure the Hon. M. H. Cegu Isadean will also accept that the Hon. Rauff Hakeem should have really been the Chief Minister in the Eastern Province on the basis of the Muslim support there; the Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie will endorse it certainly. Pillayan has been pushed in and brought in; we will grant all those negative aspects but what does he say? Finally, it is an absolute misery that he speaks of. He says, People in the East are losing confidence. So, Hon. Minister, before we preach to the world, ensure that we have economic renaissance that is starting from Pillayan downwards. Where is his paramilitary force? Where is his child labour force? These are what has led to the question of Labour GSP Plus; the Labour GSP Plus issue is directly stemming from these types of activities. Hon. Minister, I need not teach you as to what Labour GSP is. You can teach me ten times over with your knowledge in legal activities. But, in my humble way, let me say that owing to lack of decency paid to human rights, owing to the torture that is prevalent that they believe, the child soldiers and the child labour exploitation and the media suppression that is taking place - I am sure the colleagues in the media here would certainly bear testimony to the fact that they are being stymied, they are being suppressed, they are being told what to say and if they do what they want, probably they may not be living tomorrow - the European Union, before they grant the GSP Plus concession have all the right to request the Government to allow them to check what is going on. When you signed the application on 10th October, under Clause 9 on page 5, you have agreed if I am not wrong, to be examined, investigated and questioned. Now, at that particular moment you had the opportunity to say no but, you did not dare to do so and forwarded the application and then suddenly when they called upon you and said, We want the investigation to take place, then you have come a cropper. Now, there is a necessity. Today, how many internally displaced people are there? Who is voicing concern over them? After all, they are Sri Lankans. Can we say that the Tamils or",

I was pretty disappointed when an unconditional approach was mady by the Opposition Leader saying, Let us forget everything. Let us protect the labour GSP is stuck in the mud. I was pretty disappointed when an unconditional approach was made by the Opposition Leader saying, Let us forget everything. Let us protect the labour GSP and think of what is required in that. The ICCPR needs to be enforced. Normally, it is accepted that when the Executive signs an Agreement, it is implemented. But, owing to the interpretation of the Supreme Court it had taken a little diversion; the cases that have been filed in the Supreme Court before have proven that it does not walk the talk. As a result, there is a necessity to get it written into the Constitution. So we have expressed our desire to support you. But what was the answer from the Hon. Prime Minister? He said, We do not want to get caught up with matters that are affecting the sovereignty of this country. Hon. Minister, can you tell one area that basically affects the sovereignty of this country? Where is it mandated that you have got to do this, that and the other to receive the Labour GSP? It was only on the area of media stymieing. Are you saying that you do not mind that going on, that the media must be stymied? If that is the case, ensure that it is told openly. Are you saying that child labour should go on? If that does not exist in this country, what is the problem in looking into that area? Human rights is something which basically has not been asked for but it is being perceived may be, and if that is the case, is that something which is violated and is that acceptable? So, Hon. Minister I do not understand as to why such a thing is allowed to go on. When the trade is reducing and the flow of aid is stopped, you lose the Labour GSP. We have a pundit in the Central Bank who thinks that we can teach the world as to how the trade should take place. What happened? He said nine or ten months ago We do not want Labour GSP. If you want, give it; otherwise stop it. That was the language used. Today, the European Union has decided not to in colloquial language but, certainly they have said, Okay, let us investigate what is going on. Then, what happened? Investigation was stopped. But, I am made to understand that they are unilaterally pursuing it. I would like to know from the Hon. Minister whether there is a surreptitious move. The Ravaya newspaper of 23rd of Novermber, 2008 states: GSP + . Are you telling the world one thing and preaching something under? Is that what is going on? Are we privy to know that or not? I am sure you will clarify it. The next thing is, this is a Government that has said, Okay, if the Labour GSP is stopped, we will ensure that the exporter will be benefited to that extent The loss in the year 2009 would roughly be Rs. 21 billion, not Rs. 15 billion was in the year 2007, because the GSP concession applies not only to textile but also to tobacco, fisheries,",

So it is a loss of about Rs. 65 billion over the three years. I do not understand what government has the wherewithal to say, We do not want it. We have sufficient money, so you can stop it. Hon. Minister, I think we have got to be more dexterous in handling this type of thing because we are living in a world connected with each other and I guess it is much more desirable to catch more flies with honey than with vinegar. On that score, what are we basically doing? Why is it that even at this late stage you do not rectify errors? If wrong advice has been given let us correct it. Let us say, We, as Sri Lankans have got together in a bipartisan approach and decided to save the industry and save Rs. 65 billion for the country, Now, here is a Government that could not pay Rs. 250 million to the tea smallholders. Do you think that a Government which could not pay Rs. 250 million to tea smallholders, will honour Rs. 21 billion to the textile industry? When you go to the Finance Ministry they will say, They are textile people. They have money. Just forget about them. When you were the Deputy Minister of Finance during President Kumaratungas regime, you promised Rs. 50 billion to the exporters for airfreight and said that the cost, insurance and freight aspects will be made more competitive. What happened? They spent about Rs. 500 million but not a cent was paid to them. The exporters who are given a 12 per cent tax rebate today are placing orders for the period June/July, 2009 assuming that the Government would give them Rs. 21 billion. They place the orders, which they have got to do now, and if they do not get the money by that time, what will happen? These companies will go bankrupt. So, if you do not think wisely at this moment, we will only open the door to companies like Brandix, MAS Holdings to invest in Hyderabad, in India forgetting Sri Lanka, If that is the policy of the Government, then God bless this country! So, this is what is happening. At this moment, I would also like to draw attention to the Progress Report 2008 and Action Plan 2009 of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources. This Minister has said that this country belongs only to the Sinhalese. But in his own Action Plan he quotes Arahath Maha Mahinda Thero: Oh! Great King, the birds of the air and the beasts have an equal right to live and move about in any part of this land as thou. The land belongs to the people and all other beings and thou art only the guardian of it. He puts this in the front page of his Ministrys Action Plan and talks something completely off the mark when it comes to his own ideas. Hon. Dinesh Guunawardena, does this not made us laugh till our ribs ache and tickle ourselves to death? These are the hypocrites who are guiding the environment in this country. These are the hypocrites who are basically bringing racial disharmony. It is a pity to find that these people come from the",

I mean, sometimes what is told takes a little longer to happen. But, at the end of the day it only comes in compound interest and it is very difficult to come out of it. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) , .

Minister, you spoke about the interest rates of DIMO. There is newspaper article which states; DIMO Chief says that the interests rates are too high. I do not need to labour on that. Then, there is another article which states: Lankan tea drive overseas is being taken up in the last couple of weeks. I thought tea had been sold from 1849. What is going on? Suddenly tea becomes such an important area. This has been our lifeline. So, I guess these are matters for which for which economic priority and prudency must be given. Hon. Minister, now that I have dealt with your Ministry sufficiently, let me get on to - I am left with only six more minutes-the areas of the Hon. Minister of Trade and Marketing Development. This is something very peculiar. As the Minister is not there to defend himself, I would speak only in matters of importance. First of all, I must say that the Cabinet has decided to defer incurring capital expenditure. The circular that has been sent by the Ministry of Finance and Planning dated 11th November states that the Cabinet has decided on the 5th of November to manage public expenditure very strictly during the balance period of 2008. When the President came and presented the Budget in Parliament on the 6th of November, he contradicted what is stated in the circular. So, with that for development activities only about 80 per cent will be used and the balance 20 per cent is put on hold. Now, if that is the case, 10 per cent of capital expenditure will be cut in the year 2009 as per the same circular. So, in 2009 you have a capital cut. You",

    "text": "have no think of two matters. First, on what direction is this Government heading. If you are not reducing inflation and if you are not going to increase your revenue for next year, then the Government is going to get caught in a debt trap or a revenue trap. That is what is going to take place. So, let me first ask that if 10 per cent is being cut from the capital expenditure of Rs. 740 billion for the year 2009, from where is it going to be cut? And, this year if the expenditure is not being expended, then at what point and what are the areas that ate not going to be developed? Is it going to be converted as has been done in the past? Let me first take the Upahara , . . discount . . . . . Sri Lanka State Trading (General) Corporation . ? over-emphasize . . Then, there is the Consumer Affairs Authority. This is another matter which has basically been debated last year, where they said that they are going to bring amendments owing to lack of teeth in the Consumer Affairs Authority Act. It has been spoken new for one year and nothing has happened. Last year, Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa and Hon. Bandula Gunawardane challenged that the Consumer Affairs Authority was changed by me for the benefit of Prima. When I sued them not a guy spoke. They only talk in the well of this House where they are protected through privilege. Not a guy has the guts to talk outside. That is problem. So they are the spineless creatures who only create venom inside them and then, they go out and say, I am sorry it is because I was told to speak That is what happens. Where is the benefit to the consumer? If they can hit us and give the benefit to the people, let if be so. But, they only character assassinate and to not give the benefit to the consumer. Now Hon.

    "text": "who took part in this Debate both from the ranks of the Government and the Opposition. But, I would like to begin, Sir, by describing to this House the overall approach of my Ministry to the development of exports in our country. There is no doubt that exports constitute the foundation of Sri Lankas economy. It was the former Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew whose success was a phenomenon in transforming Singapore from a Third World country into a First World country. Lee Kuan Yew said that the reality of the modern world is that you have to either export or perish. That is why I say that exports performance constitute the throbbing heart of the economy of this country. Now, Mr. Chairman, we are proud of our performance in the field of exports. The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake said that we have not referred to the period between June and August. There is nothing to be afraid of. That is reported on pages 2 and 3 of this document I have. Across the board there has been a development of approximately 15 per cent of exports in this country. What we are trying to do in facing the global crisis, which the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake referred to, is to explore new markets. While consolidating existing markets, the Government is making a determined effort to find new markets for the exports of this country. For that purpose, His Excellency the President, in the Budget that was presented to the House on the 6th of this month, has set apart Rs.1,000 million. Just 10 days ago, I visited Horana in order to participate in a function where for the first time, cosmetics worth US Dollars 500,000 were exported into Iran. I am sure the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake would be happy about that. Iran is a new market and we are now exporting non-traditional goods into a new market. Our trade relations with Turkey are growing by leaps and bounds. Turkey is certainly a country that we must look at closely for this purpose. Vietnam on the East, is yet another country. So, we are finding new markets as a means of dealing with the financial crisis that the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake referred to and mitigating the impact of that crisis as far as Sri Lanka is concerned. That is one part of the strategy of my Ministry. Enhancing exports income is one of the priorities today. We think that that is necessary but that is not sufficient. There is no room for complacency. Simply because the exports are growing and the income that we derive from exports is increasing, we cannot rest on our laurels. There is more to be done. There is a second aspect to the matter. The second aspect, Sir, is to ensure that these benefits percolate down to the grass-roots level. We cannot have these benefits confined to Colombo and the environs. Our per capita income today is US Dollars 1,630. That is something that we can legitimately be proud of. But, we have to ensue that the remoter regions of the Island like Polonnaruwa, Monaragala and Hambantota also benefit from this exports performance. That is why I would say, without hesitation, that among all the programmes which have been embarked upon by the Ministry of Export Development and International",

    "text": "Trade, the most significant, from the point of view of national priorities, is a programme which has to do with the development of export promotion villages which are situated in different parts of the country and the focus is on the remoter regions, the less developed regions because we are concerned about social equity. We want to equalize the benefits that accrue from the growth of Sri Lankas exports. Now, for that purpose, His Excellency the President, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, specifically allocated Rs. 500 million for the development of export promotion villages. Just a few days ago, last Monday, my Ministry, published in all the newspapers in the three languages, Sinhala, Tamil and English, advertisements calling for suggestions from those who are intended to benefit from this project. We want to use this money in a way that is beneficial to the people for whom this is intended. We do not want to declare the policy from the Ministry and impose it on anybody. We will structure these programmes in accordance with the actual suggestions that are proposed by the beneficiaries. For this purpose, we have identified tentatively, 25 export promotion villages in different parts of the country and for this purpose we are proposing to divide the country into nine zones. There is no distinction at all on the basis of ethnicity. This will benefit the South, the North and the East. That is the manner in which this programme has been constructed. What we are proposing to do is to bring the farmer into direct contact with the exporting companies. It often happens in our country that the farmer works very hard but he is not able to get the maximum benefit from what he produces. If we consider fruits and vegetables for example, in Tambuttegama in the Anuradhapura District, in Embilipitiya, in Kolonna, in Polonnaruwa, at certain times of the year there is a glut of these commodities. Now, what we want to do is to infuse technology, make it possible for fruit juices, pulp to be made, for export. We want to develop facilities with regard to packaging. That is one of the weaknesses in Sri Lanka today and the degree of wastage is very large because of the inadequacy and lack of sophistication characterizing our packaging facilities. So, we want to add value, make the maximum use of modern scientific methods; eliminate the unconscionable profits of the middlemen as far as that is possible. We are encouraging large companies to enter into forward contracts with the farmers. So, the farmer is provided with the seed capitals, the know-how, the fertilizer and the company agrees to buy back the product at a pre-agreed price for a stipulated period. In that way, the farmer is insulated from sharp fluctuations in the market. Now all this requires an outlay and it requires expenditure. What we are basically resorting to is an out-grower system which would enable large numbers of people to benefit from the expenditure that is incurred. Now, this is the project that we have embarked upon in order to ensure that the larger volumes of foreign exchange which we earn for the country, find their way into the less-developed parts of the country and we then improve social and economic conditions not just in the Colombo District or the Western Province, but in the country as a whole.",

    "text": "I think there is a lot of talent in this country which we need to make use of. If you look at some of the performers who had become global leaders, they had managed to get where they are by resorting to sophisticated methods of value addition. Today, we do not export out of this country tea in bulk form. We are going in for packeted teas and tea bags. We are going in for flavoured teas. That is how companies like Dilmah has become world famous. When it comes to rubber, one of our principal agricultural exports, we do not export the raw latex. We have technology and we produce tyres, surgical gloves, things of this kind. This means that the foreign exchange that we earn is greatly increased and also the value addition provides employment opportunities for large number of people, the youth in particular. Spices constitute one of the other areas that we want to develop. Sri Lanka produces 80 per cent of the worlds cinnamon. But, the peeling methods are somewhat anachronistic. They are archaic. So, if you want to develop our spices industry, we have to modernize it and for this purpose also expenditure has to be undertaken and those are the resources which have been allocated to the Export Development Board in the provisions of the Budget that was presented on the 6th of this month. In the coconut triangle, Kurunegala, Chilaw and Negombo, the emphasis is naturally on coir products. Yesterday, I was with the Hon. D.M. Jayaratne in Gampola promoting what I consider to be a very successful foliage project. There is an enormous demand for Sri Lankan foliage in some European countries, in particular, the Netherlands. So, we are developing these export promotion villages as a conscious and appropriately chosen instrument in order to maximize the benefits that are available to the farmer in consequence of the development of our exports. Also, one of the key features of the thinking of our Ministry is that exports cannot be conceived of any longer simply in terms of physical commodities. We must also consider services. After all, Sri Lankas principal asset consists of a high calibre of our human resources. We have therefore, begun to export our services. Take for example, the construction industry. We have a great deal of expertise in the construction industry and some of our workers involved in that industry and even professionals in that field have been able to earn large sums of money by going into countries like Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Kuwait, where there is a construction boom and there is a demand for construction expertise. So, these are some of the innovations that have been put in place by the Ministry of Export Development and International Trade and I would like to inform the House of some of these developments.",

    "text": "Then, I would like to respond to some of the points that were made by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake. The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake asked a question about CEPA. The position with regard to CEPA is this. The CEPA, in a sense, is a logical extension of the FTA and there were negotiations which took place in order to make CEPA, a reality. But, then it was found that many local entrepreneurs had significant reservations and concerns about CEPA. The Government naturally felt that before concluding an agreement of that kind, it would be useful to talk to the people who had fears and apprehensions, to address those fears and to find out from them what it is that they found unsatisfactory about the proposed agreement. It was certainly not the wish of the Government to enter into an agreement which was strongly opposed by local entrepreneurs. So, there was a need for discussion and negotiation. I think that should be the policy of any democratic government, not to impose anything on the local entrepreneurs but to find out what their feelings, their wishes and their priorities are to address those concerns and to conclude the agreement only after allaying the fears and the anxieties which have been articulated by local industry. So, we are in the process of talking to the Chamber of Commerce and to the local businessmen who thought that they had problems with the proposed agreement. I do not think that there is anything wrong with that course of action. That is exactly how a government should deal with matters of this kind. The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake also said that the free trade - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)",

Let us finish it and go forward, but, suddenly you say, Now we will get back to the discussion. . . ( .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) No, these are processes. These are not concluded events.

Now, that is the help that the United National Party is offering. They are telling us, You come before the House to change the Constitution. The European Commission has made it very clear that they are not interested in that exercise at all. It is only you who are asking us to do that, not the European Commission. The European Commission does not want a change in the Constitution of this country. I say so categorically and with responsibility. The European Commission has raised various issues.

Member, the position is that this is not a live issue as far as the European Commission is concerned. They are not interested in going into this question whether the ICCPR is part of our law. They accept the judgment of the court. Now, on the question of the First Optional Protocol, the constitutional amendment that you want, you are saying that you will support us. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)",

The two are completely different. Then, there is one other thing that I must say, Sir. The Constitutional amendment which the United National Party wants, includes the First Optional Protocol. What is the effect of the First Optional Protocol? It means that any judgment pronounced by the highest judicial tribunal in this country, the Supreme Court, will be subject to appeal to a foreign tribunal. Now, the Supreme Court of this country, in the Singarasa case, specifically held that an amendment of that kind will violate Sri Lankas Constitution because our Constitution contains an explicit provision exclusively vesting judicial power in the courts of the Republic. So, judicial power in this country can be exercised only by courts in Sri Lanka. Judicial power in this country in accordance with our Constitution, cannot be exercised by an European Court, an American Court or a Japanese Court. It has to be exercised by courts in this country. Now, the United National Party then said, If that is your problem, we will provide you with a two-thirds majority. That does not answer the question because that is not a provision that can be changed by a two-thirds majority. It will require a referendum. Now, Sir, I make bold to say that no government in this country, whatever political party it may consist of, will go before the people of Sri Lanka at a referendum asking the people to endorse a Constitutional amendment which has the effect of degrading the highest judicial tribunal of this land and making a judgment of the Supreme Court subject to appeal to a foreign tribunal.

Sir, I will stop in about four or five minutes. As far as the GSP Plus is concerned, the present position is this. We have made our application. It was received in Brussels on the 10th of October, 2008. We are not withdrawing our application and Sri Lankas Ambassador in Brussels, His Excellency Ravinatha Ariyasinghe has been instructed to continue to engage in a dialogue with the European Commission on all matters which arise from Sri Lankas application. However, we have made it very clear that one thing that Sri Lanka will not agree to, is to subject this country to an investigation by a foreign tribunal. So, we are certainly prepared to engage in a dialogue. We have not shut the door on an engagement. We are prepared to do that. But, it must be done in a manner that is consistent with the self-respect, dignity and the sovereignty of this country. Not even in the days of the British Raj, after we ceased to be a colony and then became a dominion, was there any question of this country and its administration being investigated by a foreign power. That is not acceptable. But, if they have issues to raise, if they have questions to ask us, we will certainly not run away from those issues. We are quite confident that we can convince any impartial observer of the positive trends which have taken place in this country in the recent past. Contextual considerations are of overriding importance, Mr. Chairman, and having regard to that, the Government has every confidence that it can persuade any objective, dispassionate tribunal of the positive developments which have taken place in this land during the last few months. The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake said companies like Bandix are running away and investing in India. Brandix is proposing to open a large factory in the District of Batticaloa, which will provide employment for 1,800 people. Brandix, which is a large private company, has confidence in the developments which are taking place in the Eastern Province and they are going ahead. They have already started to construct this factory there and that will bring livelihoods back to the people of that part of the country that have suffered anguish for a very long time. Hayleys is another company which has shown great confidence in the developments which are taking place in that region and they are investing very considerably in agricultural pursuits in that area. I must also mention that the Assistant United States Trade Representative for South Asia, Mr. Michael Delaney, traveled by helicopter in the company of His Excellency Robert OBlake, the American Ambassador, to Trincomalee. He saw for himself some of the developments that were taking place in Trincomalee. He saw for himself some of the developments that were taking place in Trincomalee.

He expressed great satisfaction of what he saw with his own eyes and he told me in the presence of the American Ambassador that the US Government and in particular, USAID would be happy to involve themselves in a variety of programmes in that part of the country, focussing upon skills development, vocational training and the establishment of linkages between the private sector and the public sector. So, all is not doom and gloom. There are people - the private sector, foreign governments - who have demonstrated confidence in what is unfolding in that part of the country and it is certainly not the case that companies like MAS Holdings and Brandix are deserting the shores of their native land in order to invest overseas. That is a distortion of the truth, if I may say so, with respect. Since my time is up, Mr. Chairman, I would like to conclude by expressing my sincere appreciation to all the officials of the Ministry, who have made it possible vigorously to implement these imaginative and productive programmes. In particular, I would mention Mr. Ranugge, the Secretary of my Ministry, for whose knowledge of administrative procedures and sense of integrity I have a great respect. Mr. Anil Koswatta, who has recently taken over as the Head of the Export Development Board, has invigorated that whole institution and his work has made a substantial difference to the functioning of the Export Development Board. I would also like to make reference to Mr. C. A. N. Perera, the Head of the SLECIC, who has also contributed in no small measure to the success of those programmes, particularly the APARA programme which is intended to provide support for Sri Lankans who are travelling abroad in search of employment. So, these are vital functions which are being discharged at the moment by my Ministry. I would like to thank all Members of this august Assembly who participated in these preceedings and I assure them that we will do our best to make a success of the matters which have been entrusted to us by His Excellency the President.
