, . , , . , , . . . , , , , 88 . . * . , . - - . . . . lobby . . . . Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, now I would like to cite as to how we have brought the entire SAARC region together consisting of eight countries in combating terrorism. Our resolution was towards making a meaningful declaration in addressing this scourge of terrorism and how we are going to counter it. The Declaration that was made at the 15th SAARC Summit is relevant in this regard. I may quote the relevant sections associated with combating terrorism, how the entire SAARC region has come forward to echo the need for us to join hands in bringing about the counter-terrorism measures in relation to the SAARC region and particularly how we are going to introduce mutual legal assistance within the SAARC region. That too was signed during the SAARC Summit in Colombo. The particular section that embodies and includes terrorism is

a very relevant and a salient feature in the "SAARC Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters". For the first time, we have got an enabling Convention that could counter-terrorism jointly within the region. Now, I may quote that section from the "SAARC Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters". It states: Recalling the discussions in SAARC on cooperation measures for combating criminal activities including those related to terrorism. This Convention deals with the scope of application, implementation, the methodology including all other definitions associated in countering terrorism in a meaningful manner. These are the far-reaching Declarations and implementing Conventions that we were able to agree upon at this 15th SAARC Summit. I would also like to state that every leader who gathered in Colombo went to the extent of condemning terrorism and they insisted on the need for us to counter-terrorism in a meaningful manner, because it is vital at a time when we have made good progress in our efforts in combating terrorism in the North and at a time that we are trying to restore democracy in all parts of Sri Lanka. I would like to quote what the Indian Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh has said. That is vital because India was made a very focal matter, particularly by the JVP yesterday. I am quoting the "News Line" under the heading "SAARC leaders condemn terrorism". It states, I quote: "India - single biggest threat to our stability and progress. " 'Terrorism continues to rear its ugly head in our region. It remains the single biggest threat to our stability and to our progress. We cannot afford to lose the battle against the ideologies of hatred, fanaticism and against all those who seek to destroy our social fabric, said the Indian Prime Minsiter Dr. Manmohan Singh' ". It further states, I quote: Terrorists and extremists know no borders. In conclusion the Indian Prime Minister highlighted the need for us to fight terrorism. What did Mr. Makhdoom Raza Gilani, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, say? He has said, I quote: "Pakistan -We need to fight it individually as well as collectively. I condemn the attack on the Indian Embassy in Kabul. Pakistan has suffered from terrorism, which afflicts all countries of this region. We too have lost a great leader in Benazir Bhutto becauseof terrorism. It is our joint responsibility to rid our region of this menace. We need to fight it individually as well as collectively". "The forthcoming meetings of the SAARC Police Chiefs and Home and Internal Ministers in Islamabad, which takes place later this year, will focus on strengthening regional cooperation against terrorism, he said".

What has the President of Afghanistan say on terrorism? I quote: "Afghanistan-wild fires of terrorism spreading across the region."

* . * . * Produced at end of speech.

2705 2706

He further says, I quote: I am sure you will realize that these terrorist attacks are a rapidly growing threat, not just to Afghanistan or India, but throughout the entire SAARC region. Considering the many threats facing South Asia, President Karzai said that terrorism is by far the greatest and most menacing threat of all. While the people of Afghanistan today are bearing the brunt of international terrorism on a daily basis, it is with tremendous trepidation that we watch the wildfires of terrorism spreading across the region". What did Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed, the Chief Advisor and the Head of the Government of Bangladesh say? He says, I quote: "Bangladesh - committed against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations". "The deadly fangs of terrorism are spreading across the region. They threaten to disrupt peaceand stability. We must combat this menace of terrorism across the broadest possible spectrum. Then, what did the Prime Minister of Bhutan, Lyonchen Jigmi Y. Thinley say in condemning terrorism. He says, I quote: "We unequivocally condemn these senseless and reprehensible acts of violence regardless of how sublime, noble and even desperate a cause may be; we can never justify the means that can kill and maim innocent men, women and children in the most cowardly and barbaric ways. Then, this is what the President of Maldives, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom has said. It states, I quote: "Maldives - strengthen collective efforts to combating the scourge of terrorism". "Maldivian President Maumoon abdul Gayoom said that it was the most important duty of SAARC to undertake all efforts to strengthen collective efforts to combat the scourge of terrorism".. 'The SAARC Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters will complement the efforts of the law enforcement agencies for greater regional cooperation in the fight against terrorism". Now, this is what we have brought in real meaningful terms.

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. M.K. Shivajilingam) State terrorism .

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) The terrorism coming from your part is terrorism. There is no State terrorism in this part of the world. Is there State terrorism in India? Hon. Member, are you saying that there is State terrorism in India? Sometimes you cannot even hear the word "terrorism" because you are so much resistive to these words because you are trying to live with terrorists. That is the biggest mistake one can make, Hon. Member. That is what you have to be.

Now, Sir, we not only did confine our condemnation of terrorism in bringing the entire unity of the SAARC region to one voice but also spread to other regions as well. What did Australia say? All successive governments were trying to get the condemnation of terrorism from the Australian quarters and we have now succeeded in making it happen. I like to quote a Media Release under the heading "Australia invited as Observer to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Smuuit" dated 5th August 2008 where it states, I quote: Australia welcomes Sri Lankas successful hosting of the Fifteenth SAARC Summit. Australia especially welcomes the Summit Declarations strong message on the need for international cooperation in the fight against terrorism. Now, this is a singular achievement where Australia has condemned terrorism and endorsed the Declaration that was made in Colombo at the Fifteenth SAARC Summit. Several thousands of miles away from the Indian Ocean, Australia was in a position to endorse the Declaration, but I am sorry to say, that my learned Friends across the divide here have failed to mention a single word or at least the slightest reference to the Declaration that we were able to bring about successfully at the Fifteenth SAARC Summit. That is the irony of Sri Lankas political divide. We have no cures for that. We have no answers. But we have to blame ourselves for the culture that is there in Sri Lanka. At the same time, the UNP has a major problem. , , . , . , . -[ ] 23 , , . . . . . . , . , '''' 22 . . 24. , . . , .. . , . ,

Introduction

The President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, His Excellency Mr. Hamid Karzai; the Chief Adviser of the Government of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh, His Excellency Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed; the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Bhutan, His Excellency Lyonchhen Jigmi Y. Thinley; the Prime Minister of the Republic of India, His Excellency Dr. Manmohan Singh; the President of the Republic of Maldives, His Excellency Mr. Maumoon Abdul Gayoom; the Prime Minister of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, the Rt. Honble Girija Prasad Koirala; the Prime Minister of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, His Excellency Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani; and the President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, His Excellency Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, met at the Fifteenth Summit meeting of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) held in Colombo, Sri Lanka on August 2 - 3, 2008. Regional cooperation 2. The Heads of State or Government reaffirmed their commitment to the principles and objectives enshrined in the SAARC Charter. They renewed their resolve for collective regional efforts to accelerate economic growth, social progress and cultural development which would promote the welfare of the peoples of South Asia and improve their quality of life, thereby contributing to peace, stability, amity and progress in the region. 3. The Heads of State or Government recognized that SAARC has been making steady and incremental progress over the years, in particular since the last Summit held in New Delhi in April 2007, towards realizing the objectives of the Charter. They accordingly emphasized the importance of maintaining the momentum, through clear links of continuity between the work already underway and future activities. The Heads of State or Government recognized the need for SAARC to further strengthen its focus on developing and implementing regional and sub-regional projects in the agreed areas on a priority basis. Each Member State may consider taking up at least one regional / sub-regional SAARC project as the lead country. 4. The Leaders noted with satisfaction the considerable progress made in various domains of partnership among SAARC Member States and emphasized the need to consolidate and ensure effective implementation of all SAARC programs and mechanisms by rationalization and performance evaluation on a regular basis.

A Partnership for Growth for the Peoples of South Asia 5. The Heads of State or Government were convinced that the process of regional cooperation must be truly people-centered, so that SAARC continues to strengthen in keeping with expectations as a robust partnership for growth for the peoples of South Asia. They accordingly directed all SAARC mechanisms to abide by the Charter objective of promoting the welfare of the people and improving their quality of life. In this regard they directed the Council of Ministers to ensure that SAARC mechanisms identify further areas of cooperation where people-centric partnership projects could be initiated.

6. The Heads of State or Government observed that an effective and economical regional tele-communication regime is an essential factor of connectivity, encouraging the growth of people-centric partnerships. They stressed the need for the Member States to endeavour to move towards a uniformly applicable low tariff, for international direct dial calls within the region. Connectivity 7. The Heads of State or Government recognized the importance of connectivity for realizing the objectives of SAARC. They accordingly directed the SAARC mechanisms to continue to embody in their programs and projects a strong focus on better connectivity not only within South Asia, but also between the region and the rest of the world. They further stressed the necessity of fast-tracking projects for improving intra-regional connectivity and facilitating economic, social and people-to-people contacts. Energy 8. The Heads of State or Government noted that increased access to energy is critical for fulfilling the legitimate expectations of growth and development in South Asia. They observed in this regard that the escalation of oil prices threatens both the energy security of the region, as well as the economic growth witnessed in South Asia. In this context, they recognized the need to expeditiously develop and conserve the conventional sources of energy and to build up renewable alternative energy resources including indigenous hydro power, solar, wind and bio, while introducing energy reforms, energy efficiency and the trade and sharing of technology and expertise. They also noted that there is tremendous potential for developing regional and sub-regional energy resources in an integrated manner and noted the efforts being made to strengthen regional cooperation in capacity development, technology transfer and the trade in energy. While expressing satisfaction at the progress over the recent years to strengthen energy cooperation, the Leaders directed that the recommendations of the Energy Dialogue be implemented through an appropriate work plan. 9. The Heads of State or Government stressed the urgent need to develop the regional hydro potential, grid connectivity and gas pipelines. They noted that the possibility of evolving an appropriate regional inter-governmental framework may be explored to facilitate such an endeavour. They welcomed Sri Lankas offer to host the Third Meeting of SAARC Energy Ministers in Colombo in 2009. Environment 10. Being increasingly aware of global warming, climate change and environmental challenges facing the region, which mainly include sea-level rise, deforestation, soil erosion, siltation, droughts, storms, cyclones, floods, glacier melt and resultant glacial lake outburst floods and urban pollution, the Heads of State or Government reiterated the need to intensify cooperation within an expanded regional environmental protection framework, to deal in particular with climate change issues. They were of the view that SAARC should contribute to restoring harmony with nature, drawing on the ancient South Asian cultural values and traditions of environmental responsibility and sustainability. 11. The Leaders expressed satisfaction at the adoption of SAARC Action Plan and Dhaka Declaration on Climate Change by the SAARC Environment Ministers at the SAARC Ministerial Meeting on Climate Change held at Dhaka on 3rd July 2008. In this context they stressed the need for close cooperation for capacity building, development of CDM projects and promotion of programs for advocacy and mass awareness raising on climate change. They also expressed satisfaction at the adoption of a SAARC Declaration on Climate Change for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) by the Twenty-ninth Session of the Council of Ministers. 12. The Heads of State or Government expressed deep concern over global climate change and its impact on the lives and livelihoods in the region. They also noted the urgency of the immediate need for dealing with the onslaught of climate change including sea level rise, on meeting

food, water and energy needs, and taking measures to ensure the livelihood security of the peoples in the SAARC region. They resolved to work together to prevent and address the threats to the livelihoods of the peoples and to provide access to remedies when these rights are violated and also to find an equitable distribution on responsibilities and rights among the Member States. They also emphasised the need for assessing and managing its risks and impacts. In this regard, they called for an in-depth study on Climate Justice : The Human Dimension of Climate Change, to come up with a rights-based approach that would highlight the human impact when responding to the impacts of climate change. 13. The Heads of State or Government affirmed that every citizen of this planet must have an equal share of the planetary atmospheric space. In this context, they endorsed the convergence of per capita emissions of developing and developed countries on an equitable basis for tackling climate change. They were of the view that any effort at addressing climate change should take into account historical responsibility, per capita emissions and respective country capabilities. 14. The Heads of State or Government expressed concern at the human loss suffered through natural disasters in the region and stressed the need for the timely provision of relief in humanitarian emergencies. In this regard they directed that a Natural Disaster Rapid Response Mechanism be created to adopt to coordinated and planned approach to meet such emergencies under the aegis of the SAARC Disaster Management Centre. Water Resources 15. The Heads of State or Government expressing their deep concern at the looming global water crisis, recognized that South Asia must be at the forefront of bringing a new focus to the conservation of water resources. For this purpose they directed initiation of processes of capacity building and the encouragement of research, combining conservation practices such as rain water harvesting and river basin management, in order to ensure sustainability of water resources in South Asia. Poverty Alleviation 16. The Heads of State or Government while acknowledging the significant steps taken to alleviate poverty in the region, resolved to continue to combat poverty through all available means, including especially through peoples empowerment,. They committed themselves to continuing to share each others experiences and success stories of pro-poor poverty reduction strategies such as micro-credit systems, community-driven initiatives and the raising of the consciousness of the poor on their right to resources and development. 17. In this respect, they emphasized on undertaking sustained efforts, including developing and implementing regional and sub-regional project towards the attainment of SAARC Development Goals (SDGs). They noted the decision by the Ministers on Poverty Alleviation to obtain an inter-governmental mid-term review of the attainment of the SDGs to be completed by 2009. 18. The Leaders welcomed the offer of Nepal to host next Ministerial Meeting on Poverty Alleviation. SAARC Development Fund (SDF) 19. The Heads of State or Government expressed satisfaction at the signing of the Charter of the SAARC Development Fund (SDF), and finalization of its Bye-laws, and called for an early ratification of the SDF Charter. They also welcomed early operationalization of the Fund from the available funds. They expressed satisfaction at the launching and identification of the projects on women empowerment, maternal & child health and teachers training under the social window of the SDF, as directed by the Finance Ministers. They reiterated their commitment to expedite their financial contributions to the Fund. In this regard, the Heads of State or Government accepted with appreciation the offer of the Kingdom of Bhutan to host the SAARC Development Fund Secretariat in Thimphu.

Transport 20. The Heads of State or Government expressed satisfaction at the progress through the Meetings of the Ministers of Transport. They reiterated the critical importance of an efficient multi-modal transport system in the region for integration and for sustaining the regions economic growth and competitiveness. They urged early implementation in a gradual and phased manner of the proposals of the SAARC Regional Multimodal Transport Study (SRMTS). 21. They noted the progress made in the consideration of the draft Motor Vehicle Agreement (MVA) by Member States. They also noted that technical inputs related to Regional Transport and Transit Agreement and Regional Multilateral Railway Agreement were being examined by the Member States. In this context, they directed the next Transport Ministers Meeting to expedite work in this regard. They appreciated the offer of Sri Lanka to hold the Second Meeting of SAARC Ministers of Transport in Colombo in 2008. Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Development 22. The Heads of State or Government urged the need for even more expeditions and close regional cooperation in information and communication technology. They welcomed the enhanced digital connectivity among the Member States and the ongoing work to upgrade the regional telecommunication infrastructure. They directed that the arrangements needed to implement the proposed collaborative tele-projects such as those for health care and education, be expedited. Science and Technology 23. The Heads of State or Government acknowledged the ongoing contribution of Science & Technology including cutting edge Technology in information and bio-technology in improving the quality of life of the peoples of South Asia. They noted the offer of India to host the Ministerial Meeting on Science & Technology on September 15 -16, 2008 for development of a roadmap on identifying implementable focused regional and sub-regional project in SAARC. Tourism 24. The Heads of State or Government underscored the vital contribution that tourism could afford to the economic development of the SAARC region. They agreed to make every effort to implement the comprehensive action plan adopted by the Second Ministerial Meeting held at Coxs Bazaar, Bangladesh. These efforts would include facilitating the movement of people through improved travel infrastructure and air, sea and land connectivity among the SAARC countries, collaboration in human resource development and the promotion of SAARC as a common destination through public-private partnerships and joint campaigns. Culture 25. The Heads of State or Government emphasized the role of cultural connectivity in bringing the peoples of South Asia closer, while reinforcing and projecting a distinct south Asian identity. They directed that the Agenda for Culture be implemented in full. SAFTA and Trade Facilitation 26. The Heads of State or Government emphasized their commitment to implement SAFTA in letter and in spirit, thereby enabling SAARC to contribute as well to the dynamic process of Asias emergence as the power house of the world. Recognizing the need to continue to address the major barriers effective trade liberalization in the region, which include sensitive lists of items and Non-Trade Barriers (NTBs), they directed that the decision to revise the sensitive lists by the SAFTA Ministerial Council (SMC) be implemented early. They also recommended that while revising the Sensitive Lists, special consideration be given to the LDCs. The Leaders directed that SAFTA Committee of Experts (SCoE) to Expeditiously resolve the issue of Non Tariff Measures (NTMs) and Para Tariff Measures in order to facilitate and enhance the trade under SAFTA. 27. The Heads of State or Government underlined the need for taking concrete measures to improve trade facilitation in terms of the mutual recognition of standards, the adoption of common tariff nomenclatures,

the harmonization of customs procedures. They directed the relevant SAARC bodies to expedite their work in these areas. They also recognized the importance of development of communication system and transport infrastructure and transit facilities specially for the landlocked countries to promote intra-SAARC trade. 28. The Heads of State or Government observed that the SAARC legal instruments on trade liberalization and the measures and initiatives for trade facilitation are increasingly affording significant openings for mutually beneficial trade, investments and economic co-operation within South Asia. These openings are complemented by the uniformly sound levels of national economic growth being attained by the Member States of SAARC. The Leaders accordingly noted the growing and urgent need for enhancing capacity within SAARC dedicated to encouraging national and regional strategies that would further maximize the positive trade, investments and economic cooperation climate in South Asia. In this regard they welcomed the offer of Sri Lanka to prepare a Concept Paper and a Working Paper on the subject and directed that the Paper be discussed at a Session of the Standing Committee specially convened for this purpose, to enable the adoption of appropriate follow-up measures. 29.

Colombo Statement on Food Security We, the Heads of State or Government, participating in the Fifteenth SAARC Summit held in Colombo on 2-3 August 2008, affirm our resolve to ensure region-wide food security and make South Asia, once again, the granary of the world.

In view of the emerging global situation of reduced food availability and worldwide rise in food prices, we direct that an Extra-ordinary Meeting of the Agriculture Ministers of the SAARC Member States be convened in New Delhi, India in November 2008, to evolve and implement a people-centred short to medium term regional strategy and collaborative projects that would, among others, lead to : * Increase in food production; * Investment in agriculture and agro-based industries; * Agriculture research and prevention of soil health degradation; * Development and sharing of agricultural technologies; * Sharing of best practices in procurement and distribution; and * Management of the climatic and disease-related risks in agriculture. We direct that the SAARC Food Bank be urgently operationalised. We also emphasise early drawing up of the SAARC Agriculture Perspective 2020. We further direct that SAARC region should forge greater cooperation with the international community to ensure food availability and nutrition security in South Asia. Remarks by H. E. the President at the Concluding Press Conference of the SAARC Summit Good evening, Ladies and Gentlemen, The Summit which concluded just a little while ago had as its central theme the strengthening of the partnership between all the peoples of South Asia, for growth and prosperity. In other words, SAARC has committed it self to ensuring that its endeavours would remain strongly centered on the peoples of South Asia. The media will be crucial to the realization of this commitment for it is the media which provides that connectivity essential to ensuring that Governments, give the people the foremost place. Therefore, I do welcome this opportunity soon after taking over as Chair of SAARC, to speak to the media. I convey to the peoples of our region through you the firm endorsement by all the Heads of State or Government of the Summit theme and Declaration - Partnership for Growth for our People. In the final analysis, all regional cooperation efforts including in South Asia, have as their objective prosperity and equitable development. Economic and commercial cooperation therefore occupied a very high place in the Summit deliberations. You would also appreciate Ladies and Gentlemen, that the Summit had to grapple with two issues that have in recent times come to pose strong challenges throughout the globe, as well as in our region. The first is the situation of reduced food availability that is leading to a world wide rise in food prices. The other is the increasing cost of energy. Both of them if unchecked can have the potential of undoing the hard won developmental gains that the peoples of South Asia and their Governments, have achieved. Given the seriousness of the subject of food security, all the Leaders felt that it deserved to be addressed through a Special Statement, released along with the Declaration. In this Statement, the Leaders of the SAARC countries affirm their resolve to make South Asia once again a major granary of the world, through a series of interconnected and specific regional collaborative projects. Towards this end, an Extraordinary Meeting of the Agriculture Ministers will shortly be convened to address all connected issues on Asian matters for us to follow up. At the same time, to ensure continued nutritional security, directions have been given that the SAARC Food Bank which will store stocks for distribution in case of a scarcity within the South Asian region, should be immediately operationalised. Let me add that since the issue of food has global ranifications, the action SAARC undertakes will not be isolated from similar efforts in other regions of the world. In the field of energy, the approach will be built on several pillars. Firstly, there will be an effort to try to develop and conserve conventional sources of energy. Secondly, there will be a strong focus on alternative and renewable energy sources, including hydro power, solar, wind and bio. The third pillar which complements the other two, would consist of progressing

2008 06 2719 2720

energy reforms, increasing energy efficiency, transferring technology and trading in energy. The Energy Ministers of the SAARC countries are due to meet in Colombo next year and they will maintain the political momentum in this regard.

There was unanimity that the South Asian Free Trade Agreement or SAFTA, as it is more popularly known, and which aims through the eventual elimination of tariffs to sharply increase the volumes of trade and the sharing of prosperity, must be implemented in both letter and in spirit. The SAARC leaders also directed that the implementation of SAFTA must be accompanied by the expeditious resolution of the problem of non-tariff barriers within the region, that come in the way of realizing the full benefit of lowering customs duties.

The Summit was able to ensure the finalization and signature of two Agreements, vital for economic and trade collaboration. One of them relates to the establishment of the South Asian Regional Standards Organization which will harmonize the quality assurance levels of goods traded between the member States. The other was the Charter of the SAARC Development Fund, which with its initial base of US $ 300 million will provide financial support for both frastructure development and social upliftment projects in South Asia.

All the Leaders participating in the Summit were absolutely clear that terrorism has become a great menace throughout the world, including in our region. South Asia cannot progress, unless there is stability and security throughout the region. It is in this spirit, that the Summit was able to finalize and then have signed the Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters. The Leaders condemned all. Forms of terrorist violence and emphasized that the Member States should firmly cooperate, especially through the exchange of information, against terrorism and organized crime.

The SAARC countries which together account for over 1/5th of humanity, have always been conscious of the need to preserve for future generations the common heritage of the environment which nurtures all mankind. The Declaration therefore has a significant section on this issue, underscoring the resolve of the SAARC family to progress on the path of development in harmony with nature, and drawing on the ancient South Asian cultural values and traditions of environmental responsibility and sustainability. The Leaders have also directed that the region should establish a Natural Disaster Rapid Response Mechanism, operating under the SAARC Disaster Management Centre.

The concern for the environment has included the issue of depleting water resources, which is a problem encountered in many areas of the world. SAARC will accordingly try to build up its collective regional capacities through research on water conservation, combining traditional conservation approaches such as rain water harvesting with newer approaches such as river basin management.

In the social sector, the Summit directed that the South Asian University based in New Delhi should begin its first session in 2010. The University is perhaps one of the most far-sighted projects undertaken by SAARC, for through bringing together the best of our youth in a centre of academic excellence, it will over the years, cement even further the bonds of friendship among the peoples of South Asia.

The Summit has also given practical effect to its theme of forging partnerships based on people, by recommending to introduce an uniformly low call charge rate for IDD communication within South Asia. At present, through the rates have admittedly been coming down over the years, nevertheless the call charges within the region remain somewhat costly.

The summit has also moved to strengthen the links of SAARC with the world outside. After endorsement during the discussions, there are now eight countries and one regional association that have observer status. This growth in the ranks of the Observers shows that there is an increasing enthusiasm for engagement with South Asia, perhaps because our part of the world is expanding both economically as well as in terms of human resources. The

Summit resolved to reciprocate this enthusiasm, by adopting guidelines that will facilitate SAARC to henceforth embark on practical and mutually beneficial projects of cooperation with those Observers, who are interested in doing so. We have also agreed on procedures as to how SAARC will interact with inter-governmental organizations. In conclusion, Ladies and Gentlemen, may I say that our deliberations were characterized by a spirit of great commitment to the continued progress of all the Member States and peoples of SAARC. The success of the Summit affords an auspicious start to Sri Lankas tenure as Chair of the Association. My Government and I pledge our utmost to faithfully carry out the high responsibilities assigned to us. I have no doubt Ladies and Gentlemen, that in our effort to do so we will have the firm support and goodwill of all our fellow SAARC countries and South Asian peoples.

[.. 12.40] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees. I am glad to follow our Foreign Minister, the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama. I was very carefully listening to what he was saying. He was copiously quoting from the speeches of the Heads of States who attended the SAARC Summit referring to the Convention on Suppression of Terrorism that they were adopting. Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, something that is very ironic is that all the Heads of States referred to a variety of incidents in the region related to terrorism. They referred to the Indian High Commission bombing in Kabul. They referred to the Ahamabad bombings. They referred to Benazir Bhuttos assassination and the Karachchi incident. But none of them referred to any terrorist incidents in Sri Lanka. Why is that? Is it because of the Foreign Ministrys fault in not properly advising them of what has happened here or is it that they very judiciously and considerately avoiding referring to incidents here since they themselves were quite unhappy about the State terrorism which is equal to other acts of the terrorists taking place in this country? Not a single Head of State in their speeches referred to a single incident of terrorism in this country. They referred to all other types of terrorism which obviously needs to be condemned. But then why should they not directly condemn the terrorist acts here? They very consciously avoided perhaps because they need at least to bring upon some realization on this Governments action which for all purposes is a mirror image of what is caused by the LTTE. It is very interesting that I had to refer to this white van incidents. Then there was a very interesting joke that appeared in one of the Sunday newspapers. I attended the book-release ceremony of our former Defence Secretary, Mr. Austin Fernando, which was mentioned by my Friend, the Hon. Vijitha Herath during his speech. His book was titled My belly is white. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition who was seated next to Mr. Austin

Fernando in the podium mentioned to Austin, Your successor is also writing a book. Your book is titled, "My belly is white" and his book is titled "My van is white'". This was carried in one of the Sunday newspapers. The successor is Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the present Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, Public Security, Law and Order. So, that I believe is an interesting joke. But it is no joke any more because these white van incidents are going beyond any tolerant levels and I would like, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, to table* a memorandum sent to His Excellency the President by the Federation of Mosques from Batticaloa District about several incidents that had taken place in the month of July in Eravur. In that memorandum they have listed these incidents. On the 14th of July Mr. Razick Jiffry and Mr. Segu Ismail Mohamed Naoufer were abducted while travelling towards Eravur from Welikanda by some unidentified people who came in a white van. They were detained for three days, severely tortured and released on the 17th of July. Then, Mr. Aliyar Sakkab of Eravur who serves in the Sri Lanka Telecom was abducted on 20th of July 2008 by those who came in a white van. He was released the same night after brutal torture. On the 30th July 2008, a gang came at night in a white van to Meerakerny in Eravur and tried to kidnap some persons but when a woman raised an alarm, they left the place. Then, on 31st July 2008, four persons came in a white van and forcibly took away Sahul Hameed Abdul Samam, Sahul Hameed Aspahan who is a teacher, Mr. Jamaldeen Rajai and Mr. Sally Mohamed Anas Noufer. They had been released after severe torture and one among them was released only after three days. These incidents have taken place in Eravur and a memorandum had been submitted to His Excellency the President by the Federation of Mosques.

Now, these incidents, I would like to tell you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, is a sequel to certain incidents that had taken place previous to these incidents. Now, you would remember that I had referred to this matter earlier too. The University Teachers for Human Rights in a recent report mentioned that a Government Minister in the area is arming certain Muslim youth in order to pursue his political aims and there were several incidents that were mentioned by the University Teachers for Human Rights in their report and I will on a later occasion table that. I am told that this Minister, Hon. Ameer Ali, had intervened to release a person who had been taken into custody. This person had been involved in several violent incidents. These white van people have promptly released him because of the Ministers intervention. So, this shows the complicity of the Government in some of these incidents. This is a very dangerous trend and people are talking about militancy in the Eastern Province, militancy among the Tamils, militancy among the Muslims and there are fears of

radicalization. This very Government, by its very short-sighted actions, is building up armed gangs for their own political purposes. Finally they also get hold of innocent people, abduct them and torture them.

: I quote further : The United Nations said yesterday the delivery of humanitarian aidin Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu districts was hampered due to an acute shortage of fuel and the escalation of the war causing more pain and suffering to an already battered people surviving in makeshift camps. The UN spokesman Gordon Weiss told the Daily Mirror, fighting between the security forces and the LTTE had escalated resulting in some 57,000 more people being displaced by the end of July. He said the war situation and the fuel shortage made it extremely difficult and dangerous for UN humanitarian missions to transport food and other much needed supplies to these people. When asked whether sufficient stocks of food and other relief supplies were available, he replied in the affirmative. We are doing our best to provide food, water and other necessities to the affected people Mr. Weiss said. , 30 , . , , , , , , , , . , . . - - . . - UN spokesman - . . , , , . . . . ; . . . . , , . ,

( - , ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Thissa Vitharana - Minister of Science and Technology) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees. The Debate on the extension of the Emergency is continuing and at the outset, I must say on behalf of the LSSP that I am unhappy that the state of Emergency has to continue in our country. But this is a direct result of the fact of the armed conflict that is taking place, especially in the Northern Province and the situations of various attacks on civilian people in different parts of the country.

We, as a party and as a Member of the Government, would like to see this situation end as soon as possible and would like the conflict to be stopped and a peaceful resolution of the national question achieved as soon as possible. Unfortunately, the situation of conflict continues and the actions and the reactions of the LTTE and the Government Forces have been continuing with escalating violence in the Northern Province and this situation will therefore result in the need to continue the state of Emergency. I, on behalf of our party, would like to express our deepest sympathies to the families of those who have lost their members and to those who have been injured, displaced and otherwise affected during this period as a result of the conflict. The fact that these events are an accompaniment of a situation of military conflict has to be noted. We have in Sri Lanka, not only a situation of conventional warfare but also of terrorist activities. It is in this context that these events are taking place. The other factor which I have always been bringing up in this House is that there are various forces that benefit from the conflict who would like to prolong the conflict and maintain the antagonisms that generate the conflict. This, I refer to as the "Third Force". This "Third Force" has been operating to varying extents and we can see how the two combatant forces have been drawn into this conflict situation and have helped ferment it. To give an example, we have the recent white van incident where those who have been involved in harassing people using white vans have been identified and action is being taken. These are people who do not belong to either category of direct combatants. This is again supportive of the fact that there are various forces, both national and international, who would like our conflict to continue and who seek to get advantage out of this. We have to remember that the sea around Sri Lanka has natural gas

and also petroleum resources according to all the indications that have been scientifically established up to now. There is a good chance that there will be valuable deposits in our seas which can be exploited. There is, as we know, a situation of scarcity of petroleum and natural gas in the world in the context of an increasing demand which has led to increasing prices of fuel. We have the example of Iraq where certain powerful countries have invaded that country on the pretext of there being weapons of mass destruction but the real intention has now become evident to the entire world, what they sought was the oil resources of that country. So we have to be very careful. We have to make sure that we do not allow those same forces to come and capitalize on the situation that is prevailing in our country. These are forces, imperialist forces, who have always ruled the world on the principle of divide and rule. They have divided people and used the divisions, the conflicts that have arisen, to their advantage. So we must not give them a handle. Various issues such as human rights issues are highlighted. Anyone knows that in a situation of war, as I said before, here it is not only a situation of conventional warfare but also a terrorist warfare, that human rights are violated. This is not to justify violation of human rights, but that is an aspect of war that is inevitable. I strongly advocate that everything should be done to minimize the violation of human rights. The Government must act strongly in an effort to see that those who violate the human rights are brought to book. But, at the same time, to imagine that these violations of human rights can be stopped in a situation of war and conflict, I think is wishful thinking. If you look at countries that are in a situation of perfect peace without any conflict, there also violations of human rights that take place. These are not only poor developing countries, but also developed countries. In my own opinion, the very fact that there are large numbers of people languishing in poverty who go hungry, some of them without proper dwellings, without proper clothes, are violations of human rights. So, these are differences of degree and we must not allow international conspiratorial forces to get a handle on the basis of violation of human rights and interfere in what is going on in our country. We have to make sure that these are minimized so that we do not provide an excuse for these forces, who are predatory forces, who would like to capitalize on the situation of conflict and the misery that is here and exploit it to their advantage. We are all aware that the basis of this conflict is a political problem. The political problem relates to the national question and it is to this extent that the Tamil-speaking people, which includes the Muslims, believe that they are at a disadvantage, and must be given a political solution which they find acceptable. In trying to achieve this, the All Party Conference which was chaired by the President has set up the All Party Representative Committee which I happen to chair. We have been meeting for two years. During this period we have had 78 meetings and these meetings are focused on trying to

2008 06 2791 2792

achieve a lasting solution to the national question, a solution which the Sinhala people, the Tamil people, the Muslim people and other sections of our community will find acceptable. I am happy to say that 90 per cent of the substance of various issues which have been considered, consensus has been reached and there is a general agreement on those matters. The remaining 10 per cent have to be discussed. There was a delay in going into this matter in the last two or three months because two political parties who are participating in the APRC insisted that they would continue to participate only once the TMVP is brought into the process. I am happy to say that now the TMVP has come into the process and at the last meeting which was held immediately before the SAARC Summit, there was participation of the representative of the TMVP. At that meeting they reiterated that the document which had been submitted by the TMVP and circulated among the Members was still acceptable to them and that should be taken as the basis for the stand of the TMVP in the course of our discussions. I am happy to say that the Jathika Hela Urumaya who kept out till such time has now informed us in writing that they are going to participate at the next meeting. The MEP presumably will also follow suit though we have not had any official communication from them, and it is my hope that they will participate so that the process can then gather momentum and go ahead in the way that it should. In this connection, I would like to say that questions have been raised about the participation of parties which are now outside the APRC process. I would also state here that the United National Party though officially is a direct participant, it is only prepared to come in once the other parties that are in the process reach a consensus. They have already indicated that and we are now in the process of having a dialogue with the Hon. K.N. Choksy, the representative of the United National Party on the 90 per cent area of substantial agreement that has been reached. Therefore, it is my hope that once we reach a complete consensus the UNP will come into the process. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , . ( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Thissa Vitharana) . Now, in this discussion which we should draw the other parties in, we would like to extend an invitation to the JVP and the TNA as well. The Tamil National Alliance, though we made an offer earlier to its leader, it was not accepted and I hope that down the line they will also realize the importance of reaching a political consensus and participate in this process, because we have

to among ourselves work out a solution which is acceptable to a larger section of our population as possible covering all sections and this should be the basis of working out a solution to our own problem. So, let us all get together, look at this whole thing in a positive manner without being negative and try to take it forward and make sure that we satisfy the aspirations of the Tamil-speaking people and of the Sinhala people of this country as well to work out a lasting solution that will lead to an end of the conflict, the end of the war and lasting peace where the state of Emergency is not enforced.
