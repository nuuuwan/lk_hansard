( . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W. A. Wiswa Warnapala - Minister of Higher Education) Madam Presiding Member, before I propose to discuss certain developments within the sphere of Higher Education, I would like to refer to the importance of the knowledge economy. The development of a knowledge economy has become the important goal of both developed and developing countries in the world. Therefore, the establishment of educational institutions of global excellence has assumed importance in all the developing countries, including Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka needs universities of excellence in order to accelerate the process of economic and social development in the country. The Ministry of Higher Education in the last two years has taken several steps to introduce a new development-oriented higher education policy with which we proposed to accelerate the social and economic development of this country. We have undertaken a series of reforms and we proposed to bring about changes with a view to converting our universities into global centers of learning. Fundamental reforms are therefore necessary to achieve this objective. We want to convert all our universities into centers of learning, into centers of excellence. In the last one year, the Ministry has taken steps to enhance the quality of teaching and research in order to convert the universities into centers of learning.

In all developing counties, the need to establish global universities with a global focus has become the central theme of reforms in higher education. Reforms are necessary as creation of knowledge has become the fundamental objective of higher education. Knowledge is important today. Knowledge has become capital today. Therefore, we need to create knowledge; we need to generate knowledge and we need to disseminate knowledge. All that could be done through centres of learning, through centres of excellence in the sphere of higher education. With these remarks on the need for effective and realistic reforms in the sphere of higher education, I would like to refer to what we have done in the last one year to improve the system of higher education. First, I would like to devote my attention to the question of funding. The previous speakers have said that the funding is not enough to improve both the education and the higher education sectors. In 2008, the Government allocated Rs. 21,000 million to the Ministry of Higher Education. There are 17 universities which come under the purview of the Ministry of Higher Education. When you take all the postgraduate institutes into consideration, 53 higher educational institutions come within the purview of the Ministry of Higher Education. Out of the allocation made, Rs. 15,868 million was for the University Grants Commission, which is the apex orgnization in the higher education sector. Rupees 384 million has been allocated for the two Buddhist universities. We have two Buddhist universities exclusively for the members of the Buddhist Sanga. Rupees 435 million has been allocated for the Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technological Education - SLIATE. In the Budget Estimates for 2009, Rs. 21,117.5 million has been allocated for Higher Education, out of which Rs. 4,905 million is expected as foreign funds. The allocation for 2009 has now been increased to Rs. 22,167.5 million. Madam Presiding Member, now I seek the indulgence of this House to read a little bit of information in Sinhala. I want it to go into the Hansard. 171 - 214 - 2009 11,634.64, 9,483.05 21,117.5 . , , , , , , 950, 100 , 1,050 .

214 - 4,100 , 5,150 . 171 - 5,841.5 . 16,326. 22,167.5 . Madam Presiding Member, the total allocation for the Ministry of Higher Education is Rs. 21,117.5 million. New universities have been allocated an additional Rs. 950 million. Another Rs. 100 million has been allocated to both the Kelaniya University and the Sri Jayawardenepura University. What has been allocated under the University Grants Commission is Rs. 5,150 million. The total allocation for the Ministry of Higher Education is Rs. 22,167.5 million. I want to inform this House that this amount has been allocated for the development of higher education in this country. Now I would like to refer to the two Buddhist Universities. We have created two Buddhist universities exclusively for the members of the Snaga. The Buddha Sravaka Bhikku University at Anuradhapura is to be developed as a centre of excellence in the area of Bhddhist studies. Now we are trying to relocate the University in a different place called Manamunawaththa and 11 acres have been acquired for the purpose, Rupees 1,300 million has been allocated for the development of the Buddha Sravaka Bhikku University at Anuradhapura which is exclusively for the members of the Buddhist Sanga and we have allocated money for the construction of an administrative building, a hostel building and the other buildings are to be renovated with the money which has been allocated for this year. Then, the next is the Buddhist and Pali University. It is another Univetsity which has been built exclusively for the members of the Sanga. There are undergraduate and postgraduate courses conducted by this University and the faculties are to be developed in 2008. The registered number of students have increased from 1512 to 170. Even at this university, a building programme has been started and a library complex is to be built, lecture halls are to be built, the main administrative building is to be build. In this way, we are planning to expand this University. The University Grants Commission is the apex organization within the higher education system. For the University Grants Commission, Rs. 14.000 million was allocated in 2007 and now it has been increased by 7.41 per cent in 2008 and Rs. 15.000 million has been already allocated for the University Grants Commission. The University Grants Commission has taken steps to synchronize the academic calendar of the universities. This in my view, is a major achievement because in the past we have been fairly unsuccessful in maintaining the university

calendar. The University Grants Commission decided to fix common days for the commencement and the termination of the academic programme of the universities with effect from 2009. Accordingly, the new students who enter the universities would be admitted to the university or to the higher educational institutions in the last week of May each year. Establishment of the South Asian University as a centre of excellence by pooling the resources available within the SAARC member states is in progress. The South Asian University, that is the SAARC University, is to be built for the SAARC region and Sri Lanka is going to get one or two faculties. Still it has not been identified as to which faculty we are going to get. The University will be set up in close proximity to New Delhi in India. The Chairman and the Vice-Chairman of the University Grants Commission serve as members of the Steering Committee which has been set up for planning and establishment of the SAARC University in Delhi. The Dean of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Peradeniya, a Member of the Commission, has been appointed as a Consultant and Advisor, on infrastructure development of the SAARC University in Delhi. This is a university which is to be built for the entire SAARC region. In 2008, the University Grants Commission approved the establishment of seven new departments, namely, Political Science in Jayawardenepura, Management and Finance in Ruhuna, Medicine in Kelaniya, Archaeology and Heritage Management in Rajarata nad Public and Internal Law, Private and comparative Law and Commercial Law in Colombo. Eight new undergraduate degree programmes, BSc (Special) in Biology and BSc (Special) in Statistics at Peradeniya, BA in Archaeology and Heritage Management and BA in History in Rajarata. BA in Business Administration (Accounting Special) (Financial Management Special), (Human Resource Development Special) and (Marketing Special) in Jaffna were introduced. Four postgraduate degree programmes, MBA in E-governance, MA in Political Science, MAs in Bio Diversity and MSc in Agribusiness Management have been introduced in the Universities of Moratuwa, Colombo, Peredeniya and Ruhuna respectively, Ten new degree programmes have been stated in 2008 thereby increasing the intake by 495 students. These are the new degree programmes : Tea Technology and Value Addition, Industrial Information Technology, Mineral Resources Technology, Operations and Technology Management (Special), Business Information System (Special), Information Technology and Management Studies, Computing and Information Systems, Physical Education, Sports Sciences and Management and Speech and Language Therapy. These are employment-orientation programmes; the concept which guided the introduction of these new programmes was employability. We need to look at from the point view of employability so that we can produce a graduate who can market his knowledge and get a job in the labour market. Out of the funds available for the year 2008, UGC has allowed Rs. 54.3 million for continuation of projects for the

2008 21 933 934

development of Information Technology. Another Rs. 131.7 million has been allocated for new projects. The amount allocated among universities and higher education institutes for IT development, which is very essential, in the year 2007 was Rs. 150 million and, in 2008, it has been increased by 24 per cent. Due to the unavailability of lands for expansion of the two faculties of the Trincomalee Campus of the Eastern University of Sri Lanka, University Grants Commission decided to shift the Campus to a location at Trincomalee on the Nilaweli Road. The new complex consists of hostels for students, space for academic activities, a laboratory, a herbal garden and a parapet wall to prevent elephant encroaching. The total cost estimate for that project is Rs. 240 million. The whole project is to be completed within three years, which means that we will be able to have a fully-fledged campus in Trincomalee. The UGC managed to get approval from the Department of Management Services to create 1,246 new cadre positions for the year 2008. It has been raised in Parliament on several occasions that adequate staff have not been provided to universities. Therefore, we have creaed 1,246 cadre positions for the year 2008; 695 positions for the academic and academic support staff grades and 496 positions for the non-academic and non-administrative grades. Our policy is to develop the staff resources within the universities and we are getting assistance from different organizations; we are getting assistance from the World Bank, we are getting assistance from the Asian Development Bank for the purpose of improving the staff resources in our universities and the UGC has taken the correct step by increasing the cadre. In 2008, the UGC provided 52 scholarships for academic staff in foreign countries. Foreign training has been provided for 15 members of the administrative and non-academic staff because the University Grants Commission staff too need to be given an opportunity to go abroad and acquire new knowledge as the academic staff. In addition to that we have entered into bilateral agreements with different countries to obtain scholarships. I don not want to waste time of this House by reading all that but we have taken steps to obtain scholarships from different countries and a number of countries have agreed to provide the opportunities for both post-graduate and undergraduate scholarships. Expenditure in 2009 for infrastructure development has been estimated at Rs. 6,081.74 million. So far, in 2008, Rs. 3,577.87 million has been spent out of the total allocation of Rs. 5,752.12 million for infrastructure development, which includes construction and rehabilitation of buildings. During the year foundation stone was laid for the Medical Faculty in the Rajarata University. We have taken steps to provide all universities with new buildings. Primarily, in the area of accommodation, we have taken steps to provide the Universities with new hostel buildings. For the education of this House, I would

like to read some of the details. I will just give the figure. - [Interruption.] Please do not disturb me, my good Friend. I will not give way because I have only a little bit of time. I am not giving way. With regard to the University of Peradeniya, Rs. 441.99 million has been allocated for buildings; for the University of Moratuwa, Rs. 721 million has been allocated; for the University of Ruhuna, Rs. 116 million has been allocated; for the Open University of Sri Lanka, Rs. 30 million has been allocated; for the Eastern University of Sri Lanka, Rs. 61.2 million has been allocated; for the Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka, Rs. 239.70 million has been allocated. Cabinet approval has been given for construction of administrative buildings as well as hostel buildings. Then, for the South-Eastern University of Sri Lanka, Rs. 137 million has been allocated; in addition to this, from the Kuwaiti Fund they are getting a large slice to build a university complex in that particular place. The Wayamba University has been allocated Rs. 71 million; for the University of the Visual and Performing Arts, Rs. 140 million has been allocated. ( ) (The Presiding Member) . . , [ ] .

In 2008, SLIATE successfully negotiated with the University of South Australia to gain accreditations for some academic programmes while creating a ladder for the SLIATE diplomats to enter the Bachelors Degree Programmes. A project proposal was forwarded to improve 12 ATII with the assistance of the World Bank-funded IRQUE project which was approved by the World Bank. The World Bank assistance is coming and we propose to develop the infrastructure of the SLIATE with the assistance of the World Bank funding. Networking of the computer laboratories of all 12 ATII to upgrade the quality of the IT programmes is an ongoing project and we expect to complete it soon. With regard to the infrastructure development of the SLIATE, now I would like to mention it here as the members from Jaffna are here - a new academic and administration building was opened at the Jaffna Advanced Technological Institute. We spent Rs. 183 million for the development of the ATI in Jaffna. We completed the construction work at ATI in Trincomalee and we spent Rs.105 million on it. We completed the construction work in the academic building at Hardy ATI Ampara and we have spent Rs.203 million on it. Then, we completed the construction work at ATI Kegalle spending Rs.25 Million. A new ATI will be established in Anuradhapura and Batticaloa next year and we have allocated Rs.50 million already on that. We propose to build two institutes in those two respective areas.

Then, under the Asian Development Bank project, six new courses will be developed in the next year and they are as follows: Food Technology, Software Engineering, Construction Management, Telecommunication, Aquaculture and Horticulture. Two language cum IT laboratories for each ATII are also to be built. We are also going to establish Management Information system for the SLIATE and capacity development programme for academic and non-academic staff. Then, under the Would Bank project, Rs.60 Million has been allocated for the development of the SLIATE in many ways. That is, revision of existing curricula mainly focusing on industrial requirement. Then, to develop an evaluation system for Higher National Diploma programmes and to introduce student centered teaching methodology. Then, we have negotiated another agreement with the Austrian Government and the Netherlands Government which is called the Austria-Netherlands Project under which we are going to get Euro 21.9 million to develop the infrastructure of the technical college throughout the country. Eighteen technical college come under the purview of the Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technological Education and this fund is to be utilized for the revision of the existing curricula mainly focusing on industry and industrial development, to develop an evaluation system and then the balance is to be Spent in order to convert Labuduwa Technical College in Galle as a centre of excellence which was built during the period 1994 to 2000 when I was the Deputy Minister of Higher Education. I can remember we took lot of pain to develop this particular technical college at Labuduwa. It has been built but now we propose to convert it to a centre of excellence with the funding available. Mattakkuliya is the other centre which needs to be developed into a centre of excellence in technological studies. Thereafter, we propose to elevate the status of these two institutions so that as time goes on, we might be able to create a separate technological university in one of these places either at Labuduwa or at Mattakkuliya. The benefits which we are to derive from this programme are, to introduce a new curriculum for HNDE programme. HNDE students have been clamouring that they also should be brought under the purview of the university, to which we are opposed. We do not want to allow that. We want the technical colleges to remain in that form. Middle-level technical know-how needs to be produced. We cannot convert all technical colleges into universities. That is not the trend in the world. For instance, in Singapore the person who gets himself selected to a university would prefer to go to a technical college because the middle-level technical qualification is useful to get a job. Then, with regard to the upgrading laboratory and workshop facilities at Mattakkuliya, there is going to be an introduction of the HNDE course for Labuduwa. Then, a four-storey academic building is to be built at Mattakkuliya. A capacity-building programme for

academic and technical staff, and the provision of new laboratory and workshop equipment for Mattakkuliya and Labuduwa. These are the things which we propose to achieve for the SLIATE. With the assistance of the World Bank, we launched a programme to improve the quality of undergraduate education in this country. You know, Mr. Deputy Chairman, all Sri Lankan universities are undergraduate institutions. The post-graduate sector has been neglected in the past. From the point of view of our new development-oriented higher education policy, we propose to develop the post-graduate sector as well. It is only through the development of the post-graduate sector that a new learning culture could be created within the universities. When we have a very effective post-graduate sector, that will have an impact on the learning culture of the undergraduates in the universities.

. . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W. A. Wiswa Warnapala) Under this programme of improving relevance and quality of undergraduate education, I mean there are number of programmes which we have undertaken. I do not have the time to do describe them but I will just read it : Quality enhancement fund, quality assurance activities, higher education management information system. Now these are measures through which the quality of undergraduate education could be enhanced because there is a visible decline in undergraduate education in the country. Therefore, we need to improve the quality of undergraduates education in the country and the World Bank has provided us with assistance to improve the quality of undergraduates in this country. Then, with regard to the Distance Education Modernization Project for which the Asian Development Bank has given us assistance, we are trying to improve

[ . . ]

access to more higher educational opportunities through the development of the Distance Education Modernization Project. Because the distance mode needs to be utilized to provide more access to a large number of students who aspire to get into the system, but cannot get into the system because, Sir, we take only 20,000 students per year. Therefore, we are trying to make use of the Open University which has done an excellent job in the past several years. We will make use of the Open University, the concept of open learning, and the distance mode to improve the access and we propose to upgrade the Open University of Sri Lanka. Mr. Deputy Chairman, please give me one more minute to refer to the Tsunami Rehabilitation Project under which Kuwait has given us several millions of rupees to develop the South Eastern University. A number of construction works have been supported by us such as the construction of two hostel buildings for medical students of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Ruhuna under the Tsunami Rehabilitation Project, for which we got assistance from Kuwait. Again, approximately Rs. 869 million is to be allocated under the Kuwait Fund for the development project of the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka. We need to thank the Kuwaiti Government for assisting us with such a large amount to develop the South Eastern University as another centre of excellence in the sphere of higher education. Thank You, Mr. Deputy Chairman. [.. 12.25] . ( . ) (The Hon. K. Thurairetnasingam) , . , , , , , . 2009 177 , 27 , 6.5 . . , , . . , , , . , , . , . - . , ,

( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Shafeek Rajabdeen) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. I thank you Mr. Presiding Member, for giving me the opportunity to speak a few words during the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Higher Education. Sri Lankas population is highly educated with a literacy rate of 92 per cent, higher than what is expected

of a Third World country. It is one of the countries in South Asia which has the highest literacy rate. This is mainly attributed to the educational reforms introduced in 1938 following the granting of universal franchise in 1931. The late Hon. (Dr.) C. W. W. Kannangara, the father of Free education, as the then Minister of Education, took the initiative to establish Madya Maha Vidyalayas or Central Colleges all over the island providing free education for all Sri Lankan students. At the turn of the 20th Century, the supreme need was education-not merely elementary education or half-hearted education, but education that would turn common men to heroes, leaders, reformers, thinkers, and philosophers; education that would make people progressive, powerful and enlightened with knowledge. A large number of Muslim children, who were denied the priceless blessings of education, have to blame themselves for their awkward position as compared to the other communities in our country. The Muslims in Sri Lanka were a backward community and between 1921 and 1946 with the establishment of universities and schools, our community took up to education and thereby a handful of them achieved their targets to become public servants and learned professionals. With the turn of the 21st Century, thanks to our visionary leader, the late Hon. (Dr.) T. B. Jayah, the first Muslim to hold a portfolio in the first Cabinet of independent Sri Lanka, our community was able to produce Parliamentarians, Municipal Councilors, public servants in high posts, in education sector, officers in the armed forces, lawyers, doctors, engineers, businessmen and directors, By holding important positions in all important fields, our community proved the fact that they can survive in any multilingual, multiracial and multiethnic nation like ours. In the struggle for political freedom-freedom not only for one community but for all communities-we, the minorities, have always contributed our fair share. Our paramount importance was national interest than communal interest. Sir, we stand up our community. But, it cannot be said that we are against the interest of our country. We consider the terror unleashed on our nation as a curse and we are doomed. We stand up as Sri Lankans against all divisional norms in the interest of the country. The paramount obligation of ours is to establish unity amongst all communities in our country with freedom to all communities and work towards a common goal. Misunderstanding is not the result of education. The language barriers created, lack of trust, lack of confidence and misconception have taken many shapes denying us achieving satisfactory measures of freedom. In this regard, let me remind you what Chief Seattle, the chieftain of the Red Indians said when President Franklin Pierce of the USA sent word to him asking whether he could buy the lands belong to the Red Indians for occupation of the White. He said : We love this earth as

979 980

a new-born loves its mothers heartbeat. Every part of earth is sacred to my people. Every shining pine needle, every sandy shore, every mist in the dark woods, every meadow, every humming insect, all are holy in the memory and experience of my people. As we are part of the land, you too are a part of this land. This earth is too precious to us as it is precious to you. The earth does not belong to man; man belongs to the earth. Hon. Presiding Member, as a Member of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress who represents the the Colombo District, I wish to bring to your notice some of the shortcomings in our education system, particularly the problems faced by the Muslim community. Education is divided into three parts; primary; junior secondary and senior secondary. When the students are in grade five, they sit for the scholarship exam which allows students with exceptional skills to enter better schools. But, as far as the Muslims are concerned, our problems remain at the first stage. Though there are 23 Muslim schools for boys and girls under the provincial system of Government in the Western Province including two large National Schools, parents of our community are sent from pillar to post when it comes to grade one admission. The population in the City of Colombo is increasing day by day. Though there are a lot of private schools and international schools in the city, our children who come from the poorest of poor, who live in the garden tenements in the backyards of the City of Colombo, especially the children of shanty-dwellers in Mattakkuliya, Slave Island, Grandpass, Dematagoda, Maligawatta, Aluthkade, Wanathamulla, and Madampitiya are unable to attend to these schools. They live below poverty line, their parents earn less than Rs. 1,500 a month. Such is the plight of these children. Half of their parents are sick and tired in seeking admission to grade one in schools; they surround our houses for our intervention. So, Hon. Minister, I would urge that proper schools be established for the poorest of the poor. The need for establishment of Muslim schools in the Kolonnawa area is greater. Approximately, 20,000 to 30,000 Muslims have migrated to Kolonnawa. There is not a single Muslim school there and as the other schools in this area are fully saturated, all these Muslim children have to go from school to school in the city seeking admission. Therefore, Hon. Minister, we strongly urge the establishment of two Muslim schools in the Kolonnawa area, one for girls and one for boys. The Muslim children in that area are being refused admission because their medium of education is Tamil. We, the Muslims, our children would like to learn the Tamil language and would like to be students in the Sinhala schools as well. Therefore, I urge the Governement to set up two Muslim schools in the Kolonnawa area, one for boys and one for girls. There is an abundance of State lands which can be used to establish schools for Tamil and Muslim children. There is no rule that Muslim and

Tamil children must be educated in the Tamil Medium. The Muslims and the Tamil children of the present generation are also interested in the Sinhala medium. Toady, we are faced with a major problem in the provincial schools where the Muslim girls have been asked by the principals of some schools not to wear the traditional Punjabi costume. I wish to invite your attention to Circular No. 73/1995 dated 12th December, 1995 of the Ministry of Education and Higher Education which states that Muslims girls, not only in Muslims schools but also in Buddhist, Hindu or Christian schools, should be allowed to attire in the traditional Punjabi costume. We wish to strongly address this issue as this is an Islamic rite and our girls are permitted their attire by a circular of the Education Ministry. I am sorry, there is not a single. Minister in charge of Education here to listen to my speech. . . ( . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W. A. Wiswa Warnapala) I am here. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Shafeek Rajabdeen) Muslim students in national universities and Muslim employees in Government offices are also permitted to wear their traditional dress - even the Hon. (Mrs.) Anjan Umma is permitted to wear the Abaya in Parliament. So why not our Muslim girls in schools? This is our inherent right. We are thankful to the JVP for speaking about the necessity of giving additional yards of uniform materials to the Muslim students in this country. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, Please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Shafeek Rajabdeen) Therefore, Hon. Minister, I strongly urge that principals be instructed to follow the circular issued in this regard. The fundamental rights of our people should not be violated. Muslims have an inherent right to live in accordance with the Islamic way of life and to attire themselves according to Islamic norms. We do not want other fractional parties - the JHU is telling us how we should dress. Who are they? Do we tell them how to dress? Therefore, Please tell them to mind their own business because our dress is our business.

. . ( . . ) (The Hon. A. D. Susil Premajayantha) Hon. Member, may I interrupt you for a second?

( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Shafeek Rajabdeen) Yes. . . ( . . ) (The Hon. A. D. Susil Premajayantha) The Ministry of Education provides 200,000 meters of extra material for the uniforms of the Muslim girls. Even this year we provided. ( ) (The Hon.

( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Shafeek Rajabdeen) I have been given an additional five minutes. You have provided additional material but your principals insist that our girls should not to wear the Punjabi costume. You should make - . . ( . . ) (The Hon. A. D. Susil Premajayantha) If we are informed - of course we have intervened and settled that matter. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Shafeek Rajabdeen) You see, because of certain acts of some principals who come from outstations to schools in the City of Colombo, there is a misunderstanding. They do not allow our girls to wear the Punjabi costume which they are used to. . . ( . . ) (The Hon. A. D. Susil Premajayantha) Of course, we have given clear instructions to allow Muslim girls to exercise their rights. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Shafeek Rajabdeen) I can give you some examples. The Principals of schools like Lindsay Balika Vidyalaya, Sir Baron Jayathilake Maha Vidyalaya and some schools near Yashodara Balika Vidyalaya have asked our girls not to wear the Punjabi costume. You should give strict instructions to these principals and not allow them to do so because when our children are hurt over this, they cannot live unitedly in this country. We are part of the

people of this country. So, we have every right. I do not think anybody should interfere with our norms and attitudes. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Your time is over. Please wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Shafeek Rajabdeen) Please give me one more minute, Sir. I would say that the appointment of Muslim Directors of Education to predominant Muslim areas is of importance. The misunderstandings of Islamic values can only be interpreted through a Muslim Director of Education looking into the shortcomings of teachers; one additional officer will be advantageous and useful. A Tamil Director is placed in charge of the Muslim and Hindu schools. Our community is different; our values are different and our religious rites are different. The Tamil - Hindu Directors can look after Hindu schools but Muslim Directors and planners for predominant Muslim areas are important and it will make a difference. Finally, I wish to say, let us thread along the path of our forefathers, along the glorious ruins of the past, remember the creators of history and valiant builders of our nation, venerate our ancestors, great, true sons of Mother Lanka and engrave their names in gold and preserve our heritage old. Thank you very much.

( ) (The Chairman) . [. . 4.18] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha - Deputy Minister of Tourism) Hon. Chairman, I thank you for giving me this opportunity to make my presentation at the Committee Stage discussion. Firstly, the population of Muslims in this country as an ethnic group is 8 per cent and when you take into consideration the education of the Muslim community, only 1.5 per cent gain admission to the university. I think the Muslim political leadership continuously is responsible for this downfall. His Excellency the President has appointed a committee to go into the education of Muslims. Under the SLFP Government, the late Dr. Badiuddin Mahmud enabled the Muslims to get teaching appointments. Consequent to that when 3100 teaching appointments were given to the estates, the Muslims also agitated for teaching appointments. His

Excellency the President did justice to both the communities. At this moment, I must also thank the Hon. Susil Premajayantha, the Minister of Education for mediating and giving both communities teaching appointments and doing justice to both communities. There was agitation over this issue. There was also a case pending in the Supreme Court. But His Excellency the President believing the Sri Lankan identity did justice to both communities and also gave 600 teaching appointments to the Muslims thereby solving the shortage of Muslim teachers that was existing for a long period of time. This also enabled the Muslim youths to get teaching appointments. I am also very grateful to His Excellency the President for giving Moulavi appointments in addition, which was a long felt need. There was agitation by the community for Moulavi appointments. I take this opportunity to thank His Excellency the President and the Hon. Minister of Education for giving us these appointments. I would also like to stress that Muslim education - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Ranjith Aluvihare) ? ( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha) Sorry? [Interruption.] Have you got a problem? ( ) (The Chairman) . . ( ) (The Hon. Faizer Musthapha) So, I think all of us have to make an effort to see what the cause for the downfall of Muslim Education is and we have to work towards uplifting Muslim education. I think through the committee appointed by His Excellency the President, we will able to ascertain the reason for the downfall, whether it is the lack of resources or the interest taken by the community towards Muslim education. I thank you again, Sir, for giving me this opportunity. [.. 4.21]

This is an injustice done to those people. After all, they are doing the same job of work. So, this must be considered because they have been doing a very good job of work for more than five, six years. Some principals are working in big schools where there are about 60 - 70 teachers attached to them. So they must be given the due place and it is the responsibility of the Hon. Minister of Education to see that these people are contented at least, after working without any additional remuneration. I understand that

this will not cost much money also because those people are very senior people and they are in the Teachers Service and drawing a very high salary. Therefore, there is no necessity to get additional funds for these people. Secondly, I want to say this to the Hon. Minister of Higher Education who is here. I would like to thank you, Sir, for finding money to put up an Advanced Technological Education Institute in Batticaloa. You know, I used to quarrel with your Director-General on this matter, but there is nothing personal. It is because of my interest and agitation from my people that I have been arguing and you were always kind enough and you always said, I will support you. Do not worry. Finally, you have found the money. In our part, we have got the two acres of land. This was officially handed over by the Land Commissioner and we are going to put up the fence. I am giving Rs. 100,000 from my own DCB allocation and the balance money will be from you, I think. Once again I say thank you. . . ( . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) W.A.

I spoke about the appointment of permanent principals, that is, promoting of existing principals must also be done. They are qualified people. They have served for five, six, seven years. I know one principal and about 80 teachers work under him. These people were selected by a board. I hear, Sir, some people -

( ) (The Chairman) . . . . . 10 . [. . 4.38] . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. M. M. Naoshaad) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Mr. Chairman, I am happy that I have been afforded an opportunity to comment on the Votes of the Ministries of Education and Higher Education. Enough has been said on the sums allocated and it may suffice to say that the pluses and minuses would mean nothing if we are not prepared to confront the reality of the present situation in this country. Unfortunately, I have to rush through my speech for want of time. His Excellency the Present, in his Budget Speech, devoted a few lines in paragraph 18 to the education sector. Sir, I table*, due to lack of time, Chapter 1 of the Report titled Public Investment 2008-2011 published by the Department of National Planning spelling out the plans for the education sector. I do not want to devote too much time to what is said there as some of these are mere political jargon than anything else. We have seen these being repeated on many documents, but very little is being done to realize same. I also table* Chapter 17 of the Annual Report of the AuditorGeneral - 2007, which critically analyses the performance of the Education Ministry for t he year under review. These critical comments should serve as a catalyst to confront reality in the education sector and push the administrators to bring about change in the way we do things. We are fortunate to have gentlemen of the highest caliber, who are approachable, receptive, amenable, able and above all, honest in charge of the subjects. I do not pay these compliments to boost your egos, but to stress on the fact that these qualities in you raised the expectations of the public and ours, of your Representatives. These qualities are essential requirements to provide leadership to achieve what we yearn for in the field of education - change. To bring about a change, we need to confront and accept the realitythe global economic meltdown, which I attribute in part, to the wars being fought in Iraq and

Afghanistan, the local economic gloom caused by the colossal cost of the war and the propaganda that goes with it and the deep ethnic division among us, the Sri Lankans. Continuing from the contribution I made in the recent Adjournment Motion brought up in the House on the problems confronting the education sector, I wish to emphasize the fact that what ails our system today is not primarily the lack of infrastructure, but a more critical element - the lack of quality in the administrative system and pedagogical skills. We have today, many Ministries that are in change of education in various forms. We must accept that these are interconnected and need to be brought under the broad umbrella of human resource management. The greatest asset to any nation is its human resource and it is time that we took a long, hard look at what confronts us realistically and push for meaningful change. Having said this, I must say hat the Hon. Minister of Education has taken several measures in the direction of bringing about change, one of which is to appoint a team of eminent educationists headed by Dr. Bandula Gunawardene ot bring forward and Education Reform Act to this House, after 60 years of free education. If I were to elaborate, the main obstacle to the improvement of our academic performance has been the quality of our teaching staff and the poor supervision of their work together with the structuring of the school system. In fact, my view and the view held by many, is that we should abolish this system of National Schools and provincial schools and revert to primary schools, from grade one to five, junior secondary schools, from grade six to nine and senior secondary schools, from grade 10 to 13, with an emphasis on a healthy student - teacher ratio being maintained in the primary and junior secondary schools in order to build a strong and durable foundation. I table* for inclusion in Hansard a table I worked out based on the information provided in the Budget Estimates relating to the number of schools, teachers and students. As per these figures, we do not seem to have a problem with regard to the number of teachers in the system. We have in National Schools, one teacher for every 20 students, in provincial schools, one teacher for every 18 students and in pirivenas, one teacher for every 10 students. But, we all know that we still have a shortage of specialist teachers for subjects such as Mathematics, English and Science due to the way in which we appoint teachers. The situation is the same in the National Colleges of Education and the Teacher Training Colleges as well. This is why I keep stressing that what is important is not the quantity, but the quality of our teaching fraternity.

With emphasis now shifting to recruiting only graduates to the teaching profession, one must be mindful of the fact that knowledge alone does not make him a good teacher or for that matter, just a teacher. Pedagogical skills are very important to be an effective teacher. There should be an aptitude test for all those who seek to enter the teaching profession or better still, if they are made to follow a minimum one years training at the NCE or the TTC and sit for a qualifying examination to be recruited as teachers. I table* for the inclusion in Hansard a document titled Good Teaching : The Top Ten Requirements by Richard Leblanc of the York University, Ontario, which is enlightening. I also table** an article that appeared in the The Island of 19th November, 2008 titled English Teaching. Why is isnt working? by Rachel Selby, an American volunteer teacher. This makes interesting reading for anyone who wants to effect change in the way we do things. The recruitment and distribution of teachers to meet the needs of the schools have been a perennial problem with negative effects on the quality of education due to political interference in the system. Though there is a national policy on teacher transfers, teachers have stayed rooted in the same schools for over 15 years with no value addition. Transfers of teachers within zones and even within districts are not being effectively done to maximize resources, but to satisfy the whims of politicians like us. In my view, there should not be any distinction between teachers in National Schools and provincial schools. What is required is maximization of resources. We have an added problem today. We have a severe gender imbalance in the teaching cadre. I believe, as at today, more than 70 per cent of the teachers are females. This poses a severe problem, especially in rural areas where the female teachers show a preference to teach in their hometown and that too, in the school that is closest to their homes. There is very little being done with regard to in-service professional education for teachers. They should have a clear established criterion which gives them access to scholarships and ex change programmes that expose them to the changes taking place in the sphere of education in other parts of the world.

Their performances need to be assessed professionally, for which principals too need to play an enhanced role. As my speech has been cut short, I will table* the balance of my speech and just end up with what Maria Montessori had to say. I quote : If education is always to be conceived along the same antiquated lines of a mere transmission of knowledge, there is little to be hoped from it in the bettering of mans future. For what is the use of transmitting knowledge if the individuals total development lags behind.... Thank you.

. . Rest of the speech tabled.. Effective principals are strong educators, anchoring their work on central issues of learning, teaching and continuous school improvement. Principals should be held accountable for the academic achievements of the school and should be rewarded for achievements made. They should be set KPIs or Key Performance Indicators at the beginning of each year and assessed on each of those for increments. I am identifying five performance areas as the critical skills a principal must demonstrate to effectively lead a school to excellence. They are promoting collaborative problem solving and open communication with stakeholders, collecting, analyzing and using data to identify school needs, using data to identify and plan for needed changes in the instructional programme, implementing and moniotoring the school improvement plan and using systems aiming to establish as clear focus on attaining student achievement goals. I must think the Hon. Minister for confirming the appointment of principals, the procedure adopted of course is not what is ideal, but at least we have regularized these. You need to continue this and appoint prinicpals to all schools and especifaly to the backward Muslim schools. School Development Committees need to be formed in every school closely monitored and encouraged to bering in prublic - private partnership in school based management. Principals and Zonal Directors should be held responsible for this. The other weak area is the quality of supervision of schools, and I believe, the most wanting the Tamil medium schools and especially Muslim schools. There is no point in having designated officials adorning desks with titles if they do not do justice to their roles. Pre-schools and international schools that are mushrooming daily need to be closely monitored for the standard of education being imparted by them. If this is not done effectively by dedicated people with a view to improving the system, nothing will come of all the investment being made. Teacher Centers have been established in every education zone, and I believe that Samanthruai and Akuressa are the only exceptions which, I presume, will be realized during the course of next year. I regreat that time does not permit me to make any contribution on higher education, which needs to transform itself to cater to the needs of the modern world rather than turn out hundreds of art stream graduates, who struggle to seek gainful employment.

GOOD TEACHING : THE TOP TEN REQUIREMENTS By Richard Leblanc, York University, Ontario One. Good teaching is as much about passion as it is about reason. Its about not only motivating students to learn, but teaching them how to learn, and doing so in a manner that is relevant, meaningful, and memo-rable. Its about caring for your craft, having a passion for it, and con-veying that passion to everyone, most importantly to your students. Two. Good teaching is about substance and treating students as consum-ers of knowledge. Its about doing your best to keep on top of your field, reading sources, inside and outside of your areas of expertise, and being at the leading edge as often as possible. But knowledge is not confined to scholarly journals. Good teaching is also about bridging the gap be-tween theory and practice. Its about leaving the ivory tower and im-mersing oneself in the field, talking to, consulting with, and assisting practitioners, and liaisoning with their communities. Three. Good teaching is about listening, questioning, being responsive, and remembering that each student and class is different. Its about eliciting responses and developing the oral communication skills of the quiet students. Its about pushing students to excel; at the same time, its about being human, respecting others, and being professional at all times. Four. Good teaching is about not always having a fixed agenda and being rigid, but being flexible, fluid, experimenting, and having the confidence to react and adjust to changing circumstances. Its about getting only 10 percent of what you wanted to do in a class done and still feeling good. Its about deviating from the course syllabus or lecture schedule easily when there is more and better learning elsewhere. Good teaching is about the creative balance between being an authoritarian dictator on the one hand and a pushover on the other. Five. Good teaching is also about style. Should good teaching be enter-taining? You bet! Does this mean that it lacks in substance? Not a chance! Effective teaching is not about being locked with both hands glued to a podium or having your eyes fixated on a slide projector while you drone on. Good teachers work the room and every student in it. They realize that they are the conductors and the class is the orchestra. All students play different instruments and at varying proficiencies. Six. This is very important - good teaching is about humor. Its about being self-deprecating and not taking yourself too seriously. Its often about making innocuous jokes, mostly at your own expense, so that the ice breaks and students learn in a more relaxed atmosphere where you, like them, are human with your own share of faults and shortcomings. Seven. Good teaching is about caring, nurturing, and developing minds and talents. Its about devoting time, often invisible, to every student. Its also about the thankless hours of grading, designing or redesigning courses, and preparing materials to still further enhance instruction.

Eight. Good teaching is supported by strong and visionary leadership, and very tangible institutional support - resources, personnel, and funds. Good teaching is continually reinforced by an overarching vision that transcends the entire organization - from full professors to part-time instructors - and is reflectd in what is said, but more importantly by what is done. Nine. Good teaching is about mentoring between senior and junior fac-ulty, teamwork, and being recognized and promoted by ones peers. Efective teaching should also be rewarded, and poor teaching needs to be fremediated through training and development programmes. Ten. At the end of the day, good teaching is about having fun, experi-encing pleasure and intrinsic rewards... like locking eyes with a student in the back row and seeing the synpses and neurons connecting, thoughts being formed, the person becoming better, and a smile cracking across a face as learning all of a sudden happens. Good teachers practise their craft not for the money or because they have to, but because they truly enjoy it and because they want to. Good teachers couldnt imagine doing anything else.
