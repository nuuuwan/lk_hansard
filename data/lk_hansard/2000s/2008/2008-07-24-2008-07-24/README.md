( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I raise this under Standing Order No. 25. Members of Parliament have uttered untruths before this House. The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva last week mentioned that no Indian security contingent would come to Sri Lanka. But today's "Daily Mirror" has quoted the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella saying that an advance Indian security contingent - out of the whole contingent which would be larger than a normal security contingent - has come to Sri Lanka. So, I am asking this House through you, Hon. Speaker, as to why we permit these Ministers to utter untruths before this House? It was a very relevant question that was raised and an attempt was made to disguise the truth. But today it has been highlighted by none other than the person who normally utters untruths on military issues. Now, is the Minister of Mass Media and Information uttering an untruth or is the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva uttering an untruth? We, the Members of this House would like to know that. Otherwise the answers we get in this House is only a waste of time. We are wasting the taxpayers' money.

: , PETROLEUM RESOURCES AGREEMENT: STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF PETROLEUM AND PETROLEUM RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT

. . . ( )

( . . . - , ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie - Minister of Petroleum and Petroleum Resources Development) Hon. Speaker, I thank you for permitting me to clarify certain matters regarding the first ever Petroleum Resources Agreement which I have signed. It is true that I agreed for a committee comprising of Members of all parties to be appointed to look into the oil exploration matters before awarding the tender. Accordingly, I informed the Leader of the House, Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva to appoint a committee in consultation with all the Party Leaders. He had taken up this matter at the Party Leaders' Meeting and wanted the Party Leaders to name the Members. But up to now this committee has not been appointed although more than four months have lapsed. No party has submitted any name so far except that Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka personally told me that he has been nominated by his party to serve in this committee. I have done my part of the job. If the committee is not appointed, I should not be blamed. The country cannot wait for months and months postponing this much needed development activity of the country merely because there is no committee appointed by the Parliament. I am also equally interested, like the Members of the Opposition, to bring in the best possible revenue to the country. Tenders were called having given enough publicity, having launched road shows in Houston, London and Kuala Lumpur. Information was widely published in the electronic media for petroleum exploration in the Mannar Basin for three blocks. All the legally established committees - Petroleum Resources Development Committee (PRDC), Petroleum Resources Development Secretariat (PRDS), National

Economic Council (NEC) - studied the matters carefully at length and with the approval of the Cabinet, the tender was awarded to Cairn Lanka (Pvt) Limited. Only one block was given and the balance two blocks were not given as their offers did not bring much benefit to the country. The most important Petroleum Resources Agreement was prepared in consultation with the Attorney-General and with the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers. The agreement was drafted in the best interest of the country. The draft agreement was thoroughly scrutinized by the Attorney-General and amended. There has been transparency to its maximum which has also been proved by the Supreme Court of the country dismissing a fundamental rights petition filed by a citizen of the country. There is an Act promulgated to carry out the tasks related to petroleum exploration in Sri Lanka. The Ministry, PRDC and the PRDS discharged the functions assigned to the Ministry and the institutions within its purview as per the provisions of this Act. According to this Act all matters related to petroleum exploration of the country has been discharged within a legal framework. We have worked with a high degree of transparency and openness in reporting all work related to petroleum exploration to the Parliament. We have on many occasions given information to Parliamentary Consultative Committee. The PRDC is the legally mandated body incorporated under the Petroleum Resources Act, No. 26 of 2003, and all matters so far completed have been carried out with the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers. My Ministry has submitted very descriptive Cabinet Papers with all the facts on the issues under reference. Moreover, when clarifications are sought by the media of this country I have made available all important information. My Ministry has discharged its responsibilities with maximum transparency, integrity and accountability. His Excellency the President by Gazette Notification published in November 2005, has entrusted this Ministry a specific job and functions. For example, upstream and downstream petroleum industry development. We are committed to discharge these functions expeditiously and correctly without any delay. There is the National Economic Council chaired by His Excellency the President to which a number of intellectuals contribute their inputs. I am thankful to the Hon. Tissa Vitharana and Hon. Champika Ranawaka for giving me some names of competent intellectuals for appointment to the Technical Evaluation Committee. In order to evaluate the tenders and make recommendations to the Government, a Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) and a Negotiating Committee (CANC) were appointed with the approval of the Cabinet. The Technical Evaluation Committee

2097 2098

compromised of officers who are experts in the relevant fields. The Chairman of the Technical Evaluation Committee was Professor Ananda Gunathilake. The other members of the Committee were Professor D.A. Tantrigoda, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Mr. M.A.R. Kularatne, Chairman, Marine Pollution Prevention Authority, Mr. K.D. Ranasinghe, Central Bank, Dr. Vijitha Pandithasekeratne, University of Moratuwa and Mr. D. Abeysuriya, Treasury. The matter of petroleum exploration in the Mannar Basin has been discussed at length at this high -powered forum. In addition, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has also done a study about this important development activity of the Ministry and submitted their views and observations to His Excellency the President. The Ministry of Finance has also contributed tremendously in implementing decisions made on petroleum exploration in the country. My Ministry is accountable to Parliament and to the Auditor-General for all financial and administrative matters. We have also submitted almost all important documents related to petroleum exploration to the Attorney-General and obtained his concurrence and approval. We have discharged all our duties and responsibilities according to the law governing the subject of upstream petroleum sector activities. I submitted a Cabinet Paper after the bids were received. Since the decision-making power is vested with the Cabinet of Ministers they have taken a decision to award the contract to the successful bidder, Cairn Lanka (Pvt) Limited. The Cabinet has considered the national interest of the country in making this decision. I have already circulated copies of the agreement for the perusal of all Hon. Members of Parliament, thus you will see there is complete transparency from A to Z and that we have nothing to hide. Thank you.

During your period you were trying to control it. But you had other factors obstructing it; you had political pressure. Therefore, even during your period the rate of inflation was between 15 to 18 per cent. But now it is 33 per cent. The Governor of the Central Bank is trying to give a reinterpretation to this as "core inflation". Where on earth do you get this? Even in America you do not interpret it as "core inflation". They use the term core inflation only in terms of money supply. This official is using the term core inflation to show that you have economic policies. On that particular score, what are you basically doing? The rate of inflation being at 33 per cent means that you are in a hyperinflation period. It has been going up for the last 16 months.

Ranil Wickremasinghe and our party is ready to support you in regard to the Labour GSP unconditionally. Of course, do what they say. That is the most important thing. The Hon. (Prof.) G. L.

I know you have been asked to take up that issue but you have said, This is not my subject. We are telling you that we are ready to support you unconditionally.

The former Minister of Finance, is it consciously possible for you all to say that you are reducing prices? Look at the fuel prices. When I said that Rs.78 was going to be increased from the actual cost to selling price, they rebuked. The ITN and the Rupavahini went to town. The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie has stated in Parliament that they make a Rs.19 throughput charge from the profit of petroleum. They say that Rs.59 is the tax for that. Rs.59 plus Rs.19 is Rs.78. So, what on earth is this?

It w as about a comparative ranking on countries on their likelihood of becoming failed states. At the end of a critical assessment of their methodology, I concluded that Notwithstanding these methodological problems, the index does provide a good basis for debate and discussion on the condition of the Sri Lankan state. Then last year, I re-examined the 2007: I said that the good news is that Sri Lanka is holding its place at 25 in the new survey that includes 177 countries (up from 146 in 2006).

2133 2134

In this ranking, a high score is bad. This is a top 20 you do not want to belong to. But Sri Lanka has just joined the top 20 of failed states, sliding 5 places down in the 2008 survey that covers 177 countries again. 7/19/2008 Road to Top Twenty 2006 2007 2008 2006-08 rank rank rank change Afghanistan 10 8 7 -3 Bangladesh 19 16 12 -7 Bhutan 39 47 51 12 India 93 110 98 5 Maldives Not 66 67 1 Nepal 20 21 23 3 Pakistan 9 12 9 0 Sri Lanka 25 25 20 -5 Source : Fundforpeace.org The SAARC region as whole (with the notable exceptions of India and the Maldives) does pretty badly, with Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka declining in position, vis--vis 2007. Nepal, which was a member of the top 20 (with Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan) in 2006, has now climbed to 23. Last year, I bemoaned that Rwanda and Liberia were seen as less likely to end up as failed states than Sri Lanka. Rwanda (exemplar of genocide) now ranks 42nd and Liberia (once a synonym for failed state) 34th. These countries are improving ; Sri Lanka is going downhill. Comparison of the component scores for Sri Lanka and Liberia, the land of Charles Taylor, is educative in terms of what it takes to improve / worsen : Liberia Liberia Sri Lanka Sri Lanka 2007 2008 2007 2008 1-1.

Sri Lanka, on the other hand, is seen as reaching the top score in group paranoia at an astounding 9.8/10. Criminalization of the state, exemplified by the brazen attacks on journalists, has risen to 9.2/10. The scores on widespread violation of human rights (8/10) and the security apparatus operating as a state within the state (9.3/10) contributes to Sri Lankas decline.

"The Sunday Times" Economic Analysis of 06th July, 2008, states, I quote: Export earnings for the first four months January-April 2008 grew by 11.3 percent to US dollars 2,488. This was mainly due to agricultural export earnings increasing by as much as 37 percent in the four month period, compared to that of the same period last year. This was due to the buoyant prices of tea and rubber. In fact tea export earnings increased by as much as 45.8 percent. The good news is that both tea and rubber prices are likely to continue to rise this year and boost export earnings. So, my point, Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, is- ( ) (The Hon.

Ravi Karunanayake) I do not believe in what Dr. Saman Kelegama says; I believe in what Dr. Sarath Amunugama says. ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Thank you. But, now I am going to quote him. - [Interruption.] This is what an economist says, I quote: Salary increases would set in motion what economists call a wage-cost spiral with increasing prices providing a further justification for another wave of wage increase that would continue to feed the inflationary pressures with no sign of declining. It is important to remember that the increases in prices generated by the wage increases would also affect those who are not recipients of the wage increases. This is the reason why, while on the basis of equity and the livelihoods of wage earners, there is a strong justification for a substantial wage increase, economic consequences of such an increase would be disastrous. The increase in money supply to accommodate this huge salary increase would speed up inflation further setting in motion an uncontrollable wage cost inflationary spiral. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Then, if you reduce the salaries, the problem will be rectified. He is talking absolute bunkum.

Now he is coming to Parliament and trying to show what a macho man he is. At least one should have the guts to go forward-[Interruption.] He talks about irrelevant matters and if he gets the mental satisfaction well, that is good enough. [Interruption.] Sir, I do not need to speak much about the countrys situation when you have got .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] like this. This is the reason why the country is in an absolute mess. Sir, now I wish to move the following Adjournment Motion. Sri Lankan Airlines on 01st April, 2008 moved away from the Emirates management and started to be managed by the Government. A Government that is mismanaging all the public institutions, SriLankan Airlines has not become an exception. It is reported that the loss incurred by SriLankan Airlines in the first 100 days is around Rs. 5,700 million. Mihin Air, which has proven to be simply a disaster was brought into existence to satisfy certain individuals, is now having a net liability of around Rs. 3,700 million. Therefore with the limited funds available by the Government, can tax payers money be vandalized in this manner? Who is held responsible?

2191 2192

[ ]

The first point is, our country is an island and to interact with the world the aviation policy and the shipping policy must be given top priority. You have the Ministry of Ports and Aviation under the Minister, the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa. At the very outset itself, I mentioned that he may not be a person with a lot of experience but, at least it seems that he is having people around who are giving him the correct guidance. But that does not walk the chalk. It is necessary to take some tough decisions. Up to now, I am happy that certain steps have been taken in the right direction. But I guess you may not know what is going on at this particular moment. The SriLankan Air Lines and Mihin Air are two institutions that are being used to ensure that your aviation policy is adhered to. On that score, you also have the Government showing emphasis as to how important aviation is. In the last Budget the port and airport levies were reduced. You also had the mortgage charges and the leasing charges for any aircraft in the country reduced or eliminated. So, obviously you are going in the correct direction to ensure that this is pushed in the best way possible. Hon. Minister, you would remember that you took the management of SriLankan Airlines back again on the 1st of April, 2008. You also had Mihin Air which was established for reasons best known to you - to fulfil the whims and fancies of one or two. People who are absolutely clueless of the freight and the aviation industry brought an airline into existence and today its plight is very well known. Let me run through the system. The present situation of the aviation industry is mostly being spoken of as a combination of "the father, the son and the Holy Ghost". Mihin Air is in one persons hand and the other son is running the SriLankan Airlines which was financed through the father. That is why it is known as "the father, the son and the Holy Ghost". Sir, there are a number of other institutions that are running at a loss. The CEB is one of them which is running at a loss of Rs. 2,10 million; Sri Lanka Railways is another which is running at a loss of about Rs. 3.7 million and the SLCTB is running at a loss of about Rs. 3.4 billion. I mention this because all these are in the transport field. You also have the Ports Authority - the Colombo Port is the most important one - which is running at a loss of Rs. 2.7 billion. Then you also have the State Mortgage and Investment Bank and all other State banks showing a reduction in their revenue. In this background, the SriLankan Airlines which was taken over a couple of months ago is running at a severe loss today. You would know that the SriLankan Airlines was brought into existence in 1980 and till 1998 it was run rather well during certain times and badly during others. But at the end of the day, for whatever reason,

when Mr. Harry Jayawardene handed over the airline back it was making a profit of Rs. 3,200 million during that last year. Up to the end of the year 1997 it made a profit of Rs. 3.2 billion. Thereafter the Emirates took over the airline. When the Emirates took over the management you would recall that, in this House there was a Debate on the privatization of SriLankan Airlines. I being a person who certainly believes that commercialization is a necessity, on that occasion mentioned that this is a useless exercise and this would only mean our aviation policy being subjugated to a third party. Our national carrier needs to have solid Government support, if not, at least there should be a partner that will walk along with the Government so that it would benefit the country. On this score, when the privatization took place there was a Debate in this House and I am sure, Hon. Minister, what we said then has actually happened today.

I recall with respect that the late Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle had a heated argument over this. Finally he came to court and apologized. A couple of months before his demise he admitted in this Parliament and said, Yes, what went on in that privatization was wrong. He did agree with everything what we have told and said, Yes, the privatization was faulty and we should have listened to the people who spoke at that time on a constructive basis. Hon. Minister, it is with the same spirit I am getting up in this House today because I know that you are a listener. You have listened to what I have said before and taken certain corrective action. But when you have a pack of jokers on your side who interrupt even you, then that is a problem. - [Interruption.]

Going on further on the basis of what I said, you had ground handling and AirLanka Catering which were privatized along with the company. In the first couple of years, SriLankan Airlines had shown a profit and when it was handed over on the 1st of April, 2008, it had a 14 billion rupee cash reserve because, out of the 14 aircrafts that were there three or four aircrafts were sold and leased back. - [Interruption.] So, when the authorities of the Emirates Airlines knew that their period was coming to an end what they did was, they ensured that they sell- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Shafeek Rajabdeen) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) point of Order ?

2193 2194

2008 24

( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Shafeek Rajabdeen) Sir, you cannot listen to two people at a time. You must listen to one. Therefore, my point of Order is that one person should speak on the Floor of the House at a time. ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Mervyn Silva) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) What my Colleague says is that there must be decorum in Parliament. When you have got .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] in Parliament, it is a problem; when you have got clowns in Parliament, it is another problem. ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Mervyn Silva) .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) , . . . . . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, going on further, you had Emirates with 40 per cent of shares in hand. Then, subsequently, two to three per cent of shares in the hands of the staff were also sold and finally the Emirates got 43 per cent of shares. The Emirates has 43 per cent of the shares means that they are a substantial shareholder. So, Hon. Minister, for whatever reason, you have got to work with the Emirates which has 43 per cent of shares of the company. So, on that particular score, when they returned the airline to you it had a 14 billion rupee cash reserve. The assets of the airline were sold and it was given as an asset less but a cash rich company. When the cash was given, you had an agreement entered into on the aircrafts they sold and leased back. The condition being that if by chance that the companys asset ability reduces beyond a certain point and the cash flow reduces beyond a certain point, the agreement stands annulled. So, Hon. Minister, you are in a very vulnerable position because in

the month of April you have lost US Dollars 14 million, in the month of May you have lost US Dollars 16 million and in the month of June you have lost US Dollars 24 million. So, that would mean a collective loss of US Dollars 54 million - Rs. 5700 million - in 100 days. That means, when you reduce Rs 5.7 billion from your cash reserve of Rs. 14 billion, you have only Rs. 8 billion in hand. So, Rs. 8 billon in your hand would necessarily mean, on this same trend, that this company can last only for three months on the basis of utilization of the cash reserve. Now, just before you took over the airline you had Peter Hill unceremoniously chased out. You all had different opinions. Well and good. We told you right from the day one not to employ him. But, you took nine years and eleven months to realize that. It is only in the last month that you kicked him out. When the SriLankan Airlines was given to Emirates we said, Do not privatize the ground handling." We said, "Do not privatize the catering. But, you went ahead with it. Finally the results showed that the SriLankan Airlines made a loss. Earlier it was only the ground handling and the catering that made money. So, that is the reason why you need experienced people and you must realize that we have told this in the national interest. After ten years, when everything was coming to end, you realized what was told was right. So, Hon. Minister, now what has happened? You have SriLankan Airlines with 4513 employees. Of that, 2200 are casual employees. They have been working in the company for four and a half years. The management of Emirates and SriLankan Airlines have been discontinuing their service every six months and taking them back two days later. That has been the practice. Now, Hon. Minister, would you and your Government take steps to confirm these 2200 casual workers? As of last week you had 50 employees moved from the flying section to ground handling. Fifty-five employees of the ground handling section were sent home and the reason being given is that it is overstaffed. So, on that score what are you doing? First of all, you must ensure that the commercialization process goes on. Yesterday, flight UL 115 to Coimbatore was cancelled. Why? Due to lack of staff. From yesterday till the end of October, the Colombo-Bombay flights are reduced. I do not know exactly whether it is reduced or completely cancelled. My knowledge is that it is reduced. Why? Because of the commercialization process. You increased the airfare but there are no passengers now. You have got Jet Airlines that is coming in and Kingfisher Airlines may be coming in January next year. So, because of that the SriLankan Airlines could not get the necessary critical factor - the passengers - to run the airline. So, as a result they have reduced Colombo-Bombay flights till October. So, the first thing that you have got to do is that you must regionalize the service and ensure you make maximum profit.

2195 2196

[ ]

Hon. Minister, the airfare to London is Rs. 70,000 or may be Rs. 100,000 now with the fuel surcharge and all. To go to Maldives, for a one-hour flight, you charge Rs. 44,000. So Hon. Minister, if for a ten-hour flight you get Rs. 100,000 and for a one-hour flight you get Rs. 44,000, then your objective should be to regionalize the service. Forget about running around the world. Run in the region and make it profitable. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) , . . , .

, , . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES took the Chair. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Carry on, please. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman. Hon. Minister, going on further, about three weeks ago, you had one passenger of a London-bound flight kept back for security reasons. But unfortunately, though the passenger was kept back his baggage went on the aircraft. Finally, in mid-air the staff had realized that there was one passenger less and one excess baggage. So, as a result, they had to make an emergency landing in Abu Dhabi jettisoning about 30,000 gallons of fuel incurring almost a Rs. 30 million loss to the airline. That was just one instance. Now, never mind that mistake, but had they gone to Europe, the SriLankan Airlines could have been blacklisted because the European Union follow very stringent security measures. So, if you had one passenger less and one baggage in excess on the checklist that would have been an absolute black mark to the airline. Fortunately, realizing this, you had made an emergency landing. But you lost about Rs. 30 million. So, a company that is cash-strapped, losing Rs. 5,700 million in hundred days - that is roughly Rs. 57 million a day - Hon. Minister, how can you afford such a loss? Now the European Union had imposed sanctions on Garuda Airline, - the Indonesian national carrier. For three years, they have not been able to fly into Europe. I am wondering whether there is any underhand activity by our competitors to ensure that SriLankan Airlines is also blacklisted. I am telling this with the best of interest because if that happens, what would happen to our entry into Europe? We go to London, we go to Germany, we

go to Parris and probably we may be going to Switzerland. What would happen if the European Union imposes sanctions like they have done to Garuda Airline of Indonesia and two other private airlines for being lax in security considerations? So, Hon. Minister, I suggest you put somebody competent in charge of this airline and ensure that it is run well. Then, the other factor that you have certainly got to take note of is the agreement on the leased aircrafts ; the condition being that if by chance the cash flow reduces beyond a certain point and the asset ability reduces beyond a certain point, the agreement stands annulled. Obviously, Emirates has put this clause if Sri Lanka takes over the airline for them to run into a major problem. When it stands annulled, you will have the aircrafts suddenly at a particular point and taken into their custody. So, please, first of all ensure that the agreement is renegotiated in the name of Sri Lanka. We might have political differences, but now we are talking as Sri Lankans. So, please ensure that this is taken care of. Now, Hon. Minister why I am basically mentioning this is because we have a country that is economically in chaos. You have absolutely a tightfisted policy, obviously with the present problems. You know that fuel prices are going up day by day. This is not something affecting only the SriLankan Airlines. It affects every airline. But, the Singapore Airlines is making a record profit. That is higher than what they have made in the previous year. You have the Emirates making a larger profit than last year. Likewise, the Thai Airways, except Malaysian Airlines - which I think is on the break even point - all airlines have surpassed their budgeted expectations. So, I do not want an answer from you saying that the oil prices are going up, so SriLankan Airlines is also facing a problem. This is what the officials are usually saying. Look at cargo handling. You have capable Sri Lankan people like Mr. Niran Seneviratne. I have been made to understand that he has spoken to you and given some ideas. Make use of these people. They handled it even when the Emirates were running the show. But they have not been promoted and you have got other people promoted who are running after politicians. You should also get the assistance of capable people like the Hon. Dilan Perera, because, even in the ports sector he done some work and both of you can set the place on fire - I mean in a positive sense. So, ensure that you make use of people like Mr. Niran Seneviratne. Then, I have been made to understand that the Finance Manager, Ms. Dilky is doing well. Likewise, the IT Manager, Mr. Nalaka is also doing well. But all of them are being sidelined. You had Chandana de Silva who was doing an excellent job but, suddenly he went to Emirates because he knew that he would not be promoted. "The father, the son and the Holy Ghost" combination - one was pulling the other- and poor Chandana got displaced. But, he would have been the ideal candidate. So, look into all this and give an

2197 2198

2008 24

opportunity to these people and ensure that you run the airline well. After all, this is not like running a trishaw or a private bus. These are carrying air passengers. Now, Hon. Minister, when it comes to Srilankan Airlines, today there is a statement in The Island newspaper under the heading, SriLankan to go public? I do not know whether this is a statement that has been made with your knowledge, but certainly it has been mentioned by some of the officials there that it is going to be privatized. You say that the policy of your Government is no privatization. Then, how is it going to be privatized? So, I would like you to look into this, because these are stealthily happenings like the unilateral ceasefire that the LTTE has declared about which the Government says, "No" and the security council says, "Yes, there will be an observation of ceasefire: no air raids, no military advances". So, I would like to know, on behalf of the United National Party, what you are going to do about this statement. Is it true or not?

Then look at Mihin Air. We mentioned one year ago that this is an absolute disaster. Now what has happened? After 11 months of operation Mihin Air has become the first asset less and aircraft less airline with a liability of Rs. 3,700 million. Is this what we were expecting of Mihin Air? Every month Rs. 200 million is being added on to the liabilities for the loan that had been taken from the Bank of Ceylon. I actually do not know what the loan impact on Lankaputhra Development Bank. So I do not want to refer to something I do not know. But, I would appreciate if you can look into this matter. Every month the Bank of Ceylon adds on Rs. 200 million to their liabilities. So as of now it is Rs. 3,700 million. The SriLankan Airline losing Rs. 5,700 million in 100 days and with this cumulative loss of Rs. 3,700 in liability, in what a colossal mess you are !

Then, Mr. Nihal Gunawardena, the former Operations Director of Mihin Air has gone to court asking compensation for premature termination of his service. So he is on a legal process. Who is this Sajin Vas Gunawardena? Has he got any experience in the airline industry? I know that he has not been able to fool you, but he has managed to fool your brother. So, it is high time the elder brother tells the younger brother that this is a disaster, this nonsense is enough. You have done the correct thing by telling him to go. But, the directors still do not know whether he has been sacked, whether he has resigned or whether he is still running the show behind the scene. But, imagine, he comes to press conferences and says he wants to buy aircrafts which are 20 years old, which have lost their airworthiness; flying ability. I would also like to quote an article which appeared in The Sunday Times of 6th July, 2008, where it states that, I quote: "Mihin Staff 'grounded' without pay".

Now I would like to corroborate myself on this issue. I only quoted the newspaper which says that they have not been paid their salaries for two months. I, as a matter of fact, spoke to certain officers regarding this and they said, Yes. Some of them said that they got only 20 per cent of their salary. Hon. Minister, please look into this. Amalgamating these two airlines is not going to solve the problem. I mean, for a cancer you cannot give a Panadol and cure it. You have created a monster and now you have got to live with the monster. You have got down Mr. Jayaseelan, SriLankan Airlines Country Manager for Beijing to run this airline. I do not think an airline which does not have any aircrafts and any assets except liabilities can move on. Everyday the staff is taken to the airport and brought back. You have no passengers. Bookings made have been cancelled. So, you have got to take some drastic action on this, Hon. Minister. There is no point in taking up an Adjournment Debate on this, if no action is taken. We are saying this for posterity, for knowledge of the people and you have to take corrective action because these are the problems that are affecting the people. The losses of these activities have to be borne by the people. Owing to this, the cost of living is increasing. So, this country on one hand is experiencing a cost-push owing to world inflation and on the other hand inefficiency, corruption and over subsidy in certain areas contributes to the increase in cost of living. Hon. Minister at this particular moment, Mihin Air owes Rs. 850 million to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation says that they have got to increase the price of fuel owing to the fact that these losses have to be included in their financial costs. Hon. Minister, you could see as to how your Ministry is helping to increase the cost of living. Mr. Asantha de Mel says that Rs.850 million needs to be paid by Mihin Air. Since he does not get that money, he has got to take those financial losses into consideration when fixing the price of petrol. The Hon. Fowzie says that the cost of a litre of petrol is Rs.80 and the selling price is Rs.157. Why? It is because of these contributory factors. This is why, with authority and with full confidence, that we are moving this Adjournment Motion. My speech will be followed by the Hon. Rajabdeen and the Hon. Lakshman Nipunaarachchi. I would love to take this matter forward into a further debate. But I am sure you will take necessary action on this because I can remember that sometime back when I told you something while walking out with you from the Parliament, the following day itself you took action on that matter. So, I guess that is the spirit that you have to have, then before too long we would be able to see a major change. We want to see assets are less run down than they are run down today. The Hon. Dilan Perera made a very good contribution with regard to this matter at the COPE. I must say that he has been very positive on this matter. Therefore, take

2199 2200

[ ]

action. Sack people if required and ensure that they do not run round you and make a mockery out of this. All we want to say is, ensure that there is proper financial management. Do not say that fuel prices are increasing and as a result SriLankan Airlines is running at a loss. It is absolute bunkum. Overstaffing is another problem. You have 2,200 casual employees. Are you going to confirm them or not? If not, what are you going to do with them? Ensure that the perks that are given to the staff are in keeping with the industry. When IATA comes and do a surprise check, please ensure that everything is correctly adhered to. Otherwise, if we lose the right of flying into the countries of the European Union member states this airline will have do be closed down. Hon. Minister, I do not want to take too much time as there is very little time available and my Colleagues who are waiting to follow me. But if this Adjournment Motion does not get the necessary addressing from you, we will take this into a full debate and the Government will be held responsible for the irresponsible management. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Shafeek Rajabdeen) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees for giving me the opportunity to speak a few words on the Adjournment Motion moved by my brother Member, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake. I fully endorse the ideas expressed by the Hon. Member in the House.

Today, Mihin Air is side by side with the SriLankan Airlines. The liabilities of Rs. 850 million to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and Rs. 100 million to the Bank of Ceylon are there. The Mihin Air was floated to be side by side with the national airline, SriLankan Airlines.

I would like to seek the indulgence of the House and the attention of the Hon. Minister to the issues raised by the Hon.Ravi Karunanayake. The shortcomings of Mihin Air have been clearly itemized. The lack of proper management and the conflict of interests towards this airline are clearly shown. Aviation is important to us especially because we are an island surrounded by the sea. While taking into consideration some of the points raised by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, where he stated that the European Union has issued sanctions on Garuda Airlines, I would like to emphasize that in the national interest of this country we have to take action. Accumulated losses of an airline would result in an increase in the cost of living. I would like to second the Motion moved by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake. Thank you very much.

The government has also agreed to not take any action on the management of SriLankan Airlines in circumstances where ho prima facie grounds exist on alleged misconduct or breach for such inquiry.
