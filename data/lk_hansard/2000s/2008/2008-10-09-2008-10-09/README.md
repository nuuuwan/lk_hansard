( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , . . . ROLE OF THE CENTRAL BANK IN PROTECTING THE ECONOMY OF THE COUNTRY ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Hon. Speaker. Sir, I rise on the Floor of the House to move an Adjournment Motion in order to discuss a very important matter that has arisen in the country today. It is in relevance to the economy of this country. Sir, I move the following Adjournment Motion. The countrys financial situation has been moving from bad to worse. The present Public Debt has increased 100 per cent as at what it was on 01st January, 2004. Furthermore, from the very recent past, the Central Bank has been moving away from its non political role to being a mouthpiece of the Government. Now there is a very severe international financial meltdown in the world as well. Therefore, how and what would be the role of the Sri Lanka Central Bank in this background (Domestically & Internationally), especially as to how the economy will be protected and insulated. Viz.

Hon. Speaker, the relevance in bringing in this Motion today is that there is a huge financial meltdown in the world and as a result Sri Lanka, one of the 212 countries in the world, is not insulated to face all the problems that are there, domestically and internationally. Hon. Speaker, first I would start with the domestic one because it is relevant with the practical things that have taken place in this country. I wish to know whether the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, the esteemed institution which is mandated to look after the financial activities of this country, has done the basic things required of the institution because they are entrusted to look into the deposits and the well-being of the depositors when they are taken over by financial institutions. Has due care been taken in this regard? The second one is, against the financial meltdown in the world whether the Sri Lankan Rupee is made to be stable as against the Dollar; whether domestically, action has been taken with regard to that. The third one is, whether the foreign reserves that are held by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka overseas have been invested prudently because if not it can have ramifications at a time when the dollar or foreign currency is of absolute essence to protect our currency. So, Hon. Speaker, today the inflation is around 30 per cent. I am talking from the domestic point of view. When the Budget was presented by the Finance Minister last November, he stated that the projected revenue would be roughly around Rs. 760 billion but as at 30th August, 2008, we can see, on a proportional basis only 46 per cent of the total revenue has been earned. So roughly on that pro rata basis, the maximum that the Government could earn would be between Rs. 600 - 650 billion and if so, there is going to be a Rs.110 billion deficit. Furthermore, with the stock exchange today dropping to almost 2000 points which is roughly about a 1500 percentage drop over the last couple of weeks, Hon. Speaker, I want to know whether the Central bank is in full control of the economy at this particular moment. The reason being - . , . , . . "" . . , . ? 7,800 . 1,800 . . 29 . . .

We brought to his attention that there is a general perception that there are companies operating on the basis of investment companies which have not been registered at the Central Bank. , ", .

I moved away from the domestic sector because Sakvithi Investment Limited has created a huge uproar and impacted on the hearts and minds of many people today. Some of them have even gone insane owing to the fact that amidst a bad economic crisis their situation has become worse.

Hon. Speaker, I would like to take this even further. Why has this situation been created? This Government has decided, owing to the fact that they do not want conditional loans and they are financially taking the system on, to go for international borrowing on syndicated loans, on commercial loans. Now I table* a printed copy of a news item that appeared in "The Bottom Line" online edition on the 08th of October, 2008 under the headline "Lanka foregoes $ 468.4 m from WB". , 5, 25 , , US Dollars 468 million , HSBC ; , Standard Chartered Bank . 10, 11 . ? , . ; 1994 2000 ; ? Then, I also table* a copy of the news item that appeared in "The Bottom Line" online edition of 8th

October, 2008 which shows that a US Dollars 300 million syndicated loan is being looked at by the Government of Sri Lanka. What is the requirement? You look at the HSBC loan. We pointed out in this House the inimical effects of taking such US Dollar loans. One thing we said was that - you are going for dollar borrowing - when your internal resources and the internal financial controls are weak, please do not expose ourselves to the foreign world because the vicissitudes that take place in the currency-adjusting factors can make or break a country. You do not need to feel shy about Sri Lanka when banking institutions in many countries like the United States, Pakistan - technically, Pakistan has gone default at the moment - and Iceland have gone bankrupt. Lehman Brothers Bank in the USA has gone bankrupt. US Dollars 700 billion has been approved by the Congress and the Senate in order to stimulate the US economy. The Central Bank of Hong Kong has reduced their interest rates. Likewise, Australia, for the first time, has reduced one and a half per cent over the last three days and in the United Kingdom, the Bank of England has stepped in to support inter-bank borrowing because the situation is so volatile. Hon. Speaker, amidst this, does the Governor of the Central Bank, in his naivety, have the audacity to say that this country is not having an economic problem? We would like to say that after all one persons judgment can affect 20 million peoples future. That is what is happening. We would like to know as a responsible Opposition what necessary steps have been taken to insulate the economy domestically and internationally. The reason why I referred to the HSBC loan was to point out that today we are paying a fixed rate of 8.25 per cent on a dollar borrowing. It was based on the Federal Reserve Rate plus 3 per cent and fixed at that. Today the Federal Reserve Rate has dropped from 5 per cent to 1.5 per cent. Yet, we are paying at 8.5 per cent.

Then, look at the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant Project. The Hon. Minister of Finance in reply to a question raised in Parliament stated that there are two Trans Loans which have been taken. One is, US Dollars 300 million at 2.5 per cent and the next one is US Dollars 155 million at 8 per cent plus 0.3 per cent per year. That works to 10.4 per cent. US Dollars 50 million has been taken from the ICICI Bank and US Dollars 270 million has been taken from the Standard Chartered Bank.

Today, the London Inter Bank Offered Rate has reduced from 5.83 to 4.85 per cent. The premium rate has gone up now that no bank will lend to Sri Lanka at anything less than 11 per cent. When you look at the Central Bank and its financial syndicated loans, are we not

2008 09 1689 1690

heading into a death trap? Today, the amortization factor is so high that last years total revenue was Rs 770 billion. The amortization factor was Rs. 685 billion. That is, interest plus capital factor. Then, how is the Government going to ensure that protection is given to the country and to the citizens? This is where the tiger has been caught by the tail. Now, at this particular moment we are wondering as to how we can go forward?

Another action that has been taken by the Central Bank is the Futures Trading market. Three months ago the price of a barrel of petrol was US Dollars 146. At that particular point, the rates changed and today the rate has dropped to US Dollars 88 per barrel. But, unfortunately our rates cannot be reduced for the simple reason that this Government has decided to go for Futures Trading. They have gone for Futures Trading with the Standard Chartered Bank and the City Bank and they have committed this country till February - March 2009 at the rate of US Dollars 138. Has it been done through a tender? Has it been done through a Cabinet decision? If not, who is held responsible for this? US Dollars 138 as opposed to US Dollars 88 today! Who is paying the difference? It is the consumer who is paying that and that is why the Hon. Minister Fowzie is unable to reduce the oil prices.

Furthermore, the agreement according to the Futures Trading is that, when the rates go up to US Dollars 138, there is a cap; that if the prices go beyond a certain point, the maximum profit that the Petroleum Corporation can make is Rs. 1.5 billion. But, when it comes down from US Dollars 138 to US Dollars 88, there is no cap to take advantage of that particular benefit. So, as a result what has happened is that, today the price of a barrel of petrol is US Dollars 88 but we will be paying US Dollars 138 per barrel till next February or March. I am made to understand that only 50 per cent of the purchasing has been hedged and when it comes down, you have got to buy not only the quantity but twice the quantity that has been mentioned, so that you make a double impact. To whom are we giving this money? The Standard Chartered Bank.

? plug plug , , . . ? , . 10

? . , . . . . . 12 13 . ? , ? , . . - Domestically and internationally we must ensure that our currency - the value of the rupee - is protected. Please ensure that we have a solid stand. We should go forward on that basis to have a better tomorrow. Remember the world is in turmoil. Financial melt-downs are taking place all over the world. Today, even the FTSE has almost lost about 300 points. The Colombo Stock Exchange, with yesterdays verdict on the Waters Edge land issue, will have an financial impact. Wherever there are corrupt deeds , they need to be corrected. That is what the Supreme Court says. We, the United National Party, will ensure at this moment and will go on record as well, that every single corrupt deal will be corrected and brought before the people.

So, we tell all investors that this is an open situation. The Supreme Court has given a very clear mandate. Every single corrupt deal will be revealed in order to protect tomorrow. I mean, the general situation is, governments come and governments go. This Government has been ruining the country for 15 years and it is high time that they go. So, when they quit we have to inherit the country; you and I will have to inherit this. When we inherit, we must ensure - [Interruption.] You are laughing, Hon. Speaker. We must ensure that when we take over the country, we should have less of a burden, not more of a burden because the general fact is, the UNP is like a janitorial service; we come and we correct the situation and then again somebody else comes and messes it up.

On that score, all we want to ensure is that there should be a solid ground on which the economy can stand firm and sound at a time when there are financial melt-downs all over the world. Ensure that we have a proper answer in order to protect our countrymen and our economy.

Thank you.
