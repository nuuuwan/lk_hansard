asked the Minister of Posts and Telecommunication,

(a) Is he aware that a person by the name of R.M. Dilani Rathnayaka of No.87/3, Denida, Nawalapitiya is employed as a full time registered substitute of the Denida Sub Post Office since 30.09.2003?

(b) Will he inform this House the reason for not appointing Dilani Rathnayaka to the aforesaid post, which fell vacant as a result of the Sub Post Mistress of Denida Sub Post Office being promoted with effect from 31.07.2006, as appointing the permanent substitute to the aforesaid vacancy is the usual practice?

(c) However, will he admit that appointing a person by the name of Sisira Kumara Bandara who has not even served as a substitute of the aforesaid Sub Post Office, to the aforesaid vacancy with effect from 15.09.2007, is not fair?

(d) Will he state whether the person by the name of Dilani Rathnayaka will be appointed to the post of Sub Post Master of Denida Sub Post Office on the basis of qualifications and experience?

(e) If not, why?

Sir, I rise to a point of Order. This is very unfair. When the Hon. Ministers are not present in the House we cannot expect the Chief Government Whip to answer these questions which are of very technical nature. The Hon. Minister, in charge of the subject must answer. I have been the Minister in charge of this subject. I know that there are several questions raised by these Hon. Members. But the Hon. Minister in charge of the subject never comes. There must be some practice. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , .

No, that is a right of an MP. I agree on that. I agree with you on the principle. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

I am not blaming, you Minister. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena)

No, you can blame me. What I am trying to say is, do not interpret to say that if the Minister was present that he could have answered any question. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

This year is significant in the context of urbanisation in South Asia for two reasons. First, it marks 60 years since the countries of India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka came into existence as modern nation states. Second, it is a watershed in human history when, for the first time, more than half of humanity, about 3.3 billion people, now live in towns and cities. In South Asia, home to over 1.6 billion people, a quarter of humanity, a third lives in urban areas. As the world becomes increasingly urban, the centre of gravity of this process is gradually moving to South Asia and China. According to the United Nations projections, within seven years time, that is, by 2015, South Asia will account for five of the worlds 12 biggest urban agglomerations (cities with more than 15 million people), namely, Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Dhaka and Karachi. Further, all but two of these 12 mega cities (Tokyo and New York- Newark) will be located in developing countries. In all, by 2015, over 540 million South Asians will live in towns and cities and, by the year 2030, this figure will cross 813 million. These are colossal numbers by any yardstick. To put these numbers in perspective, global population is projected at 8.2 billion in 2030 of which 4.9 billion will be

urban dwellers. And 3.9 billion will live in less developed regions. In other words, by the year 2030, one in five urban dwellers will be a South Asian. This broad brush picture, of course, conceals marked differences in the process and nature of urbanisation within South Asia. To begin with, the levels of urbanisation vary significantly across countries." , . I quote again: While Pakistan is the most urbanised country in the region at 36 percent, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Nepal are among the least urbanised (12, 15 and 17 percent respectively). It is interesting to note, in particular, the low level of urbanisation in Sri Lanka, given its relatively high per capita income and human development report scores vis--vis the other countries in South Asia. In Sri Lanka, based on materials of construction used for wall, floor and roof, housing units have been divided into three types viz; Permanent, Semi-Permanent and Improvised. Out of occupied housing units in 18 districts, 69.8 per cent are permanent, 28.3 per cent are semi-permanent and 0.9 per cent are improvised. , . , . . , . . . " " . , .

[.. 11.38] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, while discussing the important pieces of legislation that the two Hon. Ministers have presented in this House, I would like to divert for a moment to refer to the situation in the Weligama area. Unfortunately, for the last three days continuously there has been a tense climate prevailing in Weligama and the outskirts of the town. On the night of the 21st Sunday, a gang of people who had gone into a hotel, had an argument over paying a bill and had damaged that hotel and some of the items in the hotel, following which the police intervened and three people were arrested. They were made to compensate the hotel owner by paying Rs. 2000. Then, after going back to their village, they have come back and engaged in damaging and attacking a place of worship, a mosque, particularly the Meera Jumma Mosque in the Weligama town. Now these sorts of incidents are happening far too often to our liking. The Government particularly has to take a serious note of these incidents targeting places of religious worship. Though a curfew has been clamped, even now the security of the Muslim people in that area is in serious jeopardy. Last night too a gramasevaka officer from Welipitiya area in Weligama was mercilessly attacked by gangs of thugs in the surrounding villages and he is presently warded in the hospital. He has been hospitalized after being severely beaten up. This being the Ramadan period, obviously Muslims are terribly perturbed and I must say here that the people of the area are blaming the police for not taking timely action. Several complaints have been made about assaults. There have been some teachers who have been assaulted, a few other members of the public have been assaulted and this is happening regularly. The day before yesterday, in Koledanda, another village, a mosque was sought to be attacked and since people intervened, they were somewhat able to prevent it but yet the tense situation is prevailing. I hope the Government will take serious note of these incidents and timely action and instruct the police to arrest the culprits. They are showing some reluctance to arrest the culprits and therefore these people are having a sense of impunity, a sense of immunity and that is why they are going ahead and attacking places of worship. This situation should be contained immediately. Even a Muezzin of this particular mosque in Koledanda has been attacked and this has been carried out by the police. Therefore, people are losing confidence in the very people who should maintain law and order and enforce law to prevent crimes in this country. This situation in Weligama should not be allowed to continue and as a matter of interest there was another issue that we came to know. On the very day, a petrol shed belonging to the Chairman of the Weligama

[ ]

2008 24 993 994

Urban Council, Mr. Hussain Mohamed, who happens to be a Muslim - he is also from the governing party, the UPFA - was totally destroyed. I am told that the loss is in the region of Rupees three to four million and I have reliable information that a particular Minister of the Provincial Council of the Southern Province who had a political vendetta has used this situation of communal disturbance to destroy and cause damage to the petrol shed of the Chairman of the Weligama Urban Council. Today, he is a very distraught man. Though he is a Member belonging to the Government - he belongs to the ruling party of the Weligama Urban Council - his own petrol shed has been destroyed and the popular suspicion is that a particular Minister of the Southern Provincial Council has been behind this attack. There are various connotations. There are elements taking advantage of a situation and are also willing to do harm to their political opponents and destroy their properties. These matters must be placed on record so that the Government will ensure that at least in the future such incidents do not take place. As a matter of practice, it has been observed in many places that the police always close the door of the stable after the horses have bolted. They step into the area after the event has taken place. Timely action is always delayed. Though the incident occurred on Sunday night, until Monday, no curfew was imposed. Curfew was imposed only on Monday night and that too from 10.00 p.m. to 6.00 a.m. I am sure it will be imposed even for a few more days so that the situation could be brought under some semblance of control. The request of the people of the area is that there should be continuous heavy surveillance by the security forces and the police to see that further incidents do not occur in this area. With those comments, Mr. Presiding Member, I will move on to say a few words in Tamil since the Fair Minister of the Ministry of Housing and Common Amenities who too comes from the Ampara District is here. There are specific issues concerning the Ampara District which have been in a state of neglect for quite some time. These are issues which we have collectively agitated for but still not materialized. Therefore, I thought that I should refer to these so that matters would be expedited. , 2004 , . , , . -

. . 10 . ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Ferial Ismail Ashraff) Hon. Member, I have to tell you that there would be no question of those people being ousted from the camps or their electricity or water facility being interrupted in any way because we have taken necessary steps to take care of those refugees who are in refugee camps. Of course, there is a delay in the construction of the houses, but nothing has been interrupted. It is going on. There is a definite delay on account of lands not being available in that area. But, we will definitely look into it. There is no question of those people having to go on protest because we will take care of their immediate needs.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

But the Divisional Secretary is now in a situation where he is worried that he will again be subjected to a hartal in front of his office if this does not go on. This has been going on for the last three or four years and the Hon. Minister has been in charge of this subject. You are from that area. It is expected that you should take some action to have these things expedited since several houses are yet to be built. ( ) (The Presiding Member)

Hon. Member, kindly wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

I am winding up, Sir. Several houses are yet to be built. I am sure some action would be taken to somehow complete this. Similarly, the Marathamune Housing Scheme is also nearing completion. I hope some action would be taken to see that those refugees who have previously taken similar action to bring their protest to the notice of the Government will also be provided with the necessary shelter without much delay. Having said that, Mr. Presiding Member, I would like to -

( ) (The Presiding Member) You have to wind up, Hon. Member. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I will wind up by saying that the filling of land in the Sainthamaruthu area is going at a very slow pace though about 60 odd houses have been undertaken to be built for the Malikaikadu refugees. That work is going on. Apart from these 199 houses, the balance 400 houses for the rest of the refugees who are still languishing in squalid conditions in those temporary sheds should be built and they should be resettled as fast as possible. I am told that the Ministry of Resettlement and Disaster Relief Services has undertaken to pay the rent for the Kalmunai people who are residing in those temporary lands. That responsibility too has to be somehow fulfilled without further delay. With those comments, I wind up. Thank you. [.. 11.54] . . ( ) ( . . - ) (The Hon. M.S.
