No. You had submit the list. Then, we will give our list.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe)

Okay, I will tell you.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena)

Yes. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe)

. I have met the Commissioner of External Affairs and the Commissioner of Trade of the EU. I have met in Colombo, Lord Malloch Brown when he came here. I met him once in London and I met him subsequently here. All the Ministers met him. Other Ministers I have met, or for that matter any other Member of the UNP, has been during their visits here. We have told them very, very clearly, as far as we are concerned, we are for the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka; that terrorism has to be countered by security response, maybe the Army in some places, police in other places but that long-lasting peace depends on a political solution acceptable to all parties and based on democracy. One issue which we have with the Government is that, the difference between Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE is that we are a democratic entity. The LTTE prevented the voters from voting at the Presidential Election which resulted in the victory of Mr. Rajapaksa and he has become the President. They are not a democratic entity. But unfortunately, today Sri Lanka is also not being a democratic entity, there are restrictions on the media. Already there have been new restrictions imposed on the media. Then, there have been abductions of media personnel. There has been pressure brought on the Members of the Opposition parties. Those are issues that I have taken up. If that is so, the first person who took such issues up during the period 1989 to 1990 had been the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa. . - - ; . , . . . .

[.. 4.10] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Shafeek Rajabdeen)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Hon. Presiding Member, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to participate in the Debate on the Fourth Budget presented by His Excellency the President, the Minister of Finance of this country.

Sir, the Budget for 2009 has been presented by His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, sowing the seeds of prosperity and economic growth, at a time when there is no possibility of a high yield in this country which is in the midst of a financial crisis. Today, history has been created in the world by Barack Hussein Obama who has been elected to the White House. He has made the American dream come true where earlier colour, caste, creed and religious beliefs deprived a citizen from being elected to the highest office as President of the United States. Abraham Lincoln proposed something but the countrymen disposed of him. The American Independence and the conditions prompted Martin Luther King, the civil rights activist, to advocate reforms but the world brutally killed him. John F. Kennedy made moves to reform and in 1963, the assassination of the visionary leader took place. America, now the New World, is a super role model of the world. It has blue states and red states. It is very simple, they are United States. People irrespective of colour, caste, creed and religious beliefs have come together for a change in the New World. That has shown every human being, millions of people all over the world, that the white supremacy has been overcome by change. It is a lesson that we all must take very seriously. Well done Obama! Your "change" will be a policy that would bring peace, understanding and fellowship amongst all people of the world. You have shown that equality reigns supreme in the New World. Whilst we look at America, the Super Power, let us also look at our Motherland, just a teardrop in the ocean. In our tiny land, torn apart by terrorism with the promise of peace in the near future, thousands of soldiers have laid down their lives to give us a better tomorrow. Twenty five years of war and terror have killed and displaced millions of people. Our country is hoodwinked and betrayed by the policy of "Mahinda Chintana" of the grand Alliance of the Government formed together with the Communist Party, the Jathika Hela Urumaya, the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna, the CWC - the Workers' Congress - the National Unity Alliance, the dissident Members of the UNP and the dissident Members of the SLMC. Peace and cohabitation is the major quest in todays world. Sir, let me thank you again for giving me the opportunity to participate in the Debate on the Budget for 2009. The biggest source of revenue for this country is the taxes which amount to approximately Rs. 600 billion. Our largest Head of expenditure is for salary payments to the public servants of our country. There are approximately 1.2 million Government servants and four and a half lakhs of pensioners and senior citizens who are drawing out money or draining out the coffers passed by this great Budget. Since Independence up to date, our biggest expenditure has been the repayment of loans

535 536

obtained by consecutive governments as foreign loans. In 1960, it was recorded at US Dollars 6.2 billion; in the 1970s, it was US Dollars 8 billion; in the 1980s, after the introduction of the open economic policy, it has increased to US Dollars 310 billion and in the 1990s, it has come to an amount of US Dollars 1,117 billion. Our borrowings are increasing day by day. The foreign loans we have obtained between 1980 and 1990 have increased by over 500 per cent. Mr. Presiding Member, what I am trying to say is that one cannot feed his family by borrowing and taking overdrafts from banks because some day he is bound to crash as there would be no cash flow. A higher level of income should be shown to overcome the higher rate of interest. The rate of interest in our country is the highest in the region and we see that since the latter part of 2007, the world economy has been heading towards a recession. The gradual collapse of housing markets and the financial system and the losses incurred by international banks and the deep credit squeeze have drastically reduced the investment growth and outlook in many countries. Due to rising inflation, the economic growth has declined in most countries the world over, creating a lesser demand for commodities and a stiff competition globally. Foreign exchange earners in the forefront connected to tea and rubber and industrial value added products such as the apparel industry and agricultural products are affected due to the increase in the cost of living and high oil prices and the increase in electricity and transport charges. Considering the poverty-stricken people in the Third World, we are in an equal position with the people of Africa today where we see bankrupt governments have prompted disaster to its people with no food, no clothing, no shelter and terror has taken shape in those lands along with ethnic cleansing and genocide on a large scale. We do not want Sri Lanka to come to that stage. That is why we are all united in fighting a war on terror, considering a united Sri Lanka as an important aspect. As a member of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress representing over 8 to 10 per cent of the Muslim population in this country, we see no development in the tourist industry, in the building industry or in the business world. Our share market is collapsing and it is very unrealistic since only a few are calling the shots in our reserves. Most of the skilled labour force is leaving the country. Mr. Presiding Member, that is the only consolation we have. The educated are leaving the country looking for greener pastures and the unskilled women are sent to the Middle-East as housemaids. Our country is left with narrow-minded citizens who advocate themselves to petty politics making lives miserable with ethnic and racial problems. We foresee that any further unrest will bring doom to our motherland. I would like to state that if America can change its policies and elect as its President an African who belongs to a minority community, which comprises of only 11 per

cent of the total population, and if India can have a Prime Minister who is from the minority Sikh community and even had a Muslim President and a Chief Minister from another community, why can Sri Lanka not do it?

The other day, I listened to an Hon. Member of the JHU who said that this land is a Sinhala land, a Bauddha country and he wanted to reclaim the lands that were given to the peasants and farmers as sacred lands. Even Mullaitivu is being quoted as a sacred land. We should not deprive others if we want to have unity and development in this country. Let us not be narrow- minded; treat everybody with equality. Who cares whether you are a Sinhala, a Tamil, a Burgher or a Malay? Let us all work together because it is our motherland. Let us not tell each other, I am a Lankan; you are a foreigner. I will invite those people who say that we are foreigners to go before a mirror and ask themselves as to who they are. All religions speak of co-existence and respect for one anothers beliefs and above all, we must respect the human nature, desire and demands. Mr. Presiding Member, the Budget has not addressed the SMEs even though the Government always speaks of SME development. Today, the handicraft industry in Sri Lanka has virtually closed down where more than 1,200 craftsmen are unemployed. Since there is no active support by the Government to revive this industry and with the downward trend in the tourist arrival, the handicraft industry has gone bankrupt. The Government must, under the Ministry of Rural Industries and Self-employment Promotion accommodate them and revive this industry by giving special grants and loans. To revive the industry, the Government should at least send a delegation to India to see how they turn out products out of coconut husks and how they run the cottage industry of handicrafts there. The cottage industry of handicrafts in India is given special recognition and the craftsmen are brought under a cluster and are supported. The Budget does not specify any form of support to this category of industry even though in the "Mahinda Chintana" they are referred to right throughout. In that programme of development, the SMEs are the backbone of the countrys economy.

With the current economic crisis, with an inflation of over 20 per cent and the unbelievable interest rates, most of the small and medium industries in the Island have virtually closed down. The State banks, at this stage, must bail them out and restructure their loans before all the small and medium industries are closed down. Otherwise, this will reverse the development process; create more unemployment and the economy of this country will be at stake. The Government of the day should address this issue urgently, not on paper but in reality. The Lankaputhra Bank along with the other State Banks, at this stage, must restructure the loans given to the SMEs. It is useless for the State Banks to show

[ ]

2008 08 537 538

profits in millions at the end of the year without giving any financial support to the SMEs. Today, an entrepreneur cannot get any bank loan without a collateral and this will be with a 20 per cent interest. Recently, I met a Member of the delegation that came to Sri Lanka from Malaysia and Singapore to do an investment programme. The very first thing that he did, Sir, was to go around the market and see as to what the potential is. As Sri Lanka is a very risky country for potential investment, he went to a few banks and when he met me he said, I can invest all my money in these banks because the rate of interest that I would get is well over 18 per cent on my bulk investment. There is no purpose of doing business here. In Singapore, for business the bank interest rate is 3 to 6 per cent whereas our profit turnover is only 3 per cent. So, there is no need to toil and do business here. It is better to put our money in a bank and collect it with interest. That is what this country is doing. There are many wealthy citizens. This Government is not aware of all this. If you keep somebody at the steps of a casino, you will see the influx of black money and who has this black money. The Inland Revenue Department does not know these things. The people who have money have a lot of money. But they are not properly taxed. So, the Government must explore every avenue to bring them to book. Today, the Labour GSP has not been looked at. I am afraid that a large number of factories are being closed down and there is unemployment. Duties are entrusted to a number of ministers in the industrial sector. Foreigners opt to open fixed deposits in Sri Lanka rather than to start industries anymore. The current state of this country is very critical especially with regard to the export-oriented industries to the EC countries. If the GSP Plus issue is not addressed positively, I am afraid that a large number of factories would have to be closed down. The GDP will be reversed. The Government has entrusted the task of tackling the GSP Plus issue to too many ministers and all of them have different views and their own agendas. Unless this issue is addressed properly, Sri Lanka will lose this concession. Too many ministers will spoil the soup. There are more than four ministers trying to address one issue and take wings every month to the EC countries and we only see newspaper reports which state that all four ministers are sitting on the GSP. The President should entrust the handling of export trade to one minister and he has to take up issues and find solutions. In all the discussions on the apparel industry, private sector participation must be included. Hon. Presiding Member, I would like to talk on the fuel subsidy. Fuel subsidy should have been given before the Budget and not during the Budget. The Government had no option when Laugfs Gas and Shell Gas reduced the prices of LPG before the Budget prompting an overstock of petroleum products in the city. Nobody stocked petrol before the Budget. Most of the petrol sheds in the city are closed with no stocks. Most of the

petrol sheds went dry. Had the Government reduced the prices of petrol and diesel before the Budget they would have stored more petrol and made additional money. The relief of Rs. 30 for diesel and Rs. 15 for petrol is not an important factor; it is an interim relief and the price of gas and petrol can go up day by day depending on the world market prices.

I would agree with the Hon. Sunil Handunetti of the JVP in regard to the fact that a mere increase of Rs.1,000 to the public servants is not sufficient. Once the salaries of public servants are increased, it could never be decreased. It is permanent. If the Government grants a mere allowance of Rs. 1,000, then it can be reduced as and when you want. The increase and the decrease of the price of petrol by the Government has nothing to do with the increase of the salaries of public servants. If you continue to do good work with the public, the public will look after you. The increase of productivity is essential. The Government may impose taxes from 15 to 20 per cent on commodities. But a bigger slice of increment must be considered for the public servants. Depending on the increase and decrease of prices of essential commodities, the Government could not reduce the salaries from time to time. Pay-cuts are only possible with non-performance and non-attendance. I would like to say that public servants need motivation, an increase in their salaries and an increase in productivity and a clear mind.

Mr. Presiding Member, I would now like to touch on the estate sector of this country. Estate workers are being paid very low salaries and have been ignored. There is no relief given when the prices of sugar, milk, flour and all other basic commodities go up. I wish to speak about the production of tea. There are over one million people who contribute to the advancement of the tea industry. They have brought in a lot of revenue to this country though we do not appreciate it today. As there is no proper tea plucking taking place, there is no good price for tea and the world market has a recession on tea. Therefore, there is no relief given to the estate workers. You want the estate labourers to be labourers today, tomorrow and forever. There is no proper education and no roadways in the plantations. The welfare of these estate labourers must be looked into. So, I would like to request the President to look into this.

The composition of tax revenue projected from January to October 2008 shows that there is 21 per cent on income tax, 37 per cent on VAT, 19 per cent on Excise Duty, 11 per cent on Import Tax, and 5 to 7 per cent on other miscellaneous taxes. An analysis of revenue for the years 2005 to 200 shows an increase of income tax from Rs. 709 billion to Rs. 855 billion and the total expenditure from Rs.1,016 billion to Rs. 1,197 billion. So, the deficit has increased from Rs. 307.35 to Rs. 336 billion.

539 540

The bulk of the recurrent expenditure is for personal emoluments and welfare subsidies of Government servants. This country gives everything free to the poor from the day they are born to the day they die. We have also given everything to the Government servants but there is no productivity. So we have to work with the Government servants to bring more productivity to the country. With regard to the expenditure, the repayment of foreign loans is the biggest burden to the country. I think the foreign loans borrowed by consecutive governments to develop our country have made our children indebted for life and those who are being born and yet to be born will also be paying these debts in millions. To wind up my speech, I wish to bring the words of Archbishop Oscar Romero to the limelight. I quote: Peace is not the product of terror or fear. Peace is not the silence of cemeteries. Peace is not the silent revolt of violent repression. Peace is the generous, tranquil contribution of all to the good of all. Peace is dynamism. Peace is generosity. It is right and it is duty. The chintanayas of all religious leaders such as Lord Buddha, Jesus Christ, Holy Prophet Sallalahu Alaihiwasallam and Lord Krishna will conquer the hearts, minds and the rights of the people. But if we are to reap any harvest, let us not talk of man-made chintanayas; let us put our heads together irrespective of caste, creed and religion, work as human beings and call ourselves, Sri Lankans and not "Sinhala", "Demala" or "Marakkala". Assalamu Alaikkum.
