Hon. Speaker, I move the following Adjournment Motion: "The Government dissolved the Sabaragamuwa and the North Central Provincial Councils prematurely despite the fact that there was about fifteen months more legally for its expiration.

Since the dissolution, the Government has been misusing all resources be it the police powers, be it the public service, be it the media, financial regulations, human rights etc. This is directly as the result of the lack of implementation of the 17th Amendment and these

powers are being used by the executives without any checks and balances. Therefore, now they are resorting to intimidation, terror tactics and trying to snatch the fundamental right of the citizens by trying to deprive people from voting. We are informed that goons squads are being used by the Government at various polling divisions in these two provinces and trying to disrupt a peaceful election.

We call upon the Government to explain as to why the opposition political parties are being deprived of police protection and to request the Government to immediately ensure that law and order is restored and all persons who have acted beyond the law is brought within the law forthwith." Moving that Motion, I would like to move forward referring to the two Provincial Councils that are due to face election. , . . . , . , . ; . . . . . . . ? ? , , , , , . 2004 02 . . , , , . - - - - . . 1999 . 2000 . 2004 , . 2005 , 2008 ? . , .

Gen. Janaka Perera Chief Ministerial Candidate Provincial Elections - 2008 Lakeside Hotel, Rowing Club Road, Anuradhapura 22nd August 2008 Inspector General of Police Jayantha Wicremarathna, Colombo 1. Dear Sir, I am enclosing a complaint herewith connected with a series of criminal activities planned by a senior Police officer DIG Mahinda Balasuriya who has been brought to Anuradhapura on top of you and senior DIG Mr. Jayantha Gamage. It is also learnt from the media that two more DIGs have been sent to handle Anuradhapura. It is shocking that when the attack on Dr. Johnpulles House took place under the very nose of the present DIG Pathirana commanded by Berty Premalal Dissanayake and his son Duminda masterminded by your new DIG to the task Manhinda Balasuriya. This is also in violation of the directive given by the Commissioner of Elections Mr. Dayananda Dissanayake that no Police officer should be transferred in or out of the province after the nomination day of the Provincial elections scheduled to be held on the 23rd of August 2008. I would request you to take immediate action in order to prevent any breach of Peace or the commission of any criminal activities masterminded by the said Mahinda Balasuriya and have all the new DIGs removed from the scene. It is my hope that what is necessary at the moment is that the Police Officers should be directed to take no orders from any Politicians as it is happening presently, but to instruct them that they will be held personally responsible for any breach of Peace. In any event as the Inspector General of Police I hold you over all responsible for any illegal activity that is already conspired and orchestrated to take place during the course of today and tomorrow. I am also enclosing a statement made by Dr. N. D. Chandrasena in this connection. Yours faithfully,

Gen. Janaka Perera

Dr. N. G. Chandrasena No. 6A Sarasavi Gardens Nawala Rd., Nugegoda 21st August 2008 Deputy Inspector General of Police K. G. P. Pathipara, Anuradhapura Dear Sir, I am enclosing a complaint herewith connected with a series of criminal activities planned by a senior Police officer DIG Mahinda Balasuriya who has been brought to Anuradhapura on top of you and senior DIG Mr. Jayantha Gamage. This is also in violation of the directive given by the Commissioner of Elections Mr. Dayanda Dissanayake that no Police officer should be transferred in or out of the province after the nomination day of the Provincial elections scheduled to be held on the 23rd of August 2008.

3181 3182

Nambukaragamage Chandrasena : Age 47; Sinhalese Buddhist; Presently I am residing at the Ashok Hotel Rowing, Club Road, in Anuradhapura and working as the Coordinating Officer for General Janaka Perera the Chief Ministerial Candidate at the forth coming Provincial Elections to be held on the 23rd. I am reliably informed that senior Police officer DIG Mahinda Balasuriya has been brought to Anuradhapura on top of DIG Pathirana and senior DIG Mr. Jayantha Gamage in order to commit series of Criminal activities in the District of Anuradhapura during the last days of the election and on the day of the election. I am further informed that this same Balasuriya has been the Master mind where a large mob was led to the house of Dr. Johnpulle where the main coordinating office of the United National Party in Anuradhapura was located, committing arson and mischief setting fire to the entire house. The Police were present and did not take any action to prevent the same. In addition to Police not taking action when a contingency of army and the fire brigade came to the scene the senior Police officers who were present have asked them to go away without dousing the fire. Now I have been reliably informed that the same criminal hand that is behind these criminal activities namely Mahinda Balasuriya is planning to plant offensive weapons at the hotel where myself and general Janaka Perera along with all his family members and friends are residing and raid the same and take General Perera and or his friends and the family members in to custody. I am making this complaing with a request to you to inquire and take action against this conspiracy. Bringng Mahinda Balasuriya to Anuradhapura is in violation of the directive given by the Commissioner of Elections Mr. Dayananda Dissanayake that no Police officer should be transferred in or out of the province after the nomination day of the Provincial elections scheduled to be held on the 23rd of August 2008. I would request you to take immediate action in order to prevent any breach of peace or the commission of any criminal activities masterminded by the said Mahinda Balasuriya and other Police officers who are acting under the instructions of Mahinda Balasuirya.
