QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE I

SECURITY OF HON. MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT . ( . ) (The Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera) , . . . . . . . . , . . , . . , . ; walkie-talkie . ? . , , . , . , , . . . . . . . . . , . . Sir, I rose to speak in the context of the rapidly deteriorating security situation in the country and especially that of the Members of Parliament. This matter has been discussed on several occasions both on the Floor of the House and at the Party Leaders Meetings. I refer in particular to the Meeting of the Party Leaders of 2nd January, 2008, where it was agreed that the Hon. Speaker would hold a meeting of the Party Leaders together with the IGP and the Director, MSD to discuss matters pertaining to the security of the Members of

Parliament. IGP . . Party Leaders . . . . IGP . , , . , . . . . , . . . . . , . "" . . . " , " . , . . ( ) (The Hon. Wimal Weerawansa) . . ( . ) (The Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera) . .

Speaker, may I also, at this moment, take up with the Hon. Prime Minister - the Hon. Chief Opposition Whip also took up this matter - the matter regarding the security of the Hon. Leader of the Opposition. You would remember, Hon. Prime Minister, when the late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar and you were in the Opposition, you were given the same security that was given to Members of the Government. Today, even the Hon. Leader of the Opposition does not have a bulletproof vehicle. The official vehicles are not there today. The Hon. Premadasa Champika and I went to D.S.Senanayake College to attend the funeral of those seven children and I was astonished to see the Hon. Leader of the Opposition coming in a normal vehicle. When we inquired about it, they said that the Government has withdrawn the vehicle owing to its wear and tear.

So, Hon. Prime Minister, it was in your best interest that security was provided when you were in the Opposition. The late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar had 37 vehicles. Is it not right that the security of the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, as the alternate leader of the country, should be looked into? Look at the Members of Parliament on the Government side today. There is nobody there. If the Government Ministers and Members of Parliament are worried about coming to Parliament, what do you think the plight of the Members of the Opposition is? But that would not deter us at all. All we say is, ensure that security is provided to us. Every Member represents the people. The Government has been given a temporary lease to run the country. We change sides. If we come to power tomorrow, I am sure you would be protected in the same way you are now protected. So, I think it is necessary to look into this particular issue. This is a very fair call. It was looked into when you were in the Opposition, Hon. Prime Minister. I am sure even if the Government would not do it, you, as the Prime Minister, would ensure that it is done. I also agree with what the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera mentioned in this House. These are matters that should be looked into. There is no point in talking of what should have been done when it could be done. Thank you. II

[.. 11.13] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Thank you, Venerable Presiding Member. We have completed six decades since achieving Independence from colonial rule. Today, some of us are averse to comparing ourselves with other States. We, perhaps, think that would not be to our advantage and therefore, it should be avoided. We have also, since of late, developed a chronic xenophobia. We saw samples of that in the House this morning when questions were raised about the International Centre for Ethnic Studies, a very reputed organization founded several decades ago by the late Hon. (Dr.) Neelan Tiruchelvam, which has been rendering very distinguished service in several fields for the benefit of this country. In recent decades, rule under the Emergency has become the norm in our country. It is no longer the exception. The normal rule of law has been supplanted by the Emergency Regulations. In many countries, this would be considered outrageous, but not so in Sri Lanka. We are averse to change, particularly if the change is to bring about something new, something progressive as happens in other countries which are maintaining stability and progressing. Nevertheless, we are averse to such change. We have been so frequently under Emergency rule because of a serious ailment that afflicts our body politic and this ailment has persisted from shortly after Independence. This country, Venerable Presiding Member, is inhabited by distinct peoples: the Sinhalese people, the Tamil people, the Muslim people and others. The mother-tongue of the Sinhalese people is Sinhala. Tamil is the mother- tongue of the Tamils and the Muslims. The plantation Tamils of recent Indian origin have lived primarily in the plantation sector. The Muslims have lived in all parts of the country and substantial numbers live in the North-East. The indigenous Tamils have primarily inhabited the North-East. They have their distinct history, tradition, culture and their own distinct identity. I must say, Venerable Presiding Member, with due respect, that the Sinhalese are not Tamils and the

[ ]

2008 06 715 716

Tamils are not Sinhalese. The Sinhalese people and the Tamil people are distinct peoples with distinct identities. The Muslims, particularly in the North-East, have laid emphasis on their own identity which needs to be recognized. It would, Venerable Presiding Member, in my respectful submission, be only a foolhardy person who would state that these distinct peoples within Sri Lanka have evolved into a Sri Lankan nation during the past 60 years of Independence. Unfortunately, we have not developed into a Sri Lankan nation. That is because, Venerable Sir, the structure of the Sri Lankan State has not been inclusive. This is particularly so in regard to the indigenous Tamils who have raised issue with the Sri Lankan State in regard to their exclusion whenever it occurred and the instances have been numerous with serious import politically, socially, economically and culturally. The concept of Indian nationhood despite the multifaceted and rich diversity of the Indian people emerged not only from the ethos of the Indian freedom struggle under the unique leadership of the Great Mahatma but also from the Constitution of India evolved through the wisdom of its founding fathers which embraced all its peoples and was inclusive. We do not have a Constitution evolved on the basis of consensus amongst its different peoples signifying a sense of inclusiveness. The Soulbury Constitution of 1947 was a colonial enactment. The 1972 and 1978 Constitutions enacted by different governments which did away with the safeguards for minorities provided by the Soulbury Constitution were enacted without Tamil consensus, so as to exclude the Tamil people from a meaningful status in governance. This is the serious ailment that afflicts the countrys body politic. It is in this background, Venerable Sir, that I propose to examine the current Constitution-making efforts in this country. Let me start with President Mahinda Rajapaksa with whose steps we are now concerned. Let me first quote from the Mahinda Chintana under the caption Towards a New Sri Lanka and I quote from page 31, Sir, of this document which states as follows: AN UNDIVIDED COUNTRY, A NATIONAL CONSENSUS, AN HONOURABLE PEACE I am deeply convinced that we need to think from a fresh perspective and devise a new approach if we are to find a sustainable solution to the conflict in the North and the East. The violent conflict and the stalemate in the peace talks over the past years have gradually led to this issue progressing beyond the North and the East to engulf the entire country. Let me go on, Venerable Sir, and I want to state that after some months from that statement which I read, which was in November, 2005, President Mahinda Rajapaksa appointed the Parliamentary Representative Committee on Constitutional Reforms and the Panel of

Experts and he addressed the inaugural meeting of that body at the Presidential Secretariat on 11th July, 2006. In fact, the "Daily News" of 12th July, 2006 carried his speech under the heading Only alternative to peace is peace and this is what the President said, Sir, in the course of his address under the caption Unity, Territorial Integrity and Sovereignty." I quote:

The unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty of our country needs to be preserved. This cannot be open to bargain. Our approach has been widely endorsed by the international community and notably India and the Co-Chairs and have clearly ruled out any form of division of this country. Our objective must be to develop a just settlement within an undivided Sri Lanka. Each party represented here, has its own solution to the national question. We will discuss and synthesize these different approaches and develop our own Sri Lankan model. We must explore past attempts from the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayagam Pact onwards. We must draw appropriate lessons from the experience of other countries. I will not impose a solution on the country. But you will through your deliberations provide a solution to the national problem." This is what the President said, Venerable Sir, when he spoke at the inaugural meeting of that body. Then, Venerable Sir, under the heading "Devolution for the People by the People", the President in the course of his address stated, I further quote:

People in their own localities must take charge of their destiny and control their politico-economic environment. Central decision-making that allocates disproportionate resources has been an issue for a considerable time. In addition, it is axiomatic that devolution also needs to address issues relating to identity as well as security and socio-economic advancement, without over-reliance on the centre. In this regard, it is also important to address the question of regional minorities. In sum, any solution needs to as a matter of urgency devolve power for people to take charge of their own destiny. This has been tried out successfully in many parts of the world. There are many examples from around the world that we may study as we evolve a truly Sri Lankan constitutional framework including our immediate neighbour, India. So, he said, there are several models of several constitutions in many parts of the world including India which we can study. Under the heading Some concluding Thoughts the President said, I again quote: Any solution must be seen as one that stretches to the maximum possible devolution without sacrificing the sovereignty of the country given the background to the conflict. It therefore behoves on particularly the majority community to be proactive in striving for peace and there must be a demonstration of a well stretched hand of accommodation. Any solution must therefore address these expectations as well. The role of the Parliamentary Representative Committee as well as its Panel of Experts is to fashion creative options that satisfy the minimum expectations that I had enumerated earlier as well as provide a comprehensive approach to the resolution of the national question. In conclusion, I wish the Parliamentary Representative Committee and its Panel of Experts all success in their collective endeavour in formulating a political and constitutional framework for the resolution of the national question. It is imperative that the process moves speedily and effectively.

717 718

These were the words of the President, Venerable Sir, when he addressed that inaugural meeting and I thought it necessary to emphasize what he said in the context of what has happened subsequently. He wanted the APRC and the Panel of Experts to study the constitutional frameworks in other parts of the world including India. He wanted them to act on their own. He said he would not impose a solution. He said there must be the maximum possible autonomy and people must be in a position to control their own destiny in the territory in which they live.

Hon. Sampanthan, you may carry on please.

[.. 11.13 ] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Thank you Madam Chairperson. Those were, Madam, very encouraging words. Those were the words of a statesman, with a vision for his country and personally I was extremely happy when I read that speech; I preserved a copy of that speech and I am happy I have been able to place that speech before

Parliament today. I think, Madam, the President meant what he said on that occasion. Of course at that point of time, the international community were evincing great interest and were calling upon the Government to come up with a set of political proposals that would be a solution to the protracted ethnic conflict in this country and the President may have also have intended to reassure the international community that he was endeavouring honestly and genuinely through the APRC process and by appointing a Panel of Experts to assist them, evolve a solution that would be acceptable to all the people in this country and also the international community. The Panel of Experts, Madam, comprised of 16 persons. There were eleven Sinhalese, four Tamils and one Muslim and that Muslim gentleman was a very leading legal luminary in this country. The Experts Panel got on with their task. Eleven of them, six Sinhalese, four Tamils and the Muslim, submitted their report, we could call it the Majority Report; that was a multi- ethnic report. Three others, all Sinhalese, submitted their report and that was looked upon as a Minority Report. Two others, both of whom were Sinhalese made their observations on both the Majority and the Minority Reports. Their observations, at least in many areas or some areas, were an acceptance of the Majority Report. Eleven out of sixteen, also supported by two others in several or at least some areas, particularly given its multi-ethnic composition, constitutes a significant majority in any democracy. It were these reports, Madam, that resulted in the JVP which was a party to the APRC walking out of the exercise. A dialogue unfortunately does not find a place in the political programme of the JVP except in their own terms. I must state, Madam, that President Mahinda Rajapaksa certainly had no control over the actions of the JVP. The country knows about the MoU signed between the Government and the main Opposition Party, the UNP, the objective of which was to evolve a consensus on the national question. Such a consensus would have ensured a two-thirds majority in Parliament for the type of solution that the President outlined in the course of his inaugural address to the APRC and the Experts Panel and such an agreement between the Government and the main Opposition Party would have also ensured the required approval for any solution at a referendum in the country. Very unfortunately, the President by accommodating deserters from the UNP, for whatever reason, was prepared to sacrifice the Memorandum of Understanding signed with the UNP with all its attendant advantages and this, I think, was a singularly unfortunate event but history was repeating itself. I do not wish to go into the intricacies of this piece of political skulduggery but the President in my view could have saved the situation if he was prepared to stand tall above all others, if in fact he was truly focussed on a solution and looking at the issue from the point of view of the larger and long term interests of the country because the destiny of the country

[ . ]

2008 06 719 720

was at this time in his hands. Unfortunately that was not to be and the official UNP consequently dropped out of the APRC process. Meanwhile, the Chairman of the APRC, a Gentleman for whom I have the highest regard, was continuing with his efforts. He came up with his own report and the parties continued with their discussions at the APRC. It was at this point of time that the President's party, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party came up with its proposals, "A Unitary System of Government with the District as the Unit of Devolution". The basic features of the proposals outlined by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party before the APRC was indeed a far cry from what the President stated in his inaugural address to the APRC. He talked of maximum autonomy, genuine autonomy in keeping with models of governance in other parts of the world including India with people being able to determine their own destiny in the territories where they lived. So this was a far cry from what the President said in his inaugural address to the APRC and the Experts Panel, and I must state quite frankly the two positions that were outlined by the SLFP and by the President in the course of his inaugural address were irreconcilable. I might say with due respect, the President had plunged from the sublime to the ridiculous. There was no way in which the President could redeem himself thereafter. I must state that it was after this position of the SLFP before the APRC, that I for the first time commented on the APRC process and said that that process was as dead as a door nail. I was certain that after such proposals from the SLFP, the APRC could never take off. The Chairman and some of the parties continued to be at work. The process was delayed. The Budget became the cause of further delay. The JVP having walked out of the APRC wanted to wreck the APRC and it was extracting its pound of flesh. Small nationalist parties within the APRC encouraged by the SLFP proposals were meeting the President and complaining against some features that the Chairman of the APRC and some of the other parties were endeavoring to incorporate in the proposals. These meetings were taking place quietly on one side while the APRC was sitting - without the participation of all APRC Members - between some of the ultra-nationalist parties and the President. The international community had for long been insisting upon a credible set of devolution proposals that were sustainable. On Saturday the 12th of January, the Co-Chairs issued a statement in regard to this matter. I would like to read from that statement. It states, I quote: The Co - Chairs support a continued Norwegian role as facilitator. The Co-Chairs emphasize their belief that there is no military solution to the conflict in Sri Lanka, and reiterate their support for a negotiated settlement. Thus they urge the government of Sri Lanka to finalize a politically sustainable devolution plan; urge all parties to comply with their obligations under international law to protect civilians and allow access by humanitarian aid agencies to populations in need; express deep concern about the human rights situation and protection of civilians in

Sri Lanka, and call for continued monitoring of the human rights situation by such means as to assure an appropriate role for the U.N. and request the government of Sri Lanka to provide access to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in Kilinochchi for representatives of the Co-Chairs and the facilitator.

That was a comprehensive statement which dealt with the need for a set of political proposals outlining a sustainable devolution programme and also makes a special emphasis on the human rights situation on the question of humanitarian access to civilians who were victims of the conflict and in regard to access for the Co-Chairs and the facilitator to the LTTE in Kilinochchi.

This was the situation in which the President had to now deal with the nationalist parties maintaining a constant contact with him and with the SLFP having placed these proposals before the APRC. The President could not displease the nationalist parties. He fixed 23rd January as the date for the final report. He also had to make sure that the final report did not displease the nationalist parties. He had to fix a date to satisfy the international community that something has been done and it was in these circumstances that a stratagem had to be devised to extricate himself from the quandary he had landed himself in. He had all along endeavoured to impress upon the international community that he was genuinely committed to an acceptable political solution. The international community was insisting on results. He was not able to deliver because the nationalist parties would not permit him to go beyond his own party's proposals before the APRC and they were not prepared to accommodate or accept the proposals being made by the APRC Chairman and the other parties of the APRC. The only way that the President could devise was to ask the APRC to take its own time to finalize their own proposals and seek refuge in the outdated Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution which was already a part of the Constitution of Sri Lanka from 1987. It was 20 years old and the person who, at the inaugural meeting of the APRC wanted them to come up with something new, something in keeping with the pattern of devolution that prevailed in other countries the world over that would give the people the right to determine their own destiny in the territories where they lived; the person who talked about maximum devolution and the person who said, I will not impose a solution on the country, I leave it to you; you and the Panel of Experts can decide and submit your report, was compelled to seek refuge in something 20 years old, which had been in the Constitution for over two decades.

By this time the Ceasefire Agreement too had been abrogated by the Government and therefore, it was obligatory for the Government to do something or at least show that it was doing something and it was in these circumstances that the President sought refuge in the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Eighteen months of deliberations of the APRC with over 60

721 722

sittings and the Experts Panel Reports were not required for President Mahinda Rajapaksa to implement the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution which had been enacted in November, 1987. The Co-Chairs and the international community surely did not make their best efforts to achieve what already existed in the Constitution as a solution to the protracted conflict. For good measure, certain clauses in regard to the implementation of language provisions which had remained moribund for over two decades were also included. This was the pathetic state in which the President found himself and he had to somehow device some stratagem, some escape route. He had to seek refuge somewhere and he was able to do that when he sought refuge in the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The President had made his position very clear, Madam, in the Independence Day speech which he delivered on the 4th of February. I listened to him and I quote from the Daily News of 5th February, 2008 which gives its English translation, where he states: Our solution must be based on what could be implemented in this country. We cannot offer solutions that are experiments. We cannot experiment with solutions when so much blood has been shed and tens of thousands of lives have been lost. That is why we selected a solution which can be implemented and about which we have experience. This practical solution is to bring the provincial administration closer to the people within the framework of our Constitution. The President put the matter completely beyond doubt with this statement he made at the Independence Day celebrations which was a complete reversal of what the President said at the inaugural meeting of the APRC. He had completely reneged from the position taken up when he appointed the APRC and the Panel of Experts and that must be said, Madam, in a manner that admits of no doubt. I would like to examine what President Mahinda Rajapaksa said in his 2007 Independence Day speech and I quote from his speech which appeared in The Hindu of February 5, 2007. It states: The Sinhala people were ready for a political solution on the ethnic conflict. I wish to re-emphasize that I know that the Sinhala people in the South are ready for this. We are not ready to give into the bloodthirsty demands of the LTTE. However, at the minimum we should be reasonable and honest enough to agree with Mr. Anandasangaree or the Hon. Douglas Devananda. That is what the President said. He extended an invitation to us also on this Independence day to join with him but we are prepared to join people only when we can repose our faith and trust in them and when we are quite certain that they will keep their words. So, he on this occasion said that you must at least repose your faith in Anandasangaree and Douglas Devananda and you must

be able to satisfy them. What does Mr. Anandasangaree say in regard to a political solution? Mr. Anandasangaree addressed the final meeting of the APRC summoned in January and this is what Mr. Anandasangaree said. Though he is not a member of the APRC, he had been specially invited by the President and this is what he said. I quote: It is no secret that that we had been agitating for a solution based on the Federal concept. Federal concept ! .and also offered to accept the Indian Model as an alternative if the term federal is allergic to anyone. We have not changed our views in this matter and in the matter of merger of the North and the East. That is that the merger of the North and the East must continue. That is Anandasangarees position. He further goes on to say, Madam. I quote: We assure everybody that while spurning violence we will by non-violent means and in a friendly way continue to persuade the citizens of our country to agree that no permanent solution can be found under a Unitary System. This is what Anandasangaree says. What does Douglas Devananda say? I will quote, Madam, from an interview given by Mr. Douglas Devananda to The Sunday Times of 2nd of December 2007. He was asked: Q. Are you for the de-merger of the North and the East? A. The two provinces should be linked. We are for a united Sri Lanka within which the North-East should operate as one unit. That is our partys view. So, where does the President stand? Not merely had he gone back on what he said at the inaugural address when he addressed the APRC and the panel of experts, he had gone back completely on what his own Tamil supporters Anandasangaree and Douglas Devananda had been advocating and he is not able to even accommodate the views of these people. I also want to say this. While wanting to implement the Thirteenth Amendment, there is also a clear statement being made that the land powers and the police powers contained in the Thirteenth Amendment will not be given. The cause of the conflict has been that there has been grave injustice in certain areas and of those areas land and security have been vital. Those powers will not be given by a President who talked about maximum autonomy when he set up the APRC and he wanted the APRC to study other models in other parts of the world. I want to say a few words about the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, Madam. I want to make it very clear that the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution contemplates the North-East merger. It recognizes the North-East merger which had been a reality for 18 years and which had been acted upon by successive governments and successive Presidents

[ . ]

including the governments in which Mahinda Rajapaksa was both a Minister and Prime Minister. If the Thirteenth Amendment is to be implemented it can only be implemented in a merged North-East not in a separate North or in a separate East. That would be, in my submission, totally illegal; it will be immoral and it will be a fraud which nobody will accept. I want to make our position very clear in regard to that matter. I want to also say, Madam, that the Thirteenth Amendment did not drop from the sky. It emerged as a result of very lengthy discussions that took place between the J.R. Jayewardene Government in July and August, 1986 and the TULF. The Government was represented by President J. R. Jayewardene, Mr. Gamini Dissanayake, Mr. Lalith Athulath Mudali, Mr. Ronnie de Mel, Mr. A. C. S. Hameed, Mr. K. W. Devanayagam, Mr. Ranil Wickremasinghe and on the TULF side, there were Mr. Amirthalingam, Mr. Sivasithamparam, Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam, Mr. Yogeswaran, Mr. Anandasangaree off and on and myself. I was there regularly at every sitting. We had several discussions over several days, from 9 o clock in the morning to 6 o clock in the evening, for about 10 to 15 days in July and 10 to 15 days in August, 1986. That is how the Thirteenth Amendment emerged. Based on those discussions, President Jayewardene evolved something but, that was not acceptable to us. The moment he submitted this to the Cabinet, we went and met President Jayewardene on the 29th of September, 1987. A delegation comprising of Mr. Sivasithamparam, Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam, Mr. Yogeswaran and myself called on President Jayewardene and we told him that the draft which he had submitted to Cabinet was unacceptable, unworkable and we said that the Thirteenth Amendment must not be passed on those lines and we wrote to Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on the 28th of October, 1987. The letter was signed by Mr. Amirthalingam, the Secretary General of the TULF, Mr. Sivasithamparam, President of the TULF and by myself, R. Sampanthan, Vice-President of the TULF and former Member of Parliament for Trincomalee. All three of us signed this letter. It was sent to Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on the 28th of October, 1987. I table* the letter and want that to be included in Hansard. This is what we said in that letter, Madam. I quote:

We feel it our duty to also express our disappointment with the proposals to solve the Tamil problem contained in the two Bills - the 13th Amendment to the Constitution and the Provincial Councils Bill - presented to Parliament by the Sri Lankan Government. These proposals do not meet the aspirations of the Tamil people nor are in any way, commensurate with the loss of life, sufferings and privations suffered by the Tamil people. Since 1983, the T.U.L.F. has always negotiated with the Government of Sri Lanka directly, utilising the good offices of the Government of India, and through the Government of India in the hope of evolving a comprehensive scheme of devolution which the T.U.L.F could commend to the Tamil people.

The T.U.L.F. regrets it cannot recommend the contents of these Bills to the Tamil people as being satisfactory, just and durable. On the eve of your departure to Sri Lanka to sign the Agreement, we requested you among other things, that a team of experts from India along with their counterparts from Sri Lanka draft the necessary legislation. You agreed that this was a reasonable request. Now the legislation is sought to be foisted on us without any Indian expert playing a part in the drafting. The T.U.L.F. expected all along that a copy of the draft legislation would be made available to the Government of India at some reasonable time before it was made public. Apprehending that this might not happen, a delegation of the T.U.L.F. met President Jayewardene on the 29th of September 1987 and made this formal request. We regret that the Bills were gazetted without being made available to the Government of India. This is not merely cavalier treatment of India but a clear breach of para 2.15 of the Agreement which states inter-alia that 'residual matters shall be resolved between India and Sri Lanka'. The Bills are certainly not the result of any such resolution. This was contained in the letter we sent to the Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on 28th October, 1987. The Bills were passed in that way but at the same time, I want to say that consequent to our representations to the Government of India, President Jayewardene who had gone to Kathmandu for a SAARC Conference in November, 1987 was requested to come over to Delhi on his return from the Kathmandu SAARC Conference. Mr. Amirthalingam, Mr. Sivasithamparam and myself, the three of us were requested by the Indian Government to be present in Delhi at that time, where extensive discussions took place between the Government of India, the officials and President Jayewardene and his team and between the President and the Prime Minister of India. There were 13 matters on which President Jayewardene agreed to make improvements to the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. I was present in Delhi when those discussions took place. We were in touch with the Indian officials and we know exactly what happened. But those 13 amendments were never brought about. That is the truth, Madam. In fact, on the morning that we left for New Delhi, I and my Colleagues Mr. Amirthalingam and Mr. Sivasithamparam met with Mr. Natwar Singh who was the then State Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Union Government of New Delhi and Shri Kuldip Sahadev who was the Joint Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and we were told, we - meaning the Government of India - have a firm commitment from the President to make the improvements to the Thirteenth Amendment. Mr. Kuldip Sahadev butted in and said, We have the commitment in writing. That is the reality. We did not contest the elections under the Provincial Councils. We refused to contest because we said that the Thirteenth Amendment is not workable and will never be a success. That is the position, Madam, with regard to the Thirteenth Amendment. Please forget it. Please dump it. We will not touch it with the wrong end of a barge pole. I want to make the Tamil position very clear on the Floor of this House. You might get hold of some quislings, some mercenaries, whom you are now

* . . Produced at end of speech.

cultivating in the Eastern Province to contest elections on your behalf. But do not think you can fool the Tamil people. The Tamil people since 1956 have historically delivered certain verdicts at every election where they have stood for genuine autonomy, genuine self rule in the areas of our historical habitation, in keeping with what the President said in the course of his inaugural address to the APRC and the Panel of Experts - ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Madam, I can go on till 12.10 p.m. and I have requested the Chief Opposition Whip to give me five more minutes. I will finish soon. I will not take your time. In regard to the international community, Mr. P. Chidambaram, the Minister of Finance for India, and Mr. Richard Boucher, the Under-Secretary of the United States for South Asia when they were here recently and the Co-chairs have talked about the type of political solution, of radical changes in the structure of Government, genuine autonomy, which would give the people, the Tamils and the Muslims the right of self rule in the areas in which they have historically lived. I have quoted those statements in Parliament. They are in Hansard. Your Thirteenth Amendment is not anywhere close to what the international community has contemplated. Therefore, please do not try to fool anybody; please, do not try to fool yourselves. You will not be in a position to work the Thirteenth Amendment. Forget it and come clean. Think of something which people can accept. Before I conclude, Madam, I think I must read certain answers given by the Chairman of the APRC, the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana, in an interview he has given to "The Nation" newspaper of Sunday, 3rd February. It states, I quote: "Q: Your credibility is at stake after the President forced you to implement something that was never discussed at the APRC under your chairmanship. What is your comment? A: I would have preferred very much if this question of the 13th Amendment implementation had not come up till we finalized our main report. But considering the fact that this was an unforeseen development, and the fact that the Executive President of the country, the person who set up both the APC and the APRC, requested that the APRC immediately addressed what he felt was a pressing need, I as the chairman, together with the rest of the APRC, had little option but to accede to his request. So, it was an imposition by the President, in the words of the APRC Chairman. They merely acceded to the request of the President.

He goes on to say, I quote: If the whole exercise was something which I was doing as a Member of my party the LSSP, or together with a few other like minded political parties, then I could have acted differently. But under the circumstances I hope the people of Sri Lanka as well as those abroad who are interested in the future of our country will understand the circumstances which have led me to follow the course that the APRC has now taken. There is another question, Madam, which was asked from him and which he answered. I think, I should read it very quickly. It states, I quote: "Q: How do you interpret President Rajapaksas suggestion to delay the whole process? He wanted the process delayed. "A: The President had laid a certain deadline in January for handing over to him the final set of proposals that the APRC had been developing over the last one and a half years. But later he indicated to us that the 13th Amendment was sufficient for him to act in the interest of winning over the Tamil-speaking people, That is, his quislings in Batticaloa, nobody else. .and also to convince the international community of his commitment to a political solution to the people, and therefore we could take our time over the main set of proposals which he would be ready to receive. Q: It is also learnt that the President had requested you to keep out land and police powers , which he confirms in the course of his answer. So, what are you doing? Whom are you fooling? If you think you are fooling the Tamil people, you are sadly mistaken. Our people will never be fooled. If you think you are fooling the international community, you are sadly mistaken. The international community has clearly laid out the contours of a political settlement - what can be the solution to the problem. You are fooling yourselves. That is the most pathetic part. Before I conclude, Madam, I would like to read a very short comment made by Mr. Rajmohan Gandhi, a very distinguished journalist and author, and a statesperson in India, the grandson of Mahatma Gandhi and also the grandson of C. Rajagopalachari, who was the first Chief Minister of Madras Presidency and also the first Governor-General of India. He is the grandson of two very distinguished people. He was asked in the course of a recent interview which he gave and which has appeared in "The Sunday Leader" of 3rd February. It states, I quote: "Q: What lessons do you think Sri Lanka can learn from the asymmetrical devolution model now in place in India?" The answer he gave was this. It is a long answer; I will not read the whole answer, but I will read the relevant paragraph. He said, I quote: If autonomy is genuine it will work. But if an offer of autonomy is mainly a faade

[ . ]

2008 06 727 728

That is what you are trying with the Thirteenth Amendment - a facade, a deceptive exercise and unworthy of any credibility. He goes on to say, I quote: But if an offer of autonomy is mainly a faade it will not work, but if the majority groups and now Im speaking globally of all countries, if governments are willing to give genuine autonomy to distinct groups that can go a long way, but it has to be a genuine offer, and it has to be an offer supported by the people of the majority group as well, not just the political parties. At this point of time, Madam, I have not the slightest doubt in my mind that the vast majority of the Sinhala people in this country are prepared to give the Tamil people a reasonable solution. I am not prepared to be guided by the thinking of some ultra-nationalist groups that have managed to come to this House in recent times. The majority - the Government - the SLFP - and the UNP can come together and if there is genuine autonomy, there can be a solution to the conflict in this country, which will be accepted by both the Sinhalese people and the Tamil people. Therefore, before I conclude I want to make a final appeal to you: instead of trying your dirty tricks - stop this game of playing dirty tricks, come clean, be candid, be honest, be genuine, be straightforward - come up with a solution that would really be a solution to this conflict which has caused much human suffering to all people in this country. I thank you, Madam. * : : Letter tabled :

XXV Our disappointment with proposals contained in the two Bills 28th Oct. 87 Shri RAJIV GANDHI, Prime Minister of India, NEW DHLHI. Dear Prime Minister, We thank you once again for all four efforts on behalf of the Tamil people. We repeat our deep anguish at the tragic turn of events in Jaffna. We feel it our duty to also express our disappointment with the proposals to solve the Tamil problem contained in the two Bills-the 13th. Amendment to the constitution and the provincial Councils Bill-

presented to Parliament by the Sri-Lankan Government. These proposals do not meet the aspirations of the Tamil people nor in any way, commensurate with the loss of life, sufferings and privations suffered by the Tamil people. Since 1983, the T.U.L.F., has always negotiated with the Government of Sri Lanka directly, utilizing the good offices of the Government of India, and through the Government of India in the hope of evolving a comprehensive scheme of devolution which the T.U.L.F. could commend to the Tamil people. The T.U.L.F. regrets it cannot recommend the contents of these Bills to the Tamil people as being satisfactory, just and durable. On the eve of your departure to Sri Lanka to sign the Agreement, we requested you among other things, that a team of experts from India along with their counterparts from Sri Lanka draft the necessary legislation. You agreed that this was a reasonable request. Now the legislation is sought to be foisted on us without any India expert playing a part in the drafting. The T.U.L.F. expected all along that a copy of the draft legislation would be made available to the Government of India at some reasonable time before it was made public. Apprehending that this might not happen, a delegation of the T.U.L.F. met President Jayewardene on the 29th of September 1987 and made this formal request. We regret that the Bills were gazetted without being made available to the Government of India. This is not merely cavalier treatment of India but a clear breach of para 2.15 of the Agreement which states inter-alia that residual matters shall be resolved between India and Sri Lanka. The Bills are certainly not the result of any such resolution. We do not wish to burden you with a detailed analysis of the Bills. But please permit us to draw your attention to some important matters.

1. Single Administrative Unit. After a great deal of persuasion, you got President Jayewardene to agree to one administrative unit of the Northern and Eastern provinces as now constituted having one elected Provincial Council, one Governor, one Chief Minister and one Board of Ministers. The continuance of such a unit was to be subject to a referendum in the Eastern Province by 31st December 1988, which could be postponed by the President. We objected to such a referendum and we believed that it would eventually never be held.

The provisions of the Bills have made this political arrangement of such importance to the Tamils a farce. The setting up of a single administrative unit is to be done by an executive act of the President, in the form of a mere proclamation, which can always be revoked, and this too has to depend on the President being satisfied on a number of imponderables. It was the Tamil expectation that a single administrative unit of the Northern and Eastern Provinces, would be firmly created by an adequate constitutional Provision. The Provision in Section 154 of the 13th Amendment, however, is of a dubious nature, and could be interpreted to

729 730

mean that a perpetual power is vested in Parliament to legislate on this all important matter. The resulting position would be that a single administrative unit of the Northern and Eastern Provinces, even when finally established would be an impermanent arrangement. 2. Legislative and Executive Power All parties to the negotiations have always understood that the powers to be devolved to the Provincial Council will be the same as those enjoyed by a State in India with suitable adaptations. This was to be particularly so in the field of legislative and executive power. During the discussions between the Sri Lankan Government and the T. U. L. F. in July/August 1986, it was agreed that the Legislative Power of the Province in respect of Provincial subjects would be near absolute, and that the Governor would be a ceremonial head, with his discretionary powers clearly defined. The Bills retain the power of Parliament to amend or repeal the chapter pertaining to Provincial Councils, and the Lists of Subjects, and also the power of Parliament to legislate even on subjects transferred to Provincial Councils, by a 2/3 rds. Majority, and the approval of the people of the whole country at a referendum. This would indeed be a simple exercise in Sri Lanka, where the majority community constitutes 74% of the population. In the field of executive power, the Executive Power of the President is sought to be retained by providing that the Governor shall hold office in accordance with Article 4(b), which provides that executive power of the people shall be exercised by the President of the Republic, through the wide and undefined discretionary powers of the Governor, which according to Section 154F (2) have to be exercised on the Presidents directions; and through powers exercisable on the Proclamation of an emergency on very wide grounds. It would be relevant to recall that between 1970 and 1987, Sri Lanka has been under Emergency Rule for more than ten years. The Sri Lankan Government has declined to accept the T. U. L. F.s persistent demand that the Indian pattern pertaining to the proclamation of emergency be followed. Not merely have the justiciablity of Proclamations of Emergency and Break down of Constitutional Machinery been specifically denied, power has even been vested with the President, to make Emergency Regulations with respect to any matter set out in the Provincial Council List, or having the effect of overriding amending or suspending the operation of a statute made by the Provincial Council. Vide Article 155 (3A). These Provisions were never accepted by the T. U. L. F. - some of them were not even proposed to the T. U. L. F. and we are certain that these provisions have not been accepted by India. During discussions with the T. U. L. F., the Sri Lankan Government indicated that the number of Ministers of the Province should not exceed one-third the total number of members. The North Eastern Province would have seventy one members. The T. U. L. F.s proposal was that the number of Ministers should not exceed one-fifth the total number of Members. The number of Ministers has now been restricted to four. This has been done with the ulterior motive of promoting discord amongst the different peoples of the Northern and Eastern Provinces, and so as to diminish the importance of the Provincial Council and hamper and impede efficient Provincial Government.

3. Lists of Subjects Though it was clearly understood that the lists of Subjects would substantially conform to the Indian pattern, the Concurrent List has been heavily loaded, and the Provincial List clearly starved. Subjects such as Fisheries other than beyond Territorial Waters, Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Industries, Redemarcation including creation of Districts,

Assistant Government Agents Divisions, and Grama Sevaka Divisions Restoration, reconstruction of destroyed towns. Villages, properties, compensation or relief to persons who have sustained loss or damage Palmyrah plantation and Palmyrah Industry, coconut plantation and industry related thereto, the ownership management and control of State-owned industrial enterprises within the Province dependant wholly or mainly on raw materials found in the Province (recommended by the Political Parties Conference) Co-operative Banks, Prisons, Provincial Public Service, Provincial Public Services Commission, Local Government . Nice, Inquiries, Surveys and Statistices for any of the purposes in the Provincial List and such others have not been included in the Provincial list, in keeping with the discussions held with the T. U. L. F. on the basis of the Indian pattern. In the field on Education, the powers of the Provincial Council are substantially curtailed even in the matter of secondary Education. Both the Conscurrent and Reserve lists have been so framed as to minimize to the maximum possible extent, the scope and content of the Provincial Councils powers. 4. Land and land Settlement On the all important subject of Land and land Settlement, Appendix - II in the Bill is in many respects even worse than the Appendix attached to the proposals of 23rd September 1986 which itself was substantially deficient. The following matters are clearly unacceptable :- (i) The inclusion of State Land in the Reserve List, (ii) The reference to State Land continuing to be vested in the Republic, and the power of disposition by the President, (iii) The denial of the right to the Province, though land is a devolved subject, of the ipso-facto use of State Land for devolved subjects, (iv) The restriction of the right of the Province to administer and control only such land as is made available to it, (v) The stipulation that the alienation and disposition of State Land within a Province to any citizen or organization shall be by the President in accordance with Laws governing the matter contrary to even existing procedures for alienation, (vi) The wide definition given to Inter Provincial Irrigation and Land Development Projects, the principle of the National Ethnic Ratio in such projects, the right given to the Government of Sri Lanka to determine the selection of allottees for such lands, designedly to perpetuate the present pernicious practices, (vii) The failure to properly formulate the principle of the Cumulative Entitlement of the Tamil speaking people in Schemes under the Mahaweli Project in the Eastern Province, and the failure to Incorporate with Appendix - II the Annexure on settlement in the Eastern Province under the Mahaweli Project. The above are clearly directed towards reducing the Provincial Council to the position of a Nonentity in respect of State Land even though Land is a developed subject, and enabling the Central Government to have dominant power over State land. Ample scope is also retained for the continued colonization of the Northern and Eastern Provinces with members of the majority community. Such a position would be completely contrary to the discussions held with the T. U. L. F. and is totally different from the Indian pattern where Land Colonization etc., is a State subject with no power whatever reserved to the Union. The Tamils can never accept any settlement which does not satisfactorily resolve the burning question of State Land. The Land Settlement programmes carried out by the Sri Lankan Government in the post Agreement period have been a major destabilizing factor and do not inspire any confidence whatever in the Tamils.

2008 06 731 732

5. Trincomalee Port The subject of Ports has been included in the reserve list and the Trincomalee Port as a Major Port would come under central control. Annexure C specifically provided that A Port Authority under the Central Government will be set up for administrating the Trincomalee Port and Harbour. The area which will come under the administration of the Port Authority as well as the powers to be assigned to it will be further discussed. This matter was raised with the Sri Lanka Government and though apparently certain assurances were given the Bills do not contain any provision reflecting such assurances. Tamil apprehensions are greatly aggravated by the fact that in 1984 after the finalization of Annexure C an extent of 5150 acres of land around the Trincomalee Port was vested in the Port Authority, which could result in the creation of a new Township with racial overtones around the Port, and be the cause for prolonged conflict. The manner of recruitment to employment in the Port since 1983 and the facilities provided to such employees clearly indicate this trend. The T. U. L. F. had given the Indian negotiators comprehensive paper dealing with this subject. It is essential that this matter too be resolved in an acceptable manner. 6. Provincial Public Service.

The provisions in respect to the Provincial Public Service and the Provincial Public Service Commission have been included in the Provincial Councils Bill contrary to the Sri Lankan Governments draft proposals for the amendment of the constitution of 23rd September 1986 which categorically stated Provision regarding Provincial Public Service to be included. The appointment, transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control of Provincial Public Servants being vested in the Governor who is subject to Presidential directions is contrary to the proposal made by the T.U.L.F. that the provisions of Article 55 which vests the appointment, transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control of Public Officers in the Cabinet of Ministers be made mutatis - mutandis applicable. This together with the omission of the subjects of the Provincial Public Service and the Provincial Public Service Commission from the Provincial List, suggest that the Provincial Public Service will not function under the executive control of the Provincial Board of Ministers. Effective Provincial Government would be an impossibility in this situation. Contrary to the belief that the chapter pertaining to Provincial Councils would confer on the Provinces a measure of credible sutonomy without derogating from the entrenched clauses in the constitution, the present Bills at every turn, enable Parliament and the Central Executive, to extend its tentacles into the Provincial sphere circumscribing and emasculating the exercise of even the powers conferred on the Province. 7. Tamil as official Language and matters relating to the Central Government. The provisions in Clause 2 of the 13th Amendment making tamil also an Official Language has been nullified by paragraph (4) which states that Parliament shall by law provide for the implementation of the provisions of this Chapter. In relation to Sinhala as the Official Language, the Constitution provides for the manner of its use. The same constitutional provisions should be made applicable to tamil also as an official Language. Besides these there are other matters regarding the rights of the Tamils in relation to the Central Government which have to be discussed and resolved. In view of the above we earnestly request you to ask President Jayewardene not to proceed with the two Bills in Parliament in the present form till the matters referred to herein, are discussed and resolved to the satisfaction of the Tamil people. We request that we be granted an early appointment to discuss these matters more fully with you.

With kind regards,

( - ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama - Minister of Foreign Affairs)

Madam Chairperson, I consider it a great pleasure to speak on the Emergency Debate at a time when we are confronted on one side, with an escalation of targeting civilians in our country by the terrorists and on the other, when we have announced political proposals that could address this national question. The Hon. R. Sampanthan took great pains to explain this issue. I did listen to the Hon. Members lengthy speech. In a way, it was encouraging to note that today a dialogue has got started however much there is dissatisfaction. There is still hope that by having a dialogue, we could address the fundamental issues that have been confronting us. The Government of Sri Lanka, led by President Rajapaksa, has made a beginning towards addressing the national question, which has protracted over several decades and on which the late President Jayewardene, in spite of having a five-sixths majority in the House, failed to fully implement the Constitution in a pragmatic manner.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Why did you break the MoU with the UNP? ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

You wait. I did not disturb you.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

If you did not break the MoU with the UNP, you would have had a two - thirds majority in Parliament.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

From when have you started speaking for the UNP? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

Why did you break that MoU? ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

I will come to the bare facts. Let me respond, Hon. Member. The MoU between the UNP and the SLFP, the main constituent party in the Government led by President

5 PL 002898 (2008/03)

733 734

Rajapaksa, is independent of all these issues. If the UNP is willing to support this process, they are always welcome to do so. Our Government has opened doors for everybody, including the TNA, to come on board to address this issue in a practical and pragmatic manner. Dogmatism is something we have to say, "no" to.

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran)

They did not invite us for the APRC.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama)

Okay. ( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) The President never invited the TNA for the APRC. Do you know that? ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) We are always willing to do so. - [Interruption.] The APRC is still sitting. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please do not disturb him. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Let me reply you. The APRC is still sitting; the APC is still there and you are welcome to be there tomorrow. I will communicate your willingness. - [Interruption.] You must come to the APC. Why are you not coming? Why are you not making your submissions known and why do you not want to be a part of the solution rather than a part of the problem? We do not want to hear the LTTE's voice in this Chamber in terms of - ( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) Ha, ha! ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) I know your restrictions; I know your limitations. - [Interruption.] I know you are being led not by the people's will - [Interruption.] I am posing this question to you. - [Interruption.] You are being led by the fascist terrorists who are dictating to you.

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) You answer the questions raised by the Hon. Sampanthan. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Every time we come out with a solution, this happens. - [Interruption.] How can we satisfy the blood-thirst of the LTTE? - [Interruption.] Hon. Presiding Member, I will be taking more time from the Opposition. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please allow the Hon. Minister to speak. ( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) Why do not answer the questions? ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) I am answering the questions. One question was, why were you not invited for the APC? Right now, the Government is willing to invite the TNA to be a part of the APC. - [Interruption.] Come and present your submissions to the APC. After all, this is part of democracy. - [Interruption.] ( ) (An Hon. Member) The LTTE will not allow them to come. ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) You come and show us what your proposals are. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . . . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Your Government comes up with the proposal of a unitary Constitution with the district as the unit of devolution and insists on that position. Today you have virtually come up with something called the Thirteenth Amendment, which is twenty years old and now you want us to come to the APRC. Are we a bunch of donkeys to come there?

[ ]

2008 06 735 736

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Let me answer. Hon. Member, as far as you are not a part of the Tigers, you can always be a part of this process.- [Interruption.] A donkey is more respectable. That is more decent than the blood-thirsty Tigers. Having said that, I will continue to respond to the Hon. Sampanthan because he articulated where the Government has failed; where President Jayewardene and the subsequent Governments in power for the last twenty years failed. That was the crux of his submission before the House this morning. I welcome that because the history must be spoken about. Otherwise, we would not learn lessons from past experiences for the present and the future. What did our President when addressing the APC at the time of the handing over of the APRC Proposals say? He said, "The political issues have to be addressed politically and this is the beginning of that process". This is the beginning of that process. The APRC has not stopped its deliberations. They continued to hold two subsequent meetings after handing over the APRC Proposals for the full implementation of the Constitution. Do you expect a newly-born infant to walk before he could crawl? Twenty years have passed since that Amendment got into the Constitution of our country. There was no political will or political direction for its proper implementation. Why are we hiding behind the myth that we can deliver something more substantial? Is the House in agreement to implement whatever we decide in terms of our own expectations, the expectations of this country? There are stages one has to go by and the process has to take its course. That is the course we have taken with practicality and pragmatism in a pluralistic, democratic society. It is unfortunate that today two districts are being dictated by terrorists who have no respect for human life. Children going to school, children going for sports have to lay their lives because there is this madness in the country with suicide cadres mobilized by the LTTE seeking a fascist regime. Who is speaking for those children? Would anyone stand up for them? It is sad when it happens. Even the UNP is not ready to vote for the extension of the Emergency. Abstaining is the easiest thing to do. Here is a country that needs salvation, liberation from the terrorist clutches. Scourge of terrorism has gone on too long in this country and I am happy to state today that the international community has come together to endorse the proposals that we have presented. I and Mr. Richard Boucher, the Under-Secretary, spoke on the 4th over the telephone. I must be happy to state here now that I am responding because you named Mr. Boucher, the Under-Secretary of the United States State Department, by name. And, what did he say? He said, This is a good beginning and make it happen. Yes, that is what we are going to make happen. And we are going to implement it, rather than being jittery, what we have got in our hands. This is where every

consecutive government failed. You could not find answers why governments previously failed though you said so. There were more expectations that you generated out of President Jayewardene. Yes, people can make submissions; people can listen to submissions; people can agree with the submissions but there is the divide in terms of implementation against acceptance. This is what has happened. This is where the TNA failed; the TULF failed in spite of all your great efforts and your leadership. We did value the efforts of the Tamil leadership in our country. In a pluralistic society we can always discard what we cannot agree with because there has to be pluralistic democratic traditions and principles that we are all committed to as enshrined in our Constitution. It is from that angle that we are looking at it. Today, some may say that the LTTE is now escalating violence because there is no CFA in force. As the Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka I must ask, "Were there no violations when the CFA was in force? How many people had to lay down their lives because of the terrorists attacks? Did the Dambulla attack on the bus, the Nugegoda attack, the Slave Island attack, the Kebithigollewa attack I and II and all other attacks that targeted the civilians of our country take place after the annulment of the CFA or before? The answer to that is, the LTTEs frustration getting escalated due to the successes of the military because today we are attacking the targets of the LTTE not the civilians like what happened in the past. We are very careful to see that the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the country is protected through professionally-handled military operations in the conflict areas. We have to disarm the people who are carrying arms. We have to get the essence of the democracy established in all parts of our country. Today the frustration of the LTTE is that we have overtaken the LTTE in terms of democratic approaches; the political issues have now surfaced and they are being addressed by the Government of Sri Lanka through political means. And that is how the APRC Proposals came out, and India along with the other countries have come to endorse it as the beginning of the right direction for the country to move. That is the beginning and that is the right direction. That is why the LTTE is getting further frustrated and isolated in the international community and amongst their own community in Sri Lanka. The LTTE diaspora, the Tamil diaspora who believed in a reasonable solution is being canvassed by the Government of Sri Lanka today and the Foreign Ministry is doing its best in order to penetrate the international Tamil diaspora with our communications to them and they are being well-received. In fact, today I am happy to state in this House that we have started sending communications from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Tamil population living both in Sri Lanka and abroad stating what we do and what we stand for as a country. This is what we termed as the re-launch of the Nambikkai. I will send you a copy of this

737 738

newsletter, Hon. Sampanthan. These are what we have to reach out to because the Tamil people are part of this country. The Tamils who live abroad are also part of this country. They are the ones who have been dictated and subjugated by the LTTE wherever they live. Their children have been made to be suicide cadres giving their lives for a fascist dictator, Prabhakaran who had terrorized this country and taken the terror across the shores of Sri Lanka, even to India, becoming the mercenary today in other locations where terrorism is fostering. This is the challenge we have taken upon ourselves; this is the challenge we are addressing. This is why we are inviting the TNA and I am glad that you have responded well. You have a role to play in the political process of our country. That role is very much there for the democratically-elected Members coming from the TNA. Do not be part of the dictation that comes from the LTTE. Do not be the voice of the LTTE. Be the voice of the Tamil community; be part of that agenda. That is why we have a respect for Mr. Anandasangaree. Why did he subscribe to the proposals that have come from the APRC? Why did he say this is a good beginning? Because he has studied all the proposals that came up for the last 30 years in this country unable being delivered. Here is a Government that has come to deliver. That is the difference between delivering and unable to deliver and causing frustration to the people of this country, not one community but all communities. People today need peace, sustainable peace. This is not a gimmick to reach sustainable peace in our country. Why have we demonstrated in the Eastern Province of our country since its liberation numbering three districts? Today we have started the recruitment of the police from the Tamil-speaking people and the Tamil community. How many members have joined the recruitment drive of the police in the Eastern Province today? We want to empower the people of their security, their rights to be protected, in terms of their wherewithal, their properties, their livelihood, generation of income and above all, bring prosperity to all regions of our country. Where was the distribution of Sri Lankas GDP concentrated? It concentrated in the South as the other locations were not accessible to people who wanted to go and make investment because the LTTE stopped that, prevented that. I know it so well having been the Minister of Industries five or six years ago. Still we could not take development to the Eastern and the Northern Provinces because of the LTTE's dictation that they did not want any development activities to take place in spite of the CFA signed by the then Prime Minister, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe at that time. That was the dictation that came on us; they wanted to dictate to the people. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , .

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) , .

That is the process that we are following and want everyone in the polity of Sri Lanka to be part of, and the international community is watching this development with great expectation and hope; the hope being that for the first time the Government of Sri Lanka has been able to deliver something that has got into our Constitution but unable to be implemented. To deliver what is unable to be implemented is a new beginning. Once again I state that what has got into our Constitution that has been jointly formulated is what we have to address with pragmatism.

Terrorism has to be countered and President Mahinda Rajapaksa went on to state that terrorism has to be countered whilst addressing political issues politically. This is the process that we follow and our two-pronged approach for Sri Lanka in the year 2008 is aimed at achieving security for our people and this is where we need the condemnation of the LTTE for all the atrocities that they are committing on the lives of our people. When the corpses of the children are brought to their homes, what kind of a pathetic state are the households in all parts of Sri Lanka plunged into? This is the answer that we have to jointly find. This is the process that we have to advocate in terms of getting support from all quarters of Sri Lanka towards the proper implementation of this process.

Once we hold elections in the Eastern Province, another proposal will come from the APRC. Proposals have to be implemented and elections are to be won. Shortly there will be elections in the Eastern Province that will enshrine what we have said here and the implementation process will begin. It is important that we come together in this drive. Divided, you are only supporting the LTTE and I know that all the respectable Members of the TNA will be part of this drive in order to support your people, the people who have great expectations of you and not the fascist terrorists who have a thirst for a separatist movement purely for the survival of their operations and thrive for further atrocities and brutality towards the civilized society of Sri Lanka. Therefore, I think all parties across the Divide must join and support the Government at this endeavour to realize the expectations of our people.

Thank you, Madam.

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Mr. Presiding Member, when we, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, decided to disengage from the Government and when we resigned our portfolios, I made

749 750

a very clear statement in this House as to the future course of action of our party. We made it very clear that though we were compelled to leave the Government for very cogent and clear reasons which I elaborated in my speech that day, on the 12th of December, before the Third Reading Vote on the Budget, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress' conduct in the Opposition would be quite independent and that we would always consider conditional support to the Government looking at the conduct of affairs in their administration. I must also say, Sir, that the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress has had a very consistent policy when it came to voting on occasions such as the extension of the Emergency in this country. When I say "a consistent policy", I must say that we, be it in the Government or the Opposition, have continued to lend our support to the extension of the Emergency, looking at the issue in a very dispassionate and a rational manner to ensure national security as well as specific safeguards and guarantees for the community that we represent. Having said that, Sir, I must very clearly outline here that the recent events in this country - the indiscriminate attacks on civilians on both sides of the divide - have caused a lot of concern for the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress. We are indeed considering very dispassionately once again as to what we should do in this Vote today. We had a discussion with our Members of Parliament and we must say that we are constrained for specific reasons today to symbolically vote against the Emergency for the way in which this Government is using the cover of Emergency to deny the democratic rights of the other political parties, particularly in the background of elections in the Eastern Province - for nine local authorities in the Batticaloa District. But we do agree that there is a very alarming situation in the South with indiscriminate attacks on civilians, on one side and on the other, with a war situation in the North where there are a large number of casualties both on the side of the armed forces and even among civilians. We condemn attacks on innocent civilians, be it in the territories where the Government's writ runs or where the Government's writ does not run. As a political party which has taken an enormous risk in deciding to contest the Local Authority Elections in the Eastern Province despite the prevalent insecure conditions in those areas, we must very clearly remind this Government that if not for the participation of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, the already affected credibility of this Election by the non-participation of major parties like the United National Party and, of course, the Tamil National Alliance, which has a bigger stake in those nine Local Authorities than the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, would be almost nil. But yet, we decided to contest for specific reasons - we are not prepared to allow this Government to plunder the votes of our people by their intimidation, harassment and with the patronage of the

armed groups which are allowed to contest as the quislings of this Government. We have seen the kind of agreements that the UPFA Government has entered into with certain groups which, in our opinion, were responsible for abducting even Members of Parliament in order to prevent them from casting their votes in this very House. And today, they are happily contesting together under one list for the Batticaloa Municipal Council.

In that situation, we must again point out that our participation in the All Party Representative Committee too should not be misconstrued as if we are lending support to a very duplicitous exercise. It is quite apparent that the President wanted the APRC to comply with his own dictates. But the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress made it very clear that if the President wanted to implement the Thirteenth Amendment, he does not need to get a stamp of approval from the All Party Representative Committee. The purpose of the All Party Representative Committee was something else and we very clearly made it known in the deliberations of the APRC as well as at discussions before the President that the deliberations of the APRC must be separated from the report that was submitted to the President. Though our representatives signature is there, that should not be seen as an endorsement of the way in which this Government wants to interfere with the affairs of the All Party Representative Committee. We have been part of many such committees in the past. We have participated in those discussions with many reservations. But we did not want to allow successive Governments to use those processes to hoodwink the minorities in this country as well as the international community. This has been a continuous pattern. Therefore, we must make it very clear.

The Hon. Dew Gunasekara is present. The Hon. Sampanthan, in his speech, very clearly quoted the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharanas own dilemma and his predicament expressed in his own words, that he was virtually pressurized to present a report endorsing the Thirteenth Amendment as a solution. It was meant to be implemented as an interim measure. But, alas, it was an interim measure even without important devolutionary aspects such as land and police powers. So, this is not something that we wanted. This is what the President wished that we should have and unfortunately, some in the international community appear to be, in my opinion, talking in parables about the virtues of the All Party Representative Committee and its deliberations. Having said that, Mr. Presiding Member, let me not delve too much into that subject since there would be another opportunity, may be in the coming debates where I could deal with the subject of devolution and our attitude to devolution. With those comments, I would like to move on to say a few words in Tamil about the current security situation in the Eastern Province and the conduct of elections in the Batticaloa District.

[.. 1.40] ( )

( - , ) (The Hon. Dew Gunasekara -Minister of Constitutional Affairs and National Integration) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, in view of the time factor, I wish to make a brief intervention in English. Since 1983, almost as a ritual, uninterruptedly we are called upon to come before you to seek approval of this august Assembly for the extension of the Emergency. It is

our fervent hope and equally the expectation of the people of our country to see an end to the extension of this Emergency. We are meeting here today in the context of a growing demand from our people as well as the people in the world over for termination of war, a political solution to the national question and restoration of unity, sovereignty, integrity and peace to the country and to its people. However, we witnessed in the past few weeks once again, an escalation of violence causing death to civilians - the most innocent, the weakest, the most helpless, children, women and elderly women - and destruction in the most ruthless manner. This was nothing but a calculated attempt on the part of the LTTE, in my view, to provoke a backlash from the civilian people in the South in its desperate position. We have witnessed this pattern of violence in the past as well. I take this opportunity on behalf of the Communist Party of Sri Lanka to express our deep indignation and condemnation with all vehemence of these atrocities. The only way how the civilian people should respond in these circumstances is by not falling prey to the strategies and tactics of the LTTE, namely provocation of the people. Sir, it is our appeal to the people to let the security forces handle the situation. I repeat on the Floor of this House once again that there are basically two decisive factors which have led to the prolongation of this catastrophe. Firstly, due to the intransigence and the belligerence of the LTTE, they are neither prepared to abandon their Eelam project nor are they prepared to opt for an alternative solution. The history of 25 years testifies their unchanged position. That is why all talks for a negotiated settlement finally ended, failed. Secondly, the absence of a consensus between the two major parties parties in the country - the SLFP and the UNP - have missed so many opportunities in arriving at a consensus for finding a solution to this problem. Other extremist factors that cause hindrance or impediment to a solution are not decisive, in my view, or they may be a nuisance or at times, a menace. We, of the Left, have been attempting to bring sanity to those forces from the very inception of the problem which has cost us so much politically but nevertheless we stand defended. Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, since 1983, we are aware of five administrations under four Presidents and one Prime Minister who attempted to find solutions. In fact, solutions were offered by some. They were either sabotaged or deliberately not implemented. The fact remains that the problems facing the Tamil people and the Tamil-speaking people at large remained unsolved. It was in this background that the His

757 758

Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa assumed Presidency in November, 2005. Not even 10 days of peace was made available to him. Violence, causing death to security forces and innocent people broke out on 3rd December, 2005. Until the Mavil-Aru matter came up in July 2006, the Government observed optimum restraint without going into an offensive position, I would say, not even to a defensive position. I need not repeat what happened in between Mavil-Aru and Thoppigala. The LTTE should blame itself for all what has happened due to its intransigence and belligerence. Mr. Deputy Chairman, given the existing reality of the political situation and in the context of the ground reality of the war situation, a negotiated political settlement is out of the question for the moment and now it is not in the political agenda.

It is under these circumstances and conditions that His Excellency the President sought the assistance of the political parties in Parliament to make a search for a consensus for a solution through the APRC. The JVP and the UNP opted out of the APRC subsequently on different grounds, but with the same objective I believe, that is to prevent or block a consensus. Taking the balance of political forces in the country and the balance of power in the Parliament, President Rajapaksa as an immediate and interim measure thought it prudent to implement the existing constitutional provisions relating to devolution and official language which hitherto remain unimplemented.

They may be inadequate, but not as outmoded as claimed by my good Friend, the Hon. Sampanthan, for whom I have the greatest respect, for the simple reason that it has never been tried out neither in the North nor the East. Even though it may be inadequate, I do not for a moment underestimate the importance of implementing those constitutional provisions. While the APRC continues in its attempt to seek a final solution by way of a consensus, the Government has decided, expressing its will, determination and readiness to speedily implement those constitutional provisions relating to devolution and official language.

Mr. Deputy Chairman, do not forget the fact that this is what the late President J.R. Jayewardena with his five-sixth majority failed to implement. Even the late President Premadasa never wanted to implement it seriously. The benefits of the Thirteenth Amendment never reached the people in the North or the East. In this situation, President Rajapaksa has embarked on a new attempt, where all his predecessors have failed. Admittedly, even the moderate Tamil people may feel that these proposals are inadequate at this stage of political developments. But do not forget the fact that President Rajapaksa is attempting to implement what all his predecessors either failed, sabotaged or remained indecisive to implement.

Let those people in the North and East begin to enjoy the benefits of those constitutional provisions. On a personal note, I must inform this House that it was my first exercise as Minister of Constitutional Affairs and National Integration to submit a Cabinet Paper at the first Cabinet Meeting itself drawing the attention of my Colleagues to the urgent need for the implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment, which remains unimplemented for over 20 years. Immediately, I got the approval to implement the language provisions of the Thirteenth Amendment. I have made a dent into the language question. The vexed question remains unsolved for over 50 years. It is a Herculean task. But for the first time since 1956 an attempt is being made.

I take this opportunity to thank Members of all the political parties in this House for having responded unreservedly to my call for their cooperation and support which they have tremendously extended. Of course, it takes time to clear a backlog. I shall aggressively attempt to implement it as the infrastructure is already being built now. Again this was what President Rajapaksas predecessors never attempted or failed to achieve and hence it is something new and innovative although my good Friend, the Hon. Sampanthan says that it is outmoded since it had never been tried out either in the East or the South.

The illustrious The Hindu daily editorial commended that the decision to implement Tamil as an official language was a historic decision taken by a Sri Lankan Government since Independence. Though my good Friends in the local press including the State media never appreciated, the foreign press the world over appreciated the steps taken for the implementation of Tamil as an official language. I must of course, praise the Editor of "Divaina" who wrote a special editorial, showering blessings on my Ministry for success in the implementation of Tamil as an official language.

In this connection, Mr. Deputy Chairman, I wish to refer to The Hindu of 28th January 2008, where it states that all except extremists and opportunists in the Tamil and Sinhala camps will welcome the interim steps recommended by the APRC to move forward the process of earnestly implementing the devolution and official language provisions of the Sri Lankan Constitution. This is the voice of The Hindu , the voice of India, the largest- circulated newspaper in India and the world over and this is the thinking of "The Hindu newspaper. It says further, Sir, that it helps to put the things in the correct perspective in the post-ceasefire period. I believe that this is a good start under the given political realities. Mr. Deputy Chairman, the political thinking behind this decision represents the thinking of the rational-minded people of this country and the vast majority of the people who aspire for communal harmony and peace.

Thank you very much.
