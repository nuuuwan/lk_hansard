Minister of Finance presented his Budget to Parliament on the 6th of November this year, you will recall that the Members of my party, the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi, walked out of the House and we released a statement on that occasion. I propose to read that statement to the House because my speech will primarily focus on that statement which we released on that day. Sir, I quote: \"As a mark of strong protest against and firm condemnation of the ruthless prosecution of the war by the Sri Lankan State in the North Eastern territory of Sri Lanka, the areas of historical habitation of the Tamil-speaking people, carried out by continuous aerial bombardment, multi-barrel rocket fire and other military attacks in Tamil civilian populated areas through which war the Sri Lankan State continues to commit genocide of the Tamil nation by the extermination of Tamil civilians and by the destruction and devastation of the Tamil homeland and by the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Tamil civilians tantamount to ethnic cleansing and for the prosecution of which war the Sri Lankan State seeks to allocate a colossal sum of money under the Budget Proposals, 2009, the Members of Parliament of the Illankai Tamil Arusu Kadchi, the Tamil National Alliance, will boycott the Budget Speech and walk out of the House when the Hon. Minister of Finance commences the presentation of the Budget, 2009.\" As you will recall, Sir, in terms of this statement, when the Hon. Minister of Finance commenced presenting his Budget Proposals, we walked out of the House. My speech today, Sir, will primarily focus around the statement which we made on the 6th of November. We see the prosecution of this war, this ruthless war as the fulcrum on which the whole institution of Government revolves. The Tamil question has afflicted the body politic of this country since Independence primarily because the peoples that inhabit this country - the Sinhalese people, the Tamil people and the Muslim people - have not been able to give themselves a Constitution based upon the consensus of all its peoples. Efforts to evolve a solution to the Tamil question have not been successful primarily because the two main political parties, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the United National Party, have not been able to adopt a bipartisan consensual approach. President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his key advisers seem, however, to think that there has to be a military solution to the Tamil question. That, in my submission, is the objective of this war. This objective is sought to be packaged in four concepts. It was three formerly, but now it has become four. But still, some Ministers talk about three concepts. The Governments new discovery for the resolution of the intractable Tamil question, which in effect is the right of the Tamil-speaking people to self-determination in the areas of their historical habitation, is based upon the following four concepts: one, demilitarization; two, democratization; three, development and four, devolution.",

    "text": "Militarization in this country, Sir, is in two forms. One is the State military. The Sri Lankan State has got its Army, its Navy and its Air Force. There is a retaliatory or a defensive armed force of the LTTE which has also got its own army, its own navy and its own air force. President Mahinda Rajapaksa states that the violence of the LTTE must be militarily crushed; there is no other way. I want to pose the question, Sir, as to when violence was first unleashed in this country, when violence first commenced in this country, is it not true that violence was unleashed against the Tamil people in the 1950s, in the 1960s, in the 1970s and in the 1980s? Why? They merely carried on a non-violent political struggle. You were not prepared to accommodate their moderate political demands and you unleashed violence against them. They performed Sathyagraha on the Gandhian model of non-violence. In 1956, when their leaders performed a Sathyagraha at Galle Face Green, in front of the old Parliament House, they were attacked. You subjected the Tamil people to violence because you wanted to subdue them and subjugate them. The Tamil people, however, have proved that they are too resilient for you to succeed in your efforts. The emergence of the LTTE was in the late 1970s, after three decades, this was the reaction to the Governments violent and unjust actions against the Tamil people. You now try to make out that the LTTE is the only problem, that the LTTE is purely a terrorist organization and that there was no justification for its emergence. This I submit, Sir, is nothing but downright chicanery. You conveniently forget that in more than half of Sri Lankas post-independence history, in more than the first three decades since the country attained independence, only the Tamil people were the victims of violence and that the Sri Lankan State was the offender. Politically no acceptable solution has yet been evolved to the Tamil question. You are not willing to do so because you do not want to compromise on Sinhala supremacy. The Government in an effort to deceive the international community; stages the drama of an APRC process and also claims in the interim to implement the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, something, which the President wanted done, because he wanted something with which he could try to appease the international community. I must specifically state that the 13th Amendment, as an interim solution did not come out through the APRC process. It came out of a directive of the President to the Chairman of the APRC, that is the truth, and not even President Mahinda Rajapaksa can deny that. The Chairman of the APRC, Prof. Tissa Vitharana in a statement to the media has acknowledged this position. This is now to be done separately in the East and separately in the North thereby undermining the merged North-Eastern unit of governance which the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement provided for and which was implemented under the 13th Amendment to the Constitution and the Provincial Councils Act. This is yet",

    "text": "another grave betrayal in the long list of betrayals committed by the Sri Lankan State against the Tamil people, you try to make out that you want to solve this problem, that you are honest about it, that your political proposals are intended genuinely to find a solution, but you are de-merging the North-East and not coming up with a worthwhile political proposal. I propose at this stage Sir, with your permission to read out an interview given by the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, former Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Government, and who is now the Leader of the SLFP(M), the defecting faction and sits in the Opposition. This is what he said in an interview given to Mandana Ismail Abeywickrema which is reported in the The Sunday Leader of August 3, 2008. The question that he was asked is, I quote: The Indian Prime Minister was reportedly assured by the government even during your tenure as foreign minister that a political package to resolve the ethnic issue will be submitted at the earliest but still there is no progress on that front. How serious has this development impacted on Indo-Lanka relations? And, what was the answer he gave? I quote: As you know, as foreign minister between the period of November 2005 and January 2007, I made six visits to New Delhi-twice with the President. At each opportunity, I had the honour of meeting the Indian Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh to explain the evolving situation in the country. Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee also participated at these meetings. In fact, at each meeting, first the President and then I assured the Prime Minister that the final report of the All Party Conference (APC) will be issued by August 2006, the latest. That was two years ago. He further goes on to say, I quote: However, as time went by, it was also clear to me that the government, especially with the pressure exerted by the likes of the JHU, Wimal Weerawansa and also the Defence Secretary, were all out to sabotage and cripple the workings of the APC. The APC, as far as the President and his people were concerned was a ploy to keep the international community at bay and also a means of showing the international community that the government was interested in negotiating a settlement while it secretly operated a military option. In fact, when I met Dr. Singh later that year, it was very embarrassing, as I, in order to protect the government, had to pretend that a solution was forthcoming. In December 2006, the duplicity was evident when I accompanied the President to New Delhi to attend Minister Mani Shankar Aiyars daughters wedding and to meet the Indian Prime Minister to brief him on the latest developments in Sri Lanka. At this meeting, we had in our delegation, Dr. Rohan Perera, who was an advisor to the Foreign Ministry and a member of the experts panel of the APC that was drafting the final recommendations. At the meeting, the President got Dr. Perera to give a brief presentation to the Indian side on the proposed recommendations. Dr. Perera gave a concise presentation where he said they would propose absolute devolution of power similar to that of the quasi federal Indian Constitution.",

    "text": "However, we were in for a rude shock once we got back to Sri Lanka when President Rajapakse, who was extremely peeved by Delhis blackout of his photographers at the earlier visit, instructed that the experts committee of the APC be dissolved. Dr. Perera and other members were mercilessly attacked in government controlled newspapers and were forced tosubmit their resignations. The President presented a set of proposals to India, which he himself was to disown a few weeks later. At the non Aligned Summit in Havana in September 2006, President Rajapakse again assured the Indian Prime Minister and the delegation that there would be no demerger of the north and east. But he later instigated Wimal Weerawansa and the JVP to file action against the merger. Even today, it is a well-known fact the President is there behind the anti-Indian rhetoric of the JHU and the JVP. This, Sir, comes from the Foreign Minister of this Government who was with the President of this country, at the meeting with the Indian Prime Minister in Havana, where the President assured the Indian Prime Minister that there will be no de-merger. This is not being said by me. It is being said by a Foreign Minister of this Government and this is exactly what Mr. M. K. Narayanan, the National Security Adviser of the Indian Government told me and my colleagues when we met him in New Delhi before the judgment of the Supreme Court, after the President met with the Prime Minister in Hawana. Mr. Narayanan told us that there was an assurance from the President that there will be no de-merger and that we do not have to worry about it. Going further he told us that the Indian Prime Minister has told the President that if there was going to be a de-merger, India would have to keep all its options open. Those were the exact words of Mr. M. K. Narayanan, the National Security Adviser of India. Sir, where exactly is this government going? What is this government doing? Are you not cheating everybody, the people in this country, the international community and the much beleaguered Tamil people? Insofar as, Sir, the sharing of powers of Government is concerned, the Thirteenth Amendment was rejected by the main Tamil political party of the Tamil people, the TULF as early as 1987 - 1988 and continues to be rejected by the main Tamil political party, the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi, the Tamil National Alliance which has 22 Members in Parliament out of 23 Tamil Members of Parliament elected from the North and the East. It has not found acceptance with any Tamil political formation that does not carry out the dictates of President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Such a worthless scheme can never be a solution to the Tamil question. Moreover, by seeking to implement the Thirteenth Amendment, President Mahinda Rajapaksa thereby seeks to set at naught all efforts to evolve an acceptable political solution between 1989 and 2007 including his own pronouncements and actions when he set up the APRC. The Thirteenth Amendment concentrates all powers in the Centre and the Provincial Council is no more than a glorified local government institution. Such a worthless scheme can never be a solution to the Tamil question. I am told that the media today have reported that the Hon. Susil Premajayantha in Parliament yesterday said that there will be no solution above the Thirteenth Amendment. If that is your position, I might tell you across the Floor of this House, you can chuck it, we will not touch it with the wrong end of a barge-pole.",

It is in this background, Sir, that this so called demilitarization which in effect means the military annihilation of the LTTE takes place. In doing so, Tamil civilian settlements are subjected to aerial bombardment, multi-barrel rocket launcher fire and other military attacks. Tamil civilians are killed and injured. Their assets including their livelihood opportunities and equipment are destroyed. They are displaced in hundreds of thousands. Entire villages are depopulated and denuded in a manner tantamount to ethnic cleansing. As a step complementary to the conduct of this war, Tamil civilians, particularly youth, are subjected to enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. The killings of five Tamil students in Trincomalee Town and 17 Tamil aid workers in Mutur, Trincomalee were two such clearly outrageous instances which are presently being inquired into by the Commission of Inquiry. I will deal with that later in the course of the Committee Stage discussion. This happens not mearly in the North-East, but even in other parts of the country. We state that by this process of so called demilitarization, genocidal attacks have been unleashed against the Tamil people in their areas of historical habitation, their homeland. These ruthless military attacks have objectives that go beyond the so called annihilation of the LTTE. The Sri Lankan Government surely knows that the LTTE cannot be annihilated by aerial bombing of Tamil settlements and firing multi-barrel rockets into such settlements. The real objective is to break the will of the Tamils as a people, to break their resilience and to subdue and to subjugate those who remain. I would even mention, Sir, that when the Government sought the immediate withdrawal of UN agencies and the international nongovernmental organizations from the Vanni some time in September, when those agencies were prepared to work there continuously, this was deliberately done by the Government in order to inflict further hardships on the Tamil people and as a component of the process of committing genocide against the Tamil people. In this process of demilitarization, valuable lands of Tamil",

The Sri Lankan armed forces are increasingly occupying the areas historically inhabited by the Tamil people both in the North and in the East establishing new camps and new facilities wherever they please, and the Tamil people who remain in these areas will have to live under the oppressive control of these armed forces who are 99 per cent Sinhala and who have nothing but hostility against the Tamil people. This, Sir, I submit is the most suppressive subjugation of the Tamil nation that has been inflicted on them by this Government. This cruel action, Sir, against the Tamil people is ironically and most cynically described as the liberation of the Tamil people by the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government. Tamil people are killed; they are grievously injured; their houses and other assets, plantations, crops, animal husbandry, occupational equipment, everything, is destroyed; they are driven out of their homes and villages; they are impoverished, rendered destitute; they seek refuge with their children in the open even under trees and the Government has the audacity to say that these Tamil people are being liberated. Governments mendacious conduct, Sir, in regard to what is happening can be seen from what happened in the Eastern Province. There was a Debate in Parliament in regard to the situation in the North-East on 5th of September, 2007, in the course of which, quoting the reports of recognized human rights organizations, the University Teachers for Human Rights (Jaffna) and the Human Rights Watch, I stated that at least 300 Tamil civilians had been killed in the course of military operations in the Eastern Province, and the Minister who replied on behalf of the Government said that he had checked with the Government Agents of Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Amparai and the Area Commanders of the Army in those areas and that not one Tamil civilian had been killed. I subsequently got the names of these people and moved another Adjournment Motion in Parliament which took place on 18th September, 2007 and in the course of that Adjournment Debate I tabled the names of 261 Tamil persons who had been killed, their addresses and the dates on which they were killed and I called upon the Government to appoint a Commission of Inquiry comprising three retired judges of the higher judiciary, one Sinhalese, one Tamil and one Muslim with the Muslim as the Chairman of the Commission to go into this question, inquire and give us a report in regard to the truth. Have you done that? Why not? You go around saying, Tamils are not being killed; we are liberating them. I gave you the names of 261 people and called",

    "text": "upon you to appoint a Commission comprising three retired judges to ascertain the truth. Have you done that? Have you paid compensation to a single family whose member was killed? You have not paid one cent. This shows what the Government is engaged in. It is genocide of the Tamil nation and not the liberation of the Tamil nation as you have the cheek, the impudence, to say even publicly, even internationally. Can such a government, Sir, ever be trusted? In regard to your militarily crushing the LTTE - I do not want to talk too much about that. I remember, when I was a Member of Parliament during 1977 to 1978 in the old Parliament, President J.R. Jayewardene one day stood up and said that he had instructed his nephew, Brigadier Bull Weeratunga to go to Jaffna and to put an end to terrorism. That happened 30 years ago. And we all know what has happened. I wish to say that unless one of these three things happens -firstly, you destroy the Tamil nation, you are able to commit genocide of the Tamil nation, which is what you are doing now. You are in the process of doing that. Secondly, there is an acceptable political solution which is increasingly becoming remote from what is happening in this country. Thirdly, the Tamil-speaking people and others living with them are living in their own independent state- unless one of these three things happens, it is my submission, that you will still be fighting terrorism yet another 30 years down the road. President J.R. Jayewardene said this 30 years ago and 30 years further down the road you will still be fighting terrorism. I might at this stage refer to what was stated in regard to a similar situation by the late Prime Minister of India, Shrimathi Indira Gandhi which she referred to the Bangladesh situation, in a letter that she wrote to the President of the United States, President Richard Nixon on the 15th of December 1971. This is what Prime Minister Indira Gandhi said: The fact of the matter is that the rulers of West Pakistan got away with the impression that they could do what they liked, because no one, not even the United States, would choose to take a public position that while Pakistans integrity was certainly sacrosanct human rights, liberty were no less so, and that there was a necessary inter-connection between the inviolability of states and the contentment of their people. Exactly the same situation prevails in Sri Lanka today where the human rights of the Tamil people, the liberty of the Tamil people, is under attack by the State in a genocidal process and the Sri Lankan Government, under President Mahinda Rajapaksa, thinks that they can get away with all these things and nobody can question them, nobody can control them and nobody can set things right. I must say, you are making a very sad mistake. Sir, I want to refer to the Indian concerns that was expressed in recent times. They were contained in the three communiqus that I am hoping to place before the House. The first was on October 6th, a demarche referred to by an official who said, I quote:",

    "text": "\"The Sri Lankan Deputy High Commissioner was summoned by the National Security Adviser today to express Indias grave concern and unhappiness at the growing casualties of unarmed Tamil civilians as a result of military action. The escalation of hostilities in the North and the resultant fallout was leading to a great deal of concern in India. It was pointed out that there was need for the Sri Lankan Government to act with greater restraint and address the growing feeling of insecurity among the minority community. To stem the deteriorating humanitarian situation, the need to revive the political process was highlighted. It was essential that vital supplies to the affected population were not disrupted in any manner. This was after you withdrew the UN agencies and the international NGOs from the Wanni. Sir, the second statement that came out is from the Indian Foreign Minister, Mr. Pranab Mukherjee. I quote from an article in \"The Hindu\" of 17th October, 2008 under the heading, \"India worried about civilian suffering, says Pranab.\" He stated: It is essential that their rights- It means the rights of Tamil civilians. - be respected, that they be immune from attacks, and that food and other essential supplies be allowed to reach them, External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee said in a statement here. Mr. Mukherjee said New Delhi had consistently made it clear that normality could not be brought about by military means or battlefield victories. What was required was a peacefully negotiated political settlement which allowed each community to realise its potential within the framework of a united Sri Lanka. The Government of India, he stressed, would do all in its power to achieve this goal to ameliorate the humanitarian conditions in Sri Lanka and had been making representations to Colombo at several levels. There was a third statement, Sir, which came out from the Foreign Secretary. \"He expressed grave concern over the situation obtaining in Sri Lanka.\" \"He expressed worries at the humanitarian effect of the conflict on the civilians and said essential supplies and food should be allowed to reach them.\" The Foreign Secretary also reiterated that a political settlement is required and this could not be brought about by military means. He also asked the High Commissioner for Sri Lanka in India to tell his Government that urgent steps be taken to address Indias concerns. What is happening Sir? We all know that after all these concerns, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, as the Special Envoy of the President, went to India. He was there on the 26th of October and he made certain representations and gave assurances to India that the Tamil people will not be penalised or will not be victimized during the course of the military operations and that the Government would ensure that the Tamil civilians were safe. I will, Sir, place here a record of the events that took place in the Wanni on 24th of October, that is two days before the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa went to India, 25th of October, 28th of October, 29th of October, 30th of October, 31st of October, 2nd of November, 3rd of November, 6th of November, 9th of November and 10th of November as the result of aerial bombardment and multi-barrel rocket",

Civilians have been killed; civilians have been injured; schools have been damaged; houses have been damaged -some completely and some partially; temples have been damaged, even the Kilinochchi Hospital has been damaged. Mr. Speaker, I am tabling* this document and I want this to be included in Hansard. This is a record of events within the said several days and the photographs of the consequences of such events, during the so-called liberation of the Tamil people showing how Tamil people have been injured, how Tamil people have been killed; how their cattle have been killed; how their houses have been damaged; how temples have been damaged and how the Kilinochchi Hospital has been damaged. This has happened after Mr. Basil Rajapaksa's visit to New Delhi. I am tabling** these photographs, Sir. So, Sir, if this Government thinks that by merely prosecuting this war, they can find a solution to the Tamil question, I think they are sadly mistaken and I would strongly urge them to rethink their whole strategy. At this stage, Sir, while we talk about the war and all that has been going on, I want to read, Sir, an article that appeared in the \"Time\" Magazine of 3rd of November, 2008 where Mr. Barack Obama, the new President of the United States, as the Democratic candidate met with General Petraeus, the Military Commander of the US, in regard to the war in Iraq. General Petraeus was of the view that the war should be continued but Barack Obama had a different view and he met with the General and discussed this matter with him at length and told him that why he did not agree with the Generals view. He said very clearly, I quote: Your job is to succeed in Iraq on as favourable terms as we can get. But my job as a potential Commander in Chief is to view your counsel and interests through the prism of our overall national security. Obama talked about the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, the financial costs of the occupation of Iraq, the stress it was putting on the military. Do you think of your national interest? Are you not alienating the Tamil people in such a way that the Tamil people can never be integrated hereafter into a Sri Lankan nation, by killing them in this way, by injuring them in this way, by destroying all that they own? You do not think of that; you are not concerned about it. The article further states, I quote: But the Senator from Illinois had laid down his marker: if elected President, he would be in charge. Unlike George W. Bush who had given Petraeus complete authority over the war - an unprecedented abdication of presidential responsibility (and unlike John McCain, whose hero worship of Petraeus bordered on the unseemly) - Obama would insist on a rigorous chain of command.",

He described this phenomenon as the inability of the people to accommodate others who are not like us, and mentioned Sri Lanka as an example,. Who does not accommodate whom in this country? He further states, I quote: pointing out that the war rages even when everybody there looks exactly the same. Obama also criticized the Bush administrations war on terror as the cause for suppressing civil liberties, saying: Part of my job as next President is to break the fever of fear that has been exploited by this administration. We are told to be afraid of terrorists, immigrants and each other. This becomes the means by which our civil liberties are being subverted and our values are distorted, implying policy changes are in order. He promised a break from the Bush-Cheney diplomacy: a willingness to speak to our adversaries and cited President Kennedy, saying We should never negotiate out of fear, but we should never fear to negotiate. The notion that not talking with Leaders we do not like makes us look tough is fundamentally flawed, it makes us look arrogant and sends the message to the world that we are not listening.",

The Parliamentary critics of the Budget have failed to acknowledge that this Budget has been prepared in the context of a global economic tsunami and as such it must be adjusted, if necessary, to minimize the impact on our country. An attempt has been made to meet the objectives of the Ten Year Development Plan envisaged by the \"Mahinda Chintana\" while also addressing the economic burdens experienced by the people, in the context of the financial and economic recession that is sweeping the world. For instance, a major criticism made by the UNP Leader, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe has been that it was a grave mistake to have resorted to getting the benefits of hedging to obtain petroleum at a lower price when prices were rising steeply in the world market. No one at that time could have anticipated the dramatic fall of oil prices that has subsequently occurred as part of the fall in commodity prices as a consequence of the economic tsunami that is sweeping the world. The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe has not yet realized that this tsunami has swept away the credibility of neoliberal economics and with it the UNPs Regaining Sri Lanka programme.

    "text": "piloted the whole neoliberal exercise for over 13 years in the USA, has now admitted that it was a big mistake, and a major cause of the present crisis. In fact, the remedial action in developed countries, including the USA, have led to the State taking shares in private banks, insurance companies and even other companies that are being bailed out so that their performance can be regulated. When the worlds leaders of capitalism have to resort to nationalization, analysts are questioning whether this heralds the end of capitalism itself and the dawn of socialism. Thus, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe and the UNP, stands naked before the people of Sri Lanka without an economic policy. , . \" \" , . It has nothing to offer other than empty promises and baseless criticism. Then, I come to salaries. When the UNP sheds crocodile tears over the inadequacy of salary increases, we can only turn to its own record during 2002 - 2004 when no salary increases were given. This Government has not only linked the Cost of Living Allowance to the rise in the Cost of Living Index, but also given a reasonable added salary increase and allowance to government employees as well as pensioners. The LSSP would have liked this to be increased further but appreciates that in the present context this may be difficult. But, we would urge that the private sector parallels the Governments increase. , , allowances . 2002 - 2004 . . pensioners , allowances . . , . . However, considering that Sri Lankas economy, in order to survive, has to be even more competitive in the context of the global economic crisis, we urge all employees to maximize productivity. In particular, the State sector has to play an important role in riding this crisis, which can drag on for some years. There is a strong case for carrying out extensive administrative reforms on the lines that have been successful in Singapore. Taking a cue from Keynes solution to the Great Depression of 1929-33, Obama has stated that in the USA he hopes to increase state expenditure and thereby stimulate the economy and create more jobs et cetera for which, his opponents have accused him of being a socialist. In fact capitalist political leaders as well as economists have started to read Marx to better understand capitalism.",

The cess and other taxes have been opposed without understanding the reason why they are being levied. These are all directed at reducing the import of items that can be grown in our country like maize, cowpea and sugar or, locally produced like milk powder, paper, leather goods, furniture and garments, so that two important objectives can be achieved: growth of our economy and saving of foreign exchange. But all taxes, including VAT, are to be waived on essential items like rice, dhal and medicines. It is correct that the increase of the price of wheat flour will have an adverse impact, specially in the urban areas and the plantations. The LSSP welcomes the milk subsidy for Samurdhi and plantation children under five years, but action should be taken to give Indian Tamils in the plantations the benefits of the Samurdhi as soon as possible. The present drive to increase the production of rice and kurakkan flour and products based on them, backed by ongoing research which is being carried out by institutions including institutions under our Ministry, will help to offset the cost of living. Reducing imports of luxury items is also a major objective towards this. . .",

    "text": ", . . . Saving foreign exchange is particularly important as with the fall in the income from our export commodities like tea, rubber, garments and gems, the foreign trade deficit will increase - already our foreign reserves which were adequate for three and a half months of imports in August have reduced to one and a half months - unless the imports are curtailed We must not get into Pakistans position where reserves dropped to zero and they were forced to beg for IMF assistance and so become a victim of their anti-national conditionalities. However, the short-term impact of the cess on the cost of living may be less than anticipated because of the fall in global prices of imports. Suggestions like devaluing of the rupee to help make our exports competitive will no doubt help to increase exports, but will have to be assessed in relation to the adverse effect on the cost of living. In respect of the latter, the attempt to open Co-op City outlets and to revive cooperative societies through the Budget is very welcome, but co-op mudalalis should be replaced by genuine co-ops with active collective consumer participation. . . . . . . , . I now come to the Vidatha Programme. The LSSP appreciates the support given in the Budget for rural infrastructure development and the promotion of rural agriculture and industry. But, we regret that the role of the Vidatha Programme of the Ministry of Science and Technology, which the Ministry of Finance has supported, has not even been mentioned. Despite severe financial constraints, 237 computerized Resource Centres have been opened, one in each administrative division in all parts of the country including the North and the East. During this year, up to 31st August, 2008, 497 training programmes and 103 awareness programmes on topics like improved kitul tapping, rice-based bakery and other products, low-cost housing, fruit and vegetable dehydration, mushroom cultivation, jam, cordial and bites production, ornamental fish farming, papadam, candle and soap production, practical electronics training et cetera have been launched. There were 11,206 participants, but a very much larger number benefited. In the last three",

In regard to research, in the Budget Speech, the President has recognized the need to produce high quality products using latest technology. He stressed the importance of a knowledge-economy giving more attention to scientific research, and allocated Rs.300 million to be steered by the National Research Council - NRC - with the help of various ministries and institutions. On behalf of the scientific community, I wish to thank him for this action but wish to remind him that the presently voted sum for science and technology is well below the one per cent of GDP that the \"Mahinda Chintana\" promised and is one of the lowest in the world, 0.13 per cent.

    "text": "performing this task for 40 years as a statutory mandate, will be actively involved in carrying out the task that is being entrusted to the NRC outlined by the President. It is unfortunate that there has been a massive cut of Rs. 81 million in the allocation to the National Science Foundation this year. I hope that this serious blow to the NSF will be suitably adjusted. Coming on to advanced technology, the NSF is playing the lead role in promoting the training and implementation of the Nanotechnology initiative, which aims to make Sri Lanka a leader in this field, so that we can produce the high quality industrial products that will enable us to become an industrial force and emerge from poverty. I wish to thank the President for providing funds for this effort. At the moment, only 1.5 per cent of our products are based on high technology as against over 30 per cent in many developed countries and even Korea. We cannot emerge from poverty unless we follow their example. The Ministry of Science and Technology is developing a project to set up world class centres of excellence in several fields like electronics, biotechnology, mechatronics, artificial intelligence, ICT, space technology, post-harvest technology and material science, focusing on those areas that Sri lanka is lacking today. The objective is to link this with industry so that good quality products at competitive prices can be produced by our industry. If we do this quickly, Sri lanka can take advantage of the setback to international competititors in the current economic crisis. I hope that this will receive the necessary funding so that we can develop the industries that will take the country forward on this basis. Then, I come to alternate energy. While welcoming the moves to support mini-hydropower generating projects, more Budgetary provision should have been made for supporting other forms of alternative energy like gliricidia, which can provide more than 20 per cent of our electricity grid energy needs while also generating an income of over Rs. 200,000 per year per acre to our cultivators. Research which has already been commenced on cheaper ways to tap solar energy should also be supported. The use of ethanol, biogas and biofuel needs to be adequately researched and actively promoted with suitable subsidies. While welcoming moves to encourage organic fertilizer use, the time is ripe to consider shifting the emphasis in our agriculture to organic and natural farming. This is not only for health and environmental reasons but also the cost factor, both local and foreign exchange. With regard to taxes, I am glad that a committee is to be set up to review our taxation procedures. There are too many taxes and the collection is falling far short of the targets. General taxes like VAT which affect the rich and the poor equally should be done away with. More targeted taxes directed at those who can afford to pay are",

Steps should be taken to tap black money; estimated at over 30 per cent of our economy by giving suitable inducements for important development needs, as all attempts to surface them have failed so far. With regard to capital account, the LSSP has always opposed opening the capital account to foreign investors and speculators. We saw how the East-Asian economies collapsed with their withdrawal in 1997. I am glad that the Central Bank has limited the opening and retained a tight control of local banks, so that the impact of the global financial crisis has bee minimised. We hope that there will be more regulations in the future in the interests of the country. Finally, I hope that this good Budget will be properly implemented so that the people and the country get the benefits of it. Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman.

I must say, the world over, even in developing countries, people are turning back to strong government to take them out of the dangers of \"market failure\". The message is clear, the path is challenging, Madam Presiding Member. If we are to develop as a country all our people must be able to improve their livelihoods together, if not, we will perpetuate disparities, as happened under the neoliberal market policies of the previous UNP Government. There must be a balance in policy. On the one hand, the local producer, whether a farmer or an industrialist requires protection and support. On the other hand, they require opportunities to market their produce and balancing these twin aspects of providing support and creating opportunities is the challenge and it is the policy the 2009 Budget carries forward. There can be no turning back. Our economy has grown by a consistent 6.9 per cent over the past three years, with the highest rate of 7.7 per cent in 2006. There has been a sustained drop in",

On the fiscal side the achievements have been no less impressive. Revenue has increased from around 14.5 per cent in 2004 to revised 16.1 per cent in 2008. The overall budget deficit is expected to be around 7.0 per cent of GDP in 2008, the revenue at 16.1 per cent and expenditure at 23 per cent. The budget deficit is targeted at 6.5 per cent in 2009. A further noteworthy achievement is the consistent decline in debt/GDP ratio from around 102 in 2004 to 85.8 per cent in 2007. It is also noteworthy to say that despite the national defense expenditure we have been able to keep development expenditures (public expenditure) increasing from Rs. 229 billion in 2007 to be able to budget for Rs. 370 billion today. There are significant achievements. No doubt, challenges lie ahead, Madam Presiding Member. We must build on the performance of the past few years in the years ahead. Our development challenge is to eliminate the pockets of disadvantage.

The present crisis which started with the collapse of the two great giants, Freddie Mac and Fanny Mai, the two largest institutions which provide housing loans in the United States, quickly spread to the banking sector in the USA and very soon similar cracks appeared in Germany and in Great Britain and in Iceland. The crisis was so great that it created the worse collapse ever. The governments of the USA, Germany and the UK quickly went to the assistance of the financial institutions and the USA poured US Dollars 800 billion from state funds as assistance. We must also ask this question from the industrial world in particular, as to how they are going to cope up with this depression and how will it get out of this crisis. How will the USA and Europe stimulate their ailing industries and revive their economies to compete with the growing giants of Asia? These are the questions that worry the entire world.

In this crisis Sri Lanka need to be vigilant if we are to protect ourselves and shelter those who are most vulnerable to the shocks produced by this economic earthquake. To provide markets for our produce we may even have to negotiate bilateral trade agreements. We have to continue to strengthen the cooperative system whether they be consumer cooperatives or marketing cooperatives. It must be emphasized that our first duty is to protect those who are vulnerable in employment, their jobs and work places. Those who know the agonies of the people in Sri Lanka in 1930s will understand what I mean. I hope we can rise above party differences and rise to face these challenging times. , ,",

    "text": "achievement of the Millennium Development Goals which is an ambitious agenda for reducing poverty and improving the poor peoples living standard. As most of us know, Millennium Development Goals were agreed on by the world leaders at the United Nations Millennium Summit in September, 2000. Though we have made good progress in the field of health and education, we are still backward when we look at the poverty profile of our country. We have a long march ahead of us to eradicate poverty in this country and the present Budget is a step in the right direction. Per capita income has increased during the last three years but it is important to realize that if it is to be more evenly distributed, we will have to develop a strategy to ensure that income-generating activities take place in all the districts. Take for instance, the Districts of Monaragala and Badulla. Poverty is rampant in these areas. The increase of the special commodity levy on imported sugar from Rs. 14 to Rs. 16 per kilogram will contribute towards the improvement of the local sugar industry and sugar cane cultivation which, in turn will have an impact on the people living in these two districts. Similarly, the imposition of the 25 per cent cess on imported maize and animal feed applicable to all importers, including those in the BOI sector, will be a boom to the farmers who are involved in the cultivation of maize in these areas. We hope to see more income generation and employment generation in these districts as a result of these decisions. Therefore, though some cynics will not look at the Budget positively; we have to enlighten the people that the long-term impact of this Budget is going to be beneficial for all of them. Still on the subject of poverty reduction, I have a special interest in the Budget Proposal to allocate Rs. 300 million to further popularize Co-op City outlets in rural areas and to set up around 1,000 mini Co-op City outlets at village level. This will further promote the co-operative movement in Sri Lanka. Co-operative activities already have a significant impact on developing countries in terms of credit, social protection, shelter and employment, touching every aspect of peoples lives. The democratic structure of co-operatives and self-help organizations can play an important part in tackling poverty. This collective self-help scheme can offer real benefits to the people who are economically vulnerable. Therefore, co-operatives can go a long way towards helping to meet the Millennium Development Goals and the proposal to allocate funds for the development of co-operatives, is a step in the right direction. Even in the fields of education and health, to ensure that we do not rest on our past laurels, steps are being taken to develop over 300 Isuru Schools across the country and also to introduce Information Technology. The proposal to allocate an additional Rs. 950 million to improve Rajarata, Wayamba, Sabaragamuwa, Uva-Wellassa, Northern, South-Eastern and Jaffna",

    "text": "Universities, will ensure that the quality of education is further improved in the regions and provide a better platform for the academics and students in these regions to pursue further education. Similarly, efforts have been made to minimize inter-provincial disparities in the health sector by setting up teaching hospitals with improved technology and operating theatres. The proposal to allocate Rs.350 million to improve health facilities in the remote area is another important decision. This will pave the way to develop the hospitals in the districts having a high poverty ratio. So, the poor people will have access to better quality service at their doorstep. This will ensure an educated workforce in the future with better access to health services which, in turn contributes towards poverty alleviation. We foresee a peaceful future for Sri Lanka in the coming years. If we are to improve our economy, we have to ensure that peace and development goes hand in hand. It is understood that a major portion of our funds are allocated for defence expenditure. With the advent of peace, we will be able to allocate more funds to accelerate the development process. Another important area that needs targeting, is the improvement of infrastructure. If poverty is to be alleviated, we have to promote investments in all the regions. It cannot be done if infrastructure facilities are lacking in those areas. Roads, electricity, communication and water facilities are very important if investors are to move into an area for investment. Naturally we cannot expect the private sector to invest in these areas without an economic return on investment. Our Government is taking all necessary steps to provide the infrastructure necessary and to promote investment in all the regions leading to sustainable development. Therefore, compensation for acquisition of lands for road development is to be lauded. The proposal to pay compensation of less than Rupees one million by cash and to issue Treasury Bonds by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka through the Bank of Ceylon in the case of compensation exceeding Rupees one million, would contribute towards solving this issue to a great extent. Similarly the setting up of a Presidential Task Force to coordinate the implementation of development activities by including all the important stakeholders, is another step that is appreciated. Taking all these developments into consideration, we can foresee a revival of the local industries, an increase in the Gross Domestic Product and a reduction of regional disparities in income generation leading to a more balanced distribution of income among the people of Sri Lanka, thereby accelerating our march towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.",

    "text": "Then you have a very high inflation rate which has to be curbed. As you know, a high inflation rate in the economy is really a bad sign for the overall macroeconomic policies of a country. The Central Bank has pointed out that the inflation rate of 20 per cent last year is too much for the economy to bear. A high inflation rate brings down the real income of people. The private sector cannot project their budgets reasonably. So, what we have to aim at is a low inflation - high growth regime. But there are warning signs that this economy is heading towards a high inflation - lower growth regime, and I would urge all those people who are handling the economy to look at this a new. Of course, as I mentioned, the public investments are there. Massive infrastructure projects are planned now and they are in progress. I would say that the Budget is not only a Budget that will look at the defence expenditure to safeguard the territorial integrity of this country and curb the menace of terrorism from our Motherland, but it is also a development Budget that takes the development of this country to the villages, which is very important. So, I would commend this Budget. I would urge the officials of the Central Bank and the people who are handling the policy aspects of the economy to look at the high rate of inflation in this country. But, generally speaking, the Budget has been able to contain and target certain sectors of the economy. The GDP deficit is only about 7 per cent which is commendable. It is really commendable that the Budget deficit is below 10 per cent, because you are spending about Rs. 200 billion on the war and at the same time, you are continuing with the economic development of this country. Therefore, I would commend the Minister of Finance, the Central Bank and also the other officials who looked at the overall aspects of the economy and prepared the Budget. I would urge them to look at the overall financial meltdown that is occurring now in the global markets, because Sri Lanka also has to realize that this global meltdown is going to affect Sri Lanka. So, in a years time, when we are speaking again on the 2010 Budget, the world situation will be much different from what it is today.
