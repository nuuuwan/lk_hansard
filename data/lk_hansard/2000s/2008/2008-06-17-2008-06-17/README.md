Sir, when we met on the previous Sitting week, the House was informed that the Sri Lanka Electricity Bill would be taken up today and the Assistance and Protection to Victims of Crime and Witnesses Bill will be taken up on Thursday. This is an important Bill. So, we were waiting to find out from the Government as to what they were going to do, and if necessary even ask for the Consultative Committee to be summoned, to discuss some of the issues that have been raised by the civil society. In principle, I do not think anyone is against it. But we have concerns on some of the provisions of the Bill. All of a sudden there was a Meeting of Party Leaders yesterday to decide on the Bill. Then, when we heard that the Sri Lanka Electricity Bill would not be taken up, we in fact had asked for an Adjournment Motion to be taken up today and for this Bill to be taken up on Thursday. Mr. S.S. Wijeratne wrote to us and he met me also with the idea that the MPs will be briefed on this Bill either today or tomorrow. We were also met by some other organizations. Then, all of a sudden the Government wanted this Bill to be taken up today. But the whole idea of Parliament is that we must discuss this issue first. This is a very important Bill. No one is against it but there are some issues that concern us and there are some issues that concern the other parties in the Opposition as well. So, now you are going to rush

through a piece of legislation. Only now we are informed that the Government is going to bring amendments in accordance with the Supreme Court decision. The UNP has already submitted its amendments. So, why could not the Government submit the amendments all this time? The Government has submitted its amendments only now. I mean, there must be a discussion. There are some shortcomings in this Bill. We would all like to support it. But if you are going to rush through this, you are rushing through a vital piece of legislation without appropriate discussion in this House or outside. When parties have suggestions - we are going to start the debate not knowing what amendments the Government is going to bring in. We only know the amendments that the UNP and the other Opposition Parties are going to bring in. So, how can you debate this? This is an important piece of legislation. That is why I am asking the Government, let us sit down and talk this over. We do not even know the amendments that the Government is bringing in. So how can we accept this position? No one has briefed us. When we were asked by Mr. S.S. Wijeratne, we nominated our Members to go for that briefing today or tomorrow. But all of a sudden you brought this Bill. We only have what we had studied. We did find serious defects in it and we want to correct them. So, is the Government interested in bringing a piece of legislation dealing with the protection of witnesses which is really strong and which is required by the country or is it just an eyewash they are doing? That is why we are asking for the procedures to be followed. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . . . . . ( . ) (The Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera) . . . ? . "" . , Sri Lanka Electricity Bill . . , , . .

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, I know this is an urgent Bill. But after it went before the Supreme Court, there was enough time to discuss it earlier. I am now wondering whether we can have copies of these amendments in Tamil and English. We have got them only in Sinhala. But if you look at the number of amendments, this may become a new Bill. To begin with, you are removing the old Preamble and bringing in a new Preamble. Then, Clauses 2 and 3 are substantial amendments. These are the important Clauses. Also Clause 4, Clause 5, Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 9, Clause 10, Clause 12, Clause 13, Clause 14, Clause 15, Clause 17 - these are the important Clauses - almost all the key Clauses, there is a fair number, dealing with this are to be amended. You are virtually bringing in a new Bill. What are you going to debate now? We have not even read these. If you look at these amendments, you can see that there are far-reaching ones. They nullify the Bill. The question is, are you not rushing it through? You bring in the amendments now; these amendments are so far-reaching. If you put in these amendments and what we have proposed, you will virtually have a new Bill. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, the best is to refer this to a Standing Committee. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Sir, I am not, for a moment, seeking to - ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) There are so many - [Interruption.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I am not for a moment, Sir, seeking to go back on the agreement we arrived at the Party Leaders Meeting yesterday. But I must say that the Government seems to be dealing with this Bill in a very lackadaisical way. I think this Bill should have been reviewed much earlier. That apart, Sir, you are aware that this Bill has become necessary on account of the work of the Commission of Inquiry which has been appointed to investigate certain grave human rights violations in this country including the massacre of five students in Trincomalee in January, 2006 and the massacre of 17 aid workers in Mutur in

August, 2006, which are the main matters that are being inquired into by it now. The International Independent Group of Eminent Persons was invited to this country to observe the working of the Commission and to be satisfied that the working of the Commission was in keeping with international norms and standards. It was publicly stated a long time ago, almost a year ago, that there must be some law which provides protection to the witnesses and victims. The Government did not act with any urgency when that suggestion came about from the International Independent Group of Eminent Persons. The Government has taken more than one year to bring that Bill to Parliament. The Supreme Court delivered judgment about ten days ago and the judgment was tabled in this House whereupon the Supreme Court suggested several amendments. The Government is only now distributing a paper containing certain proposed amendments. We do not know what these amendments are. We do not know whether these amendments are in keeping with the judgment of the Supreme Court. We do not know whether it conforms with the views expressed by the Supreme Court. So, I think, Sir, overall, the Government is acting in a very lackadaisical way. In fact, the Bill is being taken up today at the request of the Government. There was a meeting fixed at 10 oclock in the morning where the Hon. Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights was expected to explain to the Members of Parliament the provisions of this Bill. The Government Representatives at the Party Leaders Meeting wanted the Bill taken up in Parliament today but that meeting has still not been held. So, you would see, Sir, that the Government is confused; the Government does not know what to do. That is because the Government does not have its heart in the Bill. The Government is not interested in ensuring that there will be a law which will provide genuine protection to victims and witnesses in the matter of grave crimes. That would be my submission, Sir, and I must express my agreement with the other Members of the Opposition that the Government is approaching this whole question in a very, very unacceptable way. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, in view of the submissions that have been made both by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and the Hon. Sampanthan and several others, I think it is best to have a Standing Committee on this Bill. At the last minute, amendments have been given; a great deal of amendments are given in a number of pages. Sir, there are so many important people who have to be consulted before this Bill sees the light of day in this House. There is the involvement of the Police; there is the involvement of the

381 382

Judiciary; there is the involvement of the Attorney-General's Department and the involvement of the Unofficial Bar. There are so many people who have gone through the experience that has been referred to in this Bill. Therefore, there has to be a sufficient amount of consultation. The best thing to do is to have a Standing Committee, call up these witnesses and then ascertain for ourselves as to whether it is a comprehensive Bill or not. Sir, the second thing is, I think this great hurry is because there is a European delegation in town. So, you are trying to appease and satisfy them, saying that you are complying with all the requirements they have put down in their conditions. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga)

You are trying to qualify yourselves for GSP Plus by showing the delegation, oh! we are all clean; we are the best in the whole of Asia and I know the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe is quite good at that. Therefore, do not try to make this an opportunity to rush this Bill through and satisfy them. It is well and good. All are for this Bill; there is nobody against it. But the fact is, it is not a complete Bill. You are bringing in bits and pieces and trying to achieve some other objective. That is the complaint I have. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella)

Sir, the Bill has 36 Clauses, but we have got an equal number of amendments, nearly 40 amendments. Then, Sir, I would like to ask the Hon. Minister - the Preamble states, "To give effect to appropriate international norms..." - the Clause by which he is going to give effect to international norms. I would like to know immediately whether he could point out the relevant clause in this Bill whereby he wishes to guarantee international norms. I would like to know that immediately. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe )

Sir, first of all, I would like to inform very clearly to this House through you, as the Hon. Sampanthan just mentioned, this Bill was not a result of the Commission of Inquiry nor the IIGEP making recommendations. This was a process started as far back as 2004 by the Law Commission of Sri Lanka. So, this has a long history and the Attorney-General's Department took over the Bill in 2006 and it is the tenth draft that we are considering today of a long process. Secondly, the Cabinet of Ministers decided that this Bill would be an urgent Bill. The Supreme Court made a Determination and the Legal Draftsman had prepared the amendments in line with the Supreme Court Determination and those amendments have now been handed over to the honourable Members and the Party Leaders through you, Sir. The third point I would like to make is, I was not a party to the decision taken yesterday, but I was there on invitation last Monday at the Party Leaders' Meeting, where a clear decision was taken that this Bill would be taken up on the 19th, not today, and also a meeting will be convened today to brief the Hon. Members of Parliament about the salient features of the Bill by the Attorney-General's Department. Those representatives are here today, Sir, and they are waiting to do that soon after we take a decision on what we are going to do with the Bill. That briefing will also be an opportunity for Members of Parliament to seek clarifications from the experts who prepared this Bill. From what I understand, yesterday the Party Leaders had met and they have taken a decision to take up the Bill this morning and continue the Debate till Thursday where the Committee Stage will be held and the Bill will be put to a Vote in this House at 12.00 noon. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

At the request of the Government. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)

At the request of the Government or whoever. I have not seen the Minutes, Sir, but this is what I was told. Sir, we believe that sufficient time has been given for the Members of the Opposition to study the amendments because those are in their possession as of now. I do not know whether the Tamil and the English translations have also been provided. But, that is the responsibility of the House and I am sure, Sir, you will see to it that the English and the Tamil translations will also be provided to the Hon. Members of Parliament. So, what I suggest that we do is, we should allow the Debate to go on as the Hon. Amarasiri Dodangoda has now started

[ ]

2008 17 383 384

introducing the Bill. Anyway, you have taken a decision to suspend the Sittings for the unveiling of the portraits and once we come back, let us continue the Debate on the Second Reading today. When the Committee Stage starts on Thursday - . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan)

The Second Reading should continue on Thursday. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)

Okay. The Committee Stage also will be held on Thursday and at that point, the Members of the Opposition will be able to discuss clause by clause. Also, there are some amendments that they have suggested with us at the moment and we are going to give serious thought to it to see whether we can bring some of those in. But certainly, the amendments that we have now shared with the Hon. Members of Parliament of the Opposition can be discussed by them during the whole of Thursday, if they so wish. Let us take them up at the Committee Stage and seek the approval of the House. That is all there is to it. I do not think this important Bill should be delayed. This is something which is very important. Certainly, there have been requests from the international community to put this Bill in place, but that was not the reason why this Bill was brought in. Because, as I said earlier, it was as far back as 2004 that the process started. Certainly we would like to send a very positive message to our friends in the international community that our Government is interested in putting in place this valuable peace of legislation. I think this should not be scuttled; this should not be delayed. Let us look at this in a constructive manner. I believe there is sufficient time for the Members of Parliament of the Opposition to consider the amendments and let us take them up on Thursday at the Committee Stage. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe)

Hon. Speaker, if the Government wants to give priority to a certain legislation, presenting it in the House on a particular day, then they have a process to follow: to complete all the steps that need to be taken prior to the beginning of the Debate on the Second Reading of the Bill, which includes presenting the full legislation so that we can study it. This is a funny state of affairs. The Opposition has already given its amendments, but the Government is giving its amendments only now. We were able to give at least three or four amendments and we want all those amendments to be accepted. But, more than that, if you are bringing in a legislation, you must complete the process. Otherwise, you are making a mockery of this House. That is what we are complaining of.

This is an important piece of legislation. We all agree on that. But if this matter was taken up sometime back, at some stage it should have been sent to the appropriate Consultative Committee. Then, we all could have discussed the matter, finalized it, sent it to the Cabinet and then come back with the views of the Cabinet and finished it. Then this Debate may have even been a mere formality where everyone gets up and says, This is a good piece of legislation, we all agree with it, we must go ahead and implement it. That did not happen. The Government brought this as an urgent Bill. After the Supreme Court made its determination, about three weeks have lapsed before it came here. In between no steps were taken. Now, no one is saying, "Do not take up the Bill or scuttle it". We are just saying, "How are we going to proceed? Are we going to take it up on Thursday or are we going to take it up on Friday?" I mean, you need a little bit more time to go into it. For instance, now in the amendment you have produced a new Part IV, - Suspension of Institution of Criminal Proceedings. Then you have brought in under Clause 13 - "....contemporaneous or near contemporaneous audio-visual linkage;" So those are new aspects in the evidence. Certainly, that is something which we welcome. But it needs a bit of a study. The more important question that the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella posed is that the Preamble says, To give effect to appropriate international norms and best practices relating to the protection of victims of crime and witnesses. That is there in the amended Preamble also. But when you look at this Bill, there is no clause which refers to the international norms and best practices. So, I mean, it is a mockery of the Bill to put this in the Preamble and not to refer to it in the substantive body. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella)

Only in the cover. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe)

So what we are saying is, we must have a good piece of legislation but the Government has come up with amendments which even the Government does not know. We are only reading them now. This is not the way to pass legislation, not only with regard to this Bill but any other Bill in which the whole country is interested. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)

In the history of international best practices, I want to state very clearly, Sir, that the Bill does not only encompass conventional crimes in terms of witnesses and victims protection but also goes to the extent of looking at the larger definition of human rights in the context of the ICCPR, the International Covenant on Civil and

5 - PL003031 - (2008/06)

385 386

Political Rights. I can give not one example, I can give many examples where international best practices have been looked at and incorporated in this Bill. So, in the process of the Second Reading, we will certainly keep the House informed of the very specific instances where international best practices have been incorporated. The very fact that it has gone beyond the conventional definition in itself is in keeping with international best practices. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . - ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) - ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe)

One is, there is no definition of human rights in this Bill. Secondly, going on to best practices, after the Singarasa Judgement unless the Parliament passes legislation, we cannot apply them. That is all that I want to say. We will take it up further. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . , . 12.15 . .. 12.15 , . Sitting accordingly suspended till 12.15 p.m. and then resumed. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe - Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights) Hon. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to address this House in support of the Assistance and Protection to Victims of Crime and Witnesses Bill presented by my Colleague, the Hon. Minister of Justice and Law Reforms. Hon. Speaker, permit me at the outset to put into perspective, the significance of this landmark legislation. Witness protection and the provision of enhanced protection to victims of crime has been a long-felt need in Sri Lanka. The idea of a law to address issues relating to victims of crime and witness protection was first mooted as far back as 2000 by the National Centre for Victims of Crime with an emphasis on promoting victims rights. Sir, although the Law Commission of Sri Lanka did some initial work on drafting the legislation, the proposal was shelved for some time. Discussions on this legislation recommenced, Sir, in mid-2004, as I mentioned earlier. The Law Commission was charged with the drafting of the Bill and the initiative to prepare a first draft was taken as far back as 2005. The present Attorney-General took the lead in these efforts. The Bill currently before this House, underwent intense scrutiny and was subjected to discussions in many forums, both governmental and among the civil society. This Bill has had the benefit of the input of diverse segments of society and has also drawn the attention of international experts who were present in Sri Lanka to observe the work of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry. In fact, Sir, certain amendments suggested by the IIGEP were also incorporated when the eighth draft went before the Law Commission of Sri Lanka. All of them made valuable observations on the draft legislation. My own advisory committee comprising of civil society and human rights activists was invited to make comments on the legislation. His Excellency the President gave leadership to this effort and proposed the concept of this law to the Cabinet by a memorandum under his signature. Having given its mind to the need for and the importance of this Law, the Cabinet of Ministers decided to designate this Bill as one that is urgent in the national interest in terms of Article 122 of the Constitution, Sir. The Bill was consequently subject to the scrutiny of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka. The Supreme Court also suggested some improvements to the legislation and these will be moved during the Committee Stage of the Bill whenever that is held. It is a synthesis of the wide-ranging discussions and the several enhancements and modifications made that is being considered by this august Assembly, which will undoubtedly be of benefit to the legal system of Sri Lanka.

2008 17 391 392

Hon. Speaker, speaking from the standpoint as the Minister in charge of the subject of Human Rights, the Bill is especially welcome as it provides for two critical areas that are essential for the protection of human rights - the smooth functioning of the justice system and ultimately, the upholding of the rule of law. The twin focus of this Bill: victims of crime and violation of human rights on the one hand, and protection of witnesses on the other, are equally important facets that are interlinked. They protect the right to life and the security of the person, two important rights enshrined in international human rights instruments such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Sri Lanka is a State party. It also fulfils important obligations under other international instruments to which Sri Lanka is a party. Article 32 of the UN Convention against Corruption and Articles 24 and 25 of the Convention against Transnational Organized Crime require the State to provide protection and assistance to witnesses and victims. This Bill will substantially discharge Sri Lankas obligation in relation to the implementation of such conventions. There is, Hon. Speaker, not only a good deal of domestic interest, but also international interest in the enactment and implementation of this law. With the adoption of this Bill, Sri Lanka joins a handful of Asian countries including Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines that have a legislative regime catering to this important area. There is a vigorous debate in other Asian countries, notably India and Malaysia, as to the urgent need for adopting similar legislation. In global human rights fora such as the United Nations Human Rights Council, the international community has evinced great interest in this legislation and we have repeatedly stressed most recently during the adoption of the report of the Universal Periodic Review of Sri Lanka on the 13th of June, that Sri Lanka accords a great deal of importance to this legislation. Of course, the scheme of the law transcends human rights and extends to a range of judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings during which it is important that witnesses and victims are protected. Thus, proceedings in criminal matters and other formal judicial proceedings, proceedings before Commissions of Inquiry, Special Presidential Commissions of Inquiry, the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption as well as proceedings before the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka are covered by this law. Sir, the Bill before this Assembly has a specific human rights orientation. The rights and entitlements of victims and witnesses are founded on principles of equality and human dignity. These are the core concepts that underlie human rights. It gives effect to the seminal 1995 UN Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power. This Declaration enunciates important human rights principles relating to protection of victims not only of criminal offences but also those who are subject to violation of their human rights. Accordingly, the Bill takes a broad view of who is

considered to be a victim of crime. The Bill, in its Interpretation Clause, defines a victim not only as a person who has suffered the commission of a criminal offence against himself or herself but it goes much further. Any person whose constitutionally recognized fundamental rights are violated or whose rights under the recent ICCPR Act are violated is also considered a victim. The Bill also extends the definition to encompass family, dependents or persons with a close personal link to the person whose rights are violated. I must also acknowledge the contribution of members of the civil society who have highlighted this issue and made the inclusion of this very progressive provision possible. Hon. Speaker, the ultimate test of whether a legal and judicial system in fulfilling its primary purpose is if justice is meted out and is also seen to be meted out fairly and equitably. His Excellency the President saw it fit in 2006 to appoint a Commission of Inquiry to inquire into alleged serious violations of human rights. This is due to the commitment of the Government to fully investigate these alleged serious violations of human rights and to take steps to punish any perpetrators that the inquiries identify. It has been pointed out that the performance of the Commission of Inquiry was hampered by the absence of an effective witness protection scheme. To this end, the Commission established a special unit charged with victim and witness protection even before this law was put into place. That was to ensure that the proceedings of the Commission were fully facilitated in its attempts to uncover the truth behind theses deplorable incidents. Through this exercise, I believe valuable practical lessons have already been learnt which will make the implementation of the law even easier. Permit me, Hon. Speaker, to briefly place some of the more important features of this Bill before the House. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , .

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Sir, since we have compromised to suspend the Debate by 2.30 p.m., can we not continue till then? If the House agrees, if the Opposition agrees, then we can continue, Sir. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . 12.30 01.00 .

, , . Whereupon MR. SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. JOHN AMARATUNGA took the Chair. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Carry on, Hon. Minister. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Sir, as I was mentioning, the Bill starts out by clearly setting out its objects which include the implementation of the statutory scheme buttressed by the observance of

international norms, standards and best practices in this area. A clear provision of victims' and witnesses' rights and entitlements is also included. Accordingly, the rights of a victim include the right to be present and participate in criminal justice proceedings; the right to apply for and receive compensation for harm suffered as a result of being a victim of crime; the right to be informed of proceedings and events in the criminal justice process, of legal rights and remedies, and of available services; the right to protection from intimidation and harassment; the right to restitution from the offender; the right to be represented by a counsel and the right to be medically treated for any mental or physical injury suffered as a result of being a victim of crime. Sir, the law not only stipulates the rights and entitlements of such persons, but it also provides for a mechanism for the promotion, protection, enforcement and enjoyment of such rights and entitlements. The law also prescribes offences and sets out custodial and financial penalties for offences committed against victims and witnesses of crime. The Bill goes on to provide for suspension of prosecutions in special circumstances having regard to surrounding facts and the interest of the victim and the State. Sir, the Bill also establishes a coherent and practical institutional framework that will enable co-operation and co-ordination among the various stakeholders in the criminal justice and human rights promotion and protection systems. The law creates a National Authority for the Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses to advance, guide and direct the promotion and protection of rights of victims of crime and witnesses. An Advisory Commission chaired by the Chief Justice will be set up to advise the Board of Management of the Authority in relation to the performance of its functions. The Authority is empowered to compensate victims of crime and provide immediate relief till the court orders the payment of comprehensive compensation. To this end, the "Victims of Crime and Witnesses Assistance and Protection Fund" for the payment of compensation to victims has been created. The Authority is required to establish a fund primarily for the purpose of providing interim compensation to victims of crime and generally to provide financial resources necessary to give effect to the objective of the law. The Fund is made sustainable through innovative provision being included in the Bill to recover monies from convicted persons both as compensation and as a contribution to the Fund. A clear right to compensation is included in the Bill, Sir, and victims are entitled to equitable compensation for the harm suffered. Sir, the contribution of law enforcement authorities is essential for the operation of this law. In support of the arrangements in the Bill that I referred to earlier, Victims and Witnesses Assistance and Protection Division in the Police Department to implement an

2008 17 395 396

effective witness assistance and protection programme is also envisaged. This new division which will function under a Senior Deputy Inspector-General of Police who will also sit on the Board of the Authority, is empowered to provide a wide range of protection services including housing, employment, re-location, finances and re-identification and I might add that this is in line with international best practices. Mr. Presiding Member, I must also refer to an important facet of the Bill which has caught the attention of the general public over the past few weeks. It is the matter of reception of live, audio-visual testimony from witnesses who, for one reason or another, are unable to be physically present in court or before a commission. Our law already provides for the admission of pre-recorded audio and video evidence. This is the first time that such live evidence is expressly made admissible. This is an important provision, Sir, as it enables persons under threat to give evidence from a safe location whether in Sri Lanka or overseas. Now, Sir, there are also additional safeguards to be incorporated in this Bill to ensure the protection of victims and witnesses. The law sets out the duties and responsibilities of the judicial officers and the public officers towards the promotion and protection of rights and entitlements of victims of crime and witnesses as set out in the legislation. The assistance and protection which may be provided to victims and witnesses by the courts or Commission of Inquiry includes the adoption of special measures to protect the best interest of the child victims and witnesses; to conduct judicial proceedings in camera; to prevent the victims of crime or witnesses unnecessarily harassed, intimidated or influenced by seeing the accused present at venue of the trial or inquiry; and to prevent the identity of the victims of crime and witnesses from being disclosed. This is once again in line with international best practices. Sir, I would be failing in my duty if I did not acknowledge with gratitude the efforts of the Attorney-Generals Department, the Ministry of Justice and Law Reforms, the Law Commission of Sri Lanka and the Legal Draftsmans Department for their tireless efforts in developing this legislation. I must also thank those members of the civil society and the international community who demonstrated their deep and abiding interest in improving and adopting this law. I look forward to their continued cooperation in the future in making the legal principles a matter of practical reality. Finally, Sir, I must stress that the best statutory scheme and letter of law in the statute book does not suffice to achieve the object and purpose of the legislation. What is of critical importance, Sir, is the implementation of the law. In this regard, my Ministry is committed to ensuring the successful implementation of this significant addition to the body of laws of Sri Lanka. Institutional development, training, capacity building, resource

allocation and oversight - not least by this august Assembly to which the authority must report annually, are all elements that contribute to the achievement of statutory goals embodied in the law. We plan to work closely with the other key stakeholders in ensuring that these goals are achieved. I take this opportunity to commend this legislation through you, Sir, to the Hon. Members of this House for their favourable consideration and I am certain that their recognition of the undeniable merits of this law will be forthcoming. Thank you very much, Sir. ( ) (The Presiding Member) . . [..12.39] ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , . , . . , . . . , . The spirit of the law is not observed. . ; ; . . , 1500 . . Not a single order given by the Human Rights Commission has been implemented. ? ? ? . There are enough laws in this country, Sir. What is lacking is implementation. I would like to ask the Hon. Minister a simple question. Is there a rule of law in Sri Lanka today? Take for instance the incident that occurred in the Rupavahini Corporation. We know what happened. Thugs went into the Rupavahini Corporation and assaulted some people. Where is the rule of law, Hon. Minister? Then, according to this Bill, Sir, - Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, I need your indulgence, please. Do not pretend that you cannot hear. - [Interruption.] Do not pretend. You always pretend. You come to Parliament once in a way. - [Interruption.] - Now under this Bill, who

397 398

will assist you in looking after the witnesses? It is the Police. The Police will help you to look after the witnesses. Is the Police independent today? Can the Police act independently? - [Interruption.] So, all this is nonsense. Last year, you presented a Bill to protect human rights. At that time I told you that it was not sufficient. But you said, No, it is sufficient. What did the international community say? They said that it was an eyewash. The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama was the one who presented it. You also spoke in support of it. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) I have a right. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Anyway, if you read the Preamble of this, you will find that it states, I quote: ..VICTIMS OF CRIME AND WITNESSES ASSISTANCE AND PROTECTION DIVISION OF THE SRI LANKA POLICE DEPARTMENT; Is the Police able to act independently today? Before you implement this, you have to implement the Seventeenth Amendment which gives a certain degree of autonomy to the Police. . . . . , . . . , . . . . . 24 . - [ ] ( ) (The Presiding Member) Please do not disturb. [Interruption.] Hon. Member, please take your seat. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] Parliament - [ ]

Therefore, Sir, this Bill is an eyewash. You are talking of witnesses protection. Sir, there was an incident in Trincomalee where several students were killed. Their parents gave evidence over satellite to the Udalagama Commission. What did they say? They said that when their children were killed, a Minister of the Government telephoned them and said, Withdraw the complaint. I will give you a car and a house in Colombo That was said by the fathers of the victims. A Government Minister, a very senior Minister, had telephoned the fathers of the victims and told them, Withdraw the complaint. I will give you a car and a house in Colombo. This is how they safeguard human rights. This is all an eyewash. So, if you are genuine in implementing this, I would advise you to first implement the Seventeenth Amendment. An independent Police Commission and an independent Election Commission; if those Commissions are in existence this law will be valid. For the last two years, hundreds of people have been abducted in Colombo. I ask you, "Have you prosecuted even one?" Tell me how many people have been prosecuted. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Do you want me to answer now? ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Yes. How many people have been prosecuted ? ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Well, in the first place I am not in charge of prosecutions. But, I can tell you from the information that I have, as a result of a name being mentioned in this very House, there has been an indictment served on a former air force person. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) One indictment - ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Not only him, there are four others. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) All right. Finally, say five. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) But, let me also tell you Hon. Member, I am also not satisfied with the level of indictments which have been

[ ]

2008 17 399 400

served. We are working very hard towards improving the situation. There should be better progress, I agree with you. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) How many abductions had taken place. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, in the last two and a half years 10,000 people - combatants, civilians, people abducted - have died in Sri Lanka. When the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe was the Prime Minister, only 15 people died because of the Millennium City incident, just 15 people, and they tried to show that the whole of Sri Lanka was being killed. Sir, 10,000 people have died in Sri Lanka and hundreds of innocent people who were not related to this conflict have been abducted. How many people have you prosecuted? You cannot say, "I am not satisfied." If you are not satisfied you just step down. You cannot say, "I am not satisfied" and stay in the Government. If you are not satisfied, you must act according to your conscience and step down. Now, Sir, you know what happened at the Udalagama Commission. They were getting evidence from abroad. What did the family members of the slain students do? They fled the country. The witnesses were abroad. There was no funding for satellite evidence. Then, apparently some foreign embassy had come forward and given some funds for that purpose. Because all of us, those in the Government as well as in the Opposition, Sir, ultimately wanted to find out the truth. What happened at the Commission? Certain people made objections because a foreign embassy was funding. The funding was cut off. Then, Sir, to add to the misery, the money that was allocated by the President's Fund was also terminated. So, - ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Shall I explain that ? ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) You explain when you speak. You are always explaining but no result. You go to foreign countries and explain, no result. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) If you want to know the truth, give me also an opportunity. That is all.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Before the Human Rights Commission vote, he was boasting over television saying that 150 countries are voting for Sri Lanka. But what happened? We got chased out. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Because we wanted our country to win, not like you. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) You should have resigned. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) You all are the traitors. You do not want the country's image protected. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) You betrayed the voters. . You betrayed the human rights of all the UNP people who voted for you. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) What about you? Were you not on this side too? ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) I crossed over after dissolution, not like you. . . . . . [ ] . . Do not talk nonsense. You betrayed your voters. You have deprived them of their human rights. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) I will answer that later. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) I crossed over after dissolution. The Hon. Wickremasinghe called me before the dissolution. . , . .

401 402

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) You started discussions when you were on this side. What are you talking about? We know what happened. You were talking with the UNP while you were seated here, not after the dissolution. What are you talking about? ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) I had been talking, I agree. But, I did not want to betray. . . . ? 60000 . . . [ ] ? ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. I think, the Hon. Member should withdraw that because that is a total untruth. ( ) (The Presiding Member) If it is not correct Hon. Minister, you can deny it. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) No, I want it to be expunged from Hansard. Sir, it is a point of Order that I am raising. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) I will not withdraw. ( ) (The Presiding Member) I do not think Hon. Minister, - ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) I want you to peruse that particular reference that he is referring to. There was no name mentioned and this is complete mud-slinging. I want him to withdraw that. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella)

This is not mud-slinging. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member)

Let the Hon. Member continue. You carry on. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)

This is wrong, Sir. Do not bring in this kind of politics. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella)

I accept full responsibility for what I am saying. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)

I did cross over. I crossed over as a result of a decision that I personally took. ( ) (The Presiding Member)

You can answer in your winding up speech.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)

But, I have never during these two and a half years ever criticized any UNPer or the Party that I was elected from. I never have done that. I do not think he should come here and say this kind of thing. This is wrong. This is cheap politics. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, my humble submission is that a person who has betrayed the trust of his very own voters and sat on the other side for the sake of the Ministry is not qualified to safeguard the human rights of the people of Sri Lanka. I accept full responsibility for what I said. He telephoned the parents of the victims who were killed and told them, You withdraw the complaint. I will give you a car and a house in Colombo". ( ) (Hon. Members)

Shame! ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)

Sir, I rise to a point of Order, once again. I am making this statement -

2008 17 403 404

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella)

I take full responsibility. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)

Sir, I am on a point of Order. ( ) (The Presiding Member)

Please give way. The Hon. Samarasinghe is on a point of Order. What is it? ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)

Sir, the point of Order I want to raise is - [Interruption.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage - Minister of Power) The Hon. Minister is on a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)

This reference is a blatant untruth. It is a reference to mislead this House. ( ) (The Presiding Member) So, you can deny it in your winding up speech. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)

Sir, I am telling you very clearly that there was no such telephone call ever made and how am I in a position to offer a house to someone? Am I in a position to offer a house to someone? ( ) (The Presiding Member)

Your denial will go on record. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe)

What I have always done is to constructively work towards finding out the truth about the incidents which I have very clearly condemned at all times.

( ) (The Presiding Member)

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) I urge you to bring the Reports of the Udalagama Commission to Parliament and go through them. Then, you will see who is telling the truth. I urge you to bring the evidence given through satellite by the parents abroad of those two young boys who were killed, and go through them. That is clearly there, because I followed this very closely. I do not speak without responsibility. I followed this very closely. So, therefore, Sir, - ( ) (An Hon. Member) Commission ? ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . . record . It is in black and white. Sir, the biggest problem we have today is to get the support of the international community. As I said earlier, the UN Human Rights Commission, the ILO and the European Union have consistently said that there are enough laws in Sri Lanka, what is lacking is implementation. I do not blame the judges. I do not blame the Attorney-General's Department. They frame the laws. Sir, judges are not the investigators. Police have to help the judges to come to the correct conclusion by conducting proper investigations. What is happening today is that the rule of law is implemented only against the Opposition. A Member of Parliament of the Opposition or a supporter of the Opposition on a minor infringement is before courts. So this is the problem in Sri Lanka today. Can you tell me honestly what happened to the Mervyn Silva incident? What happened to the Rs. 15 billion fraud of the COPE Report? Where is the law? Where is the law implemented on the culprits? Then what about the Rs. 3000 million squandered on Mihin Air? Where is the law today? I do not blame the judges. I do not blame the Attorney-Generals Department. Today the judges have to file a Fundamental Rights application to get a pay hike. This is the situation in the country today. We all respect the judges. Their needs should be attended to. They are not like us. They lead a very private life. Even they are finding it difficult to live. Now, take the salary structure of the judges. There is an anomaly with regard to the allowances. As they go high, the allowances become small. It should be the converse. When you get promotions, the allowances should increase but as far as the judges are concerned it is not so. They made

405 406

representations, the Government did not listen and ultimately they had to file a Fundamental Rights application. Actually, we should not bring the judges to this level. We should call them up, discuss their problems and give them the relevant salary increase. Sir, as you rightly pointed out, all this is because there is a delegation from the EU in Sri Lanka. They are going through the human rights record of the Government. We, as Sri Lankans want our business interests looked after. We want the GSP Plus to be given to the Government of Sri Lanka. But at the same time, we are justified in telling the international community, "In Sri Lanka human rights are being grossly violated". It is an insult to the country, it is a shame. When we kill our own people, it is a shame. . . - ( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) , 1988 . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . 1988, 89 , . There was a problem, we agree. There is no need to hide it. There was a problem. ( ) (The Hon. Mano Ganesan) . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . Very good. But, at that time the UNP Government - I was not in the Government, I was in the Opposition - I know at that time President Premadasa told the international community, "We have a problem in Sri Lanka because of poverty". We never said to the international community, You are wrong. . This Government says that the international community is wrong, when they point out some problems in the country. But President Premadasa said, "We have a problem in this country because of poverty. Help us". What did the international community do? They gave us 500 garment factories which alleviated the poverty in the rural areas. So, be like him. Tell the international community that we have a problem without telling them, "You are wrong. You are wrongly informed" and abusing them. When Sir John Holmes, UN Under Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief came here, what did the then Chief Government Whip say? He said that Sir Holmes is a terrorist. So, all I can say is, the Government

is in the dock as far as the international community is concerned. You are committing suicide internationally because of your own follies. We are not to be blamed. Even when the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa was a Member of Parliament in 1990, what did he do? He went round the world and pointed out various things. I will read out what he said on 20th October, 1990.

. This is an unprecedented situation where cases of abductions, cases of enforced disappearances have become the order of the day. Who is answerable? Who is responsible? It is the duty of the Government - duly elected and duly constituted Government of Sri Lanka - to trace the culprits and also to trace the victims who are yet to be found.

While cases of disappearances and cases of abductions continue day in and day out, we find the Government trotting out pious declarations and solemn reasoning in regard to the Bill that has been presented today. I dare say, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that this is in fact a shameless act, a shameless flaw on the part of the Government to hoodwink the international community which has now come to understand as to what has been going on in this little and beautiful island of Sri Lanka. I heard the Minister, the Hon. Felix Perera stating that we do not find anything that has been taking place in Iraq happening in Sri Lanka. If I have understood him correctly, thanks to the interpretation, he further stated, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that unlike what America has been doing in Iraq, we are not doing anything of that sort. Do it ! I say. I dare say, please do it. That is the only thing that has been left out. In the North, the Government has been resorting to - ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please ! Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees will now take the Chair. , [ ] .

, , [ . ] . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. RAMALINGAM CHANDRASEKAR] took the Chair.

. ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, in the North, we find the defenceless and innocent civilians at the receiving end of indiscriminate bombing. What is that? Is it not terrorism? I dare say, it is state terrorism. At the same time, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I dare say, that any bomb attack or any explosion attributed to the LTTE, in which we find civilians are the casualties, that is also nothing but terrorism. The Hon. Felix Perera further stated that, we, the Members of the Tamil National Alliance, are unable to speak out. We speak out on behalf of the people who are living not only in the North and the East but also in the South. Our people, our Tamil-speaking people are unable to cry out and openly accuse the perpetrators of the serious violations of human rights for the simple reason that they know if they dare do that, what would be in store for them. Without mincing words, we condemn terrorism in all its forms. Whether it is the state terrorism unleashed by the Government of Sri Lanka or the militant terrorism unleashed by the LTTE, we condemn it. We have done it in the past; we are doing it now and we would continue to do it as long as it continues to be perpetrated. Let there be no mistake. But while we, the TNA do this, what is the Government doing? You are piloting a Bill pontificating to the whole world, pretending as if you are the saviours of the basic fundamental rights of the people solemnly enshrined in the Constitution, and also all the other human rights declared as sacred by very many international covenants, the Government continues to be "a party" and more often than not "the party" in regard to the continuing violations of human rights of our own defenceless people. That is exactly why, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, we do not believe the Government. We will never believe this Government because this Government has lost its credibility long, long ago. I think my Friend, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe would understand me. He may not agree with me but would understand me and also he can understand the seriousness with which I charge this Government in regard to the issue of violation of human rights. Internationally, China is on the side of the Government of Sri Lanka. We know what China has been doing. The Government of China with its own iron boots continued to suppress the basic aspirations of the people of Tibet has to be on the side of the Government of Sri Lanka because, as the saying goes, "Birds of a feather flock together". Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, today the country is facing a very serious crisis. It is a very serious crisis. The very survival of the people, I mean the civilians, whether in the North or the South, is at stake. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , .

. ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) I will take another two or three minutes, please. People are afraid as to what is in store for them when they are out of their houses. I think this is the time when the Government needs to do a rethinking. The Government has to do a rethinking. In this continuing military conflict in consequence of which we find the present situation is being exploited by sections of the security apparatus, sections of those who are aligned with the Government and all the mercenaries belonging to the Tamil groups who are aligned with the Government, I beg to say, that the time has at least now come for the Government to have a rethinking in regard to the whole question. In this continuing military conflict

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member - . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, bear with me for a moment. In this military conflict there is a third party. One party is the Government of Sri Lanka. The other party is the LTTE. There is a third party, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the innocent civilians.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, your time is over. Please wind up. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Srikantha) Give me one more minute, please. It is the basic human rights of this third party, whether they be Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims or Burghers, that is at stake today because of the continuing situation. The Government should rise to the occasion, call for a ceasefire and restart the negotiations so that within a short and stipulated timeframe, we would be able to know whether we can resolve this question politically. I leave it now and my Leader who would continue on Thursday will deal with this subject in a very detailed and analytical manner. I thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The Hon. V. Puththirasigamoney.

. ( ) ( . - ) (The Hon. V. Puththirasigamoney - Deputy Minister of Justice ) Thank you, Sir, for giving me the Floor. I am very happy to speak after my good Friend, the Hon. N. Srikantha. All the speakers who spoke before me supported this Bill. But they had a doubt as to whether this Bill would be implemented in toto as expected. I would like to say that when the draft Constitution of India was submitted to Parliament for approval, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constituent Assembly, Dr. Ambedkar said, I submit this piece of paper, but, the implementation of it depends on the people who are seated here". Likewise, I think our Government has the courage and commitment to implement the provisions of this Bill once it is passed into law. Even the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella had doubts about this Bill and he was saying that the Government has brought this piece of legislation to hoodwink - that is the exact word he used - the international community. Sri Lanka has had turbulent times and even now it is so. When it comes to the implementation of certain legislations, there are certain norms and practices that are followed. When we speak about international norms and practices, they are not written anywhere. So, nobody can expect everything to be explicit. As the Hon. Kiriella is aware, most of the international agencies, the UN and its agencies say is that when it comes to the implementation of laws, each country could have its own practices and norms. But, I do not think it includes human rights. Human rights is different from the others. But with regard to all the other matters, it is so. This piece of legislation is welcomed by the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition said that the Preamble has been newly introduced. I would say, it has only been recast without losing its original text. We will be discussing all other matters and the amendments that were suggested by the Supreme Court on Thursday. With regard to human rights, we know that the Supreme Court has given certain judgments which everybody appreciates. Though the Opposition says that human rights are being violated everyday, the Supreme Court is straightforward in giving judgments on them. I, belonging to a minority community, am not going to relate all what it is. With regard to the removal of checkpoints, arresting of people in the lodges in Colombo what did the Supreme Court do? The Supreme Court can interpret the law for the betterment of the people, protecting their human rights. That is my belief. The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights, spoke at length spelling out all the salient points in this piece of legislation, because he was very much involved in

2008 17 427 428

bringing this up before the House. So, I am not going to speak at length, because we are going to deal with the amendments which have been submitted by the Opposition and also the long list of amendments submitted by the Government, on Thursday.

I believe that this piece of legislation would protect everyone. We know that in our country today, when somebody sees a murder taking place on the road, he will look the other side and go. Because, if he has to give evidence before courts, that will become the biggest problem for him because he feels he would not be protected. Not only that. Even when there is a domestic violence - if the next door person hears the husband assaulting his wife - he does not go there and ask as to what is happening because he thinks that if he does so, he has to go before the courts and waste all his time there. All of them have to be protected. So, this piece of legislation is going to protect such witnesses, so that people in future will be able to come forward and give evidence in courts without any fear.

A salient feature that I would like to mention here is that we are going to have a separate division in the Police Department for the protection of victims of crime and witnesses, once this Bill is passed into law. Another salient feature in this Bill is that there would be a Fund established which will be used to protect victims of crime and witnesses.

So far the Opposition has not spoken anything against this Bill. That is what I would like to mention here. They did not say that this Bill is bad or any clause in the Bill is bad. Every Member appreciated it. All what they say is that they do not trust the Government which is always the Oppositions point of view. I do not find fault with the Opposition because they have a right to say that. The Government is committed to protect the people in this country and I assure you that we will do everything possible to protect the victims of crime and witnesses once this piece of legislation is passed into law. Thank you.

S. Sriskandarajah, I The Petitioner is a Doctor of Medicine by profession and a Member of Parliament belonging to United National Party. The Petitioner was first appointed to Parliament from the national list of the United National Party in 1994. He thereafter been elected to the Parliament on three successive occasions as a candidate for the United National Party for the Gampaha District at the general elections held in 2000, 2001 and 2004. In 2001 the Petitioner was appointed as the Minister of Rehabilitation Resettlement and Refugees. Upon an appraisal of the threat to the petitioners security a contingent of 19 police officers were entrusted with providing security to the Petitioner with a jeep and two motor cycles along with communication equipments. Her Excellency the President dissolved Parliament in or about December 2003 and the general election was held in March 2004 and a new government was formed under the leadership of Her Excellency the President on or about 2nd April 2004 by the United People Freedom Alliance (UPFA). The Petitioner was re-elected to Parliament as a candidate of the opposition United National Party. The Petitioner submitted that shortly thereafter his security contingent was reduced by more than 50% in number and the composition of the security contingent then comprised I Inspector of Police, 2 Police Sergeants, 3 Police Constables and 2 Police Drivers totaling 8 Personnel with one Jeep and 2 motor cycles. The Petitioner further submitted that by letter dated 15.02.2004 he requested the then Inspector General of Police to provide him with additional security. For the reasons that his functions while he was a Minister had necessitated frequent visit to LTTE controlled areas, his public duties exposed to a high degree of vulnerability, he is continuing with his humanitarian work in the North and East of the country, he has been vehemently critical of the policies of the UPFA government in the handling the peace process and his views was featured often in the media. He has also through his counsel requested the good office of the United Nations by letter of 10.06.2004 addressed to the Secretary General of the United Nations to persuade the Government to enhance the Petitioners security. He made a further complain to the United Nations Human Right Commission (UNHRC) to request the Government of Sri Lanka to provide him with adequate security. In response to this request the UNHRC informed the Government to submit their observation to them. On or about 9th September 2004 the Government of Sri Lanka through its Permanent Mission to the United Nations, agreed to provide additional protection to the Petitioner, when it becomes necessary. It is important to note that the above observations were made when the Petitioner, in the capacity of a Member of Parliament, was provided with the security comprised of 1 Inspector of Police, 2 Police Sergeants, 3 Police Constables and 2 Police Drivers totaling 8 personal with one Jeep and 2 motor cycles. The Petitioner by his letter of 18.10.2004 once again brought it to the notice of the UNHRC that the State Party has not taken any steps to investigate the death threats to the Petitioner and had failed to provide adequate security to him. The Petitioner has also stated that he made a request by his letter dated 4.11.2004 to the Minister of Public Security Law and Order not to reduce the security contingent any further. The Petitioner contended that despite the request of enhancement of security his security was reduced on 08.12.2004 to 4 personnel which consist of 2 Police Sergeants and 2 Police Constables and his back-up vehicle was also withdrawn. By his letter dated 10.12.2004 he brought to the notice of Hon. Minister of Public Security Law and Order on the reduction of his security without notice. He in the said letter informed him that there is an imminent danger to his life and requested the immediate restoration of his original security arrangements. The Petitioner made a complaint to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka about the reduction of his security and his exposure to grave consequences due to lack of security. Consequent to the complaint and after inquiring into the matter the Chairperson of the said Commission by her letter dated 27.12.2004 recommended Her Excellency the President that the Petitioners former security should be restored. The Petitioner submitted that he by his letters dated 12.01.2005 to 1st and 2nd Respondent requested to restore his security as recommended by the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka. The Chairman National Police Commission by his letter dated 13th January 2005 requested the Inspector General of Police (1st Respondent) to give effect to the recommendation of the Human Rights Commission to

restore the Petitioners former level of security. The Speaker by his letters dated 13.01.2005 and 11.12.2005 addressed to the 1st Respondent requested the 1st Respondent to adhere to the decision of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka and the decision of the UNHRC to provide adequate security. In the above circumstances the Presidents Counsel who is appearing for the Petitioner has submitted that the Petitioner is restricting his prayer of the petition to a writ of Mandamus against the 1st and 2nd Respondent or their successors in office (1A, 2A Respondents) to provide a jeep or other suitable vehicle and two police drivers. The 1st Respondent submitted that the security has been provided based on the security assessment at the given time. On 27.01.2001 the Petitioner though not holding cabinet portfolio had been provided with : 2 Inspectors, 2 Police Sergeants, 10 Constables, 2 Police Constable Drivers, 2 Woman Constables and two Home Guards. After the General election held in December 2001 the Petitioner was granted a Ministerial portfolio in the Government. The Security was increased to the level of a Cabinet Minister, i. e. : 1 Inspector of Police, 3 Police Sergeants, 11 Constables, 2 Woman Constables, 2 Police Constable Drivers, a Police jeep equipped with communication equipments and 2 motor cycles deployed from the Ministerial Security Division. Following the General Election held in April 2004 the Petitioner was elected as a Member of Parliament. Taking into consideration the fears expressed by the Petitioner the then Inspector General of Police ordered to provide a special security contingent consisting of one Sub Inspector, 5 Police Sergeants/Police Constables, 2 Police Constable Drivers and a jeep and a motorcycle to the Petitioner. On 8.12.2004 the security was suddenly reduced to : 2 Constables, 2 Sergeants and 2 motor cycles. At present the Petitioner was provided with 8 security personnel including one Inspector of Police, 2 Police Sergeants, 5 Police Constables and one motor cycle together with necessary radio equipments. The learned Senior State Counsel submitted that the Petitioner is not entitled in law any security personnel from the state and he is also not entitled to any backup vehicle from the state. He also submitted, that circular dated 23rd November 1994(IR2) regarding the entitlement of Security for V.V.I.P stipulates the number of security personnel that could be provided to a Member of Parliament i. e. only 2 Pss/Pcc. Further by the letter of her Excellency the President dated 13.02.2004 (IRI) the Inspector General of Police was directed to withdraw any additional security provided to Member of Parliament who are no longer holding ministerial portfolio. According to Circular No CSA/PI/40 dated 23rd October 2006 issued by His Excellency the President, a Cabinet Minister is only entitled to a security contingent of six personnel and a security vehicle a non Cabinet Minister is only entitled to a security contingent of 5 personnel and a security vehicle. The learned Senior State Counsel relied on the judgment in Senerath and others I Chandrika Bandaranayike Kumarathunga and other [SC (FR) Application No 503/2005 (SC Minutes of 03.05.2007)] and submitted that the Petitioner is not entitled for a security vehicle. The Petitioner contended that this case has no relevance as this case deals with the facilities granted to the former President of Sri Lanka which has exceeded the entitlement statutorily provided for by the Presidents Entitlement Act No.4 of 1986. The security provided to the Petitioner before and after he held the ministerial portfolio despite the above circulars and directions is not less than 8 security personnel, jeep and motor cycle. Even at present he is provided with 8 security personnel with radio equipments and a motor cycle and two home guards. This shows that the said circulars and directions are only a guideline but in appropriate cases the security was given over and above that is stipulated in the said circulars and

2008 17 435 436

directions. The 1A Respondent in his affidavit dated 21st of November 2007 admitted that after the Circular No CSA/PI/40 was issued, on a special directive issued by His Excellency the President three Police Department vehicles have been provided to three VVIP who are facing very high security threat. The above facts show that providing security to a Member of Parliament or to a VVIP is depend upon the security assessment in relation to that VVIP and not strictly confined to circulars and policy decisions. The Petitioners submission is that he is satisfied with the security personnel that is provided event at the moment but what he complains is that the security vehicle given to him to provide security was withdrawn when there is continues request by him and other organizations to provide additional security. In this regard the 1st Respondent submitted that the security vehicle was withdrawn from the Petitioner not based on any circular, policy decision or on security assessment but purely on the statements made by the Chief Personal Security Officer of the Petitioner, Inspector Mahindapala Suriyawanca and Police Constable Driver 12004 Jayawardana, to Director of the Ministerial Security Division Senior Superintendent of Police R.P.S.K.Rajapakshe on 06.11.2004. By these statements it was revealed that the allocated personnel and vehicles were not properly utilized for the security of the VIP (Petitioner) but for other purposes. As such the jeep along with PSD 1, Police Constable Driver 1, Police Sergeant and Personal Security Officer was withdrawn on 08.12.2004 from the security provided to the Petitioner. The Petitioner contended that the decision to withdraw the police officers and the jeep given for the security, for the above reason was made without giving the Petitioner a hearing. He further contended that he categorically denied the said allegations and made it known to the Director M. S. D. by his letter date 14.03.2005 that his security was withdrawn without offering him and opportunity to answer those purported allegations and without holding and impartial inquiry. In these circumstances the Petitioner contended that the said decision to withdraw the police officers and the jeep is bad in law hence a mandamus to be issued against the 1st Respondent to restore the jeep given to provide security to the Petitioner. The importance of adhering to the audi alterum partem rule before a decision adversely affecting a person is made has been emphasized in numerous decided cases in Sri Lanka and abroad. In Gunadasa V Attorney - General and Others [1989] 2 Sri L R 130 at 133 A. de Z. Gunawardana, J held : Thus it is seen that the petitioner had no opportunity of clarifying any matter or asking any questions relevant to the evidence given by the said two witnesses. In fact, material very relevant to the matters in issue have been spoken to by the said two witnesses. It has been said by Lord Denning in the case of Kanda vs. Government of Malaya 1962 Ac 322 that, If the right to be heard is to be a real right which is worth anything, it must carry with it a right in the accused man to know the case which is made against him. He must know what evidence has been given and what statements have been made affecting him and then he must be given a fair opportunity to correct or contradict them. Hence the failure to give to the petitioner a fair opportunity to correct or contradict the said witnesses when they gave evidence, in my view has occasioned a violation of the principle of natural justice, that a mans defence must always be fairly heard. The non observation of the said principle of natural justice, would consequently amount to an error on the face of the record, which would attract the remedy of Writ of Ceitiorari, Wade dealing with such a situation in his book Administrative Law (5th Edition) at page 419 states,

When an administrative act or decision is vitiated by a breach of natural justice, the court may award any appropriate remedies, the remedy will frequently be certiorari to quash, on the footing that the vitiated decision is void or a nullity. In Jayawickrama v Prof. W. D. Lakshman, Vice Chancellor, University of Colombo (1998) 2 Sri L R 235 Fernando J held : The decision to refuse Board Certification was taken on the Basis of adverse comments by Dr. Davis which comments were entertained without giving the petitioner an opportunity of defending herseIf, in breach of the audi alteram partem rule. Hence the decision of the PGIM was fatally flawed In this instant case the allegation leveled against the Petitioner by the Personal Security Officer of the Petitioner and Police Constable Driver to Director of Ministerial Division, that the allocated personnel and vehicles are not properly utilized for the security of the VIP (Petitioner) are serious allegations and the 1st Respondent has stated in his affidavit that the decision to withdraw the jeep and the police constable driver was based only on the above allegation. The Respondents contended that the Petitioner is not entitled to a hearing as he was only granted a privilege. The Petitioner contended that the contention that granting security to the Petitioner is a privilege is misconceived as the Petitioner is entitled to protection in terms of Section 56 of the Police Ordinance and Article 12 of the Constitution. It has been held in Sundarkaran V Bharathi [1989] 1 Sri L R 46 at page 60 that even the withdrawal of a privilege is subject to the principles of natural justice. In this case Amarasinghe J observed : It has been repeatedly recognized that no man is to be deprived of his property without having an opportunity of being heard. Even if what he had was mere permission to which the Appellant Petitioner had no legal entitlement or claim of right, the refusal of the permission which had previously been granted I think may be at least sufficiently comparable to the act of taking away property so that the audi alteram partem rule will apply. It is common ground that the Petitioner was not given a fair opportunity to defend him or to correct or contradict the statement made by the above two Police Officers. The Petitioner must know what statements have been made affecting him and then he must be given a fair opportunity to correct or contradict them. As this opportunity was not given to the Petitioner that there is an error in the face of the record (the record in this case is the decision it self) and therefore the decision to withdraw the jeep and the police driver from the Petitioner is bad in law. In this application the Petitioner has not sought a writ of certiorari to quash the decision to withdraw the jeep but he has sought a mandamus to direct the Respondents to provide to the Petitioner. Mandamus is often used as an adjunct to certiorari. A mandamus is granted without certiorari, the necessary implication is that the defective decision is a nullity, for it is only on this assumption that the mandamus can operate. A simple mandamus therefore does the work of certiorari automatically (Administrative Law by H. W. R. D. Wade & C. F. Forsyth Ninth Edition at page at 625) The learned Presidents Counsel sought a mandamus not only on the basis that the withdrawal of the Jeep and the Police Driver is bad in law but also on the basis that the Petitioner has a right to these protection on the basis of legitimate expectation. The courts in Sri Lanka and other countries have taken the stance that they will uphold legitimate expectations where such expectations have been granted by public representations or by past practice. Gunawardana J (P / (CA) (as he them was ) In Wickremaratne v Jayaratne and other [2001] 3 Sri L R 161 at 178 held : The doctrine of legitimate expectation is not limited to cases involving a legitimate expectation of a hearing before some right or expectation was affected, but is also extended to situations even where no right to be head was available or existed but fairness required a public body or official to act in compliance with its public undertakings and assurances. Simon Brown LJ explained this aspect in R. v. Devon Country Council, ex parts Baker and another 1995 1 All ER 73 in which the concept of

437 438

legitimate expectation was used to refer to the fair procedure itself i.e. that the applicant claims to have a legitimate expectation that public authority will act fairly towards him. It is not procedurally fair for the State to have promised the petitioner an extent of land 2RR 21 PP in extent upon this surrendering the balance land the then proceed to acquire the whole of the land without the petitioner being given any opportunity to make representations. It is important to note that the vehicle provided for the security of the Petitioner was withdrawn on 08.12.2004 on a complaint of misuse I have already held that the decision to withdraw the said vehicle is bad in law. The Petitioner was provided with a vehicle for security in the capacity as a Member of Parliament form 2.4.2004 on the basis of security assessment. Therefore the policy promulgated by the Circular No CSA/PI/40 dated 23rd October 2006 will not affect the legitimate expectation of the Petitioner. The said vehicle was given to the Petitioner when there were similar policies were in existents there for one cannot consider the Circular No. CSA/PI/40 dated 23rd October 2006 has brought about a change in policy. Even if there is a change in policy that would be applicable to persons who would be provided with security a fresh, having regard to the fact that the public body is free to formulate and reformulate policy; Sirimal And Others V Board of Directors of The Co-Operative Wholesale Establishment And Others [2003] 2 Sri L R 2336. The duty of the Court is to safeguard rights, as well as interests deserving protection based on legitimate expectations. In Dayarathna and Others V Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine and Others [1999] 1 Sri L R 393 the Court held : When a change of policy is likely to frustrate the legitimate expectations of individuals, they must be given an opportunity of stating why the change of policy should not affect them unfavourably of R. v. Secretary of State of the Home Dept. exp. P. Khan (1985) 1 ALLER 40, 46; R. v. MAFF, ex. P. Hamble Fisheries (195) 2 All ER 714 at 731. Such procedural rights have an important bearing on the protection afforded by Article 12 of the Constitution against unequal treatment arbitrarily, invidiously, irrationally or otherwise unreasonably dealt out by the executive. They focus on formal justice and the rule of law, in the sense that the rules of natural justice help to ensure objectivity and impartiality and facilitate the treating of like cases alike. Procedural rights are also seen as protecting human dignity by ensuring that the individual is told why he is being treated unfavourably, and by enabling him to take part in that decision. Craig (op. cit.) 86. The Petitioner is in a class by himself as he is in peril and as such he and others similarly circumstanced are all entitled to effective protection in terms of Section 56 of the Police Ordinance. To deny such protection unreasonably is a violation or Article 12(1) of the Constitution. W. K. C. Perera v prof Daya Edirisinghe And Others [1995] 1 Sri LR 148 at 156 Fernando] held:

But now there is no doubt that Article 12 ensures equality and equal treatment even where a right is not granted by common law, statute or regulation, and this is confirmed by the provisions of Articles 3 and 4(d). Thus, whether the Rules and Examination Criteria have statutory force or not, the Rules and Examination Criteria, read with Article 12, confer a right on a duly qualified candidate to the award of the Degree, and a duty on the University to award such Degree without discrimination ; and even where the University has reserved some discretion, the exercise of that discretion would also be subject to Article 12, as well as the general principles governing the exercise of such discretions.

The Petitioner was provided with a security vehicle despite of the fact that there were circulars and directions by His Excellency the President. This was given considering the extraordinary security threat faced by the petitioner on the security assessment and on the request of various bodies and authorities. It is common ground that the vehicle was withdrawn on the 8th of December 2004 for the reason that it was misused and the withdrawal of vehicle was without an inquiry or giving the petitioner any hearing. The Petitioner has a right to the added security based on the legitimate expectation and the Respondents have a legal duty to give protection to the citizens as the situation demands. In Mano Haran Ganesan v Victor Perera and three others C.A. Writ Application 44/08 C.A. minutes 14.02.2008 K. Sripavan J (P/CA) (as he then was) held :

The seriousness of the situation is that if no radical action is taken, the perpetrators will take the law upon their hands exact vengeance in the nature a personal vendetta. Section 56 of the Police Ordinance imposes a duty on every police officer including the 1st to 3rd Respondents to use their best endeavours and ability to prevent all crimes and offences. The Police having come to a conclusion that the petitioners life is at risk, increased his security with effect from December 2006 to protect his life against the threats and to prevent any crimes being committed against him. Thus, the sole issue to be considered is Have the 1st to 3rd Respondents discharged the statutory duty imposed on them fairly and reasonably to prevent any crimes or offence being committed against the Petitioner by reducing the Petitioners security ? The Respondents submission that the issue of a security vehicle to the Petitioner is impossible as the Police Department does not have vehicles and it does not have funds to purchase new vehicles is untenable. What the Petitioner seeking is to quash the order of the withdrawal of the security vehicle provided to him as it is bad in law and thereby to restore the same by issuing a writ of mandamus. Administrative Law by Wade (9th edition) 618 the authors stated : Within the field of public law the scope of mandamus is still wide and the court may use it freely to prevent breach of duty and injustice : Instead of being astute to discover reasons for not applying this great constitutional remedy for error and misgovernment, we think it our duty to be vigilant to apply it in every case to which, by any reasonable construction, it can be made applicable ; R v Hanely Revising Barrister [1992]3 Kb 518 at 529. In the above circumstances this court issues a writ of mandamus directing the 1A and 2A Respondents to provide a suitable vehicle for security to the Petitioner for so long as it warranted. The application for a writ of Mandamus is allowed without costs. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) . . . 2.30 . 2008 19 . . . 2.30 . , 2008 19, .

EXEMPTION OF FUEL SURCHARGE FOR RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Thank you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to present something which I feel is not only . . . ( )

( . . . - , ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne - Minister of Power and Energy) , . . , , . , - This is only a wastage of time for the reason that we have already taken a decision to waive this fuel adjustment charge. The fuel adjustment charge is 30 per cent. Anybody who consumes more than 90 units of electricity will be subject to a fuel adjustment charge of 30 per cent. So, as far as the religious institutions are concerned, that has been waived. In fact, we got down the prelates from these religious institutions and also the heads of other religious institutions like Churches, Mosques, Kovils and Temples and other renowned places and we had a discussion. This decision was taken as a result of their representations made to His Excellency the President. His Excellency the President informed us to

take necessary steps in order to waive this 30 per cent fuel adjustment charge. So, I do not think that there is any need to waste the time of this House because we have already taken steps to implement it.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Minister, with all due respect to you - I may have respect for you, but not for your Government because all this is due to the fault of the system. I said, Sir, with all due respect to you, I may not have the same respect to your Government because what you tell is not what happens and my intention was not with the purpose of playing around with figures, but to give actual assistance at least to the religious institutions who survive on peoples donations.

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne)

Hon. Member, that is exactly what I say. In regard to religious institutions, this 30 per cent fuel surcharge had been waived with effect from April.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

No, Hon. Minister, you know our system and you know that we are very progressive in our thinking. So, it is not something which goes against your thinking; it goes in line with your thinking. But all we want to state is, in 1985 - [Interruption.] Let me carry on. Maximum half an hour is not wasting anybodys time. It will only reveal -

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne)

Even half an hour for a futile purpose is not necessary.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You wasted one month's time by prorogation of Parliament, Hon. Minister.

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne)

You are trying to waste the time of this House for a futile purpose.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, not futile.

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne)

Okay. You can go on. What I say is that I have made it known to the Chair that there is no purpose in this - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No. If what you say is really carried out, there will be no problem in the Ceylon Electricity Board. Hon. Minister, I know your genuine thinking. If what you say is carried out by the CEB, there will not be any problem. That is the problem. It is not your thinking that goes on. So with all due respect to you and also to the Non-Cabinet Minister of Power, the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage, I must say that he is also radical in his thinking. He is not so in his normal thinking, but at least when it comes to his portfolio functions, he does it properly. So, I am basically saying, Hon.
