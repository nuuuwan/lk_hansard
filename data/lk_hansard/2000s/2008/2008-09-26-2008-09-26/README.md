1998 53 37 () . 1996 2 61 (1) () () . . - - . . . . CD , , . . . " " . . - According to the UN Regulations, after 23 years of rule in a certain area by a particular party, it comes under the control of the party that had been ruling because they had been enforcing police powers as well as judicial powers, and law and order had been under their control. So, with the international support, the United National Party handed over the North and the East to the LTTE. Whoever gave the idea to the LTTE to close the Mavil-Aru sluice gates have misled them. Otherwise, they would have had their own way in the North and the East and the Government would not have carried out an operation on humanitarian grounds to safeguard the people who are living in that area. So, on some misleading information, the LTTE closed the sluice gates of Mavil-Aru and the Government had to intervene to safeguard the human rights of the people in the North and the East. Even today they are carrying out a war to safeguard the human rights of the Tamil people who are under the clutches of the LTTE. The Tamil people living in Colombo are living peacefully with the Sinhalese and the Muslims without being extorted. It is the people living in the North and the East who are being extorted. Today, the LTTE is not allowing free passage even to the United Nations. -[Interruption.] Hon. Member, read the newspapers today. The LTTE is not allowing free passage to the people. In the Thoppigala incident, there were no Tamil, Sinhala or Muslim civilian casualties. The Government allowed free passage for them to go to any place that they wish. Today the Government is carrying out a war on humanitarian grounds. It is not a war against humanity or against the Tamils; it is a war against treacherous rule of the LTTE leader, Prabhakaran.

1187 1188

Honourable TNA Members, I believe you have come here in numbers because they voted for you and if you go for a democratic election in the North and the East, you will never be able to be elected to Parliament. Definitely, you will not come. Several Members of the TNA have told me personally that they do not like to go for an election. They do not mind going for a referendum and extending the Presidents term of office till 2017. But, they do not want to go for an election; they prefer to go for a referendum. I emphasize this because they told me personally that they will never be re-elected. Accordingly, His Excellency the President has given a lot of freedom to the Tamils and he is now fighting for the freedom of the Tamil people living in Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu. As soon as they are liberated and allowed free passage - the Government will takeover Kilinochchi in a few days - the LTTE will again have to go to the jungles in Mullaitivu to fight the war. So, please tell your leader and your brethren who are taking to arms to lay down their arms, sign a peace agreement and come for a democratic election like in the East. Like one of your brothers who is now the Chief Minister of the Eastern Province, they can come to Temple Trees, they can go to Japan, to Europe, all over the world and develop the country and the places where they have been living. This is your duty. You have to do it; you have to develop that area. You take the salaries given by Parliament, enjoy the perks and benefits and just read out some letters given by your party leadership and keeping them for record. This is exactly what is being done by the JVP as well as the UNP. There is a huge crisis within your party. You all do not want to accept what the President is doing to this country. Go to the South and see the development. Take the proposed fisheries supermarket at Peliyagoda. We can call it a real supermarket. We will have a restaurant in this supermarket where you can select fish from the fisheries outlets, get it prepared there and eat. That is the kind of development that Sri Lanka is moving towards. Also, take the proposed harbour in Dikovita in Wattala area to be built at a cost of eight billion rupees. So, Hon. Members, we are honoured to be a part of this Government. I am telling you, I am not a person who has voted for the Government, but today we are proud to be a part of the Government. Everyday we cannot work. We have a short lifespan and during that period when we can work, we should work. , . . 2,500 . . . , , . ; .
