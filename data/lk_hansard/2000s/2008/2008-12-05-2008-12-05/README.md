ANNOUNCEMENTS : : NATION BUILDING TAX BILL : DETERMINATION OF THE SUPREME COURT

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . 122(1)() . 123(1) . . IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA AN ACT TO PROVIDE FOR THE IMPOSITION AND COLLECTION OF A TAX TO BE CALLED THE NATION BUILDING TAX ON THE LIABLE TURNOVER OF EVERY PERSON TO WHOM THIS ACT APPLIES; AND TO PROVIDE FOR MATTERS CONNECTED THEREWITH OR INCIDENTAL THERETO. In the matter of a Reference under Article 122(1)(b) of the Constitution S. C. Special Determination No. 05/2008 PRESENT SALEEM MARSOOF Judge of the Supreme Court JAGATH BALAPATABENDI Judge of the Supreme Court CHANDRA EKANAYAKE Judge of the Supreme Court Counsel : Viraj Dayaratne, Senior State Counsel with Rajiv Goonetilleke, State Counsel for the Attorney - General

The Court assembled for the hearing at 10.00 a. m. on 3rd December, 2008. A Bill titled Nation Building Tax Act was referred to this Court by His Excellency the President, in terms of Article 122(1)(b) of the Constitution, for the special determination of this Court whether the Bill or any provision thereof is inconsistent with the Constitution. The Bill contains a certificate to the effect that in the view of the Cabinet of Ministers the Bill is urgent in the national interest. As set out in the preamble to the Bill, the purpose of the Bill is to provide for the imposition and collection of a tax to be called the Nation Building Tax on the liable turnover of every person to whom this Act applies; and to provide for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. The categories of persons to whom the Bill is sought to be made applicable are set out in Clause 2 of the Bill, which provides as follows; 2. (1) The provisions of this Act shall apply to every person who, - (a) imports any article into Sri Lanka; or (b) carries on the business of manufacture of any article; or (c) carries on the business of providing a service of any description. Learned Senior State Counsel submitted that as provided in Clause 3(1) of the Bill, it was proposed to charge from every person to whom the Bill applies, a tax called the Nation Building Tax calculated at the rate of 1 percentum, in the following manner. (i) in the case of a person referred to in paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section (2), who imports any article into Sri Lanka on or after January 1, 2009 the tax shall be chargeable in respect of the liable turnover of such person arising from the importation into Sri Lanka of such article; and (ii) in the case of a person referred to in paragraph (b) or of subsection (1) of section 2, for every quarter commencing on or after January 1, 2009 (hereinafter referred to as relevant quarter) the tax shall be chargeable in respect of the liable turnover of such person for such relevant quarter. With respect to the definition of liable turnover contained in Clause 3(2), learned Senior State Counsel wished to make certain corrections, and the corrected version reads as follows: (i) with reference to any person referred to in paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section 2 arising from the importation of any article, means the value of that article ascertained for the purpose of Value Added Tax under Section 6 of the Value added Tax Act No. 14 of 2002; (ii) With reference to any person and to any relevant quarter referred to in paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 2, means the sum receivable whether received or not from the sale in Sri Lanka in that quarter, of every article manufactured by such person; (iii) with reference to any person referred to in paragraph of subsection (1) of section 2 and to any relevant quarter means the sum receivable, whether received or not, from the provision of any service in Sri Lanka in that quarter as referred to in that paragraph. Learned Senior State Counsel submitted that Clause 2(1) sought to make the provisions of the Bill applicable to every person who imprts any article into Sri Lanka other than those articles that are sought to be exempted in Part 1 of the Schedule to the Bill, irrespective of whether or not he was engaged in any business. He submitted that the exemptions made in the Schedule took into consideration the national interest on the basis of objective and intelligible criteria. He conceded that sub-paragraphs (b) and (c) of Clause 2(1) sought to catch up only those engaged in the business of manufacturing articles or providing services, on the basis of any sum receivable from the sale of such manufactured article or supply of service. This formula is not applicable with respect to sub-paragraph (a) of Clause 2(1) wherein a different formula based on the value of the article as provided in the Value Added Tax, Act No.

3149 3150

14 of 2002 was adopted . In view of this difference, and the broad ambit of Clause 2(1) of the Bill, learned Senior State Counsel indicated that the said sub-paragraph will be amended as follows: 2. (1) The provisions of this Act shall apply to every person who,-

(a) imports any article, other than personal effects, into Sri Lanka or In view of the proposed amendment, and in the light of the submissions of learned Senior State Counsel, we are of the opinion that the aforesaid provisions of the Bill (as amended) do not violate Article 12 of the Constitution. We are also of the opinion that none of the provisions of the Bill are inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution. Learned State Counsel conceded that there were certain drafting errors in the English version of the Bill which be sought to correct by the addition of the words EXCEPTED ARTICLES alongside PART 1 in the first sub-heading of the Schedule, and the words EXCEPTED SERVICES alongside PART II in the second sub-heading of the Schedule. In Part 1 of the Schedule he also sought to correct item (i) by the substitution of the word manufacturer in place of manufacture. He also sought to correct item (iii) as follows (i) any article sold to any person to whom this act applies as an exporter, if the commissioner Generals is satisfied on the production of a letter of credit opened in any bank in Sri Lanka in respect of the export of that article or other documentary evidence, that such article has in fact been exported from Sri Lanka; Learned Senior State Counsel also moved to amend item (iv) by re-designating sub-items i), ii), iii), and iv) thereof as respectively a), b), c) and d) and converting sub-item (v) of item (iv) as item (v). In item (vii) he also sought to correct the words aircraft of shift as aircraft or ship. He also moved to re-designate sub-items a), b), c), and d) of item (ix) as respectively items (x), (xi), (xii), and (xiii), Learned Senior State Counsel also moved to amend item (xx) of Part II of the Schedule as follows: xx) exhibiting films in cinema: and Learned Senior State Counsel also moved to amend Clause 3(4)(i) by adding the word or immediate after the semicolon in that sub-paragraph. He also stated that the words person to whom this Act applies should be substituted in place of the words liable person in Clause 4, Clause 6 and Clause 7 of the Bill. Court specifically notes that the safeguards provided in the Customs Ordinance and the Inland Revenue Act have been expressly incorporated by Clause 5(3) and (8) of the Bill to protect persons to whom the Bill is intended to apply from any violations of their rights. We therefore determine that in view of the amendments and corrections that have been proposed by learned Senior State Counsel to the various provisions of the Bill noted above, none of the provisions of the Bill (as so amended) are inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution.

. . ( . . ) (The Hon. K. N. Choksy) Mr. Chairman, I wish to move a cut of Rs. 10 from each recurrent and capital expenditure of the Heads, 101, 201-205, 142, 206-209, 163, 129, 215, 110, 228-235, 133, 134, 236, 140, 292, 169, 309, 310, 108, 308, 172, 168, 149, 303, 128, 143, 104, 280, 138, 220, 124, 216, 120, 217, 164 and 156 of the Votes of the Ministries and its Departments and Corporations to be taken up today at the Committee Stage of the Appropriation Bill for 2009. Mr. Chairman, I have had the honour of being a Member of this House for the past 20 years. Today with the Committee Stage Debate we are also having the 240th Emergency Debate at which I am present. But yet, Mr. Chairman, despite a long passage of time, unfortunately for Sri Lanka, the light has not appeared at the end of the tunnel. In any war, at the end of the day, no side wins and no side loses. Both have lost in men and materials; only the bitterness remains. The issue on our hands has got to be known as the national problem. It then calls for a national or collective solution, irrespective of the divides of political parties. Early action is called for on all sides of the House. Mr. Chairman, the demand for a separate state was clearly not welcomed by the majority of our citizens. It has now abated. But, the seeds of greater local autonomy

and local self-determination have taken root strongly. This requires to be recognized and solved reasonably by all political parties and citizens organizations as a primary national issue. If not, the present turmoil will get aggravated. Mr. Chairman, we have the Thirteenth Amendment of our Constitution and the Provincial Council System. These have devolved some powers and strengthened the system of local government. But, it is clear that the country has to go further down the road of devolution to achieve peace. A federation may thus be worthwhile considering as a measure of solution. I am conscious of the fact that Sri Lanka has been governed for almost 200 years as a unitary State. Local requirements were little considered. This is from 1815, when the British conquered Kandy and ruled throughout Sri Lanka. Our Constitutions since Independence in 1948 including the present Constitution, have continued this political concept of a Unitary State. It must be emphasized that the country has three major races and four major religions. We are thus, a multi-racial and multi-religious nation. Mr. Chairman, times have changed economically, socially and politically. Citizens grouped together in different parts of the country and belonging to the different races and religions I have just mentioned, and having distinct needs of their own consider that as of right they should have a greater say in the decision-making process relating to their requirements in their respective areas of residence. This in the ultimate analysis is the root cause of the ongoing conflict, namely, the demand for greater local self-determination. Can the issue be solved under our present Constitution of 1978? The answer is clearly, No. The Constitution is too rigid. Power and authority are far too greatly concentrated in the Centre. The Provincial Council system is inadequate. The solution, the restoration of peace and the continuance of Sri Lanka as one State, requires us to go some distance further in devolving power. A change in the national thinking on the political organization of our country is necessary. Mr. Chairman, I advocate Sri Lanka becoming a federation of States. The identification of the physical areas or boundaries of the federating units will not be difficult. They are already fairly clear. A federation is not Eelam nor will it result in a division of the country. It is important to note that it will not be the division of the country. Sri Lanka will continue to be one single sovereign, free, indivisible and independent State. The power and authority of the Central Government to ensure the unity of the country as one entity will continue. The armed forces and the police will be under the control of the Centre. So, also all sea and airports. The revenue from income tax, customs and excise duties and stamps

3197 3198

will belong to the Central Government. The federating units will be dependent to a considerable extent on the Central Government for finance. The bogey of cessation or separatism is therefore ill-founded. It cannot arise and will not be allowed to arise. A federation only means the greater freedom of distinct areas of the country to decide and handle all local issues such as the local language, civic requirements and local taxation. The United States of America, Canada, Switzerland and Australia are examples of federations which have stood the test of time and prospered. India is a multiracial, multi-religious and multi-linguistic country. Its political organization is a de facto federation of states. The powers of government are divided between the Central Government and Parliament on the one hand and the State legislatures on the other. The authority to maintain the indivisibility of the country is vested in the Central Government. No division of this country has taken place over the past fifty years, although it has been a federation. The country is progressing rapidly in its economic development. Mr. Chairman, we in Sri Lanka have so far not considered the federation idea as a measure of settlement of our ethnic conflict. I suggest we do so. It may bring peace and the obvious national benefits of peace to Sri Lanka. A federation of states is not a new idea for Sri Lanka. The Donoughmore Commission was set up by the British in 1928. This Commission gave the country what became known as the Donoughmore Constitution and the State Council in 1930. The delegation of eminent Kandyan leaders led by Mr. M.B. Panabokke and Mr. Bernard Aluvihare urged the Commission to create a federation within Sri Lanka. Due to opposition of the Sinhala leaders in the low country, the Commission rejected the Kandyan delegations suggestion. The same exercise was repeated by the Kandyan delegation before the Soulbury Commission in 1948, and once again not accepted by the Commission in its report due to resistance from the low country Sinhala leaders. The demand for a federation thereupon died down amongst the Kandyan leaders, but not with the Tamils. They formed the Federal Party", and continued this demand. Perhaps, if the demand of the delegation of the Kandyan Leaders at that time had been heeded and accommodated even to some extent, our country would not have had the present conflict on its hands. There is no hard and inflexible mould in which federalism is cast. It is a constitutional concept that varies with the historical and political experiences of the country concerned. But, one aspect is common - namely, that the Central Government is constitutionally vested with the power to

ensure and enforce the continuation of the federation and to prevent cessation or separation by any of the federating units. It is open to the country concerned to decide which subjects of government should be vested in the Centre and which subjects should be devolved. Our present Constitution foreshadows this by having three separate lists of subjects and functions, which are vested in the Centre and Provincial Councils respectively. It is not difficult therefore, to make the further constitutional changes necessary to devolve more subjects and functions and thereby create greater local self-determination or autonomy. Beyond this of course, the country cannot go. Mr. Chairman, I advocate that the All Party Representative Committee(APRC) invites the Tamil National Alliance to its meetings and considers proceeding to discussion and agreement along the lines I have outlined above. Also that a request made by the United National Party that the coalition partners of the Government table their common viewpoint before the Committee for consideration by the Committee, so that the committees report could be the stepping stone to amendments of our Constitution for the re-arrangement of our country. In this way, Mr. Chairman, we could proceed further towards ensuring the end of the ongoing conflict and progress of our nation. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and wish to state that the viewpoint I have expressed is my own and personal viewpoint and not necessarily the viewpoint of any organization. I thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Venerable Presiding Member, I would like to offer my congratulations on the Budget for the year 2009. Our Government has allocated Rs. 328,000,000 for next year

to provide facilities for all Members of Parliament irrespective of their political philosophy, religious background, ethnicity and all other differences. First of all, I must thank His Excellency the President for his enormous support given to my Ministry. My aim is to use the money allocated to my Ministry to provide necessary facilities for all Members of Parliament enabling them to deliver more efficient and effective service to the people of this country equally. We use this money for providing office equipment for the Members, appointing personal staff to the Members and providing training for the staff. We conduct training programmes on Office Procedures, Public Relations, Human Rights, Productivity. Managing Decentralized Budget, Computer Applications and Parliamentary Procedures. We conducted training programmes in the Eastern Province, Central Province, Sabaragamuwa Province, Western Province and in the Galle District. We are spending Rs. 150,500,000 per month to pay the salaries of staff of the Members namely, research assistant, secretary, typist, KKS and driver. We pay a gratuity once the appointment is terminated. For this purpose, we have received Rs. 6,500,000 for the year 2008 from the General Treasury and arrangements were made to pay gratuity to eligible staff on a first come first served" basis. An amount of Rs. 10,000,000 has been allocated for the year 2009 for gratuity payments and 158 applications have been received from the staff members who have been terminated or vacated their posts. The newly appointed Members are provided with a computer, a mobile phone, a photocopier and a fax machine worth of Rs. 350,000 and after three years of usage they are eligible to apply for a package of new equipment. To meet this requirement, my Ministry has spent Rs. 24,300,000 up to end of November, 2008 and the amount equivalent to 15 per cent of the total value of the equipment is deducted from the monthly salary of the Member on an instalment basis. In addition to the facts mentioned above, a Group Insurance Scheme is being introduced for the Members of Parliament which is being implemented through the National Insurance Trust Fund. This scheme covers a maximum of Rs. 200,000 hospitalization expenses per Member annually and for which Rs. 3,453,000 has been spent by September, 2008 on recoveries. At present, I am in the process of exploring the possibility of getting a coverage for medical tests done at Sri Jayewardenepura Hospital without hospitalization as I consider it my duty and responsibility to look after the health condition of all of my Colleagues. Apart from that, an insurance coverage had been introduced to pay Rs. 1,000,000 to the dependents of Members in the event of the death of a Member due to

[ ]

2008 05 3215 3216

accidents or terrorist activities. With the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers, I have been able to increase the amount up to Rs. 5,000,000 with effect from 1st March, 2008. I am glad to mention that all payments have been made to the dependents of the Members who died during the year 2008 due to accidents or terrorist activities and I take this opportunity to thank the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and his staff for the co-operation they have extended in providing funds for the above purpose. Finally, I must thank the Secretary, Additional Secretary, SAS, Chief Accountant, Director and all the staff members of my Ministry and my personal staff for their efficient and untiring services rendered with transparency in providing my service effectively. I thank you. [.. 11.23] ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Renuka Herath) , . 2009 , 70 16 . , 21 . . , , . 7 . . , . . , . . , . . , 21 . 21 . . , . - - 2008 2009 . . , 21 . . . , . ,

(The Hon. Arumugan Thondaman - Minister of Youth Empowerment and Socio Economic Development)

Thank you, Venerable Presiding Member. I am happy to inform you that the Ministry of Youth Empowerment and Socio Economic Development is a new Ministry set up by His Excellency the President, Mahinda Rajapaksa by a Gazette Notification of 29th August, 2006 which has entrusted to me the task of implementing projects for empowerment of youths of the underprivileged community by improving educational facilities and standards, promoting religious observances and culture, developing sports and recreation requirements and developing vocational skills and standards. In this regard, my Ministry has formulated and implemented several projects and programmes targeting the underprivileged communities in underserved areas. At the very outset, my special thanks and appreciation are due to His Excellency the President, Mahinda Rajapaksa for the continued support and assistance rendered for the implementation of the programme of my Ministry by granting the necessary funds. Venerable Sir, my Ministry along with Savumyamoorthy Thondaman Memorial Foundation and Plantation Human Development Trust, the two agencies which come under my Ministry together with the local government bodies and divisional secretariats have been implementing programmes in the areas of youth empowerment and socio economic development to

improve infrastructure facilities in the underserved areas in the plantation sector where decades of negligence and absence of government inputs have seriously retarded the progress of the plantation community especially the youths who are lagging behind like the rest of the population in many areas such as education, housing, health, environment, vocational training and skills developments. Sir, my Ministry was allocated Rs. 465 million for the year 2008 which is less than the amount allocated for the year 2007. In spite of the decrease in the amount, my Ministry was able to implement 574 development projects covering several parts of the country and benefiting all races and religions under the motto of One Sri Lanka-One Nation by seeking to bring in harmony and contentment to all people. It is pertinent to mention here that the late Hon. Savumyamoorthy Thondaman, my grandfather worked tirelessly towards improving and enhancing the general educational levels of the children of the plantation workers whose freedom from bondages and upliftment was his main dream. Hence, I deem it a privilege to make his dreams come true through the services and activities of the Ministry of Youth Empowerment and Socio Economic Development. The two institutions coming under the purview of my Ministry, namely, the Savumyamoorthy Thondaman Memorial Foundation and the Plantation Human Development Trust have played pivotal roles on the directions given by the Ministry in implementing projects. The STMF has dedicated to revolutionize the underprivileged community through extensive application and use of information communication technology by the establishment of Praja Shakthi Centres with several novel and latest hi-tech features such as Data Bank on job availability, information on various services rendered by ministries and Government departments, such as processing of birth certificates, passports and exchange of information among the centres et cetera which were not made available hitherto to the plantation community. I am happy to inform that as at October 2008, 41 Praja Shakthi Centres are functioning covering Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, Kandy, Ratnapura, Galle and Kegalle Districts. Two more Praja Shakthi Centres will be established in this month making the total of the Praja Shakthi Centres to 43. The activities under the Praja Shakthi programme will continue to be designed and implemented by my Ministry to enable the youth to acquire skilled capacities to uplift their social standards. The Thondaman Vocational Training Centre at Hatton is another institution functioning under the STMF to enhance the capacity building of the youth and make them enter into the mainstream of the society. The Thondaman Vocational Training Centre at Hatton which commenced its activities in July 2007 conducts 16 job-oriented

3221 3222

technical courses in various fields which is a boon for the underprivileged youth to seek employment opportunities at high salaries both in Sri Lanka and abroad. Students who have passed out from these institutions have been able to secure employment with higher salaries which have enhanced their economic conditions. At this juncture, I wish to place on record our sincere thanks and appreciation to the Government of India for providing the much-needed academic staff to conduct the courses at the Thondaman Vocational Training Centre, free of charge. In the cultural sphere, construction and development work is in progress at the Thondaman Cultural Centre at Ramboda which when completed will be a catalyst institution that provides easy access to the underprivileged plantation youth to further their cultural needs. The PHDT which is charged with human and social capital development of the plantation worker community has a network of seven offices in plantation districts and has supported all major interventions covering projects in social welfare, estate infrastructure, plantation reform and plantation development support. A major pilot project undertaken by the PHDT is to construct 43 houses to underprivileged families at Stonycliff Estate, Kotagala at an initial cost of Rs. 63 million. This is nearing completion. More specifically, the Plantation Human Development Trust has extended its activities to other projects such as water supply, sanitation, child development centres, pre-school education, capacity building for youth empowerment, building bridges and culverts and re-roofing the plantation workers dwellings. Venerable Presiding Member, several schools including the Norwood Tamil Maha Vidyalaya, St. John Bosco Vidyalaya, Dikoya Sinhalese Vidyalaya and Ratmalana Hindu College have been found with needed improved sanitation facilities and additional classrooms as part of the socio-economic development of the underprivileged areas. Further in this regard, major programmes have been implemented for the benefit of the workers in the plantation sector; 350 units of line rooms have been completed. Additionally, the Ministry has implemented through a network of 36 divisional secretaries, municipal councils and urban councils development activities covering a wide range from construction of schools, playgrounds, libraries and halls, concreting roads, water supply, line culverts, communication centres, provision of electricity, culverts, et cetera to improve the socio-economic condition of the underprivileged communities in underserved areas and to usher a contended youth population. One of the most acute problems faced by the plantation community is not having National Identity Cards and birth certificates. The Ministry took swift

action to fulfil this long-felt need by conducting 17 mobile services especially in the Kegalle District and enable 8,171 persons to obtain their National Identity Cards. Another project that has been initiated is to issue birth certificates to a large number of members of plantation community. So far 55,500 birth certificate applications have been distributed; 29,632 applications are being processed to issue birth certificates. As regards birth certificates, my Ministry is in the process of implementing a programme to enable all those who do not possess birth certificates to obtain same by special procedures approved by the Cabinet. I am confident that a vast majority of youth will benefit by these programmes which will empower them to have access to enjoy all public services which are not hitherto within their reach. I am confident that these two projects would empower the youth to enter the mainstream of society without legal or administrative obstacles henceforth. A detailed report containing the projects implemented by the Ministry is already with you all. In conclusion, I wish to mention further that social integration and national unity efforts too have been undertaken by my Ministry by supporting programmes such as conducting vesak lantern competitions among schools and offering development projects benefiting different communities in underprivileged areas. I also wish to place on record my thanks to the secretary and the staff of my Ministry, the Director-General and staff of Savumyamoorthi Thondaman Memorial Foundation and the Chairman, Director-General and staff of the Plantation Human Development Trust.

My Ministry has taken a long stride to protect the rights of persons with disabilities passing necessary legislations, launching a national policy, declaring year 2007 as the Year of Accessibility, signing the UN Convention on Protection of Rights of Persons with Disabilities and passing regulations on accessibility. Accessibility is an area identified in the Mahinda Chintana programme of His Excellency the President. It is mentioned that convenient access facilities for persons with disabilities will be provided as a matter of priority in all public buildings. Further, on behalf of the Government, I signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in March, 2007. As a signatory to the convention, our Government is obliged to take the necessary steps to give effect to the provisions of that convention. The Article with regard to Accessibility in the convention states, I quote: To enable persons with disabilities to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life, States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access, on an equal basis with others, to the physical environment, to transportation, to information and communications, including information and communications technologies and systems, and to other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas. These measures, which shall include the identification and elimination of obstacles and barriers to accessibility, shall apply to, inter alia: On the 1st of December, we had invited the ministers, secretaries and relevant officials of eleven ministries for a very important meeting on Accessibility for Persons with Disabilities. As you are aware, making all public buildings and public places accessible for persons with disabilities cannot be implemented by one ministry. It is a responsibility of all of us and that is why we invited all of them to discuss this matter and to have a coordinated plan to fulfil this requirement. I take this opportunity to brief this House on actions taken on this area since 1995. In 1995, the International Day of Persons with Disabilities was observed by my Ministry with the theme, Accessibility to Built Environment. A special technical committee was appointed to develop a planning guide for accessibility provisions to built environment. In the year 2000, the theme for the international day was "Barrier-free environment for persons with disabilities and older persons". By this time, the technical committee had submitted the planning guide for built environment and awareness programmes were conducted along with the Association of Architects, on the provision of accessibility to all concerned. In 2003, the National Policy on Disability was formulated and was approved by the Cabinet. In the policy document, 26 areas were included and two of which were accessible to built environment, tourism and communication and information. The existing Act was amended in 2003 to

3269 3270

[ ]

make provision to regulations on accessibility. The theme for the International Day of 2006 was "Accessibility Enables Everyone". The year 2007 was declared as ''Accessibility year" and a steering committee consisting of line ministries was established for follow up on provisions of accessibility regulations. I would mention the programmes implemented by my Ministry after 2006. We have provided Rs. 4.6 million to 37 divisional secretariats to make the secretariat buildings accessible for persons with disabilities. Funds have been given even to construct special toilets. We provided funds to make the Kandy District Secretariat accessible to persons with disabilities. We have provided funds for the accessibility facilities at the National Museum, John de Silva Theatre, Elphinstone Hall, Municipal Council, Dehiwala, Railway Stations in Slave Island, Seeduwa, Ragama, Maradana, and Colombo Fort. Under the community based rehabilitation programme, we provided funds for schools religious places, and also to individuals with disabilities. In 2007, we were able to complete 480 projects. We have conducted awareness programmes for provincial, district and local government officials including technical officers on accessibility. Today, you will be able to gather more information from our Ministrys progress report. We take action to make the buildings and public places coming under the purview of ministries accessible to persons with disabilities and then, to achieve the objective of the theme of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities "Dignity and justice for all of us", which fell on 3rd December 2008. If we can take action to realize this goal, we can create a disabled friendly environment. I would like to mention that we all will become old and the disabled friendly environment will be friendly for all of us. In conclusion, I would like to thank my Deputy Minister Hon. Lionel Premasiri for the co-operation extended to me in implementing programmes and the Secretary of my Ministry, Mrs. Jegarasasingam and all the staff of my ministry for taking the initiative and assisting me to deliver the services to the target groups very effectively and efficiently. Thank you.

. . , . . . [.. 2.36] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Venerable Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity to speak on the Special Committee Report, which deals with the Votes of multiple Ministries. I think this is a new phenomenon and I am made to understand that it was a success; so we are moving forward. I, being a Member of that Committee, appreciate the hard work that has been put in by all the officials. Venerable Presiding Member, at this particular moment, before I start speaking on that, I would like to make reference to the statement made by the Hon. Prime Minister in this House. As you know, with the unbearable cost of living and the economy in a derelict situation, we, the Venerable Thiniyawala Palitha Thero, the Corruption Watch and myself, went to court. There was a timely, creditable judgment obtained; thanks to the Supreme Court and the Chief Justice, through which redress was sought to be given to the people. But, today there was a statement made by the Hon. Prime Minister that there will be a Rs. 20 reduction in the price of petrol and a Rs. 10 reduction in the price of furnace oil, which we appreciate. Reduction of prices, which helps the betterment of the people of this country, we appreciate at all times. But, the ad hoc actions that are being advocated by the Government are sinister and puerile. Yesterday, the same Government increased diesel taxes by Rs. 15. So, the benefit that should go down to the consumer was not allowed to go down. Venerable Presiding Member, I will take this opportunity to reflect on something else as I am restrained because we are having a case pending in court. Any reduction, as I said, is appreciated. Special thanks need to be extended to the Supreme Court and the Chief Justice for the timely intervention. In the process, what was directed by the Supreme Court or the Judges was to ensure a non-political, bipartisan approach to have a national policy, not an ad hoc policy brought in today, changed tomorrow, which would not be for the healthiness of the economy of the country. So, Venerable Presiding Member, I take this opportunity to say, in the financial meltdown that is taking place, let us bring about an element of predictability; let there be sustainability; let

it be rational; let it be practical and let us come up with the national policy that is expected. When I bind myself to ensure that we work non-politically, I do so. But, the Prime Minister made a statement and the Government is playing politics. Now, on this particular score, it is absolutely essential to say that, when the cost of production of a litre of petrol today is Rs. 28, reducing the price of petrol by Rs. 20, bringing it down from Rs. 142 to Rs. 122 would not solve the problem. Earlier when we went to court, it was five times the cost of production; now it is four times the cost of production. That is 400 per cent. That is not what we expect. I see some very attentive as well as experienced Ministers, the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Hon. Dharmadasa Banda, The Hon. Kumara Welgama, the Hon. Dew Gunasekara, The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana, in this House. I am sure you would have requested in the Cabinet to ensure that there is an element of reasonableness. You do not need a Government to give petrol at 400 per cent its cost of production. You would not allow the private sector to make a 25 per cent profit if you go to the Consumer Affairs Authority. So, where is the rationale? I am sure you would take this and go forward. The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne is eagerly waiting to intervene at this particular moment. Yes, my dear Friend. ( ) (The Hon (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Hon. Member, now we are subsidizing the Ceylon Electricity Board. We have not increased the electricity fare even by one cent. Developed countries like the UK and so on have increased it when the fuel prices went up. Also, we are subsidizing the CTB. We have got down 600 more buses and we are also subsidizing the Railway Department. We are paying for all that. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mihin Air? ( ) (The Hon (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) We have not reduced a single welfare measure introduced by this Government and also, we have not privatized a single institution to reduce the Budget deficit. We have been carrying on with all that. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Okay. Now that my Friend intervened, I will respond in due course. But, who told you to subsidize the CTB? ( ) (The Hon (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) The people of this country.

3277 3278

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) My dear Friend ( ) (The Hon (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) That is why the Api Wawamu-Rata Nagamu programme is there. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , ? ? ? 200. '' '' 6,000 . ? , . , 39. 34,000 . . , 6,000 '' '' . . The direction of the Supreme Court - I must say especially the Chief Justice was commendable - was to do it in a completely different way. So, let us come up with a national policy. You are in Government today; we will be in Government tomorrow. Let that be a bipartisan policy. That should be the agreement. I least expected the Hon. Prime Minister to reduce the price of petrol by only Rs. 20 when it can be reduced by Rs. 60 or Rs. 70. This would not do. When you give - ( ) (The Hon (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Yes, we can cut down all other subsidies and reduce fuel prices like our Government, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghes Government, did between 2002 and 2004. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, tell me one area - ( ) (The Hon (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Then, all welfare measures were cut down, Hon. Member, and they showed that the - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Venerable Presiding Member, I have been generous to my Friend. But, Hon. Minister, you take time from the Government. Hon. Minister, I am asking you, why should

a person who does not have electricity but goes to work by bus pay for these electricity subsidies? You basically give that directive to him. We will take up a hypothetical case. Somawathie who lives in Nawala does not have electricity and she goes to work - we will say she goes to work in the Maga Neguma. - by bus. Why should Somawathie, who does not have electricity, pay an additional amount to go by bus? ( ) (The Hon (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) That is why we subsidize - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Why should you subsidize it? - [Interruption.] No, you are getting everybody to pay for the sins of others. Do not let that be done. . , . . . , . . , . . ? . ? , . . , . ? , . , . ? 22, , ,- [ ] . ,-

I quote from the Supreme Court judgment dated 28th, November, 2008: The Petitioners in application No. 536/08 have included a specific prayer that the price of petroleum products be reduced. It is clear from the averments in the petition that as much as Rs. 72/- is now levied cumulatively by way of taxes on each litre of petrol. The case of the Petitioners is that this levy is being made to meet the payments that are due on the Hedging instrument. Whatever be the merits of that assertion, we are of the view . It says, "we, that is the Supreme Court including the Chief Justice. . that taxes imposed on petroleum products affects the people directly. In the circumstances Secretary to the Treasury is directed to review the taxes that are now imposed on petroleum products ... I am happy because at least there is a sensible secretary in the Treasury, Mr. Sumith Abeysinghe. Again I quote: "....and submit a Report to this Court on the next date . That being the 15th of December. .in order to rationalize the amount levied as taxes and the current cost of petroleum products without the Hedging instrument. Thereupon the Court would consider whether a formula could be laid down as to the pricing of petroleum products. The 2nd Petitioner in the application . That happened to me. The petitioners were the Ven. Thiniyawala Palitha Thero - , - Corruption Watch , ,- It further states, I quote: . 536/2008 who is present in Court has agreed to cooperate in the matter of rationalizing taxes in respect of petroleum which he says could be viewed as a national issue above party politics. He may submit suggestions to the Secretary to the Treasury. This is the reason why even when we had a seminar, my Colleague, the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekera and myself did not even refer to a formula. We did not expect the Government to come and play politics here. I am also tabling* the letter I wrote after the direction of the Supreme Court to thank them on behalf of the people once again. I wrote that on the 2nd of December. On the 3rd of December, I get a letter from the Secretary to the Treasury. It states, I quote:

I called him and told him. Let us meet. I do not want to politicize this matter. I do not mind coming and discussing - [Interruption.] I mean, without talking you must try to reduce the price. Today, the cost of petrol is Rs. 29 and the selling price is Rs. 122. You have a spread of about Rs. 109 and out of that, Rs. 52 is taxes. I do not mind that; you have to impose taxes, but you do not need to impose taxes amounting to four times of the cost of production. That is 400 times. That is what - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Kumara Welgama)

Hon. Member, we cannot sell it Rs. 29. I am asking you, which country is selling at Rs. 29 in this world? You just tell me.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

The problem that you all have is, you always catch the tail without catching the head. That is the problem. Wait till I speak. You listen to what I am saying. After the horse has bolted, they decide to close the stable doors. But, the horse has bolted. That is what you do.

All I am saying is, tell me one place which has 400 per cent taxation. Tell me one country. I am not suggesting Rs. 29. We can basically try to politicize by saying, Okay, sell it at Rs. 35 or Sell it at Rs. 45. No. You, the Government has to have duties. We accept that. That is why we thought that we will have a closed door talk and come into a decision. You all are in the Government today, we will be in Government tomorrow, so that you can depoliticize this issue. When the fluctuations of world prices - , , ; . , ? . , , . [ ] . . . , .

Let the people benefit. That is all what we are saying. But, ensure that you do it. If Mr. Sumith Abeysinghe, the Secretary to the Treasury does not allow, then what happens? We have very eminent people here. At least we have also got the Presidents brother who is there. I greatly respect him. I do not believe that he plays politics. Fix a time. Even at 8 o clock tonight I will go and do that on behalf of the country. That is the commitment that we from the Opposition have. We had a seminar, but we never mentioned the pricings that day. That is the advantage. Otherwise, we can go around putting up posters like some other people do. , . . .

We will not discuss until the Supreme Court gives that approval. That is the commitment we have. But, if you do not, then we will have to write and say that the Treasury did not meet and that this is the intention of the Opposition. So, nothing more fair that can we be. That is the intention.

[ ] * : : Letter tabled: URGENT 02nd December, 2008 Mr. Sumith Abeysinghe, Secretary to Ministry of Finance and Planning & The Treasury, The Secretariat, Colombo 01. Dear Sir, Meeting to facilitate relief to the public through reduction in taxes/levies/charges levied in respect of fuel consumption

3289 3290

I write pursuant to the direction made by the Supreme Court in SC(FR) 536/2008 on 28th October 2008, filed by me along with two others (Ven. Thiniyawela Palitha Thero and Mr. Ravi Jayawardena of Corruption Watch) in the public interest, seeking relief to the masses through a reduction in the prices of fuel.

I am indeed grateful that thanks to the direction of the Supreme Court made in the public, and national interest. I am now in a position as a Member of the Opposition, to engage in a constructive dialogue with you aimed purely at lessening the very heavy burden heaped on the entirety of the public of the country through fuel prices that are much higher than those prevalent in the world market and in other countries in the region.

As His Lordship the Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva, PC quite rightly observed in court, such high fuel prices in the Sri Lankan market is a matter of great adverse impact, not only on people of every level of society including the poorer segments who find it unbearable, but on every segment of the nations economy. Inordinately high fuel prices at at time when the world oil prices have fallen drastically, directly affects the performance abilities in virtually every sphere of economic activity at a time when our local businesses require encouragement, stimules and facilitation to survive and succeed in the face of international competition. In the circumstances, the matter of a reduction in fuel prices is one which should be looked at on a priority basis as a national question, without undue consideration of political differences or petty gain, as His Lordship the Chief Justice was pleased to observe in court.

As you are no doubt aware, the progress made in arriving at a pricing formula needs to be informed to the Supreme Court when the matter is next taken up on 15th December 2008.

In the circumstances. I await intimation of a time to meet with you at your earliest convenience. With a view to a constructive, pro-active discussion as per the direction of the Supreme Court, to work towards an effective, durable and sustainable pricing formula in respect of fuel sold in the local market, that would grant immediate relief to the public, prevent recurrence of avoidable hardship to the masses and assist local enterprise and the national economy in these difficult times. Yours in the service of the public. Ravi Karunanayake, Member of Parliament.

[.. 4.11] . ( ) ( . - ) (The Hon. V. Puththirasigamoney - Deputy Minister of Justice ) Thank you, Sir, for giving me the Floor to reply on behalf of the Minister of Justice and Law Reforms. First of all, let me thank all those Members who referred to many matters pertaining to my Ministry. I am happy to say that our Ministry was able to build several court complexes in the North and the East; in places like Batticaloa and Kalmunai and also in places like Monaragala and we also built a High Court in Nuwara-Eliya. We were able to do all those things. Some of the Members referred to matters pertaining to the Ministry of Defence. Though my Ministry is the Ministry of Justice and Law Reforms, we do not interfere with the judiciary. The Members of the Opposition were praising the judiciary so that we know how the judiciary works in our country. In addition to that, we have taken action to increase the number of coroners and mediation boards in all districts of the country and we were able to work in all four corners; North, East, South and West. Whenever the Members of Parliament made complaints, particularly about the prisons, we have been able to take immediate action regarding the complaints made by the Members of the Government as well as the Opposition and we took prompt action whenever the Members from the North and East had problems with regard to the prisons. All the departments and institutions coming under our Ministry are able to work very efficiently because we have got well experienced personnel in our Ministry. We also have certain problems pertaining to interpreters and translators. This is the biggest problem that we are confronted with in the courts, in the labour tribunals and in all the other institutions. Mr. Deputy Chairman, you know that we are unable to solve this problem because we do not have enough personnel to be recruited to these positions. If not for this shortage, we would be able to fill those vacancies and provide an efficient service in that area as well. As you know, until such time I became the Deputy Minister of this Ministry, this Ministry was not taken into the area where I come from - that is the plantations. But since then, we were able to do a lot of service to the people. We were able to take our Ministry into the plantation areas through several mobile services and we were able to help the people in those areas. Particularly in the Eastern Province and in the Southern Province where people got affected by the tsunami, we were able to help by providing them with new documents in place of the documents which they lost as a result of the tsunami like their birth certificates, marriage certificates, deeds for the lands and various other documents. We were able to support them in that way. I am very happy that we were able to do that.

I would like to thank my Secretary, Mr. Suhada Gamlath, who is a very progressive-thinking gentleman. Whenever we have problems, particularly with regard to complaints coming from the Members of Parliament and also from the general public pertaining to any matters that are connected to our Ministry, he takes immediate action. We are also very grateful to the Hon. Chief Justice who has time and again given us whatever assistance and advice that is necessary to run this Ministry.

I must also thank His Excellency the President for appointing me to this position through which I am able to serve the people in the plantation sector, who are always considered to be suppressed.

With those words, I thank all the departmental Heads and the institutional Heads of my Ministry including the Secretary, Additional Secretaries, Commissioners and everyone else who have extended their support towards this Ministry during the past year. Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman)

Yes, what is the point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Unfortunately, I had been out of Parliament when the Hon. Piyasiri Wijenayake had mentioned that I had asked to stop the war. I had not mentioned such a thing. This type of despicable, Government-oriented thing should be stopped. I never mentioned to stop the war; there was no reference at all. So, it would be greatly appreciated if you could ensure that such desultory speculation is expunged from Hansard, as well as the media is told that what the Hon. Piyasiri Wijenayake stated is baseless and that it is a desultory speculation. It is wishful thinking that they make as much as washing dirty linen in public. That is their job. So, I would appreciate if you would give an Order on that.
