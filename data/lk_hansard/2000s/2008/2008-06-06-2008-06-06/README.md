: : SRI LANKA EXPORT DEVELOPMENT ACT : ORDER [.. 10.23] . . ( ) ( .. - , ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of Export Development and International Trade) , : "1979 40 14 (1) (2) , , 2008 03 1539/1 , 2008.05.06 ." Hon. Speaker, the purpose of this Order which has been made under the Sri Lanka Export Development Act is to levy a cess in respect of certain items of goods. That is, unfinished leather goods, rawhides, without value addition. We think that the export of these rawhides out of the country is not in the interest of the economy. It is to be discouraged. We want to bring in measures that would encourage value addition. That is, the rawhides would be worked upon and they will be finished leather products. This will generate employment opportunities and it will also enable the country to earn a larger volume of foreign exchange. So, this is the purpose of the Order which has been made. It is a cess which is being imposed in the interest of the economy to prevent rawhides from being sent out of the country or to discourage that and to give some encouragement for value addition that will be beneficial from two points of view. That is, to enhance the total quantum of foreign exchange that we earn and also to enable employment opportunities to be generated within the country. It is a very simple Order under the Sri Lanka Export Development Act. I do not think that there will be any opposition to that and I would ask for the support of the House in getting approval for this Order which has been made. Thank you. . . Question proposed. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

[.. 10.25 ] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Speaker, I thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to speak a few words on the Order made under the Sri Lanka Export Development Act, No. 40 of 1979. Sir, one of the most important things that need to be done in todays context is not to bring in laws to create problems for export activity but to create a conducive climate. The Hon. (Prof.) G. L. Peiris is a well-experienced and a practical person. But all I want to say is, this being a government that does not seem to know where they are heading, it will be a problem to give necessary leadership to the export field. We are talking today at a time where there is no consistency and coherency. Every possible problem is being created to discourage the exporter - a cost-push inflation on one side and on the other side you are creating external factors which are becoming uncompetitive. Firstly you must ensure that you put your own house in order. Hon. Minister, you mentioned that you are bringing in this Order in order to ensure that you give benefit to the exporter while protecting the domestic industry. But, there are many instances where the domestic industry is not being protected. There are regulations that are at cross purposes; that is, the Provincial Council is carrying one legislation and the Central Government is carrying another. Unfortunately both are operating under the same Government, under the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the JVP and the Jathika Hela Urumaya. But, there is no redress that is provided to the exporter. Hon. Minister, I thought of taking this matter up during the latter part of my speech but I will take it up at the outset because of the fact that you mentioned that this Order would be beneficial from two points of view. One is the export competitiveness. On one side you are talking about export competitiveness but on the other side, you are creating a cost-push inflation in this country. With the cost-push inflation in place, you have got to compete with the rest of the countries in the world. Look at the banks' interest rates. It is about .26 or 27 per cent. Look at the inflation rate in this country. On to your right is the former Minister of Finance, another experienced person. He is a person who knows but he does not want to speak because he would be put into jeopardy. I know he will get up, put a nice smile and will try to distract me. Distracting me will not help. You have got to attract the exporter. That is where the problem lies. When you have an inflation rate of 33 per cent which is disguised and when you have Ajith Nivard Cabraal, the Governor of the Central Bank, saying that the inflation rate in this country is 9 per cent, what is this ludicrousness that is going on in

2008 06 191 192

and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Government, you could see the impact that has been created. We are going for value addition on one hand but employment creation in this country has reduced. The next is, at this particular moment you have almost 12 per cent of your apparel component going into the European Union. Direct employment in this field is about 280,000 people and the indirect employment is about 750,000 people. That is not the only sector which is given the GSP concession. You see, fruits and vegetables are going in 14 per cent less than any other country. Look at companies like Hayleys which is a blue chip company. There are small companies like S. A. Silva's; Mr. Sarath Silvas company. They are exporting owing to the fact that the Labour GSP is giving them a 14 per cent advantage. Then, the direct employment in fruits and vegetables industry is around 12,000 people. Hon. Minister, I do not need to preach to the converted. I know you are in a Government that is reluctant in accepting as to how to take the Labour GSP forward. Look at the fisheries industry. The EU has given us 8 to 15 per cent advantage. Nowhere does this happen. We have the benefit. Direct and indirect employment in the fisheries sector is about 10,000 people. On one side, at the Eastern Provincial Council Election, you went to Trincomalee, you went to Batticaloa and said that the fishermen would be permitted to go fishing. Once the election was over that was stopped, but irrespective of that you have the fisheries industry getting a fillip owing to the Labour GSP. Hon. Minister, the next matter is in regard to leather products. Once again, direct and indirect employment amount to about 8,000 people. Now, what is the emphasis that is being placed on this? If you lose the EU benefit which is around 8 to 12 per cent on this particular score, you are going to have a major impact. I got these details from the Chambers of Commerce who have spoken to you. I know that you are having a tough time. You have a bad brief with your Government that does not know how to take this forward. Then, take the ceramic industry, Hon. Minister. You have a 12 per cent advantage coming from duty; from bicycles you get 15 per cent; from tobacco, you have an advantage of 74 per cent. Today, the United Tobacco Processing Limited in Katunayake and the Agio Tobacco Processing Limited in the Biyagama Zone are basically exporting this. Hon. Minister, we as ex-Trade Ministers also feel for this. It is not that we are trying to say that it is a problem of the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris. You, as the Minister of Export Development, we are basically helping you to help the exporters of this country. I mean, it is a relay. I handed it and you have taken it over. At the end of the day, if the exporter is unable to export, what is the meaning? The Hon. Sarath Amunugama who is very well-versed with it, during his tenure of office as the

the country? In the same way, when there are competing countries in the South Asia having an interest rate around 7 to 10 per cent, how can a local entrepreneur compete with a 28 or 30 per cent interest rate? So, this is the reason why I am basically saying that the main thrust of your objective should be to give the necessary benefit to the exporter to be competitive. Protecting the domestic industry is not the answer to this because it is not so done. On one side, you are basically slashing the duties and not discouraging cheap-scale imports into this country. On the other, you are pegging the dollar at Rs. 108 and not allowing the cost-push inflation to be controlled through a devaluation process. It has a dual impact. On one side if the dollar depreciates, you are going to have a cost-push inflation on imports. But, if you discuss the subject matter with the Export Development Board, then you have got to look at as to how to protect the exporter. Now, on the same basis, Hon. Minister, I would like to touch upon your heart and mind at this particular moment. You must speak according to your conscience. Now, on one side you are bringing in laws to protect the domestic industry and give a fillip to the exporter. Take the labour GSP. This country in the next couple of months would be faced with a situation as to how this Labour GSP has to be handled. As you know, the country is in the international rub, whether you like it or not. There are 220 countries and of that, 198 countries have been accepted by the United Nations. In this particular process, owing to the sagacity of the United National Party and its Leader, its Fiscal Management Policy, Human Rights record and the Ceasefire Agreement, we were able to obtain the triple benefit. We called upon the European Union to which we are exporting about 32 per cent of our exports to please consider Sri Lanka as a special country. Owing to the fact that we have sacrificed a lot and gone through many a turbulent time, we called upon them to please ensure that our exports go to the European Union at a special concessionary price. We managed to obtain that. Tsunami helped to quicken the process. But, after benefiting tremendously from that competing against India, Pakistan and Bangladesh who have been crying as to why they have been excluded from this for three years, what would be the benefit that the leather exporter would get after the 1st of January 2009? I am tabling* Annex 1, Hon. Speaker, in order to save time. In that, you will find the GSP concession given to each sector including the apparel industry which is the most critical factor. When we, the United National Party, handed over the government, there were 783 garment factories in this country. Today it has reduced to 253. With that reduction over the last four years owing to the mismanagement of the JVP, the Jathika Hela Urumaya

Finance Minister tried to do his very best amidst an incompetent government. You did not see the robust exports. During our period from 5th December 2001 to 2nd April 2004, you saw the export industry booming; you saw the creation of self-employment; you saw investments coming in instead of the reverse flights that are taking place today. So, this is where, Hon. Minister, I would like to take your mind to and ensure that we basically get the support.

Let me run through the Labour GSP issue. I know that you are very conversant with the areas of law and I do not want to compete with you because I am not a lawyer. But from my practical knowledge and from an accounting point of view, I want to mention because at this moment, there is no point in you saying that there is a legislative process in this country and the EU is supposed to bestow this right on us. It is not something which is bestowed on to us. We have got to earn it. If they say, I am sorry, the conditions prevailing in your country does not permit you to get this, where are we heading to?

We have the garment industry, the leather industry coming and speaking to us. We have the vegetable and fruit guys coming and saying, Please ensure that you bring some sanity into the Government. We did tell them, Yes, we will do our very best. We can lead a donkey to water but we cannot make him drink. That is the situation that is prevailing at the moment.

Now, for the Labour GSP, you have got to make an application. The Government has decided that as they have four to five months time, at the last moment to go in and say that this is the intention of the Government and you would basically be able to secure it. Hon. Minister, with your's and the Hon. Finance Ministers experience and with our UNP's genuine help to you, I am calling upon to ensure that you make the application quickly and ensure getting it without fighting on this behalf. This is not something which we do. The Government of the SLFP, the JVP and the Jathika Hela Urumaya is ruining the country. That is happening in any case. We also want to contribute and ensure that you get this because it will benefit the youth of our country. Otherwise you are going to chase them into the field of ill-gotten gains and run after arms, ammunition and things like that.

As I said, there are three fundamentals in getting the Labour GSP. They are the Ceasefire Agreement, the Tokyo Declaration and then the Human Rights issues. The question that has come about now is whether the 25 Covenants are legally acceptable and whether they are administered in this country. We accept that. Yes, it is

possible. What about the ICCPR? There is a protocol on this. Now, of that you have brought in certain regulations that will basically help to administer. But that has not been demonstrated in the Singarasa Case. This is why when you go overseas and speak to them, they say, "You are saying so, but it is not demonstrated in your courts". You can get an opinion from the Supreme Court, but that is not admissible. That cannot be judicially acted upon in this country. So, as a result you got the human rights lobbies. Those guys can be having their own interests. But at the end of the day they are heard. You lost the Human Rights Council seat simply because of them. You can put the blame on the United National Party, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe and all. But in your heart of hearts, you know that that is not the case. You all mismanage. The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights did say that we are in jeopardy of losing this. The Minister of Foreign Affairs who is running all over the country just two days before the Election said, We will get 150. What happened? At the end of the day we got only 102 votes. Then, he justifies it by saying, We got 102 votes. This is a hell of a situation. You put the country at risk and then say, We have got 102, out of 192 votes. How good is it? So, Hon. Minister, all we want is, to get you into the real situation and ensure that we get the Labour GSP. Let us together lobby and get this. Then, you cannot say that this is a perfidious act of the United National Party. But, if you do not do it, then we would think that you are doing this in order to terrorize the media. See what has happened to Keith Noyhar; see what has happened to Iqbal Athas; see what has happened to Susil Kindelpitiya of MTV; see what has happened to Lasantha Wickrematunga; see what has happened to Parameswari; see what has happened to Poddala Jayantha; see what has happened to Sanath Balasuriya; see what has happened to the Sirasa reporter in Trincomalee and see what has happened to a reporter in Jaffna. This goes on and on and on. So, it is not with relish that we say this. But we need to say this. You seem to be closing your ears, closing your eyes and only opening your mouth and basically putting the country into jeopardy. Please, ensure that these are looked at from the spirit that we come out. We may be vociferous. We may be speaking from brutal facts, but we say it from a true Sri Lankan perspective. If you basically want to take the brief in the proper way, you should call upon the Opposition and ensure that we take it forward disregarding all the villainy that you are doing to us. But whenever it comes to a national interest, we are there; we have shown it; we have proven it. Your incompetent Government cannot understand that. That is why we call upon you, who have the interest at heart, to come and lobby together.

, , (.) . Whereupon MR. SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. (VEN.) UDAWATTE NANDA THERO took the Chair. ( ) (The Presiding Member) ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , Labour GSP . Hon. Minister, this is on Case Number 23119. They say that they had withdrawn the case. But that has only put it into further jeopardy. There are other cases which will be filed and you will be putting yourself into greater jeopardy. That is why I say, Please, decolourize this; depoliticize this. Ensure that you get together. Let us speak. Keep these chauvinistic trivial parties out of it. They can only shout and just say, Do this, do that. That is just from a political point of view because they are trying to go into the extremes of it and trying to come to power. But your party and our party are the parties that represent almost 90 per cent of this country. It behoves us that we must work together on these types of issues. So, we are calling upon you to do so. You could see that the State media especially tries to carry out character assassination on the United National Party. We have proven beyond doubt and we are going to take it to all these Government factories and say, This is the Government that is trying to ruin your jobs. You had 783 garment factories and today it has reduced to 253.. Who is responsible? You had almost 450,000 direct employment and it has reduced to 280,000. These are people who voted for you all, saying, This is the Southern emblem . .

Then, Hon. Minister, look at the external situation on the macroeconomic policy. This is something which is frightening. You have basically got it from Independence to-date. Why I am saying that is because the macroeconomic policies finally justify the cost-push inflation in this country. You cannot compete with the rest of the neighbouring countries if we are not able to put our macroeconomy in order. Look at the public debt in our country. From 1948 to 2003, that is the time we handed over, there were seven administrations. The total public debt was Rs.1,753 billion. From 1st January, 2004 to-date, it is Rs. 3,853 billion, which is a 110 per cent increase in just three years. Where has this money gone? That is what we basically want to know. If from 1948 to 2003, foreign and local debt was only Rs.1,753 billion, how has that increased in three years to over 110 per cent ? That impact is basically a major problem in our country. We have a total Government revenue of Rs. 753 billion for the year 2008 and the total amortization, that is capital amortization plus interest is Rs. 885 billion. So, your total revenue does not justify one expenditure of the country which is the capital and the interest component. So, where are you heading to? You are borrowing for tomorrow to pay for yesterdays debt, not even borrowing for tomorrow for todays debt. So, this is going to put the country into a dangerous situation. Then, take the inflation factor which is 34 to 35 per cent. , 33. . . . 26 . 33 , 900 7.9 33 . ? 2.3 , 11 , 12 33 ? Cost of Living Index 2.50 . . . , 65 . . ? . , 30 35 . 35 ? .

, EPF, ETF . Hon. Minister, why are you permitting this type of hypocrisy? This is a country that pays between 8 and 12 per cent as EPF which is deducted from the employee while the employer has the option of paying 10 to 15 per cent, which most companies are doing. You are going to legislate that from 10 to 13 per cent. Now, the interest component that you are basically giving to these particular employees is only 10 per cent when the countrys inflation is 33 per cent. See, you are giving a negative return to the innocent employees. Because of these employees, only you are having a capital base from which the Government activities are carried out. So, ensure that you rectify these before talking of other things. Then, look at the bank interest rates. Please, ensure that you reduce it to one digit like what we did. Otherwise how can an exporter export his products to the countries in the region? India is basically giving them at 2 to 3 per cent interest rate and Singapore is giving the exporters almost at half a per cent interest rate. So, we have got to correct ourselves. I am talking of countries that have developed their economy. Countries that are yet to be developed are also giving at the rate of 2 to 3 per cent interest to their exporters. So, we must correct that, Hon. Minister. Otherwise, you are going to put this country into jeopardy. Then look at the countrys debt factor. There are about US Dollars 3,400 billion as reserves. You require about US Dollars 3,600 billion to keep it afloat. Now, if you are going to the Deutsche Bank asking for money, they will not give that. From the HSBC you took US Dollars 500 million. For what purpose? Have you put that money for one capital expenditure? No. You have only used it against the depreciating rupee. You have hedged it against the Dollar which depreciates against the currencies in the world today. The Sri Lankan Rupee has not appreciated. So, imagine what will happen when it starts appreciating. Hon. Minister, you are well versed with the international conditions. The Dollar is picking up now with the changes that are taking place in the USA and it will have a drastic increase that will have a direct impact and you will not be able to peg it at Rs. 108 and Rs. 109. Then you are going to the Standard Chartered Bank asking for US Dollars 250 million to pay off for yesterdays debts. You are borrowing for tomorrow to pay off the day before yesterdays debts. That is the problem. So, rectify this situation. There is no point in coming and saying that there is about a 10 per cent export of leather hides in this country when you have these types of external problems. Then, the other biggest problem is that you are borrowing to pay for recurrent expenditure. That is the biggest fear we have. Ensure that you correct it. Then,

Hon. Minister, the other point is, you are permitting foreigners to buy Treasury Bills. You are permitting commercial banks to allow foreigners to invest Dollars and pay them interest at the rate of Rs. 18 or Rs. 19. So, when that Dollar is pegged artificially, you have to ensure that they do not have a currency risk factor. Then you are going to have Dollars coming in. But on the day you correct that and allow it to float, and then if you are made the Finance Minister tomorrow, you will justify that you cannot have an artificially high rupee. Then when you will allow it to depreciate, you are putting the country into an economic jeopardy because when the Dollar depreciates, the country would not have its capital market that has been opened up now and if you are going to allow them to take the money out, you will be draining the reserves. Hon. Minister, what is happening now is what we said four years ago in this House when we debated the amendment brought in to the Sri Lanka Export Development Act of 1979. What we told then has happened today. Now what we are telling today will happen tomorrow. The quicker you go home is safer for this country. We have been telling this perennially. Ensure that we correct this. You are allowing the foreigners coming to this country to take interest on their savings out of this country without tax. If you, I or a corporate body basically go and buy a Treasury Bill or basically put our savings into a savings account, you or the corporate body will be called upon to pay 35 to 40 per cent tax, you will be called upon to pay other taxes and about 40 per cent of your earnings will be taken away. But a foreigner who has nothing to do with this country will come and take interest on their savings without paying a single cent as taxes. Who is held responsible for this? That is why I have refrained myself from repeatedly saying this. As you know I always target the economy and not individuals. But here I am targeting two people. We have asked Dr. P.B. Jayasundera, Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and Planning and Mr. Nivard Cabraal, Governor of the Central Bank be held responsible for all these acts that are taking place. We have given them enough time to come forward, debate with us, tell the people and correct us if we are wrong. But, there is a stony silence and they are taking the economy hypocritically into a further derelict situation putting yourselves, ourselves and the country into jeopardy at the expense of their political thrill. They are singing hosannas for their dinner and for their survival. It does not mean that you and I and the Professor need to listen to what they are saying. They should be held responsible. , " " . 35 , ? , , ? ?

Hon. Minister, I am sure in your tenure of office you would never have dreamt of it; you would have loved to have it.

Opening the capital market would be a dream for any Minister of Finance. But, if you open this in the worst of conditions, you are only going to put the countrys economy into a further derelict situation. Then, Hon. Minister, today there are floods where 380,000 people have been displaced. The Hon. John Senewiratne's Ratnapura District was affected very badly. There were 23 deaths reported by the Government media and otherwise. All of them mean that there is economic displacement. Economic displacement would mean that there are displaced people all over. Get them back into the normal lives. Are you spending Rs. 23 million only to get such a thing done? I mean, Rs. 23 million is Rs. 100 a day. There was flood for six days. If you divide Rs. 100 by 6, it is nearly Rs. 20. What hypocrisy is this Government practising? The Dinamina newspaper of 3rd June, 2008 states, I quote: 23 So, when you divide this, it does not even come to Rs. 90 per person for those six days. So, it is Rs. 15 a day. This is according to the Government information. So, on that particular basis -

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne)

May I correct you? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Yes, please.

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne)

The allocation is Rs. 100 per day.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Minister, I saw that reflection today in the newspapers.

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne)

May be. But, you know -

The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen who is the Hon. Minister in charge has gone on record saying, We have allocated ... This was up to yesterday.

201 202

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne)

Please allow me to explain this further. This is a decision that was taken at the last Cabinet meeting. We know only Rs. 70 had been hitherto paid. Now, that is increased to Rs. 100. So, Rs.100 is paid per day.

( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Rs. 100 per day and with retrospective effect.

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. W. D. J. Senewiratne)

With retrospective effect; from the day it was started. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Okay, I saw the "retrospective effect" comes in today. But when there is a problem in the country -

( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, the Cabinet decision was taken after all these were given to the newspapers. So, you have to go by the current situation. You may be right in the sense that - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

I am not privy to the Cabinet, Hon. Minister. I am only privy to what comes in the newspapers. I am saying this according to the information given in your Daily News. I have given the benefit of the doubt - ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

The decision of the Cabinet was made clear by the Cabinet Spokesman the following day. You are referring to a newspaper of a previous occasion. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

I have referred to your Daily News which gives your gospel truth. ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

So, newspapers change day by day. I can quote somebody else - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

I am only helping you. I am only justifying a cause on your behalf. I am only trying to say the importance that needs to be put in. Exigencies mean that you must utilize money even without asking. The Cabinet can be told later. ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) We have rectified the situation. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

You do not go to the Cabinet to get Rs. 3,200 million to run amok with Mihin Air. The Cabinet approved relief for the innocent people suffering due to floods eight days later. Sajin de Vaas can go and basically ruin Rs. 1,200 million of Government funds without Cabinet approval. Now, that you provoked me I will give you an answer to that. Then what about the Rs. 685 million that is due to the Petroleum Corporation? Poor Asantha de Mel says that he cannot basically go ahead and ask from the Minister of Finance because Rs. 685 million is due from Mihin Air. He has to encash a bank guarantee which is Rs. 25 million. Now, could you and I, if we are running a petrol shed, give a Rs. 25 million bank guarantee and get Rs. 250 million worth of petrol or Rs. 685 million worth of petrol? Now that this issue is mentioned, I have to take you to a different vicissitude. Look, an amount of Rs. 44 billion is due from all Government institutions to the Petroleum Corporation. If you take Rs. 44 million ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , . ( ) (The Presiding Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) 10 . ( ) (The Presiding Member) . .

: Letter tabled: Leader of the Opposition Parliament of Sri Lanka 7th March 2008 H E Ms Benita Ferrero Waldner Commissioner of External Relations & European Neighbourhood Policy European Commission Dear Commissioner, I am writing to inform you and the Commission, that the United National Party (UNP) - the major Party in Opposition in the Sri Lankan Parliament, which I lead, has decided to support a proposal made to the Government by the Apparel Industry to amend the 1978 Sri Lankan Constitution in order that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the First Optional protocol to the Covenant, be suitably incorporated in the Constitution. The reason for this recommendation is that in a recent case which came up before the supreme Court, the Court had ruled that the ICCPR has no legal effect in Sri Lanka since no steps have been taken to give statutory effect to the rights contained therein. As you may know, the ICCPR was retified by the Sri Lankan Government in 1980 when the UNP Government was in power. Thereafter, in 1997, the First Optional Protocal to the Covenant was also retified. Subsequently the Supreme Court ruled that no domestic legislation is necessary to give effect to the ICCPR. Although the Government in November 2007 passed a law in regard to the ICCPR this is inadequate and insufficient since it has omitted many provisions of the convention and the Protocol. If the Government has not objection to such an amendment, the necessary 2/3rds majority in Parliament, which constitutional amendments require, will be obtained. Yours sincerely, Sgd. Ranil Wickremasinghe Leader of the Opposition Leader of the United National Party

Peiris - Minister of Export Development and International Trade) Venerable Sir, one of the conspicuous speeches of this Debate was the focus on the GSP Plus issue. Many speakers who participated in this Debate made suggestions about the manner in which the Government should deal with the negotiations in this regard. There was a great deal of confusion reflected in many of the speeches that were made on the Floor of the House today. I think it is very important to clarify these issues. Several Honourable Members urged the Government to bring legislation before the House -

, () , ( ) . Whereupon THE. HON. (VEN.) UDAWATTE NANDA THERO left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. RAMALINGAM CHANDRASEKAR] took the Chair. . . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Sir, I was referring to the fact that many Honourable Members who took part in this Debate urged the Government to bring legislation before this House to give effect to the First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Hon. Dilan Perera made the point that there is absolutely no connection between these two things. That is the correct view, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees. GSP Plus is one matter; the First Optional Protocol is a different matter and there is absolutely no connection between the two. GSP Plus of course is a matter which we are all interested in. It has an important bearing on Sri Lankas economy. In order to obtain this concession from the European Union for three more years, from 2009 to 2012, we have to comply with certain requirements. There are certain criteria which have been stipulated by the European Union. One of these criteria, Sir, is ratification and implementation of 27 International Covenants in four different fields: human rights, labour issues, governance and the environment. One of the major covenants in this regard is an International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. We have an obligation if we are to make out a successful case for GSP Plus to establish that the rights that are enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are applicable, are enforceable in this country. There are many substantive rights that are embedded in the ICCPR. So, we have to satisfy the European Union that those rights receive expression in the legal system of our country and they are enforceable by the courts of this country. That is what we have to establish. The First Optional Protocol is a completely different matter. It has nothing to do with the enforcement of human rights in this country. It has to do with an appeal from the Supreme Court of this country to a tribunal abroad. This is not a requirement with regard to GSP Plus at all. The European Union has never told us to incorporate the First Optional Protocol as a condition for obtaining GSP Plus. I think many other people who spoke of the First Optional Protocol did not have, with great respect, a clear understanding of what it is. The First Optional Protocol means that a judgment by the most exalted judicial tribunal in this country, the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka, will be subject to appeal to a foreign tribunal. Now this cannot be done without amending the Constitution. The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella said, What is the problem? The United National Party will provide a two-thirds majority. But that does not solve the problem at all. This is one of the basic provisions embedded in the Constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) Alienation of our sovereignty. . . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Absolutely. As the Hon. Leader of the House says this involves the alienation of Sri Lankas sovereignty. Articles 3, 4 and the other provisions of Sri Lankas Constitution involve an exclusive entrenchment of judicial power in the courts of the Republic. Nobody can exercise judicial power in this country other than the courts of Sri Lanka; courts and tribunals that are established by law. Therefore, in terms of our Constitution it is absolutely impossible for a foreign tribunal to exercise judicial power in this country. Now this was pointed out very clearly by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka in the Singarasa case. They said that the First Optional Protocol is ultra vires the Constitution. In other words there is a fundamental incompatibility between the First Optional Protocol and the Constitution of Sri Lanka. It cannot be done. The UNP simply saying that they will give two-thirds majority does not solve the problem at all. There will definitely have to be a referendum. Now, Sir, I venture to suggest that no government in this country, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the United National Party or any other party will go before the people of this country and ask them to approve legislation to make the judgment of the Supreme Court subject to appeal to a foreign tribunal. It is a transgression of self-respect of national dignity. Nobody will suggest that to the people of Sri Lanka and I state with confidence that if any such suggestion is made to the sovereign people of Sri Lanka at a referendum, there is absolutely no doubt that the people of Sri Lanka will reject such a proposition with contempt. Now, I would also like to add, Sir, if that is the position, if we are contend to have a foreign tribunal sitting in judgment over the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka, why did we abolish appeals to the Privy Council? There was a time when the Privy Council was the highest court of appeal in this country. Judgments of the Supreme Court have been set aside in appeals in the Privy Council, but all self-respecting countries, after obtaining Independence at some time or other, have abolished appeals to the Privy Council. That means, that we want the highest court in this country to have the last word with regard to the interpretation of the laws which govern the citizens of Sri Lanka. Therefore, Sir, I state categorically that the Government will under no circumstances bring legislation before this House to enact the First Optional Protocol. That will be a breach of the faith reposed by the people of our country in the Government. We will under no circumstances do that and if anybody attempts it, I am quite certain that the attempt will be futile because the people of Sri Lanka in their wisdom, will reject such an attempt. Now, I also want to make the point very

285 286

emphatically, Sir, that the European Union has not expressly or by implication at any time suggested any such thing. This suggestion comes from other people. The EU has not asked for this. This is not a condition for obtaining GSP Plus. It is therefore a red herring across the trail. That is exactly what it is. Now, this is a suggestion that is made with ulterior purposes. There may be certain political objectives that are accomplished by bringing about a situation in which the Supreme Court is not the final arbiter of the laws of the Republic. There may be some people who have a political interest in that. And, that may be why those people are wanting the Government to bring such legislation before the House. But, it certainly has no bearing whatsoever on the European Union, on the criteria governing GSP Plus and the whole content of the negotiations which are taking place between the Government of Sri Lanka and the European Commission. It is therefore necessary, Sir, to have a clear idea about this matter. We have an obligation. The obligation is to ensure that the rights enshrined in the International Covenant are fully enforceable in this country. We may all have different views with regard to this. But, there is only one view which matters. There is only one view which is authoritative and that is the view of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka. All that the European Union is interested in is one matter. If a person who complains of the transgression of a right that is guaranteed by the International Covenant on the Civil and Political Rights, if such a person comes before a court in Sri Lanka, will that person be entitled to a remedy or not? We have to establish that such a person will have a remedy before the courts of Sri Lanka. Now, this is why, Sir, His Excellency the President using the powers that are conferred upon him by Article 129(1) of Sri Lankas Constitution referred this very matter to the Supreme Court for an authoritative ruling. The Supreme Court gave a categorical answer to that question. The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka ruled that the rights which are guaranteed by the ICCPR are embedded in the legal system of Sri Lanka and are justiciable through the judicial process of Sri Lanka. That was the clear ruling by the Supreme Court in the exercise of their jurisdiction under Article 129(1) of the Constitution. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition addressing the Seva Vanitha Unit of the Colombo District was reported in the media as having said that that is not an authoritative ruling because it was not pronounced in a judgment in litigation between parties. In other words, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition said that although the Supreme Court has expressed its view, it is not binding because it is not a judgment of the Supreme Court. With all respect, Sir, that is an erroneous view of the law. The Supreme Court has clearly stated on more than one occasion that there is absolutely no difference - ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Has the EC accepted that?

2008 06

. . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Yes, they have. Their position is - ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) ? . . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) I did not disturb you. The European Union has taken up the position that this is a matter to be resolved by the courts of Sri Lanka. It is not their intention - ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) opinion ? . . . . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) ; . . . . - [ ] ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) First Optional Protocol . . . . . First Optional Protocol . . . . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) , . First Optional Protocol . . , , . Sir, it is therefore very clear from what the Supreme Court has said that there is no distinction between a judgment of the court in litigation between parties and then, the opinion that is pronounced in the exercise of jurisdiction under Article 129 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has stated very categorically that their ruling is equally authoritative in both cases. So, that is all I wish to say on that subject. The Government, I categorically state, will not bring legislation before this

287 288

House to amend Sri Lankas Constitution. It is superfluous; it is redundant; it is unnecessary and it has nothing whatsoever to do with the case for GSP Plus. I would leave the matter at that with your permission, Sir. Then, I would like very briefly to refer to one or two other matters. The Hon. Sunil Handunnetti raised some issues connected with the Order, which is the subject matter of this Debate. He asked, if certain categories of items cannot be lawfully exported from the country at all, then what is the rationale underpinning the imposition of a cess? The assumption which was made by the Hon. Member was that the export of rawhides is absolutely prohibited in this country today. That is not the case. I have explained that to the Hon. Member. The Government is considering whether such a prohibition should be imposed. I think there will be, in the next few weeks, discussions among the relevant Ministries and we will make a decision with regard to that matter. But while this is lawful, in the intervening period when the export of rawhides is lawful, it serves a purpose to introduce this cess, the enhanced cess as a means of creating a disincentive. The effect of the disincentive would be to discourage the export of these rawhides. That means that it will be available in the country for use by the small and medium sector in particular. It will enable value addition. It will also generate employment opportunities. I think the Hon. Member accepted that point of view on the assurance that I gave him that this matter would receive the earnest consideration of the Government and the imposition of an overall prohibition on the export of rawhides will be considered in earnest by the Government as a matter of priority. The Hon. Wasantha Samarasinghe raised the issue relating to the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement which, in a sense, is a logical extension of the Free Trade Agreement between India and Sri Lanka which was entered into in the year 1988. The FTA dealt with physical commodities and CEPA deals with services. This is not the occasion to embark upon a detailed discussion of the matters connected with the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement. I have received a communication from the Hon. Wasantha Samarasinghe and I have invited the Hon. Member to a discussion in our Ministry next Friday to which I have invited all the relevant officials as well as all three Chambers of Commerce in this country: the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, the National Chamber of Commerce and the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry. So, I look forward to that discussion. I think we can clarify some of these issues and it would not be necessary to anticipate that discussion in the course of this particular Debate. Sir, I would like to make one other point. That is, underpinning the observations that were made by both Members of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti and the Hon. Wasantha Samarasinghe, there was a very proper, a very opportune emphasis on

[ . . ]

social equity. I would like to assure the Hon. Members that that is very much a part and parcel of the thinking of the Government. Contrary to what was said by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, there has been no decline with regard to the countrys exports at all. On the contrary, exports grew by as much as 15 per cent last year. In some sectors, the progress has been very much more. It has reached 75 per cent, 80 per cent in some areas like electronics, rubber, paper and so on. But we are not content with that. I do not think that that is a reason for complacency. We consider it equally important, Sir, to ensure that these benefits percolate down to the grass-roots level and result in a more equitable distribution of income and resources within Sri Lanka. It is a matter of legitimate pride to the Government, Sir, that the Per Capita Income of Sri Lanka today has reached the level of US Dollars 1,630. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , . . , . , , . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER took the Chair. . . ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I was reflecting on the fact that the Government is determined not only to increase the volume of our export earnings, but also to ensure that these benefits reach the grass-roots level. With that object in view, we are nurturing and developing the concept of the export promotion villages in the remoter parts of the country: Tambuttegama in the Anuradhapura District, Embilipitiya and Kolonna in the Ratnapura District. We are developing the beeralu lace industry in the Galle District. There are some very ambitious

289 290

programmes with regard to gem and jewellery in the Ratnapura District. All this is with a view to ensuring that there is a more equitable distribution of these benefits and that these benefits are not confined to Colombo and the principal cities of the country. So, we appreciate the point that was made by the Hon. Members and I assure them that it reflects an integral part of the thinking of the Government with regard to the development of our exports. In conclusion, Sir, I would like to sincerely thank Members on both sides of the House who gave their expertise, wisdom and sagacity to enrich these proceedings. I thank them and I assure them that the suggestions they made will be taken seriously into consideration by the Government in formulating further legislation in the weeks to come. Thank you very much, Sir. , . . Question put, and agreed to.
