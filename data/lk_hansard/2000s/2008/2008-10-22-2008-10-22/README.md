Hon. Chairperson, I am privileged today to contribute to the Adjournment Motion presented before this House by the Hon. (Mrs.) Sujatha Alahakoon, more because I for one, had my primary and secondary education in a fee-levying school and having taught in a Maha Vidyalaya for six years and thereafter being an employer for almost 25 years, it gives me an opportunity to look at our educational system in a different light. We all know that the right to education is a fundamental human right enshrined in Article 13 of the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1966. Having it as a fundamental human right, the formal education basically consists of systematic instruction, teaching and training by professional teachers which consist of applications of pedagogy and the development of curricula. Educational systems are established to provide education and training. A curriculum defines what students should know, understand and be able to do as the result of education. Sometimes, we find in this part of the world that there is a sort of social engineering done through the educational system to promote certain doctrines or ideals as well as knowledge. If I may recall, Joseph Stalin once said, Education is a weapon whose effects depend on who holds it in his hands and at whom it is aimed. And Socrates said, Education is the kindling of a flame, not the filling of a vessel. Looking at these quotes and building on that, we have seen that education in this country moved from a Guru Gedara or a Gurukula system to a Pirivena system, a missionary system and then, to a system of Government

2008 22 2273 2274

schools, ethnic schools, central schools, junior schools, Maha Vidyalayas, Madya Maha Vidyalayas, Provincial schools, National schools, Navodya Schools, Isuru Schools and international schools. This whole concept of free education brought about by Dr. C.W.W. Kannangara, the first Minister of Education, way back in 1941 has seen a transformation. So, after 67 years of free education, we need to sit back and analyse objectively as to what we have achieved through this transformation or what it has resulted in what we have today. I am very happy that the present Minister of Education, for whom I have the highest regard, a person whom I had the opportunity of associating with for almost five days at the University of Hong Kong long before my entry into Parliament and whom I observed at close quarters is a person who can judge right from wrong and take bold decisions to direct education in the right direction being in charge of this subject. I browsed through the website of the Ministry of Education and under "Our Vision" it states, I quote: To reach excellence in global society through competent citizens who share the Sri Lankan identity. And under "Our Mission" it states, I quote: Develop competent citizens keeping with the global trends through innovative and modern approaches to education leading to efficiency, equity and high quality in performance ensuring stakeholder satisfaction. Now, if you take in the current context, these fit in with the global context but the big question is whether the system is ready to take on this vision and mission. We all know that since 1970, the whole public administrative system has been highly politicized and all those who have sat before us in this House are responsible for that. But the sad thing is that the very base of human society, the very value that makes us a good human being is also politicized. Today, we know that the teaching profession has become a job bank. It is not only today, it has been so since 1970. Every government has found it very convenient to appoint people, immaterial of their aptitude to teach, as teachers and we continue to blame the systems and the Ministers who handle this subject, for a system brought about by us. We have a rush for grade one admissions; principals are arrested for corruptions, every influential person is approached for admission to a reputed school. Now, how did we categorize these reputed schools and are they reputed schools? If Royal College or Thurstan College or Isipathana College or Visakha Vidyalaya were reputed schools and the most sought-after for grade one admission, then we should be able to analyse the result of the grade five scholarship examination which is the first

major hurdle that the students face after entering grade one. How do these results correspond to the demand that these schools have for admission? How has Royal College fared at the grade five scholarship examinations if there is such a huge demand for grade one admissions? So, the cause of this problem is that we really do not know what is good for us. If I may recall, Cicero, a famous Roman philosopher and statesman said, A mind without instruction can no more bear fruit than can a field, however fertile, without cultivation. Now, coming from the question of reputed schools to the present four categories of schools we have, the type 3, the type 2, the type 1C and the type 1AB schools, we need to see whether this categorization serves the present need because we all agree that each category of students needs a different type of approach to teaching. If you take the primary school, the primary school is the first experience a child has from a state of ignorance with a desire to learn to gather knowledge. We assume that those who enter a school at primary are ignorant, they have a desire to learn and therefore they gather knowledge. Now to be able to impart knowledge to them, these children who are so tender in age need personal attention. They need to be coached personally. They need to see a mother figure or a father figure in the teachers who work with them throughout the day. The famous film producer, Walt Disney said, Crowded classrooms and half-day sessions are a tragic waste of our greatest national resource - the minds of our children. So this approach to the classification of schools and the allocation of resources has to be in keeping with the need that this sector of students need. If we look at it we should be thinking of smaller primary classes with more teachers and a different categorization or may be a reversion to the old system of having primary schools and secondary schools and developing the education system in keeping with the mindset of the students rather than attaching names and politicizing this environment. Now, after the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, we have two sets of schools in this country: we have the National schools and we have the Provincial schools. The National schools are supposed to be administered by the line ministry. I am not sure as to what the frequency is in regard to the supervision of these National Schools by the line Ministry or how often they visit these national schools to find out what is going on. Now, I have four National Schools in my electorate. I do not see any difference in the way they are administered or in the results they produce. Hon. Minister, I want to draw your attention to an incident that occurred at the National School in Samanthurai. I was told last week that buildings that were built one year ago have been demolished to accommodate a Divisional Education Office. A Divisional Education Office, I assume, looks after the administration of provincial schools or is an administrative arm of the Ministry of Education. Now,

2275 2276

the buildings in a National School are demolished to make way for a Divisional Education Office and with impunity. There is no one who has taken responsibility as to who took the decision to demolish these buildings. Buildings that were put up only last year were strangely demolished to make way for a Divisional Education Office. I made a visit to the Zonal Office on a public day and met with the staff as someone who has taught some of them and I even had some contemporaries there. I was talking to them about their functions. While looking at the administrative set up, I realized that there was a Zonal Director, there were four Deputy Directors, there were Additional Directors and in-service Instructors. So, basically there were enough people to supervise the teaching that was going on in all the schools under them. But sad to say, while discussing, one ISA who was explaining the functions of the ISAs - ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. M. M. Naoshaad) . So, this ISA got up and said, Sir, we have a problem. I asked, What is the problem? He said, Sir, these teachers do not respect us. So, I burst out laughing and said, Respect is not something I can give you in writing. We can only give you an appointment. If the teachers are not respecting you, that means, you have not earned their respect. Now, this is the sad plight of our education system. We have heaps of - almost 8,000 - acting principals. We have excess teachers in most schools and shortages in the same schools subjectwise. We have political interference in every sphere. We have graduate appointments being made immaterial of where they would end up or what speciality they have. Graduates who have obtained a Second Class Upper are posted to primary schools. So this whole thing has to be looked into. We have to look at the quality of what we have created. We know that the teacher is the most important element of the system. Teachers need the ability to understand a subject well enough to convey its essence to a new generation of students. The goal is to establish a sound knowledge base on which students will be able to build as they are exposed to different life experiences. The passing of knowledge from generation to generation allows students to grow into useful members of society. Good teachers can translate information, good judgment, experience and wisdom into relevant knowledge that a student can understand, retain and pass on to others. Studies suggest that the quality of teachers is the single most important factor affecting students performances. We know that.

But that is the very area in which we are the weakest. Graduates are placed as teachers without an aptitude test whether they have the aptitude to teach. They have the knowledge but, can they impart it to be understood? That is the most important thing. In the field of CIMA and CMA, if we can excel in the world and produce number one students in those examinations, that is a sure indication that those who have taught those children have the ability to teach them to be understood. That is what ails our education system today. There is total corruption in the administrative system, incompetence in the administrative system at the school level, and lack of proper supervision of the system, not due to their ability or inability, but due to the political interferences that have invaded this system. What we have to do collectively is to move out from interfering in the administration of the education sector. Only that action will help to improve and help the Ministers in charge to be able to charter a course where we can produce children who can fit into todays society. Today my elder son is in the University of Adelaide. He is in his fourth year of engineering. Why? He studied in the Sinhala medium. He attended tuition classes in the Pansala. He got through the Advanced Level Examination, but I had to send him abroad. So, we have to look at as to how we are going to make available opportunities for the children, who cannot gain admission to universities, without having a nationalistic line and saying, No, we cannot allow fee-levying education at the higher level. That means, you are depriving your own children of an opportunity to excel in the world. We are playing politics with education; we continue to play politics; we keep changing names, but the standard of education is dropping. I would like to ask the Hon. Minister to do a study of the performance of the free education system from 1941 to 1970 and from 1970 to-date and see how much of interference in the administration of the education sector per se has affected the quality of education in this country.

( ) (The Presiding Member) . . 5 . ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Shafeek Rajabdeen) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. I thank you, Hon. Presiding Member for giving me the opportunity to speak on the Adjournment Motion presented by the Hon. (Mrs.) Sujatha Alahakoon. I must also place on record that the Hon. Minister of Education, coming from the Western Provincial Council and now in national politics as the Minister of Education, is an expert in education. I wish to pay tribute to the excellent work done by him. I must also say that the Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha has done his job well, but there are a lot of grievances in the City of Colombo. I am representing the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress from the Colombo District. As you know, the education system in the principal City of Colombo on which I wish to speak in this august Assembly, has many short comings. We have a shortage of teachers and a demand for principals. Today, the politically-motivated appointees to the education sector, especially through the provincial councils system, has caused deterioration in the education sector. Today, I wish to speak on the revival of Muslim education in this country, especially as a Muslim representing the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress. Over 50,000 Muslim students in Muslim schools in the City of Colombo are being educated. We have 23 provincial schools and two National Schools. We also have another 20,000 students being educated in Sinhala, Christian and Tamil Vidyalayas. Also, there are over 20,000 Muslim students who study in the international Muslim schools in the City of Colombo. That shows the revival of Muslim education in the City. The Muslim community has made double-fold efforts in their education, where over 25 international schools have been started in the last ten years. I must say that the 25 Muslim international schools have started because of the inability of our community members to get their children admitted to Grade One. Our people, especially the Tamils, the Sinhalese and the Muslims, who are in the City of Colombo are sent from pillar to post, because everybody wants to send their children to famous Government schools. I must therefore say that our community which gives priority to educate the children, has established over 25 international schools and a lot of children are being educated there. Hon. Minister, if you look at the 23 provincial schools and the two National Schools, you will find only one or two are SLAS qualified or with qualifications to hold the post of principal. The rest of them are acting principals. I must invite the attention of the Hon. Minister to get more

qualified people to be principals of schools. The principals are the role model of the children. Today, for a Muslim school, a Muslim principal must be appointed. Get the correct educationists into the system so that we can educate our community to a greater fold. I also wish to invite your attention to some of the educational reforms that this country should adopt. We are in a developing world. A change is necessary. If you compare our education system with that of our neighbouring countries such as India, our system of education is far behind. Our children who are educated in the Grade 11 and 12 cannot enter the universities in India, Malaysia or Singapore. But, the children who are educated in international schools are able to enter and receive education in those universities. Therefore, I request the Hon. Minister to look into the research and development of the education system in Colombo. My brother Member who spoke before me requested you to have a study of the system of education from the '70s up to now. I will also fail in my duty if I do not bring to your attention the problems that parents encounter when they go to admit their children to schools for Grade One, especially the Muslims who are smaller in number in the Greater Colombo area. The Muslim parents are advised by the principals to go Muslim schools because of the Hijab, the Muslim disciplinary dress. In this country, we uphold our Constitution. Therefore, as a member representing the Muslim community, I wish to invite the attention of the Hon. Minister that all principals who are in office especially in the City of Colombo, must be sent a circular from time to time stating that the Punjabi costume must be accepted as the school uniform in respect of Muslim students. Those principals who ask students to remove the Punjabi dress at school assemblies must be immediately transferred. They must respect the human qualities, human traditions that we have, especially of a community which is an ethnic force. I must also say that less than one percent of our community is entering universities from the Colombo District whereas the percentage of those entering universities from other areas is greater in number. This is because displaced persons from outside the City of Colombo are appointed as principals and they are not doing their duties towards the up and coming future generation. I must also say that the poorest of the poor are finding it difficult to go to schools. I would like to request the Minister of Transport to make available free transport - like free education - for all students from the age of five up to the age of 15, so that they can travel free in any bus like in India. Our children are unable to attend schools because of the economic situation of the country. If the Government can give, especially to the students a free pass, a free system of transport for students, I think that would be the best. Transport for children in school buses must be free of charge. I would request the Minister of Transport to co-ordinate with the Minister of Education and make this facility available for students not only in the City of Colombo but islandwide.

I must also bring to the attention of the Hon. Minister the other shortcomings in schools. Most of these schools have semi-constructed buildings for over five years and are now in a deteriorating condition. I would request the Hon. Minister to see that the construction of these buildings are completed within a short period and proper infrastructure is provided for the education of children in this country. Thank you very much.

2008 6 " " . . . . Has the Holy Grail of education been sighted? - by Harsha Aturupane, Senior Economist, Human Development Unit, South Asia Region, World Bank". : The Sri Lankan education system appears to have reached and crossed this important turning point. The evidence, from number of sources suggests that average learning levels are rising.

NEREC . NEREC . : .the National Education Research and Evaluation Centre (NEREC) of the University of Colombo, show that learning outcome are rising among primary school children in mathematics, English and First Language. : The time trend of the GCE O/L pass rates, defined as students qualifying for the GCE A/L, is also positive and increasing. In 1996 only twenty six per cent of candidates passed the GCE O/L. By 2002 the GCE O/L pass rate had increased to forty two per cent, and in 2007 had risen further to forty nine per cent. . . 1994 ( ) 25.78. 49 . 1994 ( ) 46.01. 2007 61.32 . , ( ) , ( ) .
