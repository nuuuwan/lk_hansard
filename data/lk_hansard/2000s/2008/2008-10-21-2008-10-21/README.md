The Bill is not subject to any of the prohibitions or restrictions imposed by the 13th Amendment to the Constitution and may be enacted by Parliament. This is the opinion given by the Attorney-General. So, I believe that this in no way will take back the power that has already been devolved to the provincial councils and local government authorities.

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Venerable Chairperson, today we are giving consideration to an activity which is unfortunately not usually at the centre of our concerns. The topic is "Road Communications". We are discussing today a Supplementary Estimate for Rs. 9.8 billion as well as debating the National Thoroughfares Bill, meant to improve the existing thoroughly outdated Thoroughfares Ordinance enacted in 1861 under the British rule. The reason why I say the topic of road communications is neglected in our national debate on economics can be obtained by reading the enactment of the Thoroughfares Ordinance by the British. As we are all aware, the economic changes introduced by the British in the Colebrooke-Cameron Reforms of 1832, were based on capitalism replacing feudalism, the then prevalent form of production, distribution and exchange. The British realized that production alone was not sufficient, that what was produced had to be marketed. The markets were far from the centres of production. Road, sea and the newly-constructed rail transport also had to be further developed at the same time. What we are discussing today is about one component of this tripod, that of road transport. To enable road transport to be developed on a commercial basis, the Thoroughfares Ordinance was formulated by the British. But the Thoroughfares Ordinance was primarily concerned with facilitating the provision of specific road transport, to shift the products of the plantations located at the centre of the Island to Colombo for onward shipment to the metropolis of London. It also enabled the building of trunk roads to link the provincial and district capitals to Colombo, the colonial and administrative capital of the then Ceylon. The Thoroughfares Ordinance

2083 2084

was a supplement for the capitalist production of coffee, later tea, rubber and coconut and a colonial tool to better govern the country under the British. Though some side benefits came about as regards meeting the transport needs of the indigenous population, these were by the way. Under the British, the social and economic needs of the indigenous population were largely ignored. The situation got changed slightly under the Donoughmore Constitution when road development was placed under local ministers, but it did not matter much.

It was after Independence that road development with a focus on meeting the social needs of the indigenous people really started. The Kandyan Peasantry Commission was appointed to explicitly meet the road needs of the Kandyan areas which suffered badly during colonialism as the lands of the Kandyan peasantry were misappropriated to develop the plantations. The Kandyan peasants found that in the midst of their impoverished villages, there were gleaming macadamized roads serving the needs of the foreign-owned plantations but they were left with only footpaths to meet their needs. The Kandyan Peasantry Commission was created specifically to rectify this shortcoming.

Simultaneously, as a post-Independence initiative, a major programme of land development called "colonization schemes" was started, where roads were developed to meet the transport needs , both economic and social, of the new production centres of the plantations. The new production centres of the colonization schemes had to be and were provided with well-constructed roads. But there was one shortcoming. Like the Kandyan peasantry who felt that they were not looked after, the villagers in the peripheries of the colonization schemes felt that they were left out. The proposed National Thoroughfares Bill goes a long way in meeting the needs of this group. I am happy to note that an Advisory Council, which will make policy formulators aware of the needs of this group of people, is to be established. Very often, policies are formulated in the air-conditioned comforts of Colombo. Therefore, such policies have no real feeling for the needs of the voiceless and helpless people. The proposed National Thoroughfares Bill gives them some hope that things will change.

I must thank His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa for allocating large sums of money for building bridges, specially in the Trincomalee District such as the Kinniya Bridge, Irakkakandy Bridge, Pudawakattu Bridge and Nanu-Oya Bridge. Then, they are going to build the Upparu Bridge, Ganagai Bridge and the Mutur Bridge. They have already started the construction of the Trincomalee-Pulmoddai Road. Recently, they started Elle-Kantalai Road and the Habarana-Kantalai Road. Then, Kinniya-Tampalakamam

Road is to be finished soon. Therefore, I must thank His Excellency the President, the Minister, the Hon. T.B. Ekanayake, the Secretary, the General Manager and the staff of the RDA. They are doing very wonderful work in this country. Therefore, I am confident that the proposed National Thoroughfares Bill, under the dynamic leadership of the Hon. Minister, will provide these facilities. The provision of these facilities will ensure the fulfilment of the "Mahinda Chinthanaya" following the liberation of the East. Thank you.
