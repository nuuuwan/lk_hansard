    "text": "Proposal / Request : Cabinet Memorandum has been submitted by the Hon. Minister of Food and Marketing Development for the information of the Cabinet as per decision of the last Cabinet meeting held on 31st August 2001. Observations : I agree that there would be no option but the Government has to take over the losses incurred by the CWE arising from the operations carried out on Government directives. A Cabinet Paper will be submitted by me in this regard to take over the following losses.. Losses on paddy operations - Rs.290.7 Mn Losses on flour operations - Rs.3035.1 Mn Losses on rice imports - Rs.221.3 Mn - Rs.3547.1 Mn I cannot agree to subsidise the General Trading activity which has to be made a commercially viable operation. It has been brought to my notice that the Treasury has undertaken a detailed study on the Financial performance and position of the CWE and highlighted several courses of actions: 1. A complete restructure identifying factors causing losses, the unprofitable activities, Idle resources, excess cadre and stock losses to make the CWE viable entity. 2. Recruitments are made only with a proper cadre study. 3. Cost reductions to be effected in all areas of operations. 4. Strict compliance with Government Tender Procedure 5. Effective pricing policy to avoid any item to be sold below cost. While no positive action has been taken in this regard, there has been escalation of administrative and other costs and that recruitments are still made on an adhoc basis without any justification when the CWE is already overstaffed. I suggest that immediate action be initiated for a complete restructure of CWE to run it as a commercially viable venture.

Madam Chairperson, I will now get onto some of the salient features that are connected with the current economic downturn in the world. We are experiencing a global economic crisis which we are part of. That is why I think the Hon. Kabir Hashim raised several issues for me to respond. He raised about the WTO, he raised about Sri Lankas situation regarding the GSP Plus benefit vis-a-vis the so-called consequences arising out of it in the future and he also discussed about the global economy. I would like to come out with a structured approach regarding these matters because I think I owe an explanation on some of these matters, as to how the Government is looking at the downturn in the world economy. The downturn in the world economy and its day-to-day developments are well demonstrated and explained in some of the recent publications of international repute like the Time, the Newsweek, and the India Today. That is why I do not want to quote anything from the texts that we would have been otherwise used to quote in matters of economic discussions or debates of this nature. These theories that were associated in the text books have now been overtaken by the turmoil that has developed in the world, for the first time since 1929, in a most unprecedented manner and in a manner for which answers are still to be found. If you look at the cover page of the Time magazine of 13th October, 2008, which is the most recent, the heading states, The New Hard Times. Now what does",

    "text": "this say? On page 16, it makes a prediction, The End of Prosperity. On page 17, they have given two very interesting pictures of the New York Stock Exchange; the first taken on the 24th of October, 1929 and the second taken on the 30th of September, 2008, exactly after 79 years, with the same building, same features and the similar so-called scenario erupting, developing right opposite the New York Stock Exchange. The stock brokers, the people who have invested on stocks, the shareholders are standing in front of the building wanting to know why there is this sudden collapse in the world economy and where their wealth is going to be moved. Now the issue is, in a globalized sense whether countries like the United States and Europe who have major economies, have a network? This turmoil that has taken place in terms of an economic downturn lies on the basic fundamentals not being addressed in the context of a globalized economy. In this context, it is very interesting to note how the factors including the depression are going to be registered in the major economies that will have an outburst into all regions of the world. That is a known fact today. Now, look at the economy of Sri Lanka. You stated that our economy lies on the plantation sector. We have a strong plantation sector and an agriculture-based economy. Due to the incentives given by our President to farmers by way of fertilizer subsidies, today we have reached the level of self-sufficiency in our major food crops. We also have a situation where our industrial output has been growing by over 10 per cent annually during the last three years. How have we been able to register that confidence with the investors and the industrialists in Sri Lanka? You stated that there are inflationary pressures. Obviously, there are inflationary pressures on an economy that is expanding. What was the inflation rate when we were carrying out the Mahaweli project on an accelerated basis when simultaneously there was so much of investment getting registered in the latter part of the '70s and in the early part of the '80s? Inflation was 26 or 27 per cent then. But, there was money circulation, and there are economists who now strongly believe that inflation is a sign of a movement in an economy. It does not mean that it is a downturn in terms of an economy - the inflationary pressures. We have been experiencing that. It is very rarely that we have been registering a single digit inflation when we curtailed the expenditure, when we restricted the development and when we did not offer jobs to people, like we did in the years 2002 to 2004. We contracted the economy and thereby there was no expansion of the economy. As a result, there was no inflationary pressure. Inflationary pressure comes, as you know - you being an economist and a person in the business circus - when you are spending and the country has to spend today. As I said at the beginning, we have to spend in terms of eliminating terrorism, which is needed for our people's liberty to be restored and to protect our territorial integrity, for which we are now committed. Hon. Member, you cited the need for us to see that the efforts in the military area are curtailed. That, we are not prepared to do because we cannot do that. We cannot sacrifice our sovereignty and",

Madam Presiding Member, these are the areas of concern. Bringing a terrorist organization in parity with the sovereign State of Sri Lanka has cost us the enormous investment that we have to make today on the military efforts in order to eliminate terrorism from Sri Lanka. Today, terrorism has become a global menace. See, what India is saying about terrorism? The journal \"India Today\" of 26th May, 2008 states, I quote: Terror Attacks - Why can't they be stopped? That is the cry that is coming from India in terms of terrorism and the terror attacks that have now registered a phenomenal growth in the sub-continent. And that is why we are on common grounds for the elimination of terrorism from Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and the rest of the world. That is why we are trying to have a more structured approach when it comes to matters of terrorism. We want to eliminate terrorism whilst protecting our people. That is what we did successfully in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka. It is that we want to follow throughout the world. It is through that we look forward to ensuring the security of our people and that their liberties are not suppressed and diverted by terrorist movements as happening in Vanni today, if I may cite the relevant areas. Now we are talking about the expenditure factor and I said that today expenditure is needed for securing the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. One factor that threatens the economies of the world today is terrorism. Even this global crisis is largely due to the extra expenditure incurred to counter terrorism. The United States of America had also to engage itself in countering terrorism. Pakistan and Afghanistan are today trying to counter the Thalaiban's presence in the West frontier of Pakistan and that has led to extra expenditure which otherwise would have been spent for national development, humanitarian assistance, the well being of our people. and other areas of concerns. Look at the terror attacks taking place in India. It is in that context that we are sharing common ground with India. That is why we are making an effort to ensure that LTTE terrorism does not spread to India. We do not want to see an unfortunate incident like the killing of",

    "text": "Rajiv Gandhi in India in 1990. See the efforts taken by Indian journals. The journal \"India Today\" of 26th May, 2008, has articulated the terror attacks that are taking place in India and the need to improve the intelligence, countering measures to denounce terrorism and safeguard the civilians. This is the effect of terrorism that sees no boundaries, no boarders world over. The cover story of that journal \"India Today\" on the Jaipur blasts states, \"Why and Who did it?\" Under that heading, it states, I quote: Terrorism makes no distinction between its victims. When the Pink City .... That is known as Jaipur. ...experienced its first terror strike on that fateful Tuesday of May 13, the victims were Muslims and Hindus alike, poor and affluent, men, women and children.\" This is something we see happening not only in Jaipur but also in Colombo, Vanni, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Batticaloa and in most parts of Sri Lanka. Is it not similar to what we experienced in Dehiwala; what we have experienced in Pettah; what we have experienced in the rest of the country? When it comes to victims of terrorism, whether they be Buddhists, Hindus, Catholics or Muslims or Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims or Burghers, there is no discrimination. The whole of Sri Lanka has suffered in this exercise. That is why our Government is having a very considered approach in taking this forward and we like to see the co-operation extended across the divide, because that is the fundamental need. Today, there is a world economic crisis; a crisis that is looming over the world and is collecting dust from the riches of the west which has now got into ashes and that ash will blow over all parts of the world. It is that turmoil that is also reflected in this most recent article which appeared in the \"Time\" magazine dated 20th October, 2008. In that, the cover story states, \"London's Sinking\". The banking sector is sinking in London. It further says, I quote : Londons Gathering Storm Fueled by a boom in high finance, the city became an irresistible magnet for money and talent. Now, as the economic crisis hits, a darker era looms. This is where more bank jobs are axed. In Sri Lanka, more bank jobs are given. That is the difference. More opportunities for graduates are being extended. Job opportunities are guaranteed in Sri Lanka for graduates and this is the structure within which we are now advocating in spite of the terrorism we are encountering in Sri Lanka. When we come to humanitarian assistance, we also must cite that. ( ) (The Hon. Thilakaratne Withanachchi) , .",

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) Madam Presiding Member, I was speaking about the need to look into the humanitarian aspects. While taking every effort to see that the humanitarian aspects are met, we have a political agenda to counter terrorism. That is a military exercise so that we will not have an armed LTTE, which is an obstruction to Sri Lanka's lasting peace. I wish to categorically state that with regard to humanitarian assistance, there is absolutely no shortage of food or essential items in Vanni. In fact, we are very much aware that a substantial quantum of humanitarian aid that we sent to the Vanni is expropriated by the LTTE. We have a very good record in terms of our humanitarian assistance in Sri Lanka. We have sustained a very regular, sufficient and adequate supply of food items to Jaffna since the blockade of the A-9 road. Even recently, we were taking food as much as the day before yesterday, to Jaffna. Look at the obstruction that was caused by the LTTE to our food convoy. A few days ago, when we were taking food and essential items to the Vanni, the LTTE artillery fire prevented the food convoy from moving. In spite of that, we advanced subsequently. Thereafter, on the 22nd when two vessels were carrying essential food items to Jaffna, there was an interception by the suicide boats of the LTTE. They hit the hull of one of our vessels causing damage, which is repairable. But we went ahead to make sure that the food convoys and vessels carrying essential items and quantities of food were delivered to the Jaffna Peninsular. We have been very conscious as our President has stated right throughout about our responsibility to ensure adequate supply of food to the people in Vanni. We have taken on board, the sentiments expressed by our friends in India and the leadership in Delhi, on the humanitarian aspects. Some people are trying to make it appear as if it is a major type of interference. But we have to state categorically, with responsibility, that we are taking every effort to protect humanitarian needs whilst engaging in a conflict with the LTTE. His Excellency the President, Mahinda Rajapaksa is personally monitoring the situation. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , .",

There is a wrong impression created in Tamil Nadu that this has not been done. This is furthest from the correct position. All these are our citizens and we take every measure to look after and provide for them. Now, Madam Chairperson, these are our efforts in addressing the concerns expressed and we also take it as our fundamental duty and responsibility as shown from the past record of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksas administration. The Government attaches the highest importance to the humanitarian needs of the people. That is why I am saying that even today it is pleasing to note that the sentiments expressed from Chennai are also getting concentrated in terms of development that has taken place since the telephone conversation between the Prime Minister of India, Mr. Manmohan Singh and His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Now, I have a copy of an extract of the statement dated 20th October, 2008, issued by the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, Mr. M. Karunanidhi, on the efforts he has taken regarding the Sri Lankan issue. He is very emphatic and this is how he has looked at the Sri Lankan issue? He states, I quote: The day to day reports which state that the Central Government in New Delhi has systematically accepted the resolution forwarded by us with genuine care for Sri Lankan Tamils and acting upon them, Dr. Manmohan Singh has stressed that the innocent civilians should be protected from the attacks.\" He says, \"protected from the attacks\" It is not to stop that. It further states: The Sri Lankan Government should guarantee uninterrupted relief assistance to them. Sri Lankas efforts in solving the problem and having a political process is something they are looking forward to. Now, the humanitarian aspect is the highlight that comes between the dialogue we have now established. It is the humanitarian aspect that our President is most conscious of and is trying to cater to. Our engagement with the LTTE militarily lies with the need for us to see that people in all parts of Sri Lanka have democracy, liberty and security for them. To create a pluralistic society in Vanni, as much as we have done in the East and the rest of the country, we have to have the scourge of terrorism eliminated from Sri Lankas soil and it is a joint effort. As found, the sentiments are the same in India in the need for us to eradicate terrorism; it is the same in the rest of the world. It is a heavy investment that all countries are making in spite of the downturn in the global economy and it is our own measures that we are today sharing with rest of the world. We have a very strong commitment in defending our position as a sovereign State. Again sometimes intrusions come in the guise of economic co-operation. Now, that is what I want to address.",

    "text": "My learned Friend who raised that matter, the Hon. Kabir Hashim, is unfortunately not in the House . He wanted to know how we are going to look at the effects of the GSP. Right now there is the GSP. Okay, the effects of GSP, in the event it is not there! He was worried that we would not assist or was he more worried that we are trying to assist the industrialists? Our Government has said that we could always assist as our industrialists need strength. We believe that greater economic contribution to the GDP of Sri Lanka comes from the industrial sector. I state this categorically having held several portfolios and being the Minister of Enterprise Development and Investment Promotion. Today, our industrialists and the investment community are very much behind the Government in our efforts. Should we not assist them when they are in need? It is our responsibility. These are the strengths that we command in having the economic architecture on which His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa is well in place. This sometimes may be a worrying factor to the Opposition. How well are we managing the economy in spite of having to fight terrorism and at the same time sustain humanitarian assistance to our people? When the world is shrinking in terms of a global economy, Sri Lanka's economy is trying to penetrate without WTO regulations being violated and becoming an anti- dumping issue merely because we try to assist our industrialists to access the European market. There again, there is an economic downturn which will not, in my opinion, have a so-called negative effect when it comes to access to the European market because the concessions that come from the GSP must be first kept in mind. It is only a 10 per cent duty concession not debarring of access to an affluent market. We strongly believe that access is there for us even without GSP. It is like the duties levied in Sri Lanka; it is sometimes removed and sometimes increased duties but still the economy can sustain and the exports get benefits arising from the market access they generate. So, that is how we are looking at the overall economic picture in todays context. In spite of all these efforts, we are trying to reach our people. That is our stock. For the Government of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the stock lies not in the dividends that the company generates, like how the UNP has interpreted the administration, the structure and the management style. Our President strongly believes in a people-centric economic development and a people-centric political agenda for Sri Lanka. That is why today we are managing the economy, the efforts in the military, the international relations, and the overall effects of a good architecture that we have placed for Sri Lanka. With these words, I conclude and thank Madam Chairperson for the time allotted to me and I wish the Opposition will support this Bill that is presented today to bring all the Banks in the rural sector into one unified banking system. Thank you.",

Mohamed Shafeek Rajabdeen) Venerable Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak a few words on the economic situation of our country. The economic situation in this country is in dire straits. The industries have fallen below recovery; they are suffering and the garment sector is seeking oxygen to survive. All other businesses in the country are coming to a standstill due to the heavy interest rates charged by the State and the private banks. It is sad at this juncture when you look at the foreign countries, where offshore banking systems have allowed lower interest rates and they have very competitive business enterprises where governments are taking advantage. It is a sad situation where politics of this Government is taking up issues of a State bank on behalf of the entrepreneurs who are suffering. Many corrupt practices in the same State bank as well as other private sector banks are not yet proven to be above politics and they have not even given relief as envisaged in the \"Mahinda Chintana\". Today someone heading a mega-government institution has launched into the business of finance and is offering over 25 per cent interest. Who is going to be benefited by such interest rates? Is it the farmer, is it the Government servant, is it the teacher or is it the worker? No, Venerable Sir, it is sad to say that it will only benefit owners of enterprises who seize the mega-structures that are coming up in the City of Colombo. Why can the State banks and the financial institutions not support the needy and the less fortunate people with lower interest rates?",

    "text": "Look at the expensive, luxury, luminous vehicles that the Chairmen of the State banks and the directors of the State banks are using. This is a colossal waste of money. The grant of funds for full-page advertisements to promote the \"Mahinda Chintana\" itself proves that the banks are only too willing to assist the high State expenses with the poor peoples money. This must be curtailed because State institutions do not have to publicize programmes of the President of the country as people know what the President is doing. Therefore, these extra expenditure must stop. You can save small amounts in the coffers as little drops of water make a mighty ocean. Therefore, curtailing expenditure in State banks must be done so that those colossal sums can be used to give relief to the poorest of the poor. For example, take the Thai Farmers Bank in Thailand which is giving many benefits through the provincial administration system of that country. The bankers are benefited by such advances so that they will be promoting their agricultural sector and make their country self-sufficient. What has happened to our country? In our country, bankers do not even look at the farmers. The farmers are unable to sell their products. For example, look the tea market. Nobody wants to buy tea. So, to whom do we sell our tea if we do not have a demand? We must have the intermediate organizations to help these farmers. I appeal to the Minister of Finance and the chairmen of the banks to set up housing schemes for the benefit of bank employees. So, the waste land areas which are found in abundance outside the City of Colombo can be utilized. I know, today the Housing Finance Development Corporation is not able to fund any individual, especially the Government sector employees in granting bank loans. As a leading house builder and a person who has done property development, I remember we gave a low cost housing scheme with 10 perches of land for Rupees one million through the National Savings Bank. I am sorry to say that the Government sector is unable to advance Rupees one million to our Government servants whose salaries are very low and they have no means of repaying the loans. Therefore, I recommend the Housing Development Finance Corporation to get the participation and assistance of various associations coming under the purview of various bodies such as the Chamber of Commerce, Business Chambers and other associations together with architects, so that the Housing Development Finance Corporation can come under the correct line of thinking. Today, the Ministry of Housing and Construction has become an ocean of corruption, and it has failed to supply to the genuine demands of the poor, especially the Muslims in the East - the people of Ampara who are in desperate need of housing and also the people in Batticaloa who were affected by the tsunami. Up to date, they are living in shanty tenements or tents as our Government is unable to fulfil their needs.",

    "text": "Today the National Housing Development Authority has completely failed to maintain the amenities in many housing complexes such as Mattegoda, Sri Jayewardenepura, Rukmalgama, Maligawatte, Slave Island, Crow Island and Mattakkuliya. Venerable Sir, I would like to say that these monies must come from the banks. If the banks are not able to gear the system of development in this country, not only the farmers, not only the businessman, but also the poor people of this country will be affected. The Government has milked the poorest of the poor for the affluent to live in luxury. For example, I would like to say that we have borrowed a large amount of money from local banks. So that there is also a situation where we are reminded of Indonesia when Jakarta had to go on a total recession - where everybody went out of the country overnight. Some of the leading businessmen of the country committed suicide when the value of the currency fell overnight and so many neighbouring countries made use of the situation. You have got the macro world where the economic situation of some countries have improved. America has collapsed today. Countries like China has collapsed. Countries like India is surviving because they have become tailors of the nation. We, Sri Lankans are dependant only on the foreign labour force that we are exporting today. We are not doing well in the export of tea. We are not doing well in the export of other non-traditional goods. The oil market has gone up and the increase of electricity rates has brought down the production of this country. We are not able to compete in the international market. You can foresee that in the years to come, very soon there will be a sudden breakdown of the countrys economy. I am sure these so called Pundits who handle the economy of the country, who are heading this particular organization will not succeed in their attempts unless they provide this country with a macro economic system. I thank you very much for giving me this opportunity on behalf of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress. Thank you. [.. 2.16] ( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) , . . . .",

But, as he has been the Minister of Finance and a person who is used as a troubleshooter and sent all over, at least he can put forward his arguments before a Cabinet of 110 Ministers which does not seem to worry about the economy. Hon. Minister, you and I, we all feel for our country. When we speak, we speak not with a double-tongue but with the hope that at least some people will realize that if we lose the economic war, we will lose all wars. I do not want to labour too much on the requirement of this legislation. This should have been done long ago. These Bills were presented before Parliament a couple of months ago and were withdrawn just for political pressure. So, Venerable Sir, I was trying to get the message across the former Minister of Finance that this country is in absolute economic dire straits. If we try to hide behind this fact, we will be getting into worse troubles than ever. But, what is being spoken today? You have inflation of 30 per cent. Who has created this? When the inflation in the region is between 6 to 10 per cent, you have in this country an inflation running from 28 to 30 per cent year on. Then, you have investments that are going out of this country. , . ? 24 - 30 . 30 - 32 . ? ? 25. - bounce - . ? . Hon. Minister, I mean this is not something which is to be avoided.

When you were a Minister, Peter Harold was chased out of the country because of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, Wimal Weerawansa and people of his nature. I am mentioning names because if we do not do so, I guess we will be defaulting on our aim, what we are trying to achieve. Well, they had a political objective then. Today you are borrowing at 11 per cent. The HSBC loan was obtained at 8.25 per cent when the Federal Reserve Rate has gone down to one and a half per cent and even if you add three or three and a half percentage points to that, you could have got it at 5 per cent but we have lost out to 8.75 per cent. Now you are looking at syndicated loans coming from the Standard Chartered Bank at 11 per cent. Hon. Minister, how on earth are we trying to resurrect our economy? Going on further, you look at the Questions that I had asked in Parliament yesterday. One of my Questions was on the Bank of Ceylon and the Peoples Bank, as to what the total liabilities of the Banks are. The Question was not answered. Then, the next Question I asked was about the total amortization, the total capital that is outstanding, the public debt. , - - . , ? . ,",

    "text": ". . . We are made to understand that the public debt is roughly about 85 to 90 per cent. There was a newspaper article stating that this has gone down to 79 per cent. On the other hand, there are outstanding debts to the oil importers, especially to Iran which amounts to roughly Rs. 1,000 billion which has not been taken into the total debt of this country. Likewise, arms are being purchased today owing to the military pursuits of the Government - that is the choice of the Government - and the total debt is roughly Rs. 4,500 billion. Now, if that is the case, Hon. Minister, the debt owing to GDP is roughly 110 per cent. So, whom are we fooling? Amidst this, we have only got to compare and contrast the situation that is prevailing in the country. . ? , . . ? . . . , . . , debenture issue . ? , , 1,100 , , . . . . ; . , . Former Hon. Minister of Finance, you should take this matter up and ask whether it is because of Mihin Air and the Petroleum Corporation, the Capital Adequacy Ratio of Bank of Ceylon is having problems, and if that is the case, who is going to subscribe when you are going for debenture issues quoting a rate of 19 per cent when the inflation of this country is at 28 to 29 per cent? You will get the Government institutions, the captive funds to go into this. But, that will not help you to eradicate the situation that we are going into because if you borrow today for a debenture which is maturing in five years, your cost of borrowing or cost of funds to the bank would be roughly in the range of 18 to 20 per cent. I am averaging because this is 19 per cent and at maturity they are offering 25 per cent. So, on a pro rata basis, your cost of funds has to be at 18 per cent.

The Labour GSP Plus Plus which was negotiated during the UNP Government of 2003 without any conditions to the full benefit of the country is now in jeopardy of losing owing to the lack of an international trade policy of the Government. The Government had ample time to resolve many minor irritants that had come up owing to the lack of good governance and non-implementation of certain international compliances. A Government which has not implemented its promises, unwilling to reduce the burden on the people by reducing the fuel prices, unable to give salary increases to the public servants, not giving any benefit to the local manufacturers to cushion the high cost of production through cost push inflation, attempting to show that there is a linkage by the European Union in forcing the Government of Sri Lanka to accept conditions to receive the benefit of Labour GSP Plus Plus and finally the very Government which is unable to fulfil the above promises saying that they do not have money, is now coming up with fanciful stories of providing Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 21,000 million (250% more than for Samurdhi poverty eradication) per year or Rs. 45,000 to Rs. 60,000 million of public funds in Sri Lanka to sell garments only in Europe for three years, the period for which the Labour GSP Plus Plus benefit could have been enjoyed if granted (based on 2007 export figures). All of this has arisen owing to the unprofessional, unwilling and dogmatic stand adopted by the Government completely disregarding the impact it will create on the export industry and the labour market in Sri Lanka. So, as a responsible Opposition we want to know from this incapable Government as to how such huge funds would be found to pay for this non-Sri Lankan consumption.\" Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, I would just like to know before I start, whether you would reply to this? ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama - Minister of Enterprise Development and Investment Promotion) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Fine. The reason for moving this Motion is that this Government today is confronted with a major international problem on the Labour GSP. Hon. Speaker, during our tenure of office we had various problems that confronted us at the time when we took over the Government. We had the Chandrika Kumaratunga administration, with many Members of Parliament here, which had created the economic problems which resulted in a negative growth rate and they gave us a country that was full of terrorist attacks everywhere and we had to resurrect all that when we took over the control of the economy on 5th December, 2001. Within one year we were able to restore the economy to a growth rate of about 6.8 per cent. With that we had to confront a multitude of problems and we successfully resolved them.",

    "text": "One of the areas we resurrected was the export diversification of our country. Since we got our Independence in 1948, every Government and every so-called politician has been speaking about national interests and national production. But, when it comes to real production of this country it has been on three major areas; one has been on the service sector with migrating labour; the second has been on the agricultural sector with tea, rubber and coconut and the third has been on the textile industry which grew phenomenally during a period of two to three decades. With all this, we saw that export diversification was the problem and we went across to the European Union. It was I, as the Minister of Trade, Commerce and Consumer Affairs and the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris who was the then Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs, who went there under the guidance of our Leader, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, and we were able to tap the European Union Labour GSP Plus Plus because we had maintained a very good track record in the area of labour. So, because of that we impressed upon the European Union and said that, In Sri Lanka's hour of need, without giving us aid, try to give us trade and help us to ensure that we are able to stand on our own feet. And, on that basis they responded positively and laid the foundation for the entitlement of the Labour GSP Plus Plus. Now, the reason why I went into the past is just to show how developed countries have helped the developing countries over a passage of time. Firstly, it was through the GATT which was on the general tariffs and trade that helped. Thereafter, it was through the GSP that came into existence. Then, quotas were brought into existence to help certain vulnerable countries and thereafter the latest was the European Union activity, that is GSPs and the Labour GSP Plus Plus which helped us to make an attempt to get the benefits out of this. During this period, we managed to change the exports from US- bound to European-bound. We were able to move up European-bound exports from 20 to 30 per cent of the total exports. Hon. Speaker, with this in mind I would like to go back into history because I think it will be pertinent in order to bring the Labour GSP to its correct position. On the 31st of March, 2008, we had the first bombshell coming in with Mr. Weerasinghe, the Ambassador in Brussels, being removed. Being vocal and being able to speak the truth, before too long the Ambassador was recalled to Sri Lanka. He was the person who was able to get the Labour GSP for the country without causing any problem. But owing to the battle between the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Export Development and International Trade, we had the Ambassador being recalled. Then, thereafter, the European Union was changing its rules and regulations and in November 2007, a draft was put out stating that the countries that are going to benefit through the European Union must basically",

These people think that the world is inside Sri Lanka and the world has to dance to the tune of Sri Lanka. Then, on the 17th July, 2008, Lord Malloch-Brown, Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom comes to Sri Lanka and says, \"GSP, a gloomy picture, Sri Lanka better watch out\".

Venerable Sir, I would like to quote Regulation 22 published in the Official Journal of the European Union: The reasons for temporary withdrawal should include serious and systematic violations of the principles laid down in certain international conventions concerning core human rights and labour rights or related to the environment or good governance, so as to promote the objectives of those conventions and to ensure that no beneficiary country receives unfair advantage through continuous violation of those conventions.\" Then Regulation 25 states: The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision of 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999, laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission.\" Venerable Sir, why I am going through the Regulations I will explain later. Then, Article 8(3) states, I quote: \"The Commission shall keep under review the status of ratification and effective implementation of conventions listed in Annex III by examining available information from relevant monitoring bodies. The Commission shall inform the Council if this information indicates that there has been a diversion, by a beneficiary country, from the effective implementation of any of the conventions. In time for discussion on the next Regulation, the Commission shall present, to the Council, a summary report on the status of ratification and available recommendations by relevant monitoring bodies.\" Then, Venerable Sir, the most important thing under paragraph 2 of Article 9 is, I quote: The requesting country shall submit its request to the Commission in writing, and shall provide comprehensive information concerning the ratification of the conventions referred to in Annex III, the legislation and measures to implement the provisions of the conventions effectively, and its commitment to accept and comply fully with the monitoring and review mechanism envisaged in the relevant conventions and related instruments.\" Hon. (Dr.) Amunugama, you are a Cabinet Minister. You have been a former Finance Minister. You and your government have applied on this basis before the 31st of October. So, the Government has committed itself to accept a Regulation which states that review and examination of performance is a must. The European Union has been very vocal that under Regulation 22 there are certain conventions, like the ICCPR, they want to rigidly enforce. Then, they also look at the labour standards because the Labour GSP Plus Plus was given owing to the good labour standards that were maintained devoid of child labour in Sri Lanka. Then, they also look at the area of torture and things like that. So, they see whether such Regulations are kept in good order and because of that there were various discussions, various commission members coming to this country, various",

    "text": "ambassadors coming in and the ambassadors in this country trying to put Sri Lanka on red alert saying that there is a necessity to get up from your slumber and not to think that the world is inside Sri Lanka but Sri Lanka is inside the world. So, there are certain conventions that need to be complied with. Remember, Hon. Minister, when we are getting a gift, we cannot tell the guy who is giving the gift, \" You give me this, not that\". So, that is one of the reasons why paragraph 2 of Article 9 states that there is a necessity for review to take place. So, the Government very well knew that there was a problem. They signed sanctions, accepted the conditions that were put forward by the European Union to get the GSP and thereafter, now they are making a different call. The first call that came in was from the Foreign Minister somewhere in mid-September when the European Union Trade Commissioner questioned, Why is it that Sri Lanka does not try to assist the European Union in getting this Labour GSP Plus Plus? It was a very warmly call saying, \"Why do you not serve yourself and ensure that you do a basic attitude check rather than being hostile.\" The immediate response of the Foreign Minister was, \"We will not be allowing any country or any institution to interfere with the sovereign right of this country.\" That is absolutely correct. The United National Party has said so well before and when we got Labour GSP, there was not a single condition that we have got to adhere to except good governance. You are giving a convoluted explanation and trying to pose off as if there was a threat, as if the European Union was trying to put conditions on military operations. The statement that the Foreign Minister made in Parliament yesterday very clearly proved that there was no such internal or external threat or any institution that has put in its hand into the military activities of this country. So, as a result, instead of trying to be confrontational, if the Government only looked at the basic issue that they made the application complying with the conditions laid down, I guess we would have been able to get on to the right track. But, today, what is the situation? Hon. Minister, you are having allegations of trade unions that the apparel association is not permitting trade union rights . So, that is one of the basic essentials on which we got Labour GSP to this country. They say so, I do not know whether it is right or wrong. But, if it is so, then they are trying to add trouble to the existing problems for the Government. Then, look at the famous battle between the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, the Minister of Export Development and International Trade and the Minister of Foreign Affairs. It is manifesting day by day. And the Governor of the Central Bank who has been talking about this says, \"The Labour GSP, if you want give it or otherwise forget it\". Now, that impact is Rs. 21 billion and that is for one year. And, if Rs. 63 billion is being looked like that, then I guess, we must be a rich country so that we can tell them, \"We do not need the world, we will use the garments within the country. So, we do not need to export them also\" Such statements being uttered by people who should be giving leadership to the country and",

    "text": "protecting the economy, will only make a bad case worse. What does the Governor of the Central Bank say on this? I would like to quote from an article published in the Financial Review of the The Island of 21st October, 2008. It states, I quote: \"In the possible event GSP Plus concessions are not renewed, we have told the government that any assistance should be provided during the first year so as to mitigate the shock industry would face. You are getting this advantage for three years and you say, \"We will get it for the first year, the second year and the third year, go to hell\". Is that the attitude of a Government that came into office saying, We will protect domestic industry\". The article goes on to state, I quote: Although not specifying exactly how US$ 150 million is to be expended, Prof. Peiris and Cabraal both ensured that it would be used in such a way so it would be business as usual. Their business as usual and the people and industries having business as usual are different. They are on cloud nine but the people have to walk the talk. Unfortunately, the problem starts here. There is a mirrored picture given saying that everything is tickety-boo. When you look back, you would see that when the United National Party Government was in power, there were 753 garment factories in this country. Really the robust change took place in 1976 after Mr. Choksy and some others started Hentley Garments Limited and other garment factories. During the years 1977 and 1978 you had the Free Trade Zones coming in and you had garment factories thriving day by day; you had the apparel industry further pushed out of Colombo to outstations with the \"200 Garment Factory\" concept. With that, during the UNP regime of 2001 to 2003, you had 753 garment factories. Today, Hon. Minister, you are saying that the garment industry is doing well. But there are only 300 garment factories to my knowledge - I am just informed that it is 353 factories - but I was told previously it is somewhere between 253 to 300. So, you could see the number of factories that have been closed down within three to four years. In the previous speech made by the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane, he said that the unemployment rate has reduced. When nearly 400 factories have been closed down, certainly the rate of unemployment goes down? Are you trying to say, Close down all garment factories and go and work in Saudi Arabia or Doha, Qatar or Oman or in Maldives? If that is your policy, then you need not have an industrial policy; you can have a zero unemployment rate in this country. But at the end of the day you have got to ensure that you develop the local industry. When it comes to agriculture, , - . , , . - -",

With this situation, in 2007 the total export potential in this country in European Union terms was US Dollars 150 million. You are ably assisted by another Friend of ours who is seated on your right side. He is also putting his hands. The gem and jewellery trade also has this problem. You are losing the Labour GSP Plus and it will also have an impact. Of that, US Dollars 100 million is from garments and the balance we are made to understand is non-garment. Thereafter, for 2008 you have a figure projected roughly which is about US Dollars 165 million. Now, remember that the figures that have been given are extrapolated from 2007. You are not looking at 2008. So, you are trying to hide the actual incident. The US market, as you know is crashing. With that you have a higher consumption in the European Union. At a time when export diversification is required and when you have to concentrate more on the European market instead of the US market, you are basically giving the only hope we have, a kidney punch. Look at what is going on. You have to make an application for this - 1st of January, 2009 to 31st of December, 2011 - there is a three-year time span to get the benefit. In the general projection that is mentioned in year 2011 our total exports - if it has been going on the same trend over the last five years - should be US Dollars 190 million. In 2010, it should be US Dollars 210 million. In 2011, it will roughly be around US Dollars 235 to 250 million.",

We cannot afford to pay such an amount of money to the European Union just to protect one, two or three people. That is the irony that we are faced with. Going on further, all what we can say is, our economy is very fragile. The financial melt-down has started. This country has an inflation of 30 per cent. We have a baseless growth in this country. Rs. 600 million is going to be invested in military activities for the year 2009, not for the year 2008. We have not taken into consideration the North and the East when calculating the unemployment rate and we are basically having competition within the friendly countries in our region. So, we need to ensure that we have a strong economy to go forward. Once again, I would like to mention that if we lose the economic war, we will lose all wars. Three months ago, unconditionally we expressed our desire. Our Leader, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, for the first time mentioned in this House, Let us work on a non-political basis. Losing of Labour GSP is going to be too much of a loss for this country. There is no condition that has been laid down by the European Union. That has been confirmed by the Foreign Minister in this House. It has been confirmed by the European Union itself. In that case, why have we got to worry about any investigation that is taking place? Rupees 63,000 million for three years which is roughly Rs. 21 billion a year, is far too much for any Government to cope with. So, the only thing is, you have to be transparent and open. We, the United National Party, once again protect the innocent people who are working in the labour industry. We are more concerned about the workers rather than the owners. The owners can move from Sri Lanka to India without any problem. But those innocent workers cannot move from Hambantota to Colombo in that much of a hurry. So, how can they go overseas? Venerable Presiding Member, because of that, the United National Party even at this late stage, is offering its support to the Government unconditionally to ensure that we comply with what is expected in an international game. There are no conditions if it affects the sovereignty and we need to bow down to it. The United National Party will ensure that we support you fully with no such conditions as well and it is only an open request for good governance. One particular day, let us legislate what is required, comply with regulations that you have signed the application and protect the money for better use in this country. Thank you.",

    "text": "The reason for this recommendation is that in a recent case which came up before the Supreme Court, the Court had ruled that the ICCPR has no legal effect in Sri Lanka since no steps have been taken to give statutory effect to the rights contained therein. As you may know, the ICCPR was ratified by the Sri Lankan Government in 1980 when the UNP Government was in power. Thereafter, in 1997, the First Optional Protocol to the Covenant was also ratified. Subsequently the Supreme Court ruled that no domestic legislation is necessary to give effect to the ICCPR. Although the Government in November 2007 passed a law in regard to the ICCPR this is inadequate and insufficient since it has omitted many provisions of the Convention and the Protocol. If the Government has no objection to such an amendment, the necessary 2/3rds majority in Parliament, which constitutional amendments require, will be obtained. Yours sincerely,",
