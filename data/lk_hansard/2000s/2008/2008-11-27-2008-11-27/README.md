Mr. Chairman, if we focus on Article 25 (1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which was adopted in 1948, it states, I quote: Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing housing and medical care If we look at Article 11.1 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 1966 which has been ratified by more than 133 countries, it states, I quote:

The States Parties to the present Govemant recognize the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family, including adequate food, clothing and housing..

2008 27 1875 1876

If we look at Article 5 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, it states that parties to the agreement have an obligation to guarantee the right of everyone to housing. If we look at Article 14.2 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, it states that parties shall take appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination in relation to housing. If we look at Article 27 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child which was adopted in 1989, it states that the rights of children have to be protected and they have to be provided with material assistance particularly with regard to housing. Lastly, Article 8 of the Declaration on the Right to Development declares that, I quote: States should undertake, at the national level, all necessary measures for the realization of the right to development and shall ensure, inter alia, equality of opportunity for all in their access to basic resources, education,...housing. Now, Mr. Chairman, it is apparent from what I have just stated that housing as a development effort, has a lot of credence and acceptance both in nation States and within the international Community. My late beloved father addressing the 40th Anniversary Sessions of the United Nations General Assembly in October, 1985, spoke about housing in this manner. I quote: When some people speak of housing and shelter, they tend to give a restrictive interpretation greatly under-estimating its real benefits. To them housing and shelter mean only a mere roof above their heads. This is a misconception. Housing not only provides protection from the elements but also shelters all the factors that go to improve the quality of life of individuals, who form the families. Families make up societies and societies build up nations. Nations finally constitute the global community. That is why I consider housing to be not only a basic human need but also a key to human development. In essence, housing is central to the fulfillment of mans aspirations for a better life. Recognizing the importance of housing, the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa worked tirelessly, and at all times through his indefatigable efforts, wanted to ensure that all Sri Lankans received shelter in due time. , , , . . , , , . . ; , , ,

Mr. Chairman, with the Hundred Thousand Houses Programme, the Central government acted as the main provider of housing. It consisted of a construction programme; a rural housing programme; a home builders loan programme and slum and shanty upgrading programme. With the Million Houses Programme, although it was a radical departure from the conventional shelter programme, a new strategy. and enabling strategy was initiated and more components were included to achieve a larger target. This consisted of rural housing sub-programme, urban housing sub-programme, Mahaweli and Major Irrigation settlements sub-programme, plantation housing sub-programme, public sector housing sub-programme, private sector housing sub-problem and private sector housing sub-programme. Then, as the housing development effort progressed during the 1990 to 1994 period, the one million housing programme was expanded to a 1.5 million housing

programme. In addition to the sub-programmes that I just stated, five new programmes were inculcated into the 1.5 million housing programme, the special 5000 urban houses programme, disaster housing sub-programme, co-operative housing sub-programme, employees housing sub-programme and provincial councils housing sub-programme. , , ; . ; . ; . . . , . , 1993 . ? , , . , . 1996 , Habitat II .

Bismtllahir Rahmonir Raheem, Nahmaduhu Vanusalli Aja Rasoolthi Kareem, In the mane if Allah the most beneficent and the most meraful Hon. Chairman. I am very happy that I have been afforded this opportunity to speak a few words on the Votes of these two important Ministries, the Ministry of Urban Development and Sacred Area Development and the Ministry of Housing and Common Amenities. Sir, I represent the constituency of the Colombo District through my party the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress. It was the dream of my late leader, the Hon. M. H. M. Ashraff, that one day the SLMC will have and elected representative to the Capital City. He had a vision and a philosophy; his leadership, his straightforwardness, his charm, his attitude, his knowledge and skills, his foresight were and inspiration to his journey and his supreme sacrifice has paid dividends to his frustrations and his craving to serve our community. The subject of housing and common amenities comes under our late leaders wife, the Hon. (Mrs.) Ferial Ismail Ashraff. Madam, we are very proud of you and your leadership. While congratulating you on your completion of the third year in office and embarking on the fourth year with uncertainties whether there will be a snap election in 2009, I would say that the Ministry of Housing and Common Amenities has not fulfilled the aspirations of the people who brought you to power-the capturing of the LTTE heartland, Mullaitivu, is a dream that we all want to see, come true. The present Government is directly involved in the activities of the housing sector and in the Mahinda Chintana , the President has stated, I quote: I firmly believe that every family in sri Lanka should own a house. In 1980, the then Government embarked on the construction of official quarters for government and local government institutions and high-rise buildings with the Commissioner of National Housing, and housing loans and grants were offered to the people. The NHDA which was established in 1979 implemented large-scale housing programme led by the visionary leader with a generous mind, the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa.. He was a visionary leader for national housing who spearheaded the nation building process and there were many ministries under him to achieve his target. He had practical experience in urban development that paid dividends. According to the National Housing Development Authority records, 1,146,453 houses have been constructed by the year 2007 with grants and loans offered by seven state institutions with physical, human and financial resources for housing development with the

view of achieving the target towards nation building. But, after the death of the visionary leader, President Ranasinghe Premadasa, instead of implementing new strategies to meet competitiveness, it is evident that these institutions which were hives of activity during his presidency are prone to be abandoned. That is why today you see the Ministry of Housing and Commen Amenities in a lethargic state. Today, the National Housing Development Authority has completely failed to maintain the commen amenities in many housing complexes such as Mattegoda, Jayawardanagama, Rukmalgama, Ranpokunugama, Maligawatte, Colombo North, Stlave Island and the Colombo Central Housing Schemes. These are neglected beyond revival due to mismanagement of common amenities, It is purely because no financial allocation has been made for the maintenance of there housing complexes. ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Ferial Ismail Ashraff ) Hon. Member, you complained about the maintenance of common amenities in the housing complexes. The reason is this. We have told the people at the handing over that the least that we expect from them is to maintain the place that they live in. Our Ministry will definitely come in when there are major repairs. But, some of the minor repairs, unless the people get involved, we will not be able to maintain any of them. I am very happy to tell you that in this Budget, we have given a certain amount of money so that we would be able to help the people. But, please tell your constituents that they have to take the responsibility of maintaining the house that they live in. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Shafeek Rajabdeen) Madam, thank you for those words. We will see that the community leaders there will get together to solve this problem. Mr. Chairman, as regards the implementation of housing programmes in rural, urban, estate and fishing areas under the Gama Neguma programme, the implementation of the Samurdhimath Gammana in 20 villages and the model village concept in 19 districts, the Janasaviya programme providing permanent houses for the displaced in Polonnarwa, Anuradhapura and Monaragala Districts, the Jana Sevena national housing programme of His Excellency the President for 30,000 families with houses and deeds under the Mahinda Chintana, the Ministry of Housing and Common Amenities together with the NHDA, the Condominium Management Authority and the Centre for Housing, Planning and Building have merely becoming talking shops. I must say that there is no proper vision for the Condominium Management Authority and the Centre for Housing, Planning and Building. They have to go ahead with the implementation of these programmes.

The housing policy, an accepted principal enunciated in the UN housing charter is a total flop due to the bulk of the funds and finances that are set aside for housing; is burdened with the war on terror efforts in our country. Leave aside that, the issue of stakeholdership of the housing scheme built up with the Saudi funds for tsunami-affected people is before the Supreme Court due to petty ethnic issues raised by the JHU, a partner of the Government. Hon. Minister, with regard to urban development, I wish to invite your attention to the upgrading of shanties. A sudden slum clearance operation was carried out during the SAARC Summit held in Colombo this year. All of a sudden, without proper planning and without giving proper accommodation for the shanty dwellers, demolition of shanties took place in the Slave Island area. They are only given 1 one-year rental or alternative slum houses in another place. With the widening of the road along Elvitiagala Mawatha under the Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie, the then Minister of Highways, two perches of land were given to every road front tenement dweller. You have cleared one slum and created another in the vicinity. What is important is that you have given only two perches of land in Colombo to build houses, But, if you examine the UDA regulations, you would see that the UDA or the Municipality does not permit you to build a house unless you have six or eight perches of land. All Slums, as you know, have to be cleared one day and the creation of another slum in the vicinity is a practical problem. Once you give two perches of land, the Colombo Municipality will grant them temporary assessment numbers through which water and electricity connection could be obtained and within another ten years, the Government will call them unauthorized shanties. Hon. Chairman, I wish to speak on behalf of the poorest of the poor in Colombo in the wards of Mattakkuliya, Modera, Maligawatta, Kettarama, De Mel Watta and Grandpass. I wonder whether the Government knows that there are tenements and dwellings called Somalia and Tamil Nadu in the City of Colombo. The shanties in the Henamulla Camp, Slave Island, Aluthkade, Maradana, Dematagoda and Borella, all along the banks of the oya and the canals, are classic examples. Within the wards of the Colombo Municipality, there are well over 140,000 shanty dwellers and almost all the garden tenements were given assessment numbers and they pay taxes, water and electricity bills. All these shanty dwellers have been promised deeds by the NHDA, the SLRDC, the Sri Lanka Railway Department and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. Now, how do we clear the menace of shanties in the City of Mahinda the Great? Do not force them to go out like you did during the SAARC summit. In my view, the NHDA, the common Amenities Board, the Urban Development Authority, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, the SLRDC and the Ministry

of Housing and Common Amenities must come under one Cabinet Minister instead of five Cabinet ministers each of whom has his own vision colliding with another. As they are amidst a collision course, the housing concept of this Government is in the doldrums. The suburbs of Colombo needs to be developed and urbanized. May the Almighty Allah bless them all to have high-rise buildings with two-bedroomed apartments for each family like the one that you have in the Sahaspura Housing Scheme in areas such as Angoda, Meetotamulla, Kotikawatta, Talangama, Malabe, Modera, Kaduwela and Kotte adhering to the housing development concept in Singapore. Finally, I wish to say that the greatness of Democracy is that we are all birds of passage of time. We are here today, gone tomorrow! But, in the brief of time, it is our duty to be honest and sincere in discharging our responsibilities. This is what is expected by the people who cast their valuable votes electing us to this august Assembly. We must be a pride to our nation. Thank you. Assalamu Alaikkum. [ . . 12.33] ( )

Venerable Presiding Member, today, we are discussing the Votes of three important Ministries. Why do I say so? It is because these three ministries have a vital bearing on the lives of humans. The Ministry of Urban Development and Sacred Area Development, Ministry of Housing and Common Amenities and the Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage are all very important aspects of human life. Without these aspects, the life of humans on this earth would be a hell. Therefore, Venerable Presiding Member, it is the paramount and most sacred duty of the Government to have a comprehensive and corporate plan to develop these vital areas of human needs. If we take the estimates if the Ministry of Urban Development, which has been linked to the scared area development, we see that the key functions of the Ministry are establishing rural water supply system and sanitation, development of mega towns and promotion of sustainable cities. According to the basic information available, urban population consists of 30 per cent of the population whereas the population in unurbanized areas is 3 per cent of the population. The cities that have great development potential are Hambantota, Dambulla, Trincomalee, Galle and Kotte. The number of slum houses in Colombo is around 65,000. The big, question mark is whether the Government has tapped these resources for the benefit of the people. How many mega township have you established from year 2006 to-date? Have your ever matched the record construction activities completed by the late President Premadasa during his period of Presidency and the UNP regime from 1977 to 1994? You cannot break the records achieved by the UNP. You have never built any mega township of the magnitude of Raddolugama, Ranpokunugama, Mattegoda and Wickramasinghepura. You have miserably failed in matching the rural housing programme spearheaded by the UNP Government from 1977 to 1994. How many houses hasve you built in Colombo to house the slum dwellers. You cannot boast of anything in this regard. Now, If you examine the activities of the Ministry of Housing and Common Amenities, we find that the key functions of these ministries are housing sector policy development, co-ordination of national housing programme, facilitation of housing needs and introduction of low cost housing construction technology. Here, I observe that the Ministry of Housing and

Common Amenities has nothing else to do than to sit in arm chairs and speculate. According to the basic information available in Sri Lanka, there are 1,300,000 sub-standard houses whereas there are 200,000 estate houses. According to your own statistics, there is a housing backlog of 1,500,000. What have you done to eradicate this problem and at least reach half way through during your Governments tenure of office from 1994 to date? you have done nothing. In comparison to the colossal achievement of the UNP regime, your achievements are just miniscule. Venerable Presiding Member, now I would like to deal with the Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage. As I stated above, the key functions of these Ministris ate also policy formulation and implementation of sanitation programmes and to provide pipe-borne water and sewerage to people at an affordable price. According to the basic information provided, only Colombo, Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte, Matale, Galle and Anuradhapura are provided with 20-24 hours water supply. Does the Government think that these cities are the only cities of Sri Lanka? What about the other cities? What have you been doing from 1994 to date? You have been only talking but no work has been done. In the book, you have beautiful projects drawn up but there are no funds even to start a major project. How many houses in the rural sector have you provided with proper sanitation facilities? You will have to fund an answer to that. The Major defeat as I see in these Ministries is the tragic lack of co-ordination among the three Ministries. Why has this happened? All the activities of the three Ministries should be centralized as one Ministry. This would lead to proper management, co-ordination, follow-up and implementation. As it is, the activities of all these three Ministries have failed miserable became purely with the intention of providing portfolios, you have cut and chopped an important Ministry into three. This had led to confusion, mismanagement, lack of follow-up activities and bungling in implementation. How can you expect results when the activities and functions of these Ministries are overlapping each other? It is nothing but confusion.- [Interruption.] Wait and see for two months.- [Interruption.] Wait, wait I will take up your Ministry. Do not worry, Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena.- [Interruption.] In conclusion, I would like to give a piece of advice to the Government. Please do not start tinkering with important Ministries for your political survival. Take a leaf out from the late President Ranasinghe Premadasas book. During his period as prime Minister, he had all these three Ministries centralized as one Ministry coming under one umbrella. This was why he was able to achieve incredible success. , . , , , , ,
