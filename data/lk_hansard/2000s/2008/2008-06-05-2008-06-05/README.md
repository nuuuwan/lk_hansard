: : ASSISTANCE AND PROTECTION TO VICTIMS OF CRIME AND WITNESSES BILL : DETERMINATION OF THE SUPREME COURT ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . 122 (I)() . , , , 123(1) . .

S.C.S.D. 01/08 RIGHTS AND ENTITLEMENTS OF VICTIMS OF CRIME AND WITNESSES In the matter of a Reference under Article 122 (1) (b). S. C. Special Determination No. 1/2008 Present : Ms. S. Tilakawardane, J; S. Marsoof. PC, J; & A. Somawansa, J. Counsel : Yasantha Kodagoda, Deputy Solicitor Gerneral, for Attorney General. Upali A. Gunerathne, with Mahesha de Silva for the Intervenient Petitioner. Nuwan Peiris for the Legal Aid Commission. Court assembled for the Hearing : At 10.00 a.m. on 02nd April, 2008. SHIRANEE TILAKAWARDANE, J. The Act is titled Protectiion to Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act, No. Of 2007. The preamble sets out the objectives as; AN ACT TO PROVIDE FOR THE SETTING OUT OF RIGHTS AND ENTITLEMENTS OF VICTIMS OF CRIME AND WITNESSES AND THE RPOTECTION AND PROMOTION OF SUCH RIGHTS AND ENTITLEMENTS; TO GIVE EFFECT TO APPROPRIATE INTERNATIONAL NORMS AND BEST PRACTICES RELATING TO THE PROTECTION OF VICTIMS OF CRIME AND WITNESSES; THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NATIONAL AUTHORITY FOR THE PROTECTION OF VICTIMS OF CRIME AND WITNESSES AND THE VICTIMS OF CRIME AND WITNESSES PROTECTION DIVISION OF THE SRI LANKA POLICE DEPARTMENT; ESTABLISHMENT OF THE VICTIMS OF CRIME AND WITNESSES ASSISTANCE AND PROTECTION FUND AND FOR MATTERS CONNECTED THEREWITH OR INCIDENTAL THERETO. By letter dated 29th of April 2008, sent by The President to the Chief Justice, information was given that the Cabinet of Ministers had decided that, in its view the Bill titled. S.C.S.D. 01/08 Assistance and Protection to Victims of Crime and Witnesses Bill is urgent in the national interest in terms of Article 122(1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the special determination of the SC under Article 122(1) (b) was made as to whether the Bill or any provisions thereof was inconsistent with the Constitution. This Bill is to be presented in Parliament and is to be published in the Government Gazette as required by Law and thereafter be placed on the order paper of Parliament. Two petitions have been filed by the Centre for the Protection of Victims of Crime and the Legal Aid Commission of Sri Lanka seeking to be heard in terms of Rule 63(3) of the Supreme Court Rules and learned Counsel representing these institutions and learned Deputy Solicitor General made submissions. A justice system depends upon the evidence being collected and brought before the court. If fear prevails, or in some way victims of crime or witnesses are precluded from giving evidence or such evidence cannot otherwise be collected, such evidence cannot be considered, as the Judge is able to consider only what is brought before the Court and the unfortunate consequences are either that the case is not taken up or the charges against the accused are dismissed. In this manner, sometimes even in offences pertaining to Human

7 8

Rights, those who perpetrate torture, are exonerated and thereby the problems of a democratic society are eroded and there is a concomitant increase in crime. The importance of this Act deals with the necessity to protect and provide assistance to victims and witnesses and is based on the foundational principle of accessibility and transparency. It is to be noted that there is a division of responsibilities but such division needs to also include the expert witnesses in dealing with protection issues. Furthermore the responsibilities where multi-bodies are made accountable is that for the same function with efficacy provision should be made for the cooperation of the different bodies. Whilst the clear division of responsibility is important for efficient functioning of bureaucracy the lines of responsibility must be patently transparent and understandable to the victims and witnesses referred to in the Act. Special mention must be mentioned of the fact that Section 14 refers to the recommendation of the Authority and does not suggest that the Authority does not make final decisions. This is compounded by the fact that Section 14(4) states that the protection division will admit victims and witnesses to the programme after the conduct of a threat assessment which further strengthens the notion that a recommendation by the Authority is not final but reliant of the determination of the Protection Division. It is further unclear whether the risk assessment is the same as the inquiries made by the Police if the request is made at a Police station. Additionally Section 14(4) refers to communications under Section 15, so it is not clear whether communication from courts, commissions and law enforcement officers are to be forwarded to the Authority or the Protection Division or a final decision on their own. The process through which a decision to grant protection is made must be clarified to ensure that one body does not grant protection only to have it removed by another and to ensure that victims and witnesses have confidence in the process. And a streamlining of the process is also critical to minimize private and sensitive information of victims and witnesses being passed to number of hands as such would optimize the opportunity for leaks. It is suggested by court that the determination to grant protection is made by an application to court and these could be considered by the Attorney General. It is also important for there to be independence of the Protection Division. It is also suggested by the Court that the Protection Division should be a separate division that is independent of the functions of investigations and prosecution. Clarification is also not specific as to what factors would be considered in threat assessment or what would be considered as reasonable grounds in order to curtail the discretion of decision makers to be swayed by extraneous circumstances. The specific protections have also not been set out. It is also recommended that the Act should define which body is responsible for the formulation of the protection programme, responsible for the implementation of the programme and where the division of responsibilities lie. The Act lacks specificity as to on what criteria will protection be granted, and what protection mechanisms are available, how long protection will continue and whether appeals from such decisions would lie. This Court analyzed the Bill in its entirety and dealt with several specific provisions in terms of the Reference set out above. This Determination is in relation to a Bill that was urgent in the national interest of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and in terms of 122 (1)(b) as to whether the Bill inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution. In these circumstances, having considered the provisions of the Bill, the following amendments inclusions, modifications and alterations thereto were agreed upon with the co-operation and consensus of all parties including the Attorney-General and the Legal Draftsman: The definition of the Term victims of crime is amended to read as: Victims of crime inclusive but not limited to a person who has suffered any injury, harm, impairment or disability whether physical or mental, emotional, economic or other loss, as a result of an act or omission which constitutes an offence under any law or an infringement of a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constiution or the violation of a human right referred to in the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act, No. 56 of 2007, and includes a person who suffers harm as a result of intervening to assist such a person or to prevent the

However, there is no provision which provides for the adverse consequences which should follow a lack of cooperation with the Authority.

[.. 2.04] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. R.M. Imam) Hon. Presiding Member, with your permission, I wish to express my views on the present situation in the country. I always listen to the customary speech of the Hon. Prime Minister during the extension of the Emergency. His speech indicates that there is no room for peace. Once in this House, an ex-Finance Minister, the Hon. Ronnie de Mel, said that peace on knees is better than war on feet. The present situation affects everyone irrespective of the difference of race or religion. I inform this House that the Muslims from the North, particularly from Jaffna, where I hail from, are the most affected. The Tamils do not have political rights and the Sinhalese do not have economic resources, but my community from the North does not have both. Since I am from this community, I urge the Government to go for negotiations with the Tamil Tigers. The LTTE always expresses its willingness for negotiation.

99 100

I had the privilege of listening to an interview of the present Army Commander on the electronic and print media. In his recent interview on the ITN channel, he said that the LTTE is being supported by the Tamils in Tamil Nadu, the expatriate Tamils all over the world and the Tamils in the Island. Again, in the same interview that appeared in the Lankadeepa, to the question as to how the LTTE was able to achieve victories, he said that in the battle filed its leaders are in the front and, as per his words, their labala cadres or novices or privates are behind. As per a verse in "Thirukkural", before commencing a war, the power of oneself, the power of the enemy and the power of the persons who are behind him and the enemy must be assessed. Though the Government says that it could wipe out the LTTE before December 2008, the battle scenario repudiates that thinking. It is an unwinnable war. It is a battle between two brothers over the sharing of property of their mother. Since the elder brother is trying to grab the whole thing, Sri Lanka has been pushed into the present deplorable situation. As per the said verse, the LTTE enjoys sufficient moral and physical support from the above sources. I urge the Government to think of this. With these forces behind, the LTTE can continue to resist. As per another verse in Thirukkural, the leaders must lead the war for victories. The Army Commander had acknowledged that on his side, novices or privates are in the front line. According to that interview, the Commander has an inherent grudge against his commanders. As per the verse I mentioned last, unless leaders command their forces in the front, whatever number of weapons and soldiers would not bring victories. In the said Lankadeepa interview, the Army Commander had further accepted the LTTE as a most formidable force. Also, I thank the Military Spokesman, Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara, for addressing the LTTE cadres as "LTTE members", but spokesmen from the other forces address them as "terrorists". Those officers are not gentlemen.

Why is the LTTE fighting? Why is it being supported by the Tamils and the Tamil-speaking persons? Barring Jayalalitha, it enjoys the support of the Tamils of Tamil Nadu. Barring the Hon. Douglas Devananda, it has gained the full support of the Tamils in Sri Lanka.

It must be acknowledged that the Tamils have grievances. Though Tamil was made an official language in 1988, even today it does not have official status in any government department. I wish to quote a simple incident. I, as a practising lawyer who does conveyancing also, very often go to the Land Registries in Colombo and Mount Lavinia where all the name boards are only in the Sinhala language, a language I do not know. This is the prevailing situation in almost all government departments. Though the Tamils are learning Sinhala, the enthusiasm to learn Tamil is not seen in the Sinhalese brothers. In the third year anniversary supplement of "Rivira", a columnist had acknowledged this fact.

The present military exercise will end up in futality and there will be a mass loss of human lives. It will create a big wedge between the two communities. The persons who wish to eliminate terrorism through war do not have an ounce of knowledge of the realities of the ground situation. It is being pursued for monetary considerations. My view is held by several generals who led this war in the bygone era. It is a matter for happiness that a general who said this cannot be won militarily was a recipient of presidential honours recently. I admire his sagacity and openness. Due to the present conflict, the Muslims from the North are undergoing severe hardships. Of them, the Muslims from Jaffna are the most affected. As a Representative of theirs, I wish to appeal to the Government to negotiate with the LTTE. Due to the war, the coffers of warlords are overflowing with foreign capital whereas we, the Sri Lankans, are becoming poorer and poorer day by day on account of this war. Due to the intransigent attitude of the warlords, youths who have not passed their prime age lose their lives in the battlefield. The lifespan of a person is three scores and ten. Unfortunately, the life of the combatants on both sides does not span for even one score. The persons who think that war is the only solution to defeat terrorism are not thinking of the factors which are in the way to win this war. The Government says that it is waging war on the LTTE. Unfortunately, the Government has not addressed itself as to why the LTTE is fighting against it. Since the Tamil community has grievances, the LTTE is backed by it not only within Sri Lanka, but all over the world. It is headed by Prabhakaran who has surpassed the war skills of Moshe Dayan, the Israeli General. Prabhakaran is not Pillayan to prostrate himself before every Tom, Dick and Harry or to curry flavour with those in power to the detriment of the Tamil community. Pillayan, who sent a lorry laden with explosives to the Dalada Maligawa, was given a rousing welcome by the prelates. Unfortunately, the persons who got involved in this crime unwittingly have received jail terms of over 190 years. Today, the Government is - ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. R.M. Imam)

Give me just two more minutes. I am taking time from my party. The Government should negotiate with the LTTE to find a permanent solution to this problem. The Government should not believe bankrupt politicians or opportunists. Since the LTTE is ready for peace, the Government should welcome it. I wish to say that the present alliance between the cutthroat Tamil groups and the Government will not go on for a long time. Unless this problem is settled with the LTTE, no power in the world could restore peace in our country. Thank you.

[.. 2.43] . . . ( ... ) (The Hon. A.M.M. Naoshaad)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, this is the third Debate on the extension of the state of Emergency that I am taking part in. We have been debating the extension of the state of Emergency, if I am not mistaken, for over 30 years but the regularity of the debate has not helped to address the root cause of the need for this state of Emergency. We all know that the Tamil people or the Tamil-speaking people were driven to taking up arms because their just grievances were not addressed by subsequent governments. So, if majoritarian rule is the cause for terrorism, should we not be debating with equal vigour the solution to this problem? You could call it "federal" or any other name, but we should, as we debate the extension of the state of Emergency, also be debating the solution to addressing the grievances of the minority, because this war for this Government, is like a beggars wound. They do not want to allow it to heal, because it has become their bread and butter; their only means of survival. I remember when I was a director of an American company which was situated on Galle Road, Bambalapitiya, I used to stay till late and watch the traffic, and the traffic lights I realized went on and off every 15 seconds. So, I made a quick calculation. If I were to shed my honour and take to begging, if I collected two rupees every 15 seconds, I would have easily earned eight rupees a minute, Rs. 480 an hour and if I worked eight hours, I would have earned close to Rs. 3,500 to 4,000 a day. That figure into 20 was Rs. 80,000 of tax- free money. All I had to do was to shed my honour and become a beggar. So, this Government has chosen to keep this war as a beggars wound and continue to suppress the just rights of the minorities by referring to the war without ending terrorism and addressing the cause for it. Now, what is happening in the East today? I quote the website "www.lankadissent.com" where a call by the JHU to curb Muslim extremism is published:

Key government affiliate Jathika Hela Urumaya has called for immediate measures to curb Muslim extremism and to guarantee the safety of the pro-democratic Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim majority in the east. Secretary of the JHU, Ven. Omalpe Sobhitha Thera said in a statement today (May 29th) that the perpetrators of these extremist tactics should be given strong punishment.

When the Hon. (Ven.) Ellawala Medhananda Thero who spoke before me referred to the Leader of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress as resorting to communalism, I would like to remind the Venerable Thero to first point the finger at themselves and see whether what they talk in this House and outside is communalism or something else. Why we have to talk of communalism and why we have to talk of the problems faced is because we are a minority in this country and we demand that the just rights of minorities should be accepted by the majority.

If the majority refuses to accept the just rights of the minority, the minorities will have no other choice but to get our people together. Is getting our people together resorting to communalism? When did the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress emerge? It was not from the day we won Independence. When did the LTTE or the Tamil people take up to arms? That was not when we gained Independence, but only when governments repeated rules of the majority and continued to deprive the minorities of their just rights. So, now does this Government want the Muslim Community in this country to follow the Tamil brothers? Now, when we talk of this, they say, The Muslim Congress is talking of communalism. But, why are you driving us to that?

What is happening in Kattankudi today? The East is liberated and Mr. Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan has been installed as the Chief Minister of the Eastern Province, but there is turmoil in Batticaloa. Who is Kumar Sasitharan alias Shanthan, who was killed in Kattankudi? Who is he? He was a leader of the TMVP, who had problems with the Muslims of Kattankudi. So, why was he killed in Kattankudi and who killed him? Who benefits by killing him in Kattankudi and what is the end result today? Today, there are killings on both sides. This is why we opposed Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan being appointed as the Chief Minister of the Eastern Province. It is not because he is Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan, a Tamil, but because he is Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pillayan. This Pillayan is not representing the Tamil people of the East. Pillayan is today in the clutches of the Government. He is a leader of an armed group operating in the East. That group still persists. You have installed Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pillayan as the Chief Minister and you are expecting to drive a permanent wedge between the Tamil and the Muslim people of the East. Do not do this because what you will reap as a reward for this action will be devastating to this country.

Everybody talks of Jihadi groups. What is Jihad ? Jihad is not war. Jihad can be termed as an internal struggle, as an effort and why do we have to perform Jihad ? I perform Jihad within me to correct myself to be a better Muslim. But if the existence of the Muslim community or a Muslim is threatened, yes, the religion advocates that we get together and fight. Fight necessarily does not mean taking up arms. We have been fighting democratically. Since the emergence of the SLMC, the Muslims have been fighting for their democratic rights. But

111 112

we are pitted against a fellow community. We, the Tamil-speaking brothers have lived together as we say, like in pittu, flour and coconut. Now you want to separate them by legitimizing an armed group and installing them in power and driving a wedge between these two communities.

Allah has said in Surat Al-Baqarah, I quote:

"Fight in the cause of Allah Those who fight you But do not transgress limits; For Allah loveth not transgressors".

So, we will not be originating a fight. Islam forbids that. But if we are pushed to defend ourselves, then we have all the right to fight to protect ourselves because Allah goes on again saying in Verse 90 in Sura An-Nisaa, I quote:

.....Therefore if they withdraw From you but fight you not, And (instead) send you (Guarantees of) peace, then Allah Hath opened no way For you (to war against them). Like that, there is a way for us to fight for our rights. There is also restriction given in our religion to restrain ourselves. So, I call upon this Government which says that it is sowing the seeds of democracy in the East after liberating the East, but instead sowing the seeds of dissension between two communities, to kindly refrain from doing this. I am sad that the Venerable Monks who represent the JHU in this House keep digging the past and wanting to prove that this country is only for the Sinhalese. They talk of " ". Why do you not include us in that "" ? Why are you only talking of the Sinhalese and saying " " ? " " should include the Tamils, the Muslims, the Burgers and the Sinhalese. Only then, we will be one land because as long as you talk of " " we have an equal right to talk of " " . But, we, the Muslims of this country, have Sinhala blood; we have Tamil blood in us. We do not deny that and we are striving to unite the two communities whose blood we carry. But what is being done to us? We are being treacherously used to divide the two communities that we are striving to unite.

We have records established at the last Provincial Council Elections. I think it should enter into the Guiness Book of Records because in a polling station in the Pottuvil Electorate, the polling was high as 98.1 per cent of which 95 per cent was cast for the "Beetle Leaf" for three identical preferential numbers. That is a record which should be entered into the Guiness Book of Records. Likewise, in the Samanthurai Electorate and in the Akkaraipattu Electorate, there is an average of around 93 per cent votes polled; 93 per cent stuffed, I would say. From that too, 95 per cent of it went to the "Beetle Leaf" and we are talking of a democratically-elected Provincial Council. For goodness sake, stay away from the two communities. Do not try to divide the Tamils and the Muslims of this country. I repeat that because it is not going to help solve this problem. It is only going to drive away the Muslim youth towards finding their own way of fighting to win their just rights. Thank you.

( ) ( () - , ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana - Minister of Science and Technology) Madam Chairperson, first I would like to say a few words in Sinhala and thereafter in English. . , ; ; ; . . . . .

With regard to the recent election in the Eastern Province, there have been a lot of comments made as to whether it had been properly conducted or not. I think everyone would appreciate, if one looks at the history of elections in our country, that there have always been irregularities. The degree of irregularities have varied from time to time. The General Election of 1977 was, perhaps, the one with the least number of irregularities and thereafter, the subsequent elections had an increasing number of irregularities. There have been hora votes as well as stuffing of ballot boxes. This practice has been going on more at certain elections and in certain parts of the country than in others, but it has been a feature of elections.

[ ]

2008 05 141 142

His Excellency the President, at the request of the APRC, agreed to have a provincial council election in the Eastern Province. The holding of the provincial council elections is to enable the people to elect their representatives so that they can get the benefits of the various services they need. This is a progressive, democratic action. After 20 years, during which time this Province has been suffering, torn and been at the mercy of those who held arms, that election has been a welcome feature and it is through this election process that the voice of the people could be heard. The PAFFREL organization had observers in every polling booth. They also had international observers and they have reported, if memory serves me correct, that of the 584 polling booths, irregularities occurred in 22 and in 12 of them, there was evidence of stuffing of ballot boxes. This may have quantitatively affected the outcome of the election, but I do not think it would have qualitatively made a big difference. With the fact that here we are having a democratic process in motion and the peoples representatives acting in the interest of the people, the positive side far outweighs any negative side. It is a matter for concern that when there is an administration which has Tamil, Muslim and Sinhala representations and all three sections are working together in the interests of the people, unfortunately there are forces in operation which are trying to whip up feelings among the different communities, undermining the very democratic process that has been set in motion. As I have always said, in the Sri Lankan situation there is a third force in operation: those who want to benefit by the conflict; those who want to foster the conflict. This process is going on, unfortunately, once again in the Eastern Province to undermine the democratic developments. We deplore this and hope that good sense would prevail. We are happy that the Chief Minister and the Muslim Ministers are working together to maintain harmony among the different communities and give the benefits of this whole process to the people. While this process is going on, I think every effort should be made to properly and fully implement the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. There are unnecessary fears being generated about devolution of power, particularly with regard to the devolution of police powers and land powers to the provinces. I think these fears are misplaced. The Police Commission, if it is set up in the province, will have only one of the three representatives nominated by the Chief Minister; the other two will be by the President directly or indirectly. Therefore, there is no need to have these unnecessary fears. In the same way, with regard to the utilization of land; land remains vested with the Government and the use of certain areas of land in relation to certain devolved functions will be given to the provinces. Therefore, I hope that there will be proper devolution so that the people in those areas, not only in the East but in every province throughout the country, can get the full benefit of the devolution process that should have been implemented through the Thirteenth Amendment.

I would like to mention here that this is a good first step in restoring the confidence of the Tamil-speaking people; that their problems can be solved within the framework of a single country; that there is an intention on the part of the Government to ensure that the sufferings of the people in the Eastern Province in particular can be mitigated. I think this process will help to restore confidence among the Tamil-speaking people in what the Government is doing, provided proper devolution is given. I would also like to mention that the All Party Representative Committee, the APRC, is continuing to meet. We have had 76 meetings. The discussions have been continuing fruitfully. A request was made by two political party representatives from the JHU and the MEP that the TMVP should be represented in the APRC. It is unfortunate that for the last two and a half months they did not partake in the discussions over this issue. I said at that time that this is a decision for the President whether the TMVP is going to be admitted to the All Party Conference or not but once they are admitted to the All Party Conference, automatically they have the right to send a representative to the APRC. I am happy to say that that decision has been taken by the President and the TMVP representative, I hope before long, will be participating in our deliberations. There are 14 parties. Then, it will become 15 and I hope that the JHU and the MEP will also, once again, partake in our discussions so that we can again get their point of view on several matters which we have been discussing during their absence and finalize them. It is in this way I hope that we will be able to proceed towards a meaningful set of proposals. That will be the framework for solving this problem. I ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you will have to wind up. ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana) Can I just have one minute more, please? ( ) (The Presiding Member) Okay. ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharana) Every side has fears. But, I think we have to stop having unnecessary fears. We have to find a way forward and a good example was what we witnessed in Britain when the APRC visited there. There, in a unitary State, without the protection of a written Constitution, we have seen a situation where in Northern Ireland, the Sinn Fein and the parties that were involved in armed action have

143 144

given up their arms and come into the democratic stream. Not only have they come into the democratic stream but they are working together with their opponents, their bitter opponents, the Unionist Party which was headed by Reverend Paisley, in running a joint Government in the Northern Ireland Province. There is something very similar happening now in the Eastern Province and this must be welcomed. Even there in Northern Ireland, acts of violence are still continuing despite the fact that there is this type of agreement and a movement towards democratic governance. So I think we have to learn from these experiences. We must not expect magic solutions at once. We must see that the sufferings of our people are speedily brought to an end and I hope that the APRC process can make its contribution towards this goal. Thank you, Madam Chairperson. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Shivajilingam, you have eight minutes. [.. 4.52] . . ( .. ) (The Hon. M.K. Shivajilingam) , , , , , . . . 52 5 . , , 52 . , . !
