( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, it was highlighted in todays media that US Dollars 100 million has been paid in order to get this oil exploration licence. That means, you have sold the right of 700,000 barrels of crude oil to one particular company. Is it right or not? Also 90 per cent of that goes to the company that does the oil exploration and only 1 per cent comes to the country. Hon. Minister, is it ont an absolute sell - out? [Interruption] . . .

( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) We have not collecter US Dollars 100 million and given this to a particular company for oil exploration. We called for tenders and the best offer was given by Cairn (Pvt.) Limited of India and they provised to give US Dollars one million as a signature bonus. So, they have given us a signature bonus only. When they go to production we will get a 10 per cent royalty. As soon as they start they will give us another US Dollars 50 million. There is a profit sharing system that will be told to Parliament very soon. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

At the Consultative Committee it was told that you will be giving this block to two companies for exploration and the rest of it will be sold to six companies, considering the eight blocks that are there. Instead of doing that, you have given it to one company and also you have not gone through the rest of the process. So, this is a sell - out where oil seepage has take on place. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

We called for tenders for three blocks. Out of the three blocks there was a strong competition among three companions for one block. For the other block we had two companies competing and for the third block was only one. So, we thought, the best thing is to first finish the block where there was a strong competition. So, we have decided on that and thereafter we will decide on the other two blocks - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

There is a serious vulnerability - [Interruption.] . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

. . They went before the Supreme Court and the Court discharged the whole thing.

* : : Document tabled : . . . . . . . . PRESIDENTS AWARD Tamils Rehabilitation Organisation (TRO) received an award on 22 August 2005 from Her Excellency President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga in recognition of its contribution to the Transitional Accommodation Project (TAP). The President invited representatives of the UN Agencies, and International and Local NGOs to Tea at the Presidents House where a ceremony was held to mark the building of 50,000 temporary shelters for tsunami affected families. The President thanked all of the organizations present for their outstanding work in reaching this goal so despite the enormity of the natural disaster that Sri Lanka experienced on 26/12/04. TRO was recognized for building 3,240 temporary shelters. The TAP project was coordinated by the Task Force for Relief (TAFOR). TRO was one nine of NGOs and INGOs recognized for building over 1,000 Temporary Shelters. The others were: UNHCR, Ehed/Caritas, ZOA, IOM, Sevalanka, Medair, OXFAM, and World Vision.

TRO has built transitional shelters that meet, or exceed, TAFORs minimum standards in the districts of Mullaitivu, Jaffna, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, and Amparai. The transitional shelters were constructed with cement floors, walls brick and tin or masonite, and roofs of cadjan or cooling sheets. The building of the temporary shelters was coordinated through TROs District Offices using local engineers for technical advice and management. Where available, local skilled and unskilled labour was employed in the districts to complete the construction and provide a source of income to the tsunami affected populations. All temporary shelters were built with access to potable water and toilets.

Access by the communities to schooling and health services is ensured by a team of camp managers and community based organizations. While more than 8,500 transitional shelters have been constructed there is still significant work to be undertaken to improve upon these shelters, provide permanent housing, improve village infrastructure and create a sustainable economy in the tsunami and war affected areas. TRO is seeking additional funding to ensure that this work continues in these areas. Speeches at the ceremony were also given by Mr. Tilak Ranaviraja (Chairman TAFOR), Mr. Miguel Bermeo (UN Resident Representative, UNDP), Ms. Jo Da Silva (UNHCR), Ms. Mary Sheehan (IOM), Ms. Suriya Kumari (OFERR Ceylon), and Mr. Tapan Kumar Barman (Sevalanka).

[ .. 3.04 ] . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. M. M. Naoshaad) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, let me first wish the new Deputy Speaker, the Hon. Piyankara Jayaratne, all the best in his new position. Everytime we get up to debate the extension of the state of Emergency, what concerns us most is the use of those Regulations and the effect they have on human security. The term human security can be traced back to the establishment of the United Nations in 1945 and it drew on the views of the then US Secretary of State, Edward R. Stettinius, Jr. who said, The battle for peace has to be fought on two fronts. The first is the security front where victory spells freedom from fear. The second is the economic and social front where victory means freedom from want. Only victory on both fronts can assure the world of enduring peace. No provisions that can be written into the Charter will enable the Security Council to make the world secure from war if men and women have no security in their homes and their jobs. This was said way back in 1945. As far as we are concerned, it is still relevant even today.

Today, we are fighting for freedom from fear. The extension of the state of Emergency is sought today to give freedom to our people from fear. But are we free from fear? For nearly 30 years we have been waging a war and the result is that we all live in fear. Whether we live in cleared areas or uncleared areas, the freedom from fear is not prevalent in this country.

We have episodes of white van abductions, disappearances and searches being carried out in almost every part of this country. I was told that last week there was a search in Saranankara Road, Dehiwala by some young officers of the forces. They searched the properties, confiscated the mobile phones of the occupants for a moment, walked out, came back and surrendered the mobile phones. Some of the owners, when they checked, had found that from all those mobile phones the officers had originated a call to a particular number. I do not want

to disclose that number because it may have an impact on security. But, a private phone is a property of that individual and that individual is responsible for every call that originates from that phone or received into that. But they have misused these phones and given them back even without an explanation. This creates fear in the minds of the people. They do not know what is happening. So, if we continue to live in fear, what is the point in waging this war? When do we get freed from this fear? How long can we go on like this?

We talk so much about clearing the East. The Hon. Ven. Ellawala Medhananda Thero who spoke before me said that we seem to forget the historic deeds of our heroic soldiers. We have not forgotten that, but what is more important is, what has that freedom brought us? We have freed the East. For whom? And what is happening there? We need to look at all what we are doing under the guise of conducting a war to realistically see whether there is anything that we have achieved by this war.

Way back in 2007, it was announced that the LTTE's strength was around 5,000 cadres. In 2008, it was announced that we have eliminated over 9,000 LTTE cadres and the LTTE still has around 4,500 cadres. So, that means, if we add the 9,000 and the 4,500, the LTTE had around 13,500 cadres in 2008 compared to the 5,000 they had in 2007. We all know that the birth- rate among the Tamil community, especially in the North, is the lowest in this country. We know that the Tamils have lost a few generations due to this war. So, I beg to know how the cadres of the LTTE could have multiplied from 5,000 to 13,500 in 12 calendar months. Now, if this is the war we are conducting - a war of words, a war of propaganda, a war of statistics - this is not going to take us anywhere. The next thing that gets affected by the extension of the state of Emergency and the conduct of the war is the freedom from want. What do we have to say on this front? We all know that inflation is high throughout the world; we all know what the oil crisis is doing to the economies around the world, but are these the only reasons that have now prevented us from giving our people freedom from want?

We must look at things pragmatically. Some of the abductions that are taking place maybe done by criminal elements. But why do they do this? Because they have their wants. They have no other means of making ends meet. So, under the guise of making abductions, if I may say, with State patronage, they also make their money.

When we look at the wastage of funds through tamashas, the impact on the garment industry brought about by the loss of the GSP Plus and the resulting loss of employment, it is natural that people, at one stage, will decide to rebel against a prevalent government.

That should not be turned into an unpatriotic deed by saying that when the people rise up against the suppression and fight for their freedom from fear and freedom from want, they are being unpatriotic. Therefore, I would ask the Government to rethink this strategy of the war, and would conclude my speech by saying that if you think what you thought and do what you did, you will get what you got.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) 13 . ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Thissa Vitharana) . , 10 . . . , . , , . . . . . One of the issues that has come up over the recent times is the problem of human rights violations. The European Union as well as the ambassadors of various governments have been meeting me as the Chairman of the APRC and during these discussions, once they have convinced themselves that the APRC process is on track, that a detailed set of political resolutions which will address the problem of the ethnic minorities is being fashioned, they have raised the issue of human rights

951 952

violations. In my discussions with them, I made it clear that human rights violations are taking place right around the world in countries that have a completely peaceful environment, both developed and developing, and in my own view the very fact that there is increasing poverty and hunger in countries, is itself a violation of human rights. Now, we have to try to minimize those violations. In Sri Lanka, in addition, we have a situation of war. The war itself means a violation of human rights. There is a culture of violence which has developed as a result of the situation that has emerged in our country after 1983 and in this context, the violence has gathered momentum. It has affected various sections of our society. There are a large number of people trained to use arms, who have no other means of sustenance and there are underworld people and other characters who are ready to exploit that. So, it is in this situation the whole question of violation of human rights has to be viewed. In Sri Lanka, not only are we having a situation of conventional warfare, but there is also a question of terrorism and it is in this context that I said to these representatives that it was completely unfair to expect a clean bill of human rights record from any country. So, let me assure you that with regard to the fear that is being generated that the European Union will withdraw the GSP Plus benefits that have been given, that it will have a serious economic impact; in my view, it will not occur because these representatives of the European Union saw that if they deprive us of those benefits, then unemployment, living conditions and the political situation in our country will get worse, so that the violations of human rights and the other problems that have arisen will also get worse. So, I am sure that they will act in good faith and with a sense of propriety and not resort to this course of action. Finally, I would like to make some reference to the progress of the APRC, the All Party Representative Committee. For the last month, we have not been having any sittings, the reason being that two of the parties, the JHU and the MEP, wanted us to get the TMVP representative included in the APRC. I am happy to say that now His Excellency the President has taken that decision. The TMVP leader, Mr. Chandrakanthan, the present Chief Minister of the Eastern Province met me; we had a long discussion and I explained to him the background of the APRC. Now they have nominated the Mayor of Batticaloa as their representative. In the next week or two, we will be resuming our discussions which will go on and the remaining 10 per cent of issues that have not yet been resolved, the consensus for which have not been reached, will be taken up for discussion among the 15 parties that are participating. It is my hope that not before very long, we will be able to reach a consensus and reach a measure of agreement so that the completed set of proposals can be made available.

At that point of time, it is my intention to invite the United National Party and I would strongly urge the Members of that party to respond positively and participate in our deliberations so that the UNP as well as the SLFP will become parties to that agreement. This will give the confidence to the Tamil-speaking people in our country that the set of proposals that have been worked out will be implemented by whichever the government is in office. I would like down the line to extend the invitation to the JVP also to come into this process once again. Hopefully, we will be extending our invitation to the TNA, the Tamil National Alliance, to take into consideration the changing situation and come and participate in the process of consensus-building. I hope that this will create an environment in which the Tamil-speaking people, both here and abroad, will get confidence in working out a suitable set of proposals by ourselves to solve the national question which will be acceptable to the large majority, which will include a large majority of the minority population as well as of the majority community in this country. It is with this intention that the APRC process is going on, because it is important that the problem, which is a political problem, needs a political solution and we have to fashion that political solution ourselves. It is through this that we can win the hearts and minds of the Tamil-speaking people, win the war, weaken the LTTE, and it is something that may in the context of this emerging situation, force them to give up their separatist agenda and to come into serious discussions with an idea of solving this national problem within the framework of a single country. So, this is the direction in which we are moving. I request the support of all the political parties in Parliament to take this process forward in the interest of building a real national unity to get all our people together as Sri Lankan people though we have diversity which is really our strength. We must not allow that to become a weakness. We must all get together as one strong Sri Lankan people within one country and then have a lasting peace. That is really the objective of the APRC process. It is my hope that we will be able to achieve that in the period coming before us. Thereby we will be able to get away from this state of Emergency and all the shortcomings that flow from a culture of violence and the war situation that our country is facing today. Finally, we have to be aware that there are forces in the world today that would like to exploit our differences. They would like to divide and rule. The very fact that we have oil and gas, may be in the sea around us, will be an attractive bait for these people to come and make use of our problems for their advantage to gain economic benefits for themselves Therefore, we must not provide such a situation and it is to that extent that we are working on a solution, so that we will be able to avoid foreign intervention in solving our problems. Thank you very much.

(iii) No recruitments had been made for the post of Ward - Clerk in 2004 and 2005 while 129 persons have been recruited to the post only in 2006. Recruitment to the post have been made internally from the departmental employees after holding an examination based on a Cabinet Decision (as a promotion to the junior staff) and therefore it is difficult to submit a report on the districts of their permanent residence as recruitments have not been made at district level.

(iv) As per above reply there is no possibility to supply information of their Divisional Secretarys Divisions and the addresses. However, a table (Annexure 1) containing their official addresses is available in the Library of the Parliament.

(b) Substitute Sanitary Labourers are recruited to the Minor Staff under new appointments and after confirmation in their posts they are appointed to the post of Sanitary Labourer and from there to the post of Ordinary Labourer. The appointments to the other posts under Minor Staff are given as promotions for them.

(c) The appointments given on promotions are permanent while the other appointments come under temporary and casual appointments.

(d) Although a Grama Niladhari Certificate is obtained from the Division of their residency for a period of 06 months immediately prior to the recruitment, no information is called for regarding the Divisional Secretarys Division, or the District of their permanent residency. It is therefore difficult to furnish correct information of the personal addresses pertaining to the Divisional Secretarys Division of the District of their permanent residency.

However the full list of names of the persons who were recruited and their present official addresses are available in the Library of the Parliament (Annexure 2). (e) (i) Yes (ii) In accordance with the approved scheme of recruitment of Minor Staff (recruitments are made from both, males and females, passed Grade 8, and they should be more than 18 years and less than 45 years of age.)

(f) Does not arise.
