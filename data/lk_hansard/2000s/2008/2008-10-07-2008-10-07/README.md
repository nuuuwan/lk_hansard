Then b (ii) coming to the profitability of locally manufactured and imported refined products in 2006- ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You can skip the part on quantity. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) Which part do you want now? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Get on to the next point. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) Do you want the cost and all that? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, exactly. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) It is a long list. Shall I read it out? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) If you can read the final profit margin that is sufficient. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) In 2006, the final cost of products manufactured locally is-

1215 1216

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) If you can give the selling price and the cost, that would be sufficient. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) The profit margin on petrol is 10 cents in the year 2006, diesel 96 cents and we have a loss of Rs. 9.92 on kerosene.

Minister, I am very glad that you answered the Question. But my reflection is that the answer we got is not for the Question that has been posed. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) I have carefully gone through all the questions that you have posed and prepared the answers. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am very happy. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) You can go through this and if there is anything further you want to know, you can raise it at the next meeting. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Let me ask my questions on this. Firstly, Hon. Minister you mentioned that you are losing on diesel and kerosene oil and the quantities are almost four times that of petrol. But you had made Rs. 2,800 million profit in the year 2007. This mathematics does not show how you had made that Rs. 2,800 million profit while losing on your two main products including diesel the quantity of which was almost five times that of petrol. You cannot be cross subsidizing. How was that?

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) In the year 2006, the subsidy was withdrawn and we made a loss. Then in 2007, we increased the price and made a profit. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) But according to what you said you are losing on diesel as well as on kerosene. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You made a profit of 10 cents on a litre of petrol in 2006 and Rs. 6 on a litre in 2007. But as per the quantities that you have given, diesel is five times that of petrol. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) We have made a profit on diesel. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You had made a profit of 53 cents on a litre on diesel. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) What is the year you are referring to? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It is 2007. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) These are audited accounts. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Member, I know that you have a very difficult query to answer. But all I want to know is, how this magical profit making was made when you are losing all over. Unfortunately, you are answering a Question that is not in the Order paper. But I am happy to take this on. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) Fifty there cents on a litre is a lot of money because we are selling 140 million litres of diesel month. So, we have sold more than-

2008 07 1217 1218

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Okay, never mind. Do not worry about that. I do not want to give you a heart attack on that. All what I am saying is, that today the world oil price has come down to US Dollars 89. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) I know that. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) On that score, as per the prices you have given to us, you can bring down the oil price to Rs. 99 today. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) True, I can. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, you with the Hon. Members of Parliament of your side duped the people saying, Through world oil prices go up, we will not increase the price of oil here. So, when the world oil prices come down, why can you not reduce the price? . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) No. When the world oil price went up, we did not increase the price of oil here. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Why not? You increased it 14 times. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) I challenge you, tell me one instance where I have increased the price of oil immediately after the world oil price went up. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I do not want to challenge you. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

It took five months for us to increase the prices. From January to May, we did not increase the price and because of that we lost Rs. 11 billion. Thereafter when we

increased the price, we increased it only by 50 per cent. We took over loss of the other 50 per cent. Up to the month of September, we have lost another Rs. 10 billion. I do not want to cover the entire amount. But let me study and see. The world oil price went down to US Dollars 89 this morning, but again in two hours time it went up to Us Dollars 92. So, we do not know where it stands. So, let us see- ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Vicissitudes are in place. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) We will make sure that the benefit is passed on to the consumers unlike you who increased the price of oil 17 times when the world oil price went up. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Minister, you get a perverted pleasure in saying what we did. If you did what we did, you would not be in the mess in which you are in today. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie)

We have passed down all the benifites to the consumers. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) We increased prices four times and we reduced prices there times. You cannot add 1 to the 7. . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) We have passed down Rs. 21 billion on to the consumers as a subsidy. If we had increases the prices the way you had been increasing- ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Amiable Minister, just cut the crap. When are you going to reduce the prices ? . . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie) Within a short time. Wew will wait and see how the market is, doing.

. , , . , - - . , , , . . . . , . . ? , , . ; , . , . I would quote what the Army Commander said earlier. It was reported in the "Daily News" of 19th July, 2008. It states, I quote: The Sinhala nation has to sacrifice if you want to protect the country and survive, It further states, I quote: In any democratic country the majority should rule the country. This country will be ruled by the Sinhalese community which is the majority representing 74 per cent of the population. Who disputed this fact for him to say this? This fact was never disputed by anybody, but he on his own dares to say that the Sinhala nation has to sacrifice if you want to protect the country and survive. Are the Muslims not making the same sacrifice? Are the Muslims who are fighting in the armed forces also not sacrificing their lives? Did people like Major Muthaliph and others who died, who served in the Military Intelligence Unit, who were killed by the same terrorists who targeted the Army Commander, not sacrifice their lives? Are their sacrifices not worthy of mention? Why do you say that the Sinhala nation has a right to protect this country? This nation

1331 1332

[ ]

belongs to all three communities. So, that is where we find fault with the Army Commander. That is where the fear comes. As soon as you wipe them out by the so-called war against terror and once you finish that war, what you want to establish is the hegemony of the Sinhala nation. That is an unwarranted comment by a Commander of the armed forces and that should be subject to criticism and that right we, minorities must have. I do not think the Opposition must send the Hon. Kabir Hashim as a scapegoat to answer the Army Commander. Later on, the Hon. Tissa Attanayake, the General Secretary comes and says that the Army Commanders statement is unconstitutional. He also does not want to go beyond questioning the constitutionality of the statement. He does not recognize the fact that it has seriously hurt the harmonious feelings and hurt the sentiments of the minorities. So this must be very clearly clarified. The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella, the Military Spokesmans answer or the remedy was worse than the disease. This is a matter that should be left for political parties to fight in the political arena and for us to resolve this matter. Here now, things are changing. What does our Foreign Minister say? I quote from the "Sunday Island" of 5th October, 2008 : "The Foreign Minister, in an interview with an Indian magazine has denied the very existence of an ethnic problem in Sri Lanka. 'No longer would the international community recognise there is an ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka. We have a terrorist problem, a fascist movement, in the LTTE..' (Frontline - Sep 27th - Oct.10th). The Government takes up the position that there is no ethnic problem. The problem is a pure and a simple terrorist problem. If you render development and usher democracy, things will resolve by itself. This is the new thinking of this regime and this is the very ideology against which from the very outset, ever since the country gained Independence, the majoritarian Westminster model failed to resolve the problem and therefore now there is a fear-psychosis. Nobody wants to talk against the Army Commander; nobody wants to criticize him. Even the Opposition will only send a Muslim representative to speak against him in the initial phase. Later on only, the General Secretary of the party will say that what he has said perhaps contravenes the constitutional provisions of equality. It is not a question of equality alone. It is a question of dignity; dignity to live in this country as an equal citizen. One day the very same forces which are harping on the right for the majority to rule will say, Well, the equal rights that the other communities are enjoying now are too much. We need to change the rules of the competition. We need to shift the goalposts so that we can correct the imbalance that has been created by the equality that we have conceded to the minorities. That is the trend that is

developing and this is a very dangerous trend which is very harmful to the culture of harmonious co-existence that we have been striving to build. The emergence of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress in the political fabric of this country came in the aftermath of the Indo-Lanka Accord which we felt was entered into without a proper consultation with an important community in the Eastern Province. A pure and simple de-merger does not solve the problem. There are inherent issues and these issues do not get resolved by bringing Mr. Karuna Amman to Parliament or by installing Mr. Pillayan as the Chief Minister. The way and method in which they were installed and brought in is another matter which is subject to challenge in the court of law. Here too, the entry of Mr. Karuna Amman has even been criticized by some of the Opposition parties but not the SLMC. The SLMC feels that it is a new phenomenon. But, let us see how it turns out and how the impact would be felt; whether it is going to resolve the problem or the Government is simply trying to reward those who are willing to bend their heads and do servile duties to their greater ideology to reinvent the machine and impose the hegemony of one race in this country. If that is the intention, if that is going to be the result and if these leaders who are being brought into Parliament are going to be servile and are not even going to get at least what the Thirteenth Amendment promised, the land powers and the police powers to the provinces, what will then happen? These are questions we are asking. These are legitimate concerns that the minority has in this country. We may have our own points of view. As you know there has been a statement issued. The Venerable Presiding Members Party and our Party have been at loggerheads on the way in which we looked at the statement of the Army Commander. You are certainly entitled to your view and so are we entitled to our point of view. We are hurt; our sentiments are hurt; we are outraged and we need to speak out. That is why we have this august Assembly, to speak out our minds and thrash out these things in an atmosphere of give and take and finally arrive at a solution. There is the Judiciary and there is the Executive. Everyone today is taking the position of making law. It is not only our duty. The exclusive power of the legislature to legislate is now being enjoyed not simply by the legislative arm of the State. Now the Executive is also legislative. The Judiciary has also taken to framing legislation through judgments they give. So, it is not an exclusive domain simply of this House alone. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I am winding up, Venerable Sir. Therefore, we felt that we must clarify this issue in

2008 07 1333 1334

the right context. Then again, it is important for us to realize that there are continuing issues that need to be addressed and resolved by discussion and dialogue. Today, what has happened to the APRC - All Party Representative Committee? It has become a virtual farce. The JVP is not attending the All Party Representative Committee. The Hon. Wimal Weerawansas faction, I do not know whether they are going to attend or not. Currently the JHU is also boycotting the APRC. At least there must be a political track to resolve the problem. But some people are saying, No, let us first finish the war. But the minorities have a fear that if this same trend is continued, as the Army Commander says that after finishing the terrorist problem you will say, We have finished the war. There is no ethnic problem. So then, there must be recognition that there lies a problem of not sharing power with the minorities and the periphery. That needs to be shared. At least the few transitional arrangements that were put in place must be properly implemented. So, that is why we decided that we must question the justification behind such statements and utterances. Thank you very much, Sir. ( ) (The Presiding Member) . .

(The Presiding Member) . . 15 . [.. 3.21] ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama - Minister of Foreign Affairs) , . . , , . At the outset, I wish to condemn in the strongest possible terms, the suicide bomb attack by the LTTE yesterday, 6th October, 2008 in Anuradhapura, which claimed the lives of Major General Janaka Perera and his wife Mrs. Vajira Perera, Dr. Raja Johnpulle and his wife, Dr. Jenny Johnpulle, as well as several others, and express my heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families, who lost their loved ones in this cowardly and brutal act of terrorism. Major General Janaka Perera not only had an illustrious career in the Sri Lanka Army and led his troops from the front in winning many decisive military victories, but also served the motherland with distinction as our High Commissioner to Australia and subsequently as Ambassador to Indonesia. The loss of Dr. Raja Johnpulle and his wife Dr. Jenny Johnpulle, both leading medical practitioners, who served the people of Anuradhapura with utmost dedication for several decades, will be greatly felt by the people of the area. Dr. Johnpulle was a stalwart of the UNP and served as Sri Lankas Ambassador to the Soviet Union under the J.R. Jayewardene administration. As the Foreign Minister, I wish to pay my humble tribute to these two former envoys of Sri Lanka for their distinguished service to the nation. Yesterdays attack makes it crystal clear that the LTTE is firmly and irreversibly entrenched in the path of violence and terrorism. This is not the time for recrimination or finger-pointing. No attempt should be made to whitewash the LTTE and give it a lifeline, as it faces imminent and certain defeat at the hands of our valiant security forces. All political parties which subscribe to democracy should unite and join hands with the Government to once and for all rid Sri Lanka of the scourge of terrorism. This barbaric act of terrorism also demonstrates the need for the people to remain eternally vigilant, since the LTTE is determined on wreaking death and destruction on the people of this country. At the same time, the onus is on the international

community to support Sri Lanka, by taking concrete and tangible measures to combat terrorism. While we do appreciate significant steps taken by our friends who have proscribed the LTTE and helped in interdicting the supply of arms and ammunition to the terrorists, much more needs to be done to pursue front organizations of the LTTE, posing off as charity and humanitarian aid organizations, which openly engage in raising funds for the LTTE war chest. While our security forces are engaged in their present humanitarian operation to free our people from the fascist and dictatorial control of the LTTE terrorists, who are now confined to their last strongholds in parts of the Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu Districts, critics of Sri Lanka and sympathizers of the LTTE are attempting to portray a misleading and totally false notion that the Government is committed to a military solution to address the problems of the minorities. It is unfortunate that some of our friends too have been influenced by this malicious propaganda. Nothing can be further from the truth. In fact, President Mahinda Rajapaksa addressing the 63rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York last month, made it amply clear to the international community that the Government of Sri Lanka is firmly committed to a political solution. President Rajapaksa said, I quote : Exploiting perceived ethnic grievances, that must and can be addressed through political means, the vested interests of a well organized terror group, the LTTE indulges in blatant and brutal acts of terrorism, including suicide bombings to seek negotiating leverage, political recognition and legitimacy. The President went on to say, I quote : Our Government has always been ready to address the causes of these issues and effectively implement political and constitutional solutions to meet the aspirations and rights of all communities. What the Government would not, and could not do is to let an illegal and armed terrorist group, the LTTE, to hold a fraction of our population, a part of the Tamil community, hostage to such terror in the northern part of Sri Lanka and deny those people their democratic rights of dissent and free elections. Through our past actions, we have proved it. Those who criticize the Government for terminating the Ceasefire Agreement with the LTTE, should be reminded that it was precisely the ending of the farcical and non-existent truce, in January this year, that ended the LTTE monopoly of Tamil politics and paved the way for the breakaway faction of the LTTE in the Eastern Province to transform itself into a recognized political party, the TMVP, which contested two elections and won a popular mandate to govern the region. We have witnessed today, a momentous and landmark event in the history of our Parliament, namely the entry of Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan, also known as Karuna to the supreme national legislature of Sri Lanka. It is truly an epoch-making event, which would go down in the annals of our history, signifying the culmination of the metamorphosis of a member of the LTTE, who was

1357 1358

[ ]

previously committed to the dismemberment of the Sri Lankan State, renouncing violence and embracing democracy. It is still not too late for the LTTE cadres, remaining on the battle front, of whom more than half have been forcibly conscripted as child soldiers to give up their futile cause of carving out an ethnically-cleansed separate State in Sri Lanka and come forward and lay down their weapons. This would spare them their own precious lives, and indeed minimize the unnecessary bloodshed and hasten the end of the conflict. The Government of Sri Lanka is deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation of civilians in the uncleared areas as the military operations enter a decisive phase to free these areas from the terrorists. As a responsible Government, President Mahinda Rajapaksas administration is acutely conscious and aware of its responsibilities towards all citizens of Sri Lanka. This is why, even as there is intensification of the military strikes against the LTTE, there are remarkably minimal collateral civilian casualties. This has not occurred by chance or a fortuitous turn of circumstances, but, rather in pursuance of the Governments directive to the military to adhere strictly to a policy of zero civilian casualty in combating terrorism. The absence of civilian deaths in the Eastern Province clearing operations last year, except in one isolated incident where the LTTE used civilians as cover to fire at the military, is a manifestation of the success of this strategy which we are confident will be replicated in the ongoing operations in the North. The Governments sincere objective is to enable the people of the North to enjoy the benefits of the democratic process and to ensure that political freedom and the fruits of economic and social development that the people of the Eastern Province are now beginning to benefit from can be experienced and enjoyed by the people in the North of Sri Lanka as well. As a nation we take modest pride in the fact that we have achieved the difficult but essential task of building democracy in the Eastern Province and we are confident that it can be done in the North as well. And we are confident that such reinvigoration of the democratic processes in the North and the East can lead towards a lasting political solution to issues of concern to all citizens of Sri Lanka and for securing fundamental rights and preserving and protecting the multireligious, multiethnic and multicultural fabric of Sri Lankan society. The Hon. Members may also be aware of reports of the National Security Adviser of India, Mr. M.K. Narayanan, expressing concern on the situation in Sri Lanka. In this regard I wish to reiterate Sri Lankas policy of maintaining a close dialogue with India, with whom we have time-tested relationship based on mutual goodwill and trust.

The Government attaches the highest importance to the humanitarian needs of displaced persons and civilians in the areas affected by the conflict. This is an obligation and responsibility which the Government has assumed since the inception of the conflict. In order to ensure effective, adequate and safe delivery of humanitarian supplies, the Government has been working closely with UN agencies, ICRC as well as a number of local and international NGOs. The Government co-ordinates this effort at several national as well as ground level mechanisms overseeing the progress of deliveries and distribution of supplies and assessing needs in affected areas on a round-the-clock basis. In recent months, the Government has found it necessary to relocate the hub for humanitarian operations from Kilinochchi to Vavuniya with a view to better supplying the civilians and IDPs from a secure location. The Government has obtained the concurrence of the UN agencies and international humanitarian organizations and a new humanitarian hub has been established in Vavuniya. The Government has also encouraged civilians trapped in Vanni by the LTTE to come to Vavuniya where their safety and welfare could be effectively ensured. Leaflets and flyers were dropped by the Sri Lankan Armed Forces informing the civilians to move out of the Vanni to Vavuniya and other cleared areas. It is highly deplorable that the LTTE is cynically exploiting the plight of innocent civilians kept prisoners against their will, for propaganda purposes. The Government welcomes the statement of 23rd September, 2008 by the Catholic Bishops Conference on the humanitarian situation in the North. In particular, it states, I quote: It was noted that the LTTE is not permitting the civilians to come out of Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi. This is a very unfortunate situation. We ask the LTTE not to hinder the innocent civilians from proceeding to safe areas as the war is escalating and the lives of these innocent people are greatly endangered. The innocent civilians must not be used as human shields. Being mindful of the Governments paramount responsibility and indeed its sacred obligation to protect the lives of civilians, and the LTTE will not permit them to leave for the safety of Government-controlled areas, the military has identified two safe zones in the uncleared areas. In order to ensure that humanitarian supplies reach civilians and IDPs moving North-East of Kilinochchi, on 2nd October, the Government dispatched a convoy consisting of 51 trucks carrying 650 metric tons of food, which proceeded to the area via A-34 route. This convoy departed Vavuniya on 2nd October, 2008, carrying essential food commodities like rice, flour, sugar, dhal and vegetable oil and entered Vanni through Omanthai Exit Point. The food cargo was delivered at Kandavalai, Dharmapuran, Pudukudiyiruppu and Mulliyawalai.

( ) (The Presiding Member) , . ( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama) . The warehouses in these locations are identified in order to ensure that the food is delivered to the places where the people are largely located. In future, there will be a pre-notification of food delivery schedules in order to ensure maximum distribution on the ground. On 3rd October 2008, 29 trucks had been already unloaded. The convoy was accompanied by seven UN international staff members. The NGO national staff remaining in the Vanni, who are attached to the GAs as volunteers, were deployed to assist in the distribution as worked out by the respective GAs. The convoy turnaround time anticipated should be as fast as possible and the respective GAs and the World Food Programme officials had been directed to expedite unloading within one night and return the following day. The Government has planned to send in similar convoys every week carrying 750-1000 metric tons to ensure the existence of a 5000 metric tons buffer stock in uncleared areas of the Vanni. These are in addition to 15-20 lorries sent per day carrying consumer goods and supplies for the general population in the Vanni which includes food items, clothing, animal feed, fertilizer, and kerosene. The Sri Lanka Army will facilitate the expeditious return of the empty trucks through Omanthai to enable a regular and sustainable flow of humanitarian supplies. To ensure that sufficient commercial trucks are available for the subsequent World Food Programme convoys, the GAs of the respective districts have been directed to ensure up to 200 lorries are available at Vavuniya so that no delays are sustained for having to wait for the return of the 30 commercial trucks from the first convoy. It is very important that all those who are concerned about Sri Lanka including the welfare of the Tamil community should perceive the marginalization of the LTTE in the correct light. The LTTE does not represent the Tamil community in Sri Lanka. Therefore, military action against the LTTE should never be perceived as action against our brethren, the Tamil community. We are concerned about them and will work with them to ensure their welfare, security and aspirations since they are our own fellow citizens. Thank you, Venerable Sir. [.. 3.38] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Thank you, Venerable Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to the Emergency Debate at a time when we are moving from a tragic situation to an even worse tragic situation. You would see that yet another decorated person is no more with us. The general perception of the day's Debate or deliberation is that owing to the fact that Major General Janaka Perera is a political figure such a thing could happen. When Major General Janaka Perera was alive he fought against terrorists. He protected the country, ensured that the unitary character of Sri Lanka was enshrined and safeguarded and it was only then he came into politics. Has he committed a grave sin by joining the United National Party and coming into politics? There are many officers who have done a yeoman service to this country. But is it because of the fact that he decided to serve the country through the United National Party, that such an act should not be condemned? He was basically placed in a situation where his security was taken off despite his request. We must thank the courts. When he was contesting, it was mandated that he be provided with security. But no sooner the Provincial Council Elections were over, security was withdrawn. That is the history. Likewise, many other soldiers, when they are in service they are glorified. When they retire or get injured they are no more valuable to the Government. This should not be the style and manner in which it should be done. If it has been the case this must be changed immediately because there is a human element involved in this. The Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs was speaking as if everything is tickety-boo in the country. I must say, if that is the case, how many leaders were you able to meet at the United Nations General Assembly? Were you able to meet the Indian Prime Minister? Is the Indian Prime Minister due to speak to His Excellency the President tomorrow? On what matter is he going to speak? How many times have you been spoken to on the need to have a peaceful solution? We have given total support to you. As a matter of fact, the bipartisan support that has been given by us has been construed as an element of weakness on the part of the Untied National Party to take the Government on. Is that the price you have got to pay? Look at todays Daily News? When soldiers or the general public are injured due to terrorist violence in any part of the country, irrespective of victims being Tamils, Muslims or Sinhalese it is my duty, as the leader of the UNP for the Colombo District, to go and see them. The "Daily News" highlighted that fact and state that it is published in the TamilNet. Is it a justification to publish that in the "Daily News"? There are many other news. When I went to see soldiers, the "Daily News" does not give publicity. But when the TamilNet publishes that news, the "Daily News" makes it a big issue and publicises that just next to Major General Janaka Pereras article, stating that the TamilNet carried a news about the MP going and seeing the soldiers. Is that the bipartisan support you require from us? Is that something wrong we did? When soldiers are required, you send them to the

1361 1362

[ ]

battlefront. When they are injured who has gone and seen them? We have gone and seen them. Does that appear in the "Daily News"? Nobody publishes those news. When the TamilNet reflects that, is this the altar of sacrifice that you are trying to create? These are the cheap-scale politics that you all are taking forward. Ensure that these types of things change. This country deserves a different orientation. The country has gone through too much of tragedy. We need to take it out rather than going into that. We do not need to fortify that. We need to eradicate that culture. Hon. Minister, I think the Government should have ensured that a person of that calibre should have been provided with security. That is why he is now "Late Janaka Perera". You would see that there is a total breakdown of law and order. Look at the news of the lady doctor who has been killed in Hambantota. Have those assailants been arrested? A lawyer, Mr. J.C. Weliamunas house was attacked. Has anybody come forward and ensured that security checks are done and the culprits are detected? Then there is the case of Sakvithi Ranasinghe House Construction (Pvt.) Limited of Sakvithi Ranasinghe, a rogue. Thank God, he had a photograph of him posing with your President and your Hon. Ministers. Otherwise they would have said that was also in Kotte and I was behind that. Because of the fact that there was a photograph of him posing with the President, investors deposited money with him. But what is the action that has been taken in that regard? What has the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Nivard Cabraal done about it except for marketing him, nurturing him and ensuring that he is given safe heaven out of this country? Has anything been done? What has been done by the security forces in that area? Then, take the case of Rupavahini attackers. They are still at large. Take the situation of the university students. If they stand up for their basic rights they are attacked, they are harassed and the police do nothing about them. Then, take the situation of the trade union members. If they stand up for their rights that are enshrined in the Constitution, the police go and attack them. Nothing has been done, Venerable Presiding Member. What about you, the venerable monks? The Buddhist monks are attacked. Has anything been done about it? There is a general breakdown of law and order. My Colleague and Friend, the Hon. Chandranehru Chandrakanth, MP, in this House raised a Matter of Privilege on the 26th of September this year, and on the 31st of September his house was attacked. So, where is the law and order of this country? You are saying that everything is going on well. We hope and pray for it. But actual truths are not known. In order to save time Venerable Sir, I am tabling* Annex I relating the Hon. Chandanehru Chandrakanth to

be included in Hansard and not to be placed in library. Also I am tabling Annex 2 which gives the details about the deaths and injured personnel of the security forces and civilians given by the Hon. Prime Minister during the Debates for the Extension of the state of Emergency from 9th January, 2007 onwards. The figures that have been given by the Government alone add up to a huge amount. When are these types of happenings going to end? Eradication of terrorism is a must. We have been standing firm for it from day-dot. But when are you going to achieve it? Once you said in three months time you would bring honourable peace to this country. Then you said after Sampur was cleared, you would bring in peace. Thereafter, you said after the Mavil-Aru operation, you would bring in peace. Again you said after signing the MoU with the UNP, you would bring in peace. Then, again you said after you passed the Budget of 2007 you would bring in peace. Again you said peace can be brought in after 31st March, 2008. Thereafter, you said after the Election in the Eastern Province, peace can be brought in. Again you said peace can be brought in after 31st August 2008. Then the Commander of Army is going on record saying that for twenty years you cannot do anything. Thereafter you say, Prabhakaran will be eliminated before 26th November, 2008. What are these deadlines for? The goal keeps shifting day by day. At every election you say that Kilinochchi would be captured in a few days. According to you, Kilinochchi was captured 24 hours before the Provincial Council Election. But you are still to capture it. Various character assassinations were made against the UNPers. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Venerable Sir, I will ensure that I finish my speech in two minutes. I am tabling Annex 3* the front page of the Daily Mirror online edition under the caption Alleged assassin of Muthalib caught. This is a very clear testimony for which they were trying to accuse the UNP. According to this, the Government has caught a Sinhalese suspect allegedly involved in the assassination of Colonel Muthaliph. This is like when the UNP was accused of trying to sell Sigiriya and the Sinharaja Forest; the very MPs who accused the UNP had to ensure that there were no such things. Then, the assassinations of the Hon. Joseph

Pararajasingham, the Hon. Nadarajah Raviraj, the Hon. T. Maheswaran, the Hon. K. Sivanesan and Major General Janaka Perera took place. At the end of the day, you say that the X terrorist group has been involved in these. Then, why did they take on only the UNPers like the late Hon. Ranasinghe Premadasa, the late Hon. Ranjan Wijeratne, the late Hon. Lalith Athulath Mudali, the late Hon. Gamini Dissanayake? Why was the security of General Janaka Perera withdrawn? That is the problem. If the security required by him was given, you could have basically ensured the safety of Major General Janaka Perera. There were six policemen allocated for his security on that day. Why did they not go for that task? Look at the last statement General Janaka Perera has given to the police. No action has been taken on that. You are trying not to get terrorists come into democracy but you are trying to get democracy to go to terrorism. Mr. Ali Zahir Moulana who was a Member of Parliament had to forsake his seat because of his alleged involvement of moving Karuna Amman from Batticaloa to Colombo. He was insisted to stand down. But ironically today, Mr. Ali Zahir Moulana who was in Parliament is no more and Karuna with whom he was associated is in Parliament today. Is that the travesty of justice? ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , . Look at what has happened to Mr. S.B. Dissanayake. If people of such calibre can be pardoned, why cannot Mr. S.B. Dissanayake be pardoned? Look at the issue of the bulletproof car which was supposed to be given to the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe one year ago. Still it has not been given. Why can it not be given? Therefore, please ensure that that is done before we say, "Why it is not done?". Thank you very much. * : Annexe tabled.
