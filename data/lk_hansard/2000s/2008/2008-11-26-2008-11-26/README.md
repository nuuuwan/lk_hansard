. , ... . , . . * : : Document tabled: Peace Secretariat for Muslims Comments on the procedures devised by the Land Commissioner General to implement the Government policy on control of encroachment and alienation of State Land (Edited version) Compiled by M. H. M. Salman General On the 21st March 2008 he cabinet of Ministers approved a set of new policies with a view to control of encroachment of state land and the proper management & administration thereof. Issues arising out of provisions of the circular 1. Unjust Eligibility criteria (a) Denial of right to individuals who have constructed a permanent house and live therein (on land owned by parents) In Sri Lanka, as a general rule, children tend to live with parents. More often than not children continue to live with parents even after marriage or securing employment. Some of others live with parents due to poverty. Construction of a permanent house on land owned by parents is not conclusive proof or indicative of such individual own land or not in need of state land for himself. In the North and East majority live in community or together due to the conflict and for safety reasons. (b) Denial of right to individuals who own land Circular identifies three categories of land owners. They are land owners, individual owning land in other divisions and individuals who own Some extent of land for residential, agricultural or commercial purposes. Individuals own land in varying extent. In the absence of a definition to the phrase own land it is open to interpretation. Individuals who own one perches of land to hundreds of acres are treated similarly. Purpose of the government is to address landlessness; if that is no individuals owning small piece of land should not be deprived. (c) Denial or right to individuals who is likely to inherit land In legal terms inheritance is something an individual may receive in the future upon the death of somebody. A person may likely to inherit land from parents, relatives or even from anybody for that matter. Inheritance is not a certain thing and cannot be accurately predicted. An individual who is likely to or legally entitled to inherit might not eventually inherit due to a supervening incident. 2. Clarity of the word eligible citizen The circular does not interpret or describe who is eligible to apply. No upper or lower age limit is set. It is also not clear whether the spouse and/or children of an eligible individual are also entitled to apply on their own right? 3. Powers granted to Land ministers Wide ranging powers have been conferred on Land Ministers at the center and the provinces to determine the extent of land alienated to an individual under the new scheme. Conflict of interest, prejudice or even political bias may well prevail over rational decision making based on reasonable criteria.

4. Deletion of name from divisional register Specific provision is made in the circular to delete the name of an applicant from the register in certain circumstances. That is in the event of refusal to accept land offered to him from an adjacent division in situations where no sufficient state land is available in a division where applicant resides. 5. Pending applications Implementation of the circular instructions may have an adverse impact on the applications for land alienation and regularization of encroachments that are pending at different stages of approval. The circular set a deadline for finalization of pending cases; however no clear procedure is spelled out to dispose of pending applications. Further complications are bound to surface due to the strict application of section 20A of the Land Development Ordinance. Other issues 1. Displaced persons and registration The circular has not considered the presence of displaced individuals in many parts of the country. Displacements have taken place due to the conflict, tsunami and other natural and man made disasters. Muslims of the Northern Province are living out side of their homes for the last 18 years. Commencement of registration will definitely affect their interest and cause them irreparable loss. Land and property issues of displaced have already posed serious concern to the victims as well as policy makers. 2. Secondary occupation of land and legal impediments Due to the conflict large numbers of individuals have abandoned their land and houses and live in other areas. In some instances third party have been occupying such land (Secondary occupation). The situation is acute in the Northern Province where Muslims have been forced out 18 years ago. Though legal remedies are available the continuing conflict environment and other difficulties have prevented from institution of actions to recover properties. 3. Demarcation of divisional boundaries and boundary disputes In certain districts the divisional boundaries are not property determined and gazetted. Due to this certain villages are subjected to counter claims by two divisions. Some of these disputes and counter claims are not resolved for long periods of time. More often than not divisions are created for political expediency than on a rational basis and on needs. Divisions are sometimes created in haste without proper assessment of resources and demography. As a result divisions are created with little or no land availability for population expansion or development. This problem is very acute in the Eastern Province. 4. Problems associated with small divisions Ad hoc creation of divisions has resulted in geographically small divisions (in terms of land area). Common feature among these divisions is the high density of population and non availability of land for alienation or for essential development activities. Communities and individuals in these divisions compete for land and other resources sometimes leading to conflicts and straining of relationship. In these divisions more people enjoy less land whilst in others divisions less people enjoy more land. 5. Land ownership after Tsunami Tsunami also created special category of landless persons. As a direct result of Tsunami a large extent of land was lost and subsequent declaration of buffer zone also deprived large number of people of their land. In addition due to the declaration certain individuals were left with small pieces of land. 6. Ambiguity of language Circulars issued by the Secretary, Ministry of Land and Land Development and the Land Commissioner General are inconsistent on one important point.

1737 1738

According to the Ministry circular the extent of land that will be alienated in future will be determined by the Land Minister in Colombo in consultation with the respective provincial land ministers. Whereas the circular issued by the Commissioner states that the government and the provincial council will determine the extent of land. The Government and the Provincial Councils are distinct entities vis--vis the cabinet and provincial Ministers. Divisional level officers will face difficulties in the implementation if this ambiguity continues. Recommendation Clear and uniform instructions should be issued to avoid confusion 7. Usurpation of powers of provincial Councils The question is whether the circulars have the effect of taking away powers of Provincial Councils in respect of land. Is the consent of Land ministers of the provinces is sufficient to implement far reaching policy decisions touching on devolved subjects? 8. Legality of the circular Circular issued by the Land Commissioner General has express provision varying and amending regulations issued under the Land Development Ordinance and Land Grant Ordinance. Is the Land Commissioner General is empowered to amend or vary regulations framed under Ordinances through circular? [. . 1.06]

Venerable Presiding Member, I am happy that I have been given an opportunity to speak on the Votes of three key Ministries that form the backbone of my districts economy and the Governments Api Wawamu Rata Nagamu programme. I believe, the Digamadulla District is the largest contributor to the granary right now and I will participate in this Discussion taking the subjects in the order of irrigation, land and agriculture. I have known the Ministre of Irrigation and Water Management, the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa, since 1980 when we both worked together, and despite our political differences I must admit, that he is someone who can get things done. Having said that, I am disappointed that though there is an increase in Recurrent Expenditure and a huge leap in Capital Expenditure, there is very little coming in the direction of the Eastern Province except, of course, a token vote for the Heda Oya Project, by way of Capital Expenditure. This is despite all the noise being made about the re-awakening of the East under the Negenahira Udanaya. Venerable Presiding Member, agriculture is the backbone of my people, and water is the blood that feeds it and it is very critical that enough attention is paid to our region to improve the irrigation facilities and maintain the same. I spend most of time in my electorate meeting farmer organizations along with officials so that I can better understand their problems and highlight deficiencies without having to be relying only on information that is fed to me. We have this Gal Oya Navodaya scheme that was inaugurated, I believe in 2007, when Marhoom Anver Ismail was the subject Minister, This was to have an interministerial steering committee and also a project office in Ampara. I am not sure whether this objective has been realized to-date. There was an original allocation of almost Rs. 1,260,000 made for this project. I am aware that an allocation of Rs. 50 million was made for the year 2008 and later revised to Rs. 30 million, but as at today only Rs. 15 million has been spent on one anicut in my area, the Kandanveli Anicut, and it would be interesting to know what has happened to the balance Rs. 15 million of the revised allocation, when there is only one month to go in the year. This is the state of affairs when we should be really accelerating development efforts in the Eastern Province.

2008 26 1767 1768

The river division of Gal-Oya with its tributaries such as Moravil, Pattampiti, Kurunal Kanji, Udanga, Thiraimadu and Sengappadai has been in existence long before the building of the Senanayake Samudra and was irrigating the fertile lands opened up by the hard labour of my ancestors, which fact most of the present generation do not have an innate understanding of. It is only after the construction of the Senanayake Samudra in the 1950s that the Sinhala population of the district increased from a mere 2 per cent to what it is today. If not for the foresight of Marhoom Gate Mudaliyar Kariapper and the tireless work of engineers like Marhoom M. M. Ismail, Marhoom M. A. M. Mirza and the political leadership of that day like Marhoom A. M. Merza, Alhaj M. A. Abdual Majeed, Marhoom M. H. M. Ashraff, Marhoom U. L. M. Mohideen and Marhoom Anver Ismail who all took a very keen interest in the Irrigation and agricultural sector, we are not in this position today. It must be said that other Ministers too have been showing interest in this vital sector. I will fail in my duty if I do not mention the name of the Hon. P. Dayaratna who has done yeoman service to the development of the Gal-Oya valley in general. It is in this rich tradition of ethnic harmony that we need to develop the infrastructure of this district and not leave room for elements who are trying to bring about friction among the communities who live here and love the land which they call their own. I would like now, to specifically take up some issues pertaining to the office of the Irrigation Engineer, Samanthurai set up by Marhoom Anver Ismail which I took up at the Consultative Committee Meeting as well. This office covers an area of approximately 9.761 hectares and maintains, six field offices, 12 kilometers of main rivers, 30 kilometers of subrivers, two storage tanks, 4.81 kilometers of feeder channels, 5.8 kilometers of main channels, 78.2 kilometers of branch channels and 173.2 kilometers of distributory channels. It also maintains 18 main anicuts, 39 medium anicuts, 496 channel structures, 42 kilometers of irrigation roads, 171 kilometers of agricultural roads and 13 kilometers of drainage channels. All this is covered by one engineer, three engineering assistants and three supervisors. I request the Hon. Minister to increase this cadre by two engineering assistants, four work supervisors and at least 26 labourers so that we can work with this office to fulfil our needs. The main problem we have in the rivers division which is approximately 30 kilometers, is the lack of maintenance. The rivers need to be dredged to remove silt that has gathered over the years. Main channels and distributory channels need to be concreted at the head and maintained for proper utilization of the presious water resource. I made a request that approximately 4.8 kilometers of Malwatta-Samanthurai Channel, opening at the Weergoda Tank be concreted to prevent the growth of algae and I am sure the Hon. Minister will accede to it. Some of the anicuts in our area have been built in the

eighteenth century by burnt bricks. One of those, the Veerayadi Anicut, was renovated recently at a cost of almost Rs. 88 million on the efforts taken by Minister, Marhoom Anvar Ismail. In the same way, we need to look at Kandanveli Anicut, Sampumadu Anicut and Fernando Anicut which need urgent repairs. You will be surprised to hear that this office which has so much of work to do, thought it has indicated an expense of Rs. 10.8 million for flood damage work, has not received a red cent as at date. I am disappointed because I met the Secretary personally and I was assured of this money but yet it has not reached that office. I know that everything cannot be done by the State and I am one who firmly believes that farmer contribution is very essential; labour alone is not sufficient, machinery is required as well. I request that each of the irrigation offices at Samanthurai, Ampara, Akkaraipattu and Kalmunai be given the required machinery such as, crawler excavators, front-end loaders and backhoes so that we can get the farmer organization to use them, even the tractors, and contribute towards the fuel cost to reduce the burden on the state.

Another major issue is the agricultural roads. Right now the width of the agricultural roads is three metres. Now, with the advent of modern harvesting machinery, this needs to be widened to at least four metres. Otherwise, when we go through another two seasons, we will not have any roads left to maintain.

The other issue which I would like to take up is with regard to the wooden planks used to store up water in anicuts. This is a method that has been practiced over the years. With this resource diminishing, we need to find a way to protect them for longer use. I would suggest that these planks either be coated with fiberglass or plastic so that they can be used many times.

The next subject that I would like to take up is lands. With regard to the Vote on Land, we see an increase in Recurrent Expenditure and a drop in Capital Expenditure. Land is the most important natural resource which is the basis if all human, biological and environmental needs. Efficient management of land resource is very critical due to population pressure and competition among nationalities. Now, how do we do this? Recently, there was a circular issued by the Land Commissioner-General. I know that the Hon. M. T. Hasen Ali took up this issue and also tabled a document that had been prepared by the Peace Secretariat for Muslims which had elaborated on the issue. What I would like to take up is the legal aspect of this issue because I am told that there is an ambiguity of the language that is used there. The document prepared by the Peace Secretariat for Muslims states :

the circulars issued by the Secretary, Ministry of Land and Land Development and the Land Commissioner General are inconsistent on one important point.

1769 1770

The Ministry circular says the extent of land alienated in future will be determined by the Land Minister in Colombo in consultation with respective provincial land ministers, while the circular issued by the Land Commissioner says the government and the provincial council will determine the extent of land. The Government and the provincial councils, we all know, are distinct entities vis--vis the Cabinet and the provincial ministers. Divisional level officers will face difficulties in the implementation if this ambiguity continues. There is also a question whether there is usurpation of powers of provincial councils, whether the circulars have the effect of taking away powers of provincial councils in respect of lands. Are the provincial council land ministers empowered to grant consent to implement far-reaching policy decisions touching on devolved subjects? Because, item No. 1:3 of Appendix II of the Constitution states: Alienation or disposition of the State land within a Province to any citizen or to any organization shall be by the President, on the advice of the relevant Provincial Council, in accordance with the laws governing the matter. I think, this is something that has to be definitely looked at.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Please wind up.

. . . ( . . . ) (The Hon. A. M. M. Naoshaad) Please give me one minute more. I will just touch on agriculture. The Government is now working towards an increase in the paddy production and other pulses. I would urge the Minister, that to do this in our district we need soil testing facilities. The agriculture research institution opened in Samanthurai in 2001 which is now in a dilapidated condition and all the agrarian service centers have to be refurbished. I would also request that a new agrarian service centre be opened in Samanthurai for Block J which covers approximately 6000 acres. Thank you. [. . 3.03]

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] . , . , , , , , , , , , CARP . . , , , . ; . , . Let us cultivate and uplift the nation. There is a National Campaign to motivate domestic food production. For that, Rs. 286 million was initially allocated but an additional Rs. 300 million was proposed by the Budget. There has been an expenditure of Rs. 97.4 million up to end of October, 2008. Have we not done something for agriculture? Have we not done something substantial for agriculture? I am ashamed to look at the JVP. They said this years allocation is only a 10 per cent increase from what we allocated last year. We have done very well in the field of agriculture. The main activities in 2008 are as follows: a Presidential Task Force was established. Then, 36 crop-specialists were appointed to achieve the productivity increases in respect of 36 crops including crops targeted for reduction in imports. Crop Development Committees have been established. Awareness programmes, field programmes and mass media programmes are under way. Agricultural implements such as mammoties, tractors, other filling equipment et cetera, have been distributed among the farmers. High quality seed and planting material have also been distributed free of charge to the farmers in this country. Especially, in the Eastern Province we have done a massive programme providing the farmers with seed paddy, agricultural implements and other seed and planting material under the Negenahira Navodaya. At least, the Opposition should be more responsible in making their allegations about the Ministry of Agriculture. Home gardening competitions were held during 2007 and 2008 and the entire country has been set on a new trend today. If you go to the villages, if you come to the

[. . ]

2008 26 1787 1788

city areas, agriculture has become the norm of the day. You could see urban agriculture; you could see balcony agriculture; in the villages; in schools; everywhere-wherever you go-agricultural development is visible. No one can challenge that. Special projects have been launched to cultivate abandoned paddy lands in the wet zone. We planned to cultivate 1,200 hectares of fallow paddy lands in eight districts, including Gampaha, Kalutara and Colombo during the 2007 and 2008 Maha seasons. Progress achieved of that project is 88 per cent. The total investment of this project is around Rs. 10 million. Some people were talking about filling up paddy lands to build mega cities; to build fun cities. But, we have put a halt to that. Hon. Rajakaruna, we want to cultivate each and every inch of land. I am saying this for your information. Someone said that paddy lands should be filled and mega cities should be developed in and around Colombo. But, we have put a halt to that. We are cultivating all the fallow paddy lands including those in your area, the Gampaha District. The school garden development programme has really achieved its targets. Inputs such as seeds and the provision of fertilizer for commercial cultivation of maize, kurakkan, green gram, soya beans and onions have been done. Three threshing machines and Thapolin sheets have been given at a 50 per cent subsidy. Even the packing materials, plastic crates have been distributed among the farmers with a 50 per cent subsidy. Which government has done this before? If anyone wants to comment I will give one minute for them to comment. Maybe the Hon. John Amaratunga would like to comment on that - on agricultural development. [Interruption.] Very good. So, Hon. John Amaratunga, I welcome your good comments.

Farmer-women groups have been formed for promotion of home gardening and provided with marketing and entrepreneurship opportunities. Eleven Krushi Piyasas have been established. Model agro-technology parks are maintained for dissemination of modern agricultural technology and knowledge. Nearly 30,570 persons have visited the agro-technology park at Gannoruwa and 35,860 persons visited the agro-technology park at Bataatha. I invite you Gentlemen to join us and pay a visit to these places and see what our Ministry is involved in; what our task is and how far we have fulfilled it. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Shafeek Rajabdeen) You must send us invitations. ( ) (The Hon. Hemakumara Nanayakkara) Yes, very gladly, I will send you an invitation. Not only an invitation, we will provide you transportation; we will provide you a companion to come and visit our parks. If you wish to have a male companion, I would do so and if you want have another gender, that also could be looked into.- [Interruption.] Hon. John Amaratunga, I knew that you will get excited. When I came to the Discussion, you were not here, you were elsewhere getting you muscles relaxed. Do not let me discuss about that matter anymore.

There is Govi Sahana Sarana Service, a toll - free telephone service through which farmers are advised on farming problems. If you dial 1920, you will get the toll-free facility to contact Gannoruwa Agro Technology Park in order to find solutions for your agricultural problems. But, Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara, for your dating this number will not be helpful - hope he did not hear it. Just now I mentioned about the Govi Sahana Sarana Service. Under the Crop Regionalization Programme, farmers are trained and provided with improved varieties of planting material to establish crop zones.Strengthening of small farmer entrepreneurship groups through Gama Naguma programme is done. Workshops for district level officers have been conducted for formulating development plans in selected villages and 390 farmer - groups have already been selected for implementation of such projects. On minimization of losses of post - harvest and agro - processing, 52 training programmes have been conducted in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Ampara, Kalutara, Gampaha, Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, Matale and Hambantota Districts. Though the IPHT is located in Anuradhapura, post - harvest technology programmes have not only been conducted in Anuradhapura but we

also have outreach programmes. We have gone to different districts, remote areas and trained the farmers on post - harvest technology. There is a programme focused on improving productivity and productin through the production and provision of good quality seeds, planting materials, improving farming skills and cultivating all cultivable lands, including the lands owned by the Department of Agriculture. A massive programmes have been implemented under the Agriculture Development Division, such as the Programme for Promotion of Production and Utilization of Organic Fertilizer for which large sums of monies have been allocated and a special unit has been established in the Postgraduate Institute of Agriculture of the University of Peradeniya in order to carry out research and to encourage expansion of organic agriculture, Furthermore, an Organic Standards and Certification programme has been carried out, procurement of micro-water supply systems is in progress, rainwater harvesting tanks have been constructed and sums have been allocated to implement the provisions of Soil Conservation Act and Felling of Trees (Control) Act and Sustainable Water Support management Project by this division. I am just trying to make my speech very brief. , . . . 25 . Under the Crop Forecast programme, a sum of Rs. 4.6 million has been allocated and the expenditure up to end of October is Rs. 2.2 million. Distribution of data collection forms and training programme for 2007/2008 Maha and 2008 Yala has been completed as crop forecasting activities. Coming on to Japanese Assistance, a 2KR Programme, Second Kennedy Round Programme - Second Kennedy Round Programme ? , , , . , . , . , . So many programmes have been implemented under the Planning and Project Division, such as, Dry Zone Livelihood Support and Partnership Programme, Capacity Development for Decentralized Poverty Reduction in Uva Wellassa Dry Zone Programme and we have signed many MoUs, Memorandum of Understandings, with Brazil, Phillippines, and also with China and Chile in order to bring in money to the country to develop agriculture in Sri Lanka. Coming on to the achievements of the Department of Agriculture in 2008, it has released two new varieties of rice, Ld 365, a three and a half-month red short grain

2008 26 1791 1792

variety and At 308, a three-month variety with higher resistance to major pests and diseases. Seven cultivars of salt tolerant rice have also been identified. , . . , . , . . . Development of rice varieties to water stress is in progress, mapping of agro-ecological information of rice growing areas has been completed in Kurunegala and Polonnaruwa Districts, and a soil test kit has been developed for recommendation of fertilizer. , . Development of organic package for rice is being completed, development of improved vegetable and fruit varieties and hybrid seed has been completed. . . . . . . , , . . , , , . , . [Interruption] - That is very welcome. If you want one companion, I would provide one. But if you request me to provide seven, I would do that as well. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) We did not know that you have started a new business ( ) (The Hon Hemakumara Nanayakkara) I learnt this business from you. I do not charge commission. But, Hon. John Amaratunga, I said about a companion. The Hon. John Amaratunga was very clever

in collecting commission from all sorts of nefarious houses in the areas of Hendala, Wattala, and Ja-ela, and was capable enough to visit at three of these places a day. We knew that from the very beginning. Do not get entangled with me. Everyone knows about your business and why you dissolved that special unit of police which was raiding all these bad places. Anyway, let me not get entangled with you. You are my old Friend and I respect you, I say Sir to you, because you are a senior politician in this House. But, when you make statements be careful especially with Hemakumara Nanayakkara who is from Galle, the other side of the Bentota River. [Interruption.] - No, I said about companions, but your vulgar mind went haywire. What can I do? I said about companions, but if your vulgarity is surfacing up, what can I do Hon. John Amaratunga? ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Are you trying to provide seven? ( ) (The Hon Hemakumara Nanayakkara) Seven or maybe more. If you want fourteen or multiplied by some number that you wish to have, that I would do. Let me continue with my speech. Please bear with me. As regards reducing post-harvest losses, training of small-scale entrepreneurs has been done and 860 plastic have been distributed among the farmers in the Vanni area. Let me also tell you about some of the other work that has been carried out by the Department of Export Agriculture. By the Establishment of new plantations, the smallholders have been encouraged; they have been given good seed and planting material for cultivation Under the Productivity Improvement Programme, growers are assisted shade management, soil and water management practices, pruning and filling vacancies; free planting materials are supplied for filling the vacancies. I have been reading about all these things. But, my good Friend, the Hon. John Amaratunga, just heard only one word out of everything that I stated Anyway- [Interruption.] Kandalama is a lovely place. You will not go to Kandalama. You would go to Samara in Wattala. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) It is a respectable place not like Kandalama? ( ) (The Hon Hemakumara Nanayakkara) I know. It is a respectable place which will give you a lot of commissions; which will help you to maintain so many people.

1793 1794

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Why are speaking so angrily about Kandalama? ( ) (The Hon Hemakumara Nanayakkara) No, I am not. Why should I get angry? I go to Kandalama very often. Even after the Budget, I will be going there with my family. But there is a small difference. I go with my family but you go with- ( ) (An hon. Member) Whom?

( ) (The Hon Hemakumara Nanayakkara) Please fill in the blanks as you wish. I do not wish to fill in the blanks. Then I will come to research. Identification of control measures for cardamom thrips problem is the most important achievement during this year. Selection of high-yielding and superior quality pepper varieties - there is a special pepper variety, Hon. John Amaratunga, called Galle Kolu. But do not tell your Leader about this Galle Kolu. There is special pepper variety called, Galle Kolu in Matale but do not mention this to your Leader.

( ) (The Chairman) , .

( ) (The Hon Hemakumara Nanayakkara) , . . The Institute of Post Harvest Technology has done and is doing a lot of work. It has its outreach programmes which are not done only in Anuradhapura but it goes to the different districts and trains the farmers. The Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research and Training Institute does a lot of research work and provides all the information to the different departments and also to the Ministry. The Hadabima Authority of Sri Lanka is doing exemplary work for the farmers as far as wasteland management and watershed management are concerned. The Sri Lanka Council for Agricultural Research Policy (CARP) is giving the right direction of research to all our departments and other related institutions. The

CARP, in other words, or if I may state the entire name, Sri Lanka Council for Agricultural Research Policy, has given the proper research direction to all the research institutions. The Department of Agrarian Development has been doing a lot of work as far as minor irrigation works are concerned. Minor irrigation works have been restored by the Department of Agrarian Development and 711 tanks and anicuts have been repaired covering 25 districts. It is planned to be done in 2009. Construction of fertilizer warehouses will be carried out this year with the money allocated by the Budget. Two thousand two hundred and ninety hectares of new agricultural lands are to be brought under cultivation benefiting 22,000 farmer families. Then, there is going to be cultivation of 7,000 acres of fallow paddy lands extending from Puttalam to Hambantota. Classification of agricultural lands, identification of crop zones based on ecological conditions, classification and surveying of paddy lands, so on and so forth will also be carried out. - Agricultural and Agrarian Insurance Board - - Sri Lanka Freedom from Hunger Campaign Board - , . , . , , . , . . . , . . , .
