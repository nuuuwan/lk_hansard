I will read out the Answer from (a) (ii). Districtwise, the allocations are as follows: (ii) District Year 2007 Year 2008 (Rs.) (Rs.)

Jaffna 159,068,050.00 15,572,437.00 Kilinochchi 146,047,854.05 123,109520.00 Mullaitivu 178,159,904.00 124,119,000.00 Mannar 106,014,736.00 74,067,030.00 Vavuniya 180,370,680.58 162,273,795.00 Trincomalee 58,146,571.00 45,329,792.00 Batticaloa 150,854,297.72 12,578,892.00 Ampara 607,152.00 1,256,916.00 Anuradhapura 17,970,176.88 37,254,884.00 Puttalam 206,083,800.00 179,592,363.00 Polonnaruwa 52,177,355.00 22,566,513.00 * Other Payments 2007 2008 (Rs.) (Rs.) * Shipping Charges 51,722,741.38 - * Levy 512,000.00 - * Clearing Charges 10,000,000.00 - * Printing of Dry 1,400,000.00 - Ration Stamps * Payments to Postal 1,113,680.00 Department Workers * Miscellaneous 131,431,816.00 We are releasing that for miscellaneous expenses to the Jaffna Kachcheri. (iii) These IDPs got displaced due to the violence that erupted in the North and the occupation of the areas by terrorists. (iv) Adefinite date cannot be given. (b) Due to the factors indicated in (a) (iii) above, it will be (i) After ensuring security for resettlement with the clearance of land mines on international rules and regulations. (ii) Resettlement of IDPs was initiated after the areas were liberated from the clutches of the terrorists.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Minister, is the allocation of funds for the IDPs, made on a political basis or a humanitarian basis?

2008 08 3029 3030

( ) (The Hon. Ameer Ali)

No. Actually we have made these allocations via the District Secretaries. When they ask for allocations, we release funds to the relevant District Secretary.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Minister, if you look at the Answer you gave you would see that for 8011 families in the Jaffna District, you have allocated Rs.159 million and for 681 families, in the Puttalam District, you have allocated Rs.206 million.

( ) (The Hon. Ameer Ali)

We allocated Rs.206 million in that case because more than 160,000 permanent refugees are living in the Puttalam District. They were forcibly evicted by the LTTE in those days. We are looking into that problem also. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Do they also not come under IDPs?

( ) (The Hon. Ameer Ali)

No. If you want, we can give the details. There is no problem.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

I need a complete answer to my question. But now that you say so, I will accept that. Now the Eastern Province, you say is a Tiger cleared area. You have a Chief Minister who has been pushed in to that position and you still have internally displaced people there.

( ) (The Hon. Ameer Ali)

I want to tell you this. We have only two locations to resettle people in the Batticaloa District, especially in Chenkaladi and Kiran. In those two areas, the clearing of landmines is still going on. So, after we obtain the international certificate, we have no problem to resettle them. That is the only problem we are facing. We hope that within a couple of weeks we can finalize it.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The other question that arises from the Answer you gave, Hon. Minister, is that with the money that has been allocated-sometime it does not come to even Rs. 100 a day.-whether it is possible for internally displaced people to exist. ( ) (The Hon. Ameer Ali)

That is a good question. We are trying to increase that allocation in future. But, we are also facing financial problems. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Is it the intention of the Government to ensure that they are impoverished and eliminated? ( ) (The Hon. Ameer Ali)

No. Now we have appointed a special committee to look into this as to whether it is enough or not. If it is not, we are going to increase the amount.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Then the other questions is about the internally displaced persons due to the tsunami. But, you do not seem to care about the IDPs in the rest of the country; in Galle, Hambantota, Matara and Kalutara areas. They are still living in makeshift houses under refugee status. But they have not been informed-

( ) (The Hon. Ameer Ali)

In fact, those cases are not directly handled by our Ministry. The District Secretaries are involved in that. Earlier, the IDPs due to the tsunami did not come under our purview. Even but still, we have given allocations to the relevant District Secretaries.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Prime Minister, I have asked that Question from you about the internally displaced people living right round the country. I am informed only of the IDPs living in a certain area of the country. Is it that the internally displaced people in the rest of the country are not being cared about by the Government? There are also about 50,000 tsunami-affected families.

3031 3032

( ) (The Hon. Ameer Ali)

I have given you the Answer. Still we are looking after these IDPs- ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

The Answer to my question does not give details about IDPs in Galle, Hambantota, Matara and Kalutara. They are still in-refugee- ( ) (The Hon. Ameer Ali)

We have given the allocation- ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

No. You did not. The Answer that was given by the Minister does not cover those areas. It only covers Polonnaruwa, Puttalam, Anuradhapura, Batticaloa, Ampara, Trincomalee, Jaffna, Kilinochchi, the Vanni- ( ) (The Hon. Ameer Ali)

Yes. Those displaced due to tsunami do not come under my purview. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

That is what I say. The people affected by the tsunami are also internally displaced persons. I did not ask whether they are war-related IDPs or not. So, my Question was half replied.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena)

The subject of tsunami comes under a totally different Ministry. If you want, you can address another question. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Hon. Minister, I have asked from the Prime Minister about the internally displaced people. I am not bothered about whether-

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena)

Yes. The Hon. Prime Minister has delegated us to answer this Question.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Has he asked you to answer only half of the question?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena)

The subject of tsunami comes under a different category altogether. It comes under a different Ministry. So, if you had asked for a breakdown of the displaced due to the tsunami and others, it would have been better. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Come on, Hon.Minister, I have asked only about the internally displaced people. I am not bothered whether tsunami they are affected people. I am only concerned about the people of this country.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena)

The Hon. Minister very clearly explained that the Government Agents are in charge. The tsunami-affected people are virtually in the Southern Province. The question of tsunami affected people has been solved except for a very small percentage where the housing has become the problem. When the housing schemes are completed, they will get back to those houses. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

But, Hon. Minister, there are 48,000 families, which number is higher than what you have told. The number of internally displaced people, according to the figures in our hands, show that there are 48,000 families in the Southern area. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena)

It is similar to the number of affected families in Slave Island. You were talking about the displaced people in Slave Island. Your number was 700 odd while the actual number was only 280.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

If you go there and say this you will find 853 stones being pelted. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena)

No, this is how you inflate the numbers.

2008 08 3033 3034

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Yes, yes. We inflate, you deflate. But, at the end of the day people suffer. That is all what happens.

[.. 10.22] . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha)

Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my Party, the Tamil National Alliance, I wish to express our condolences on the sudden demise of a Colleague of ours who had been adorning this august Assembly till his last. Mr. Speaker, I very vividly remember the 14th of December last year when the late Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi, in the midst of much pandemonium in the House, continued very courageously with the speech and on concluding his speech, he immediately left the Chamber. I remember that I followed him thereafter and in my speech on the particular day, I took severe exception to the ridicule to which the late Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi was subjected by some Members of the Government when, as a Member of this august Assembly, he was on his feet. Anyway, Sir, this is all part of the political game and I do believe that he too

3075 3076

understood and took it in the right spirit. When I met him subsequently, a few hours thereafter in the lobby, I told him that I defended him in my speech and I still remember the sincere smile that was on the lips of my good Friend, the late Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi, on the day when I told this to him. He was a courageous politician and, Sir, I do believe that one needs much courage today to be a politician in order to speak out against what he feels as wrong irrespective of from whichever quarter that comes. The Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi was of a rare breed. He belonged to - ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . .

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , " () " . , . . Question put, and agreed to. , () .

, , (.) . Whereupon MR. SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. (VEN). UDAWATTE NANDA THERO took the Chair. . ( . ) (The Hon. N. Sri Kantha) Venerable Presiding Member, the late Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi was of a rare breed. He belonged to a different class of politicians. In that he rose in protest against what he perceived as political wrongs, which is nowadays a rare phenomenon to be witnessed in the political arena. I can recall, Venerable Presiding Member, that there were men of that calibre in our country beginning with the late Hon. Solomon West Ridgeway Dias Bandaranaike in 1951 when he chose to cross over from the Government ranks to the Opposition on that historic day. I can recall the late Hon. Edmund Samarakkody who was held in high esteem by my people - the Tamil-speaking people of this country - for the courageous and bold stand he took on the ethnic issue together with certain other matters and certain other issues. He ultimately decided to break ranks with the party with which he was associated for a long time and for the growth of which he sacrificed a lot even experiencing incarceration in British jails during the time when our country was under the subjugation of the British

masters. In that context, I can recall the then Member for Moratuwa, the late Hon. Meryl Fernando, who stood shoulder to shoulder with the late Hon. Edmund Samarakkody. I also recall today the late Hon. C. P. de Silva who, together with some of his Colleagues, decided to rise in revolt against the then Government led by Mrs. Sirimavo Ratwatte Dias Bandaranaike on the historic day, the 1st of December, 1964, which led to the collapse of the Government on the Vote on the Throne Speech by the narrowest margin of one vote. These were men of calibre. If these men wanted to remain where they were, they would have done so. But, they did not because they were men of calibre. The late Hon. Sooriyaarachchi belonged to that calibre. I think his wife and children can be proud of the fact that they owned him; they possessed him and he belonged not only to them, but to all the down-trodden people of this country who wanted justice and who still want justice. In fact, Venerable Presiding Member, it was indeed a difficult decision for the late Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi to have broken ranks with the Party, namely the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, for the welfare of which he did a lot and in consequence of which he had to experience incarceration at the remand prison. Anyway, these are all matters I do believe he would have taken in the right spirit, in that I am sure, that he was able to live up to the ideals he cherished till his last. This august Assembly, our country and more particularly the Tamil people - our people - have lost a very sincere, serious, duty-minded and courageous politician with the demise of my good Friend, the late Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi. This august Assembly, Venerable Presiding Member, has lost some men of calibre, some men of standing, some men who took to politics not as a vocation or as an occupation, but as a means of service to the people of this country, namely the late Hon. Anura Bandaranaike, the late Hon. T. Maheswaran and a few others including my young Friend, the late Hon. Nadarajah Raviraj. Anyway, I do believe that when we all stand up today to remember a young politician who would have gone a long way had Nature been nice and kind to him, we could draw the necessary strength for all of us to stand up against what we really perceive as injustice, discrimination and whatever we feel as fundamentally opposed to the basic rights and welfare of all the people of this country. Thanking you for the opportunity that has been afforded to me to speak on this Vote of Condolence, I once again express the condolences of my Party on behalf of the people we represent, namely the Tamil-speaking people of this country, to the family of the late Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi and wish at least a member from that family would, in the near future, join all of us in order to see that justice and fair play are re-established firmly on our soil. I thank you again, Ven. Presiding Member.

Some people may admire them, some people may adore them and some people may vilify them. When we discuss politics, there are inseparable terms. As I said earlier, they are admiration, adoration and vilification. , ; . . ; . , , , , , .
