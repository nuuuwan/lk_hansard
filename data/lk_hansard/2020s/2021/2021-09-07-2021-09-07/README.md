INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY: STATEMENT

BY MINISTER OF JUSTICE ... ( ) ( ... - ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry - Minister of Justice) 2021.08.17 27(2) . . : .

Hon. Speaker, before I comment on that, let me quote from the famous Judgment of the Supreme Court of India on the case of Union of India Vs. R. Gandhi, which was reported in 2010.

Re: Independence of judiciary

15. Impartiality, independence, fairness and reasonableness in decision making are the hallmarks of Judiciary. If `Impartiality' is the soul of Judiciary, `Independence' is the life blood of Judiciary. Without independence, impartiality cannot thrive. Independence is not the freedom for Judges to do what they like. It is the independence of judicial thought. It is the freedom from interference and pressures which provides the judicial atmosphere where he can work with absolute commitment to the cause of justice and constitutional values. It is also the discipline in life, habits and outlook that enables a Judge to be impartial. Its existence depends however not only on philosophical, ethical or moral aspects but also upon several mundane things -" () ( (.) ) (The Hon. (Ven.) Athuraliye Rathana Thero) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) .

The Chief Justice of India, N.V. Ramana, speaking at a virtual event held to formally launch the live-streaming of proceedings at the Gujarat High Court said, I quote:

A judge must remember, even if justice commands standing up against the popular perception, he must do so out of his commitment to the oath he took under the Constitution. A judge cannot be swayed by popular opinion. Yes, with increased public gaze, he might become a subject of multiple debates that should never deter him from his duty to protect the right of one against the might of many. Always remember, as a repository of peoples faith, a judge cannot afford to lose objectivity.

Similarly, famous former Chief Justice of India, S.H. Kapadia, in dealing with public opinion once said, I quote:

Judiciary should be independent not just from politics but also from public sentiment and judges should deliver justice as per law and not according to the opinion of the majority."

"Apart from independence from politics, judiciary also needs independence from popular interests."

"If an order is not in favour of a particular group then the judge faces backlash."

"An atmosphere is created whereby pressure is exerted on the judge.

This is not something that I say, but the respected former Chief Justice, S.H. Kapadia. He further said, I quote:

Well-founded groups are trying to influence public that the judiciary is not much different from politics.

This is happening even today. Therefore, it is important that we preserve the rule of law.

Again, respected Chief Justice Ramana of India stated recently, in June, that the "emotional pitch of public opinion on social media platforms" should not sway the judges because that is being done deliberately in order to get the judgments that they want. He further stated that judges should not be swayed by the "emotional pitch of public opinion on social media platforms" and that the Judiciary cannot directly or indirectly be controlled by the Legislature or the Executive. He also insisted that media trials cannot be a guiding factor in deciding cases.

PRIVILEGE: FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS PETITION

BY MR. NAGANANDA KODITUWAKKU

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, I think we are already behind time. So, I will just mention the precise matter of Privilege.

Sir, I want to bring up a Question of Privilege because one Mr. Nagananda Kodituwakku has filed a petition against me and the Hon. (Ven.) Athuraliye Rathana Thero. I do not want to go into that case, but in the petition he has filed, he claims that the Fourteenth Amendment was fraudulently brought into the Constitution. He says that what the then Speaker, the Hon. E. L. Senanayake, had signed was not what was passed by Parliament and it is fraudulent. I was a Member of the Cabinet which introduced that Bill. I think some of us were Members of the Select Committee that produced the Report. I have gone through all the Proceedings in Hansard. The Fourteenth Amendment is genuine. It is what was produced and what was passed by Parliament. So, this is a reflection on Parliament that we are acting on a false document and that the then Speaker had never bothered to look into it. The whole institution has been brought into disgrace by this.

Therefore, I have written a letter to you and I would like you to give a Ruling on this because I think it is very important that the position of Parliament and the Fourteenth Amendment is upheld. If we allow this to happen, everyone who has some grudge will come and say, This law was not passed this way and it is some other law, which he cannot do.

The other violation Mr. Kodituwakku has made is - the Proceedings of this Parliament can only be questioned in Parliament - that he has gone outside and raised it and some of the media have supported him.

So, Sir, I want you to go into this and take action to clear the name of Parliament. This cannot go on. If one wants to file action, I do not mind, but he cannot just go and make allegations that Parliament had acted in this manner. So, I just want to bring that to your notice and I have already written to you regarding that. Therefore, I need not table that letter. Sir, do you want me to table it? I can table it, if needed.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) You can table it.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Okay, I will table* it, Sir.

Sir, there is one other issue. : . : . . COVAX .

. Bills 2 1 . . ? 15. it is very important that we raise these issues.

Hon. Speaker, with regard to the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka Bill, the Hon. Minister said that it was our Draft. I appreciate it. It was our Draft by and large, but there have been many revisions made to that Draft which had been proposed and presented to this House some months ago. In fact, we tried to bring that to Parliament, but due to the disaster in October, 2018, that could not be done.

I have several concerns which I need to raise at this point. One, with regard to this particular Draft and two, with regard to the Amendments that have been tabled just a little while ago. Hon. Minister, it is very unfair to us because we have to go through all of this - you know there are about 20 pages of Amendments - and it is not possible for a human being to go through all that in such a short period of time. But, nevertheless, I will raise some of the main issues.

Whether it is the Central Bank or the Securities and Exchange Commission that regulates the market, all small and medium enterprises as well as large companies raise money from the public. The regulator must protect these people and they must be ring-fenced for political interference. So, there is one essential element, Sir, that I want to bring out and I want your complete attention to this, Hon. Minister. That is, why did you dilute or take away - we did not - the prosecutorial discretion of the Securities and Exchange Commission provided for in the existing Act? This Government and the new Commission have transferred that discretion entirely to the Office of the Attorney-General. In which case, why do we have a Commission at the first place? The issue that I am trying to make, Sir, is that the main point or the crux of this Act is the ability to earmark and find people who do wrong things in the capital market. We talk about pump-and-dump; we talk about information being sent on Twitter and by WhatsApp messages. Previously, these were not properly defined. Now, this Bill contains an entire Chapters on that under Part V. I must also give credit to Mr. Ranel Wijesinghe, the Chairman of the SEC at that

time, who took great care and great pains and had multiple consultations in developing this with the entire team. In this Bill, there are two main wrongs defined under Market Misconduct. One is, Prohibited Conduct and the other is, Insider Trading.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) .

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Sir, I will take five additional minutes with the consent of the Chief Opposition Whip.

So, in this case, what we are trying to do is to take action against people who mislead and catch hold of such people specifically for either falsifying information, manipulating the market - "pump-and-dump - or else, for using various mechanisms to falsify the price of a particular stock.

The situation that arises, if this Bill is passed, is that the Commission hereafter does not have the discretion to prosecute. The prosecutorial discretion goes directly to the Attorney-General. I am not saying that the Attorney-General is not apt enough to decide, but I think that discretion should be with the Commission, Hon. Minister. Why are you taking the discretion away from the Commission and giving it to the Attorney-General? Maybe, the Attorney Generals Office is overloaded; there are so many cases that had been filed during the previous administration and we do not know what has happened to those. Therefore, my honest opinion, Sir, is that we should not mess with the existing discretionary power of the Commission.

The other thing, Hon. Minister, is a very important point. I am referring to the Amendments that you are going to bring in to Clauses 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132 and 137, in which have added the word "platform". This always referred to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now, the Amendment to Clause 128 states, "Commission or a platform operated by a recognized market ...". So, I would like to ask the question from you, Hon. Minister, what is this "platform"? I heard Hon. Minister Namal Rajapaksa talking about a platform for cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency in this country is still not legal; there is no legal framework under which it can be traded. So, are we talking about a cryptocurrency platform? Are we talking about a derivative platform or of some other sort of currency board platform? Are you going to take away from the Securities and Exchange Commission the power to regulate these other platforms?

Sir, another very important point that I wish to raise is with regard to the provisions in page 135 of the Bill. Hon. Minister, I would like you to turn to page 135. In page

179 180

135, under Clause 178, there are certain things that the Commission can do, if they find people have committed various offence as construed by this Act against the legality. Clause 178(v)(A) states, I quote:

"impose a moratorium on or prohibit any trading of or any dealing ...."

So, that discretion lies with the independent Commission of ten members. But, what has happened is something unbelievable, Hon. Minister. I do not know whether you approved the Amendment. I do not know whether the Commission approved it. What does the Amendment say? It states, I quote:

"Delete lines 25 to 34 (both inclusive) and substitute the following:-

'(i) to (iv), the Commission may impose a moratorium on or prohibit any trading of or any dealing in, the listed public company's securities or in any other securities which the Commission thinks fit, by the promoter or director or any person connected with the promoter or director."

Sir, we just got this; we got this Amendments about an hour ago. Has the SEC approved this? Has Mr. Viraj Dayaratne, celebrated lawyer, as Chairman of the Commission approved this? You know, Sir, that what is happening on social media is done by various random people. These random people have no connection to the company that they are pumping and dumping. You cannot prosecute the owner of the company. Let us take, for instance, the LOLC, the Ceylon Grain Elevators PLC or the Expolanka Holdings PLC and it is not the owners of those companies who have done that. These are random people who are neither directors of the companies nor connected to those companies by any legal mechanism. So, by removing this, Hon. Minister of Finance, you are actually going to encourage further pumping and dumping done by random people, whose only objective is to pump the stock and dump it on somebody else.

Sir, there is another Amendment to Clause 178 given to us just a little while ago. Hon. Minister, this is not acceptable. Now, let us say someone gets caught for pumping and dumping by using some platform. The Amendment states - I cannot believe this! - I quote:

Any person aggrieved by a decision made under paragraph (ii) of subsection (1) may within fourteen days of receipt of such decision prefer an appeal to the Minister.

Hon. Minister, why should you be the person to judge on that? You are not the Commission. The Commission is an independent body. I am not referring to you, Hon. Basil Rajapaksa; I am referring to you as the Minister of Finance. So, it can be you or somebody else. But, Sir, I do not think that the Minister of Finance should have the final word on whether to prosecute a person who was found guilty by the Commission for insider trading or not.

Then, on the other hand, the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, No. 5 of 2006 will not be removed. Both these Acts are applicable. So, I want to tell the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva that it is always better to give ideas, but it is not good to give false ideas. He was talking to the international community. So, all these news, which was circulating in certain media stations with regard to the economic crisis in Sri Lanka, would have been given by the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva, which, I think, should not be done at a crisis situation, where the entire world is facing a pandemic.

2021 07

[1.42 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for the opportunity to speak a few words on this occasion, particularly when the new Finance Minister is present and attentively listening to all the comments that are being made on the Floor of this House.

Before, I get to the subject matter, I wish to place a request to the Hon. Minister of Finance. There is an urgent need for electric gas chambers for crematoriums in several districts in the North and the East. We have only one in Jaffna, another one in Vavuniya. But other districts do not have; Batticaloa does not have. This request is to the Minister, since he is personally present here. There were several COVID deaths and we were not able to cremate those bodies in time according to COVID-19 rules and that is causing a lot of problems. So, I would appeal to the Minister to make funds available for construction of at least temporary gas chambers in these places. Also, it has been brought to my notice that out of 30 jail guards, who were appointed to the Jaffna Prison, 20 speak only Sinhala, This is an unsatisfactory procedure. I am not very certain about the information. I just got this information and if the information is wrong, please forgive me. But, I would urge the Minister to look into this aspect as well.

Sir, coming to the matter that is before the House, the first observation that I want to make with regard to the Finance Bill that is being debated, is that for the first time in the history of this country, we have tax amnesty being declared through a legislation titled, "Finance Bill". Previously, those Bills said what it was. They were quite open. They said, "Tax Amnesty Bill" or "Inland Revenue (Amendment) Bill" and there were amendments made. But, here some important issues - as to what the objective of this Bill - are being covered up by the Title to the Bill, which is, "Finance Bill."

The second observation is, this amnesty that is being granted is not the first time, not the second time and not the third time. From the 1960s, these amnesties have been granted several times. This matter was discussed at length in the Committee on Public Finance in Parliament and all senior officials - I am sure many of them are here in the Officials Box today - repeatedly said that they concede that you must not do it from time to time: amnesties must never be given from time to time. It must be a one-off and that is it. Because once a country gets used to the fact that after a few years another opportunity will arise for amnesty, that encourages people to make money and not declare it. You might bring them into the tax net. That is the second justification that is made for tax amnesty. But the primary problem that we have in this country is that we do not have a proper mechanism to collect our revenue. That is conceded by everybody. So, without fixing that problem, there is no point in doing this.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, you have two more minutes. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Okay. Then I will get on to the two important issues. One is that in Clause 7 of this Bill, there is secrecy. This is what we pointed out in court as well; where it said "absolute secrecy" and later "official secrecy". Fortunately, in the Supreme Court, the Attorney-General said they will change the wording absolute secrecy to official secrecy. Nevertheless, the concern remains. Once you have this provision, then how that person came by that money - taxable supply - can never be gone into and although the speaker from the Government ranks who just preceded me said that terrorist financing, money laundering, all of that is exempt from this. Yes, it says it is exempt from this; but money earned through those processes can be brought in and you cannot go after that person on that account. All you have to do under Clause 5 is deposit it in an account; you can take it out the next day. The justification is that money is coming into circulation. But it does not prescribe a minimum period for which that money must remain or invest in a property. You can invest in the property and sell it the next day.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, Sir, I am winding up. So, this is not a desirable provision that is being made. The Report of the Presidential Commission on Taxation of 2009 has recommended to the government not to do this as this does not bring in the desired results. The Chairman of that Commission is the present Governor of the Central Bank. So, I urge the Minister to abandon this process, which is called tax amnesty. The Revenue Officers' Trade Unions have publicly said that Rs.300 billion loss will be incurred by the country as a result of this Act and no Government official has still countered that.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Next the Hon. Rohitha Abeygunawardhana. You have 12 minutes.

We were very confident that we could achieve this. Unfortunately, the previous Government failed to take these ideas forward.

We have to ensure that the investors who are coming to this country are able to see our rules, regulations and laws as being on par with the rest of the world. That is most important because that is what the investors are searching for. When they are coming to any country, they want to see that the laws are of a standard, which they are used to in their own countries. They must see that the laws are being implemented by people who have knowledge and who will be able to carry out those functions in such way that they will be able to give confidence, and that is what is most important. When the Hon. (Dr.) Nalaka Godahewa gave those figures today, you already saw what a big difference there was from the time our new Government took office last year. The whole market was able to move forward with confidence and with certainty because they were confident that the Government will back those laws as well as regulations to go forward with certainty. So, that is what was lacking and that is what we need to restore.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Order, please!. The Hon. Speaker will now take the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal) Hon. Speaker, this new law that we have brought forward in Parliament today will provide for the technical aspects of the market as well as the revolutionary new advances that are taking place all over the world to be introduced into our country. The latest developments will be there. We will also be able to ensure that the interest of all stakeholders are safeguarded. There may be a few instances where we need to bring in certain amendments to this Bill and that has been done after consultation with a large number of stakeholders from across the country. They have been able to give us various suggestions as well as certain new ideas that would ensure that this law would be able to be on par with the rest of the world. We are also providing for the central counterparty structures to be introduced and that also will be able to build up confidence in our markets.

Sir, the most important part of a capital market is that the laws, the regulations and the rules that we bring in should be able to stimulate the market and not stifle the market. The laws must be of such nature that when these are being implemented that all stakeholders will be attracted, but at the same time they should realize that if they are to be flouting any of these rules and regulations, that would also be addressed very quickly and in a way that it is very transparent as well. Therefore, I want to commend this new Bill to the entire House and we are hoping that all Members of Parliament who are present here today would vote for the passage of this law, so that we will see unanimity as far as this law is concerned.

Sir, we are also bringing in the Finance Bill which would provide for one per cent of tax to be paid with regard to the monies that have hitherto not been declared. . . . . . returns declare . . declare tax . .

2002 . . . . . We have to ensure that there is an opportunity for those who have not declared those funds to bring them into the system and to ensure that the Government will be able to form one economy instead of having several parallel economies. Sometimes those who

are in this parallel economies need a little bit of an encouragement to come into the main system and that is what we are providing for, and we are confident that that would also be another objective that would be achieved through this Bill. We are expecting at least US Dollars 500 million worth of monies to come in through not only foreign exchange but-

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Order, please! : ?

( ) (Hon. Members) Aye. ( ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal) .

. . . . . -guidance- . The Central Bank has a responsibility to ensure that there is certain guidance provided to the markets, so that the interest rates and the exchange rates are managed in such a way that that would be most beneficial as far as the country and the economy is concerned. It is a very tough task, Hon. Speaker, to decide on exchange rates. We should not permit only a few people, a few stakeholders, to decide as to what the exchange rates of a country should be. Sometimes, people say that it should be decided only by the traders, by those who are importing as well as exporting. That should not be the case. It should be a very carefully planned effort involving those who are borrowing, those who are lending, those who are remitting money, those who are importing, those who are exporting, all of them and the entire gamut of their transactions should be carefully managed in order to ensure that it would be fair by all stakeholders. That is not very easy to do, but you have do that. So, if you are guided only by one or two stakeholders, invariably you will come up with a wrong answer. So, we must also make an appeal to the importers that they should not import everything they want to because they fear that the rupee would depreciate. They should understand that the Government needs to take certain steps in order to ensure that those imports are staggered in such a way that no one amasses too much inventories as that itself would propel the rupee to depreciate further. At the same time, we must advise the exporters that they should also be conscious of the responsibility of converting their dollars when they come

241 242

2021 07

into the country. It should not be a compelling situation. They should be able to convert their foreign exchange into rupees because that is what makes the entire economy run and it is very important for us to recognize that. Sometimes, they may need a little persuasion to do that because in a market where they expect the rupee to depreciate further, there are instances where they would hold on to their dollars, to their foreign exchange expecting to get more as time goes on. That kind of speculation, that kind of expectation can sometimes be quite damaging as far as the economy is concerned. That is why proper guidance is necessary in order to provide for space for all these players to do their businesses as well as to ensure that the countrys economy is also taken forward in a realistic as well as a proper manner. Those are issues that we will have to work on. We have to give the support and I believe all that would assist Sri Lanka in its debt management as well.

We are also facing this situation as a result of International Sovereign Bonds being excessively issued during the period from 2016 to 2019. We do have a little bit of difficulty to manage that. But at the same time, we need to shift some of that. It is a careful shift that we need to do and for that shift to take place, we can take those decisions. We have already embarked on a programme, Sir, where we are hoping to have non-debt inflows introduced into the country. That is very important so that we do not have debt piling up on further debt. We need to ensure that certain other inflows come into the country by way of foreign exchange, which would ensure that Sri Lankas overall economy - the external economy - is managed in a way that would be realistic as well as sustainable. To do that, there would be a need to have more and more Foreign Direct Investment and that is why we have concentrated on that. The Colombo Port City Economic Commission Bill was introduced. We also brought in Pharmaceutical Zones and the Hambantota Industrial Zone. All these are designed to bring in new inflows into the country. Through those new inflows, we will be able to address the debt issue by ensuring that some of the inflows we were having only by way of debt are replaced. When debts are to be settled, those will be settled out of the inflows we will get from non-debt inflows. That is the only sustainable way. We do not need someone from outside to come and tell us how to do that. We have a country which has been independent for 73 years. After 73 years, if we still need someone to hold our hand and tell us what we should do with the economy, then I do not think we have really progressed. We have the ability, we have people who understand these issues and we know how to deal with it and that is what is most critical, Sir.

So, I want to conclude my speech by saying that we have had tense moments at different times. There are tensions. We understand that also. We are not saying that everything is rosy. But at the same time, we have been able to deal with the situation and that is what is most important.

I want to thank the Hon. Minister of Finance for introducing these new laws which will have a great impact on our economy. At the same time, I want to thank

all those Hon. Members who provided us with very interesting and important ideas as well as comments, particularly those who are from the Opposition who gave us so many insights. All that is very helpful. We appreciate that. I also commend this law to be passed with the unanimity that it deserves.

Thank you very much. . . , . , . Question put, and agreed to. Bill accordingly read a Second time. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . . 20 . ; we abstain from voting, Sir.

The entire forest remained so until the

Mahaweli Authority acquired a portion of its land for cultivation in late 2020.

Arrangements had already been made to

declare this forest as a Reserve Forest.

(iv) Not yet abandoned.

(b) (i) Establishment of forest cultivations Extent - 25 hectares. Year of establishment - 2008

According to the schedule prepared by the Mahaweli Authority after using the land for cultivation - 5188.20 hectares.

(ii) Although schedules have been prepared by the Mahaweli Authority after the clearing of lands used for cultivation, the preparation of such schedules has not been finalized as no definite conclusions have yet been reached regarding the boundaries. Therefore, once these issues are resolved, it will be necessary to re-schedule along the clear boundaries and the gazetting of this forest will be delayed until such work is completed.

Accordingly, it is not possible to state a specific date or period of gazetting.

(iii) Work is underway to gazette.
