ANNOUNCEMENTS

CORRECT POSITION IN RESPECT OF LETTER SENT TO ELECTION COMMISSION REGARDING TERMINATION OF

MEMBERSHIP OF HON. RANJAN RAMANAYKE

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I wish to bring to the notice of House the correct position in respect of the letter that was sent by the Secretary-General of Parliament informing the Chairman of the Election Commission that a vacancy has occurred in the Membership of the Ninth Parliament due to the fact that the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake, Member of Parliament for the Electoral District of Gampaha has ceased to be a Member of Parliament in terms of Article 66 (d) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

The Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake was convicted by the Supreme Court on 12th January, 2021 for the offence of contempt of court punishable under Article 105 (3) of the Constitution and was sentenced to a term of four years' rigorous imprisonment. The conviction by the Supreme Court attracted the provisions of the Article 66 (d) of the Constitution which reads that " the seat of a Member shall become vacant if he becomes subject to any disqualification specified in Article 89 or 91".

Article 89 (d) of the Constitution goes onto say that "no person shall be qualified to be an elector at an election of the President, or of the Members of Parliament or to vote at any Referendum, if he is subject to any of the following disqualifications, namely, if he is serving or has during the period of seven years immediately preceding completed serving of a sentence of imprisonment (by whatever name called) for a term not less than six months imposed after conviction by any court for an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term not less than two years or is under sentence of death or is serving or has during the period of seven years immediately preceding completed the serving of a sentence of imprisonment for a term not less than six months awarded in lieu of execution of such sentence: Provided that if any person disqualified under this paragraph is granted a free pardon such disqualification shall cease from the date on which the pardon is granted;"

Accordingly, by operation of law, Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake would cease to be a Member of Parliament from the date the conviction was entered upon by the Supreme Court. However, Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake, through his lawyers, petitioned the Court of Appeal by way of a writ application that by virtue of the conviction he would not lose his seat and requesting the Court to grant a prohibition or an restraining order preventing the Secretary-General of Parliament from informing the Chairman of the Election Commission that a vacancy has arisen in the Ninth Parliament consequent to the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake vacating his seat. The Court of Appeal has not accepted this position and has dismissed the case without issuing any formal notice to the Respondents.

With the dismissal of the writ application before the Court of Appeal, the temporary restraining order issued by the Court of Appeal preventing the Secretary-General of Parliament from informing the Chairman of the Election Commission regarding the vacancy has also ceased to exist.

In the circumstances, once all the above requirements are fulfilled under Article 89 (d) of the Constitution, to quote the very Order of the Court of Appeal in the writ matter in connection with this case, it is stated as follows:

I do agree with the submission of the learned Senior Additional Solicitor General that the act of sending a communication to the Election Commission under Section 64 (1) of the Parliamentary Elections Act would tantamount to a physical act by the 1st Respondent, short of an exercise of power. In other words, with a vacancy staring in his face, the Secretary-General has no option but he is required by law to inform the Election Commission of such vacancy. In doing so, he is carrying out a purely ministerial act. I have already referred to the fact that the exercise of purely a ministerial act is not subject to be quashed by a writ of certiorari nor is such an exercise subject to any restriction by a writ of prohibition. If the Secretary-General fails to act at that stage, a writ of mandamus would lie to compel him to perform his legal duty.

1339 1340

The reason for me to make this Announcement is that yesterday in the House, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition made a statement saying that the Secretary-General of Parliament has taken steps to inform the Chairman of the Election Commission that the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake has vacated his seat due to non-attendance of Parliament for a period of three months and the non-acceptance of his Leave Motion also contributed to this situation. As indicated above, I would like to inform the Leader of the Opposition that this position is not correct and the vacation of seat by a Member of Parliament for non-attendance for three months is envisaged in the Constitution in Article 66(f), whereas the letter sent by the Secretary-General is under Article 66(d), the content of which has been explained above.

I wish to bring this matter to the notice of the House to provide greater clarity on this issue.

I am also very sorry to state that the behaviour of some of the Members yesterday was unwarranted and baseless. Therefore, I expect all Members of this House will behave a little more responsibly with a more decent attitude towards upholding the decorum of this House.

Thank you very much.

, . [ ] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa -Leader of the Opposition) - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) , . ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Sir, since you mentioned my name, may I mention to you that I do agree that there was a misquotation on my part and I do express my regret for that misquotation.

However, Sir, it is decent for this House to recognize the fact that the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake has recourse to appeal the decision of the Court of Appeal. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) He has, at this present moment, embarked on a course of appealing the decision of the Court of Appeal. He will be challenging the decision of the Court of Appeal in the Supreme Court. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) So, I respectfully request the Hon. Speaker to give the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake his due right of contesting the decision given by the Court of Appeal. - [Interruption.] Let me bring to your attention the fact that the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake filed a case in the Court of Appeal with regard to his Membership of Parliament. I do agree that the Court of Appeal has given a decision contrary to the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayakes contention. But, Sir, the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake has every right to appeal the decision of the Court of Appeal. Up until the appeal process commences and an ultimate final verdict is provided by the Supreme Court, it is the decent thing, the right thing and it is the convention for this House to ensure that he remains a Member of Parliament. Therefore, I want to ask you why you all are in a hurry to send out this letter because when we proposed to move a Motion for Leave of Absence, you all were very quick to point out the fact that there was a court case going on and that the Motion for Leave of Absence would be denied on that basis.

Hon. Speaker, unfortunately, with great regret I have to tell you that there seems to be a conspiracy to deprive the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake of his Membership. You remember that he became a Member of Parliament through the franchise exercised by the people of the Gampaha District and by your action and by the action of the Secretary-General of Parliament, you are depriving the sovereign right of the voters of the Gampaha District. The Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake has every right to appeal the decision of the Court of Appeal. What will happen if the Supreme Court decides that his Membership is to remain and that he is a valid Member of Parliament? Are you going to reverse the process? So, let me very respectfully request the Hon. Speaker, please provide the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake with his rightful right to contest the decision of the Court of Appeal, which is based on the validity of his being a Member. He has 42 days to appeal and he has begun the process of formulating his appeal to the Supreme Court. Why were you in a hurry to send this letter to the Chairman of the Election Commission and expedite it? Please give him his right to appeal. That is a human right; that is a civic right; that is a right of a citizen of the country and of a Member of Parliament who was elected by the citizens of the country. That is his right. Unfortunately, the majority of my Friends on the opposite side of the aisle do not have the literacy levels to understand my argument. I am sorry about that. Maybe, you should conduct some classes to enhance their literacy levels and their education levels. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you, Hon Leader of the Opposition. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Sir, in the name of natural justice, in the name of the protection that is granted to citizens of the country through the Constitution, he must be allowed to do that. Are you going say that Ranjan Ramanayake is not a citizen? No, he is a citizen. He is bestowed with the civic rights, the human rights, the political rights and we have to protect those rights. So, please do not be in a hurry to send off letters because there seems to be a coup or conspiracy on the side of the Government and unfortunately, you seem to be involved in that conspiracy.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) No. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Do not deny the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake his civic rights, his political rights; do not deprive him of his Membership of Parliament. Allow him to appeal. I want to tell you, if the Supreme Court so decides, either way, we are willing to accept it. But, you are denying his opportunity, his right to appeal. So, do not embark on that course of action. It is illegal; it is unlawful; it is unconstitutional and it is not right for a Speaker of this noble Parliament to embark on a ghastly course of action.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Right, let me explain myself. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) So, I once again appeal to those Friends who do not have the literacy levels to understand my contention.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Let me explain myself. Now, you have expressed your ideas. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) They are absolute fools! [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) That has nothing to do with this. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) They are ignorant people. - [Interruption.] They do not have the literacy levels to understand what I am saying, but I hope, Sir, that you have adequate literacy to understand my contention. Please allow Ranjan Ramanayake his right of appeal.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Let me explain myself. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Please protect his human rights, protect his civic rights and protect his rights as a politician and as a citizen of the country.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Right. Now that you conveyed your idea, let me explain myself. Throughout your speech, your request has been baseless because the Secretary-General of Parliament has acted according to the Judgment that has been given and upon the Constitution, which is supposed to be a ministerial duty that no person can quash or question about; he has to do it. Otherwise, he will be the victim of the law. - [Interruption.]

The Hon. Ranjan Ramanayakes right of appeal is still lying against the Election Commission. Without wasting time here arguing on that, now you had better go and get an injunction order against the Election Commission. That is possible; it is open.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. Speaker, please allow me just one or two minutes to respond to your contention. It is all okay for a Member who has been convicted of murder to come into Parliament and I do agree that the respective Member has the right of appeal.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes . ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) So, that right given to that particular Member is not given to the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake. - [Interruption.] The Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake also has the right of appeal. You are saying that my argument is baseless. If your decision is so politicized, if you are so interested in supporting the agenda of the Government, of course, you can say it is baseless. It is not baseless, Hon. Speaker. - [Interruption.]

1343 1344

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) That is also a wrong conception you are trying to give. You are trying to give a wrong conception to the country. The Hon. Premalal Jayasekara has appealed to Court and we did not bring him to Parliament immediately after the Election. We brought him to Parliament only after he had made his appeal and under the Bail Act, he became a remand prisoner. Then only we brought him to Parliament. That right is still available to the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake. So, let him go to Court and get it cleared. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. Speaker, just now from the Chair, you accepted that the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake has the right of appeal.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes. He can appeal. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Why are you trying to deprive him of his Membership, if you accept that he has the right of appeal? Hon. Speaker, you are denying him his human right; you are denying him his political right.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) No, that is totally a wrong conception. Do not mislead the country. Thank you. Let us finish this. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Premalal Jayasekara) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena - Minister of Foreign and the Leader of the House of Parliament) Hon. Speaker, we have listened to this argument raised by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition for so many days. He seems to be repeating the same words on this issue of the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake, on whom an Order was given by the Supreme Court and as a result of which his Membership of Parliament has been vacated in accordance with the Constitution. This is not the plight of only the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake. I would like to remind the House that the former Ministers, the late Hon.

Lalith Athulathmudali and the late Hon. Gamini Dissanayake also lost their Memberships of Parliament as a result of a Supreme Court Order. The late Hon. G. M. Premachandra from Kurunegala lost his Membership of Parliament as a result of defying the decision of the United National Party. I mean, there were so many Hon. Members in the past who had lost their Membership of Parliament as a result of Orders by courts, which had been reported to Parliament and thereafter, reported to the Commissioner of Elections and vacancies had been created. I remember that the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senarathne also lost his seat but he was brought back to Parliament.

( ) (The Hon. Nalin Bandara Jayamaha) , . . . [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) . . , . . Our feelings and emotions are another matter. What is being canvassed today has been taken up for the seventh or the eighth time.

I am sorry to say that the late Hon. O.S.M. Perera, who walked into Parliament as the Member for Bulathsinhala, was prevented at the gate because the Secretary-General had already been given the letters of resignation collected from the UNP Members by the late President J.R. Jayewardene and then the Hon. Ronnie de Mel was appointed. The Member was walking in, but he was deprived of coming into the Chamber. Let us not forget those instances.

Our emotions are different, but we have to respect the Constitution. I would like to mention to the young Leader of the Opposition that that is how the Parliamentary practice and procedure and the respect to the Constitution had been. A majority of those Members were elected and some of them were on National List. Every district had elected Members of Parliament with the peoples mandate. But the peoples mandate is subject to certain provisions of the Constitution and the Judiciary. I just wanted to keep the House informed of those past incidents because all this while, attention has been drawn only to one Member. No, there are others who had suffered. But, the law has to proceed, Hon. Speaker.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Sir, -

1345 1346

2021 08

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition? ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Sir, I would respectfully request that you instruct the people who control the mikes and the television not to obstruct my speech, please.

Sir, my Honourable Friend Dinesh Gunawardena has basically carved out an argument citing precedents, which exhibits the keenness that the Members of the Government Benches have in getting rid of the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake from this Parliament. There is a conspiracy - [Interruption.] There is a conspiracy within this august Assembly with the participation of yourself, unfortunately, Hon. Speaker and the relevant officials and the governing Members of Parliament to get rid of the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake. - [Interruption.] So, why are you in a mighty hurry when the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake has a right of appeal? Remember that the case in Court of Appeal was based on his Membership, his being a Member of Parliament. He got a contrary decision, I agree. But now, he has the opportunity of challenging it. You have allowed a convicted murderer

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

to attend Parliament. Of course, we all agree that he has a right to appeal. You have recognized his right to appeal. But,you cannot recognize the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayakes right to appeal. Why are you treating two people in two different ways? You have to follow a uniform path; you have to follow a consistent path.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I think I answered your argument just now. So, it is pointless wasting time on this. If any other Member has to say anything, let him raise it.

( ) (The Hon. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

"Public Security Minister, Rear Admiral (retd.) Sarath Weerasekera, would have the public believe that the Easter Sunday terror mastermind has been identified.

How can the government say with certainty that Naufer masterminded the terror attacks?"

"The Island" . The Editorial further states, I quote;

"Is it that Naufer has sought to put investigators off the scent by claiming to be the mastermind so that the real mastermind/s will be safe?"

, "The Island" . . It goes on to state, I quote;

"The PCoI report (page 218) quotes the then State Intelligence Service Director SDIG Nilantha Jayawardena as having said that.... "

Sir, I am replacing the name of the country mentioned there with the word "a foreigner" and read it as " 'a foreigner' named Abu Hind may have triggered the

attacks". The Editorial then goes on to state, I quote;

"It then quotes an international expert on terrorism: According to his [the experts] testimony, Abu Hind was a character created by a section of a provincial Indian intelligence apparatus. Zahran believed Abu Hind was the Islamic State regional representative. Abu Hind was in touch with both Zahran and his brother Rilwan and had spoken to Naufer. This part of evidence is confirmed by Hadiya [Zahrans wife].

The PCoI however, .........recommended that 'certain identified parties' be further investigated. "

"The Island" :

" Has any such investigation been conducted?"

"They may not have made irresponsible statements before the PCoI. So, the need for a thorough probe into the NTJs foreign links to find out whether there was an external hand in the Easter Sunday attacks cannot be overemphasied."

Export Agriculture Crop New Planting Promotion Programme

The plants required for new planting in the lands suitable for cultivation of those crops in the main districts where the export agriculture crops are grown in the island are provided to the farmers on a 100 per cent concessionary basis (free of charge) and necessary technical advices and trainings are provided free of charge. Under this programme, about 1,500 hectares of new planting is undertaken annually.

Productivity Enhancement Programme for Export Agriculture Crops

The plants required for infilling are distributed free of charge in order to enhance the productivity of low-yielding export agriculture crop lands and financial assistance is also provided for agronomic practices. Further, micro-irrigation units for irrigation are provided on a concessionary basis and the technical advices and trainings required to enhance the productivity are provided free of charge.

Nursery Development

The plants required for the above programmes are produced by the Department as well as about 850 private plant suppliers. This has provided self-employment avenues to a large number of people and the opportunity to supply high quality plants to the farmers.

Organic Village Programme

The global demand for organic products is increasing and the demand for organic export agriculture crops is increasing rapidly. In order to meet this requirement, the Department of Export Agriculture is implementing a project to establish organic villages, which will provide technical knowledge and training required to convert the normal cultivations into organic farming, assist the farmers in obtaining organic certificates and create market opportunities. In addition, financial assistance is also provided to the farmers for the conversion period from normal cultivations to organic farming.

Improving the Quality of Export Agriculture Products (GAP, GMP Certification)

Improving the quality of export agriculture products has facilitated the farmers to purchase modern equipment for harvesting and processing of export agriculture crops as well as the quality nurseries. The Department of Export Agriculture has taken steps to provide farmers and manufacturers with the portion of the money spent on obtaining certificates on Good Manufacturing Practices required to upgrade special processing centres and develop products in accordance with the national standard. As well, the Department of Export Agriculture has already launched the Good Agricultural Practices Certification Programme.

Knowledge and Training Programme

A large number of training programmes are conducted by the field officers to impart the modern knowledge to the growers of export agriculture crops in the areas such as cultivation, disease control and product processing.
