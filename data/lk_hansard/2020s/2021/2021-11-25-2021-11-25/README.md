. . 1952 - , . "The Significance of the Ceylon-China Trade Agreement of 1952" "Opposition to the Agreement" :

"The Agreement was negotiated in the teeth of opposition from some of his own colleagues in the cabinet. Opposition also came from R. G. Senanayakes predecessor in the ministerial post, from the American government, and from some of the local newspapers which carried on a virulent press campaign against any dealings with Communist China.

Prime Minister, Dudley Senanayake, however, fully backed his Minister of Commerce and was prepared to pay this price; he realized that the benefits to Sri Lanka from the agreement far outweighed losses consequent to the cutting-off of American aid.

It is a tribute to the two Senanayakes that they displayed remarkable pragmatism and courage in negotiating the Trade Agreement. They did not allow their prejudices or ideological considerations to stand in the way of deciding what was in the best interests of the Country; nor were they intimidated by threats of big powers."

Sir, today is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. The UN Human Rights Council has passed a stricture on us saying that we are looking the other way when it comes to harassment of women. So, the next time when you go for its session, you will have to face the added problem of what happened in Parliament. You will have to have an answer for that. Here in Parliament, a female Member of Parliament was insulted and what is the Order given? The Hon. Member who insulted her was not punished; he did not say sorry but he was just reprimanded. But, that is not enough. What we need is a punishment for him.

The Samagi Jana Balawegaya's womens front lead by Mrs. Jalani Premadasa is organizing a series of events on Friday to show their disapproval of what happened in Parliament. It is called - .

But, as I said earlier, international diplomacy is not done by individuals. It is by our adherence to international policies and law. You may be the most eminent scholar, but if you do not adhere to the Resolutions of the UN Human Rights Council and the UN treaties which we have signed, you will not have any redress. Therefore, I urge you to go prepared to the UN Human Rights Council with the right answers because the information I get is that this time, they are not going to just pass Resolutions and wait because they did that three times. In 2012, 2013 and in 2014, they passed Resolutions and that was all. But this time, they are not going to wait and give you time; they will decide on something more concrete.

Hon. Chairman, now we are in a tight financial situation. For the last so many days, we have been asking the Government to give solutions to two problems. We have a dollar crisis. How are you going to solve that dollar crisis? How are you going to pay your debts - US Dollars 6.5 million - in the coming year? We have not got an answer.

The Foreign Ministry needs to seek a more proactive engagement with the civil society in Sri Lanka because the civil society has become a major political opinion-maker as well as an active political analyst, to whom we have to listen and then formulate our answers to some of the accusations, if not suggestions that are made in the international arena.

It is also important for us to listen to the grassroots. What do they think about foreign affairs? Of course, foreign affairs is always an elite subject; it is a government-to-government subject. But, I think modern participatory democracy demands that the peripheral people also get to know what the Foreign Ministrys policies and programmes are. , 2022

Sir, last but not least, the role of the Foreign Ministry in reconciliation and peacebuilding in this country is absolutely of undeniable importance. We are just reacting to Geneva reports. But, Hon. Minister and State Minister, Geneva is not our concern; it is our people who are important to us. Therefore, while addressing post-war demands and answering some of those unanswered questions, I hope the Foreign Ministry and its officials will also take significant steps with regard to the institutions such as OR, OMP, ONUR and the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, please. You have 14 minutes.

[1.00 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Deputy Chairman, since today's newspapers mention about one of our distinguished former Foreign Ministers, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, that his ashes are to be displayed and kept at the Jayarathna Palour today for people to pay their last respects, may I, at the very outset, say that he was one of the most distinguished Foreign Ministers of this country. He had held many other portfolios, but his vision for this country and his commitment to a liberal Sri Lanka is something that is unparalleled. We find today a tribute to him in many newspapers from a person no less than Samantha Power, former Permanent Representative to the United Nations during the Obama administration, who had been one of his very close friends. He had cultivated friendships across the world with many such leaders and such friendships had benefitted this country. I do not deny that the current Foreign Minister too has such friendships starting from his days in Oxford and we are quite pleased that the Hon. Minister has once again been appointed to head this Ministry.

437 438

2021 25

However, I must say that the conduct of diplomatic relations during the past two years of this regime when it comes to important trade partnerships and bilateral relations with so many countries and influential blocs has not only been unimaginative and uninspiring, but also there has been an apparent lack of any coherent strategy. For instance, let us look at the role or our attitude towards the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. I know that the Hon. Minister had a meeting with the former Secretary-General of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Dr. Yousef Al-Othaimeen, at the OIC Mission in New York when he went to attend the United Nations and I am sure he had a very fruitful dialogue with him. It is also my humble wish to congratulate the current Secretary-General of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Mr. Hissein Brahim Taha, senior Diplomat from Chad, who has now taken over his duties from the 17th of November, a few days ago. The relationship with the Organization of Islamic Cooperation is very vital to our country and we should not forget that this is a bloc which consists of almost 54 countries which have an absolute majority of Muslims and an important bloc with whom we have had a very good relationship, particularly before the war and after the war. I am talking about the period before 2009 and after 2009. When our country faced many challenges in the international fora, at the UN Human Rights Council and in many other fora, a vast majority or a preponderant majority of those countries, at the behest of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, had been standing by us. But, how are we treating them? Our relationship with the Organization of Islamic Cooperation bars the few on and off, off and on meetings with the Secretary-General. We do not have a sustained relationship, a continuous cultivation of friendship and a way in which we have a strategy to handle the sentiments of the countries of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and their approach to diplomacy. We have reaped a lot of benefits by their benevolence towards us. But, what have we done? Our approach has been almost needs-based, mostly transactional and very ad hoc.

That is how we can explain the conduct of the Foreign Policy of this regime. Of course, the Hon. Minister took over the Ministry only a month or two ago. But, it had been so, I am saying, for the reason that in certain matters, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation has been very forthright in commenting. For instance, it states, OIC - IPHRC categorically condemns Sri Lankas enactment of discriminatory laws under the pretext of deradicalization and counter terrorism prompting arbitrary arrests, torture and banning of burqa as tantamount to grave deprivations of human rights of Muslim minorities and violative of Sri Lankas international human rights obligations. That was pointed out by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.

Not only that, during the COVID pandemic, we observed the horrific and horrifying experience that the Muslims of this country went through. All the member countries of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and all their resident Ambassadors got together and wrote to His Excellency the President, asking him to desist from the practice of cremating the Muslim janazahs. That request was totally ignored; there was not even a courtesy

of reply. I questioned from the former Minister, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, on the Floor of this House as to what response the Government was going to give us. He was stoically silent. I am sure his hands too were tied because that was totally the responsibility of the entire Government; the President downwards had to take a collective decision. Then, what happened? Even when the Prime Minister announced it in the House, it was overturned; it had not been implemented even thereafter. Continuously, we had been traumatized with the forcible cremation policy of the Government. What happened was, the demonization of Muslims became the new normal during the COVID pandemic and that is what we perceived it to be and that is a particular matter which hurts the sentiments of the Muslims so much. Finally, what did you do? You, for a transactional purpose, withdrew that regulation. It was a transactional one because you wanted the votes at the UN Human Rights Council. Finally, when the Prime Minister of Pakistan came here - actually Pakistan stood by this Government throughout in all these matters - and made a request, you just could not say no because he told you what was going to happen. What, in fact, happened was, except for four countries - two in our neighbourhood, Bangladesh and Pakistan, and I believe Somalia and some other Muslim country of the former Soviet Republic - which voted with you, most of them abstained because they just could not vote with the Government on that issue whereas they stood by you throughout. This is why I say that our diplomatic relations have been transactional. We have been ad hoc; we have not looked at the sentiments with much more sensitivity and conducted our foreign relations.

Now, take, for instance, what is happening with the European Union bloc? All of us know that 30 per cent of our exports go to the countries in the European Union. We enjoy the GSP Plus concessionary tariff scheme, which is very advantageous for our apparels, processed food, sea food, toy products, porcelain and such items. Thirty per cent of our entire exports is a very large amount and that can be seriously impacted if we do not comply with the requirements of the European Union when it comes to the conditions that they impose. What is more intriguing to me is the attitude of our Mission in Brussels. Our Mission in Brussels, when a Resolution was tabled against a country like the Philippines in the European Parliament, followed it very carefully and saw what was going to happen. All of us know that Dutertes regime is also accused of summary executions, impunity and extra judicial killings. All those issues also impacted on that Resolution being passed against the Philippines and our Mission observed that.

They failed to understand that we would be the next and could not even foretell what was coming. They finally found it on the website when the European Parliament passed a very damaging indictment on us with the Resolution against Sri Lanka and that paved the way for this situation. Finally, a European Union mission came to our country a few months ago and I am sure their reports will be out by the end of this year. We will have to be careful because we do not have a proper way of continuous engagement with the European Commission.

439 440

So, we need to engage with the European Commission to see that all these allegations would be dealt with sufficiently.

Then, let us take the reform of the Prevention of Terrorism Act. The way in which impunity has pervaded this countrys law enforcement is a very serious matter. Custodial deaths are so apparent for all of us to see. Every now and then, we hear about people hanging themselves in the prison cells and also find stories about so-called suspects jumping out of the police van with their handcuffs on and being shot to death. All these are very apparent for everybody to see. These types of custodial deaths have become almost, using the pandemic parlance, a "new normal" again in this country.

The COVID pandemic itself had been weaponized in a manner to portray as if one community were the spreaders of it and that was the attitude of the media and the Government towards them for several months until the withdrawal of forcible cremation after the need for transactional diplomacy was felt. Therefore, these are issues for which we are paying a very heavy price.

I will now deal with the issue of the Gazette relating to deradicalization, which lacks any judicial supervision. You do not allow the Attorney-Generals Department to decide who should be deradicalized. There are innocent young people being incarcerated for very spurious reasons and also people are being incarcerated for a variety of other reasons. The case of Hejaaz Hizbullah is a case in point. The European Parliament, in their Resolution, has mentioned that; a very serious mention has also been made even by the High Commissioner for Human Rights in her Report to the Human Rights Council. Then, there was the incarceration of a young poet called Ahnaf. So, there had been such cases which had found mention in those Reports and all of which cannot be ignored continuously. They have finally found a way to file an indictment against Mr. Hejaaz Hizbullah in the High Court of Puttalam under the ICCPR Act. The case is pending. I know the matter very well, but the issue is, I dare say, that there had been compulsion against witnesses. They have been forced to make confessions in order to implicate this young lawyer, who had been a former member of the Attorney-Generals Department and the Attorney-Generals Department has filed an indictment which I do not think will stand the scrutiny in a court of law. So, these are issues which are going to affect our credibility in the international fora, particularly when concerns have been expressed by well-meaning friends of ours who had been standing by us all throughout our difficult period and we have continuously seen to it that we ignore them all the time.

Then, I must move on to some of the issues pertaining to the frustration of the officials of our Foreign Diplomatic Service.

I do not know how the affairs are being conducted. I am told that one senior official in the Ministry has gone to the extent of humiliating the members of the Diplomatic

Service. There is so much of frustration among them. It is said that at a staff meeting at the beginning of this year, this particular official had said that brilliance is his enemy - he has openly said that - and loyalty is the friend. He later circulated his comment in writing which stressed, "One ounce of loyalty is more important than 1,000 ounces of brilliance". What type of nonsense is this? He sends a written circular to the members of the Foreign Service serving in the Ministry saying such things! This is nothing but regimentation; again, militarization of the Foreign Ministry, which is a very serious matter.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Okay, Sir.

With those comments, Sir, I think the Hon. Minister will have to make a very close scrutiny of the way in which these matters are being conducted by the officials in the Ministry and this frustration of the senior diplomats will have to be addressed in earnest. Our former Foreign Ministers like the late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar, the late Hon. Mangala Samaraweera and many of his predecessors had always been very respectful. This type of repressive behaviour and insult that these officials have to suffer have resulted in many of our senior Foreign Service officials being thoroughly frustrated and that is going to impact on the countrys foreign relations ultimately. With those comments, I conclude, Sir.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) The next speaker is the Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa. You have seven minutes.

443 444

[1.24 p.m.]

( () () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Chairman, for giving me time to speak on the Votes of two critically important Ministries that we are debating today: the Ministry of Mass Media as well as the Foreign Ministry.

Let me first speak a few words about certain proposed initiatives by the Government with regard to media regulation, which is being discussed today. As you know, last year also we spoke that there was an attempt to bring in some form of media regulation, but the Hon. Minister assured us at that point that that would not take place without appropriate consultation. However, we again note that, according to media reports, there is a proposed Obscene Publications Bill, which has to be approved by Parliament.

Once again, that too has really not been discussed sufficiently with the stakeholders. We know that in the context where there is a heightened sense of nationalism and majoritarianism, even laws that may be drafted with good intentions can be interpreted and applied in ways that affect those who exercise their right to freedom of expression. So, this is of special concern particularly for artistes and those who have critical perspectives, who, even now, are being unjustly targeted very often under the guise of obscenity. So, I think this is something that we need to be very cautious about, precisely because of the way in which laws of this nature are often used to target those who are critical of the Government in power.

Cabinet approval has also been granted to appoint a committee for the amendment of the existing laws applicable to journalists and media institutions and for the preparation of policies and ethics. That is a good thing because we know that there is a huge need to professionalize the media industry so that there is a proper career path and career opportunities for those who engage in this sector. However, once again questions are being raised as to the consultative nature of these initiatives and the important factor here is that the consultations should actually be taking place at the time of drafting these various amendments rather than drafting various regulations and then submitting them simply for some cosmetic kind of consultative process.

Sir, as you know, this is what is happening also with regard to the new Constitution that is being proposed. A Committee has been appointed. The views of the public have still not been taken into account and will only be taken into account once we see the draft. But, I think the consultative process should be integrated into the entire formulation strategy. Similarly, there are fears that with regard to the policies which are being proposed for the media, the consultative process is inadequate. There are also questions as to who will actually be part of this entire committee which is tasked with bringing in the proposed reforms.

As you know, we have not been able to have a great reputation when it comes to democratic freedoms with regard to journalism and even recently, the Reporters Without Borders have noticed that press freedom in this country is on the decline, especially with the targeting of reporters who are considered to be critical of the Government in power. So, I think we need to be aware of the kind of international attention that is being mobilized due to these kinds of actions by the Government because it has a negative impact on the reputation of the country and our international standing, which actually brings me to the second issue that I want to talk about, our international relations or foreign relations.

Sir, I think it is imperative to acknowledge the fact that unless the international community has some kind of confidence in the Sri Lankan Government at a time when we are facing economic challenges and so many other challenges on so many different fronts, it is going to be extremely difficult for us to obtain the kind of support necessary for us to overcome them.

I am sure the Hon. Minister, who has a lot of experience in this area, is well aware of the fact that the international community is monitoring us very carefully and is not just going to take the Government's perspective into account when they make their judgements on us. Domestic policies of the Government are carefully observed; how they treat the Opposition and those who are critical of the Government is slso carefully observed. In this sense, we also need to recognize the fact that those who engage with the international community expressing their views cannot be regarded, in some way, as traitors of the country or those who go against the country, as it often happens. They are often portrayed as unpatriotic. So, I think we really need to look at these categories before we divide our communities as patriotic and unpatriotic simply on the basis of whether they are supporting the Government in power or not.

Also, we have to recognize the fact that this Governments reputation for indecisiveness, constant reversals and revisions of policy is also not doing the country any favours. This sort of indecisive nature of the Government, which is being observed, also has huge impact on building confidence in the Government and its stability. I think these are issues which are having negative repercussions on us in the international arena.

For example, it is with regret that we note that our Permanent Representative to the UN in New York failed to secure a place recently at the International Law Commission. Thirty four individuals recognized for their expertise and qualifications in international law were elected to this Commission and our Representative, who also contested, was not elected. That is something that we need to take seriously because our Permanent Representative to the UN in New York is a former Attorney-General and also served as a Chief Justice. If this is the international view or the perspective on a former Attorney-General and Chief Justice of our

445 446

2021 25

country, that he does not have the adequate qualifications to be in the International Law Commission, that is something that we need to consider very seriously. Our Hon. Minister of Foreign is a renowned legal scholar and yet, our Representative to the UN fails to get elected to that rather important Commission. Also, this particular individual, as you know, recently gained a really bad record especially with the way he talked about the disappearance cases, particularly of that which related to Prageeth Ekneligoda, where he openly mentioned in an international forum that Prageeth Ekneligoda is alive and is living in a foreign country. When he was asked for the whereabouts of Prageeth Ekneligoda and to name the country in which he is to be found, his answer was God only knows. This kind of action really does not help in any way in building our reputation or painting a good picture of our judicial system, the independence of our Judiciary or our respect for human rights. There were two other recent incidents, which can only be described as snobs to the Sri Lankan Government where the UK has reported in their Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy - 2020, which was published recently, that democracy is on the decline in Sri Lanka. Also, the US recently did not invite us for an important conference on democracy, which is again questionable as to why they decided to leave us out.

So, they are indications that, internationally, our reputation is being damaged. I think this affects not just this Government, but the entire country as a whole and it is something that we need to address.

Finally, I just want to end on a much more practical note, that several people have been reporting inordinate delays when trying to access the Ministry with regard to obtaining documents which are necessary for their foreign travels and that they are being inconvenienced greatly because there is no proper system to do that. I think there is a lot of red tape and no real information as to how people can obtain these kinds of documents which are necessary when they travel abroad. So, I request the Hon. Minister to please look into this because it is something that requires a very simple intervention to ensure that people are treated with dignity when they go to the Ministry, they are given the correct information and they are able to get whatever documents they need as painlessly as possible. The current sense is that the Ministry is not dealing with this very efficiently.

Once again, I urge this Government to consider the consequences of their actions locally on our international reputation and on the stability that we need to maintain at a time when we are facing so many challenges in so many different fronts.

Thank you very much for the time given, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Next, the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam. You have 14 minutes.

[1.37 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Deputy Chairman, I must say that I wish to make a few comments on the Votes of the Ministry of Foreign. But, before that, since the Hon. Dullas Alahapperuma is present, I would like to raise one matter.

Hon. Minister, at the Consultative Committee Meetings, my Colleague, the Hon. Selvarajah Kajendren, raised the issue of the Point Pedro Post Office, which has about 60 perches or six parappu - 10 perches are called parappu in Jaffna - of which the Army has taken into forcible custody four parappu, which is almost 40 perches and only the remaining 20 perches, they are willing to release to the post office. That was a privately-owned land which was gifted to the post office and the post office requires the entire 60 perches. They have made representations directly to the Ministry, to your predecessor, but to date, there has not been any action taken in that regard. Therefore, I would ask for your personal intervention to get it released because it is for a good purpose. So, you must intervene and get that released, Hon. Minister. - [Interruption[ Thank you.

With regard to foreign affairs, Sir, they say the tragedy - they say it is a tragedy - is that foreign affairs is an extension of the domestic policy. In Sri Lankas case, that is very true. Sri Lanka, unfortunately, regardless of whichever party that came into power, has had a foremost policy of pursuing a Sinhala-Buddhist identity, that it is only the Sinhala-Buddhists who can be the custodians of the Sri Lankan State. Because they have had that outlook from the very inception - in fact, even before the Independence, I would say - when the British departed, Sri Lanka took steps very quickly to implement this notion of a Sinhala-Buddhist State and as a result, created enemies within. Tamils were the primary target. Today, of course, also the Muslims and the Christians are being targeted. So, it is one monolithic identity that the State, regardless of whichever party that came into power, wanted and that has been the policy. So, the tragedy has been that that has been the policy. Obviously, when you want to pursue that sort of policy, when you have a population in this country which is Tamil and which has strong similarities with India's South, Tamil Nadu, then Sri Lanka naturally has to be concerned about India because there is only so much that the people of Tamil Nadu will allow and they will start pressurizing India.

So, in the course of that, what has happened over time is that Sri Lanka, from the very early stages of Independence, looked upon India as a potential enemy and has always pursued policies to contain Indias influence and leverage over Sri Lanka, and that has been a policy which has been pursued by every single Government that has come into power to date. That is the truth.

In the course of that process, if you look at the 80s, you had President J.R. Jayewardene looking at the Cold

447 448

War scenario, warming up to the United States. At that time, everyone knows, in the Cold War context, India had far warmer relations with the Soviet Union and we had Sri Lanka pandering to the United States, willing to invite the United States into Sri Lanka to a point where it naturally disturbed India. The consequences of that policy, I think, had left a significant imprint to a point where India had to intervene militarily in order to get Sri Lanka, in some way, to not go with the US option but instead come within its own sphere of influence.

Since the end of the Cold War, the relations between Sri Lanka and the United States and even with the rest of the world seemed to be fairly benign because those contestations, for some reason, went to the background for about 10 good years.

But today, again, you have a scenario that is changing. You have China as a rising power. Again, what Sri Lanka is doing is to pursue that Sinhala-Buddhist notion of the State and Sri Lanka chose to align itself with a power so closely. Generally, Chinas policy is that it will unquestioningly support a State, provided its own interests are looked after by that State and that is, in fact, what happened with the previous Mahinda Rajapaksa regime to a point. So, again, the global scenario or the global power balance is shifting and where there are contestations now, Sri Lanka again finds itself in a situation to pursue this Sinhala-Buddhist idea of the State and it had to pander to China to such an extent that it is so indebted to China today that it has allowed China to, in fact, come into Sri Lanka in a strategic way. Chinas influence over Sri Lanka is not benign and if anyone tries to make that position out, that it is a benign influence over Sri Lanka, they are not telling the truth. It is not benign. As a consequence, you have created a geopolitical contestation between China, the US and India, on the other hand, and Sri Lanka is facing the consequences of that contestation.

My point, Sir, is that Sri Lanka could have used that geopolitical contestation to its benefit, if only Sri Lanka is prepared to change its domestic policies, about how it sees itself. If it is prepared to rethink itself into a plurinational State that recognizes the different nations within Sri Lanka, the different identities, its plurality and in fact, celebrates that very diversity, then these geopolitical contestations, whatever they may be, can be used to the advantage of the country as a whole, where you do not create this downward spiral that Sri Lanka is facing today. But, alas, we do not have that sort of outlook!

This Government, in particular, boasts of the fact that it only got elected from a Sinhala-Buddhist votebank. It celebrates that fact. Normally, governments would be quite upset to say that they are not a unifying factor, but rather a divisive factor, but not this Government, not the Gotabaya Rajapaksa era. They celebrate the fact that they were only recognized by the Sinhala-Buddhists. Every single policy, since this President came into power, is to

make an already bad situation worse. You have people like the Venerable Gnanasara Thero of the Bodu Bala Sena heading a Task Force that is supposed to be pursuing reconciliation or some part of it.

How more ridiculous can you get? You have the military, which is a very divisive force, heading so many sensitive task forces that concern the non-Sinhala Buddhists. So, it is a deliberate policy of the State to pursue this Sinhala-Buddhist identity, to celebrate it, show it that that is the constituency it solely relies on and that it is to them and only them that they shall be faithful to.

It is for this policy, unfortunately, that the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris is now a Minister. The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris is someone that I, as a law student, not only looked up to, but also thought of as almost godly because of his writings, teachings and more than anything else, as a political student, because of his personal views on Sri Lankas current Constitution, with regard to the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and its severe shortcomings and almost hopelessness in making it work. So, it is that (Prof.) G.L. Peiris who is now the Minister of this most important Ministry and the standards that we personally expect from him are very high; certainly for me, they are very high. But, Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, when you went to Bologna, Italy for the G20 Summit, I think it was the Interfaith Forum, and made your speech there, I was shocked! I know the Prime Minister has also made comments along the same lines as you did, which were that in a country like Sri Lanka, to paraphrase, to have various organizations and parties claiming distinct identities as them being such and such a community or such and such a religion is not a good thing. In fact, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa is a Sinhala nationalist; he has been a hardline nationalist for a long time and his saying something like that is one thing. But, I do not think he should say it. He is a man who has been quite strident when it comes to human rights and he should know better. I think in his senior days now as a statesman, he should not pursue the sort of policies that he might have pursued in the past. But, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, in my view, should have, in fact, used his influence in Government, in the high offices and said that that is not the position we should take. On the one hand, when you have a President who celebrates the fact that the Sinhala-Buddhist vote is the thing that he would be most faithful to and only faithful to and then, on the other, you have the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister going before the international community and saying that other identities that are being pursued are a disadvantage and a problem, then I think we are really looking at the raw nature of this Governments policy, not only with regard to domestic affairs but also, by extension, to its international affairs and what it is going to be.

I think, Sir, we are heading for a lot of trouble. If this is the policy that the Government wishes to pursue, then you are not going to be able to use that geopolitical climate in a positive manner. On the contrary, in order to pursue this monolithic policy, you will have to take sides, and you have taken a side. Because the side that you took

449 450

[ ..

2021 25

in order to win the war is now coming back to haunt you, you think that you can balance it out by selling assets to other interested parties. I can tell you, you can sell whatever assets you want, but no balancing of strategic presences in this Island is going to satisfy India of all other powers.

As far as India is concerned, it is a reality that we are its neighbour and India is not concerned about balancing presences in Sri Lanka.

Indias only concern is that no other superpower or no other power should have a strategic presence in Sri Lanka. I mean the term strategic presence, not presence. But, you have already created a situation where you have a strategic presence to a power that is not India and you think that you can try and balance Indias interests by giving it some assets, giving India's strategic path to the United States and, maybe, to some other partners some strategic assets. It will never work. You have only one path, only one path will make you succeed. That is, to make sure that Sri Lanka changes its path to one of a plurinational country by embracing its own nations within it, reflecting that in a new Constitution and thereby, preventing and not allowing the divisions that thus far have allowed this geopolitical contestation to take place and instead pursue a policy that will be beneficial to all. I am saying this with utmost responsibility.

Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, you must weigh in your personal influence and stature. You cannot afford this Government to pursue the policies that it has been pursuing. On the contrary, you, as an elder statesman and a figure highly respected by both sides of this House, must weigh upon the Government and correct its past mistakes. Thank you.

[2.43 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Presiding Member, I rise today to speak about the regrettable state of our foreign affairs or the external relations and the mismanagement by the present Government to the detriment of the country.

At the outset, I wish to lay on record and appreciate the role and the significant foreign policy achievements of our late Colleague, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, who sadly departed prematurely and is not with us anymore. The late Hon. Mangala Samaraweera connected Sri Lanka to the world, with the international community. He strengthened our relations with India, which had deteriorated and rebalanced our relationship with key friends and the markets we export to. He pursued a policy of "friendship with all and enmity to none". It was the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera who convinced the world how serious Sri Lanka was after the war in having a new approach.

Sir, as you may be aware, the international community of nations is increasingly developing a rules-based approach to the common and even competing interests that bind us together in our common search for humanity, peace and prosperity. It is towards this end that the United Nations, the other international bodies and the inter-governmental organizations work and Sri Lanka must strive to achieve those because it can and must have a robust engagement with the world. We must honour our commitments on international treaties and obligations rather than ignoring them.

Sri Lanka achieved a significant milestone twelve years ago by ending the war. Our Foreign Policy, like everything else of post-war era, needed to change as we moved from an era of war to an era where there is no war. Our interests are also changing to economic diplomacy and to post-war reconciliation. Regretfully, in the past two years, we had not engaged with the international community in a very wise and rational manner. I have my reasons for saying so, which others can contest.

The Government has sought to treat the international community the way it sometimes treats its domestic constituency, but the international community does not

buy or believe the evening telecasts of the Governments public and private TV channels and what is propagated by the propaganda organizations. They go by facts, figures and ground realities which are without the myths that are propagated by the Government.

This Governments consistent violation of democratic norms, personal liberties, human rights and media freedom together with regular hunts of those who criticize the Government in violation not only of democratic norms but also our constitutional rights and freedoms cheapen us in the eyes of the world.

Sri Lanka has a proud democratic history. We had the first woman Prime Minister and we are one of the first countries in the world to have universal adult franchise, where women voted. We have had peaceful transfer of political power, a robust press and the rule of law. This is not a tradition which anyone with a transient mandate can be allowed to destroy, not even with the Twentieth Amendment to the Consitution. That weakens democracy, removes accountability and goes a long way towards making Sri Lanka having a one-man show.

I must re-emphasize that it was unfortunate that at a time of global pandemic, Sri Lanka became best known internationally for insisting on cremation of bodies of COVID victims belonging to some communities against their religious beliefs, practices and wishes to the extent that it required international intervention. There was no scientific basis for such decision-making.

Sir, in the limited time I have, I want to raise a few other issues very quickly.

The Hon. Leader of the Opposition stated a few days ago that we must move away from a near racist approach to a national life and policies and implement a programme of national reconciliation. The Sri Lankan State must reflect the diversity of her society and also deal with the effects and root causes of the war and political conflicts. Sri Lanka is a divided society and we must seek to heal the wounds and bring about unity. We must build a post-war Sri Lanka that is inclusive, pluralist, non-racist and accommodative of the diversity of her people.

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and former President of Chile Michelle Bachelet observed in a statement to the UNHCR, I quote:

Regrettably, surveillance, intimidation and judicial harassment of human rights defenders, journalists and families of the disappeared has not only continued, but has broadened to a wider spectrum of students, academics, medical professionals and religious leaders critical of government policies. Several peaceful protests and commemorations have been met with excessive use of force.

This must change.

The other matter that I would bring your attention to is the focus on the GSP Plus. For having that privilege into export markets in the European Union - EU - and the USA, we need to commit ourselves to meeting our

469 470

[

2021 25

international obligations. The concerns relating to enforced disappearances, torture, sexual and gender-based violence, extra judicial killings, detentions and other accountability-related issues such as impunity raised in UNHCR resolutions must be paid attention to. We must bring the necessary legal and policy changes that will facilitate honouring those commitments.

Then, I would like to bring to your attention the Prevention of Terrorism Act, PTA. At its introduction, it was brought in as a temporary measure. Its key features including the administrative detention without trial, non-judicial oversight of detention and the admissibility of forced and coerced confessions as evidence, all make the PTA incompatible with international best practices and laws. So, that, we must change. Among other things, under the PTA, we have seen the incarcerations of lawyer Hejaaz Hizbullah, since declared a prisoner of conscience by the Amnesty International, as well as of poet Ahnaf Jazeem. It goes without saying that our Colleague, the Hon. Rishad Bathiudeen, had unjustly been kept in detention for several months.

Then, my Colleagues will speak at length on the issue of justice and the international ramifications of the Easter bombings. Therefore, I will not go into those. Instead, I wish to touch on the issue of the Indian Ocean Region and the Asia Pacific. Our Government speaks excessively of neutrality and non-alignment, but the rhetorical resort to both those concepts in the absence of any clarity in our national priorities in the region has only proved to be counter-productive. In 2015, we positioned ourselves as a hub in the Indian Ocean, connecting the East and the West as well as the different subregions. It was realized that any regional order involving the Indian Ocean should be based on a transparent and predictable set of rules, which could ensure safe and secure passage for all vessels going into all those countries.

I have a few more issues of concern, which I will quickly present. As I am sure you all know, thanks to a series of actions and inactions during the Presidency of Mahinda Rajapaksa and thanks to the disgraceful conduct of people like Mr. Jaliya Wickramasuriya, Sri Lanka was placed in the blacklist by the Financial Action Task Force - the FATF. We were also categorized as a dangerous country in 2012. In 2016 and 2017, through the hard work of the Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we managed to get into the Grey List and subsequently, in 2019, to get our country removed from the Grey List as well.

But, what did we see the Foreign Ministry do under President Gotabaya Rajapaksa? It decided to shamelessly petition the US authorities to say that Mr. Jaliya Wickramasuriyas actions had the cover of diplomatic immunity.

When Mr. Wickramasuriya appealed to the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka just a couple of weeks ago to have his diplomatic immunity restored and his prosecution on the charges of money laundering and wire fraud in the USA prevented, the Supreme Court, dismissed his appeal. We

should not bring our Foreign Ministry's standing to that level by such actions.

Finally, I would like to ask the officers of the Foreign Service, some of whom may be present in Parliament today, are you representing a country which has real democracy or one that only calls itself a democracy, a country that protects and promotes human rights and upholds the dignity of each and every individual or a country that only claims to do so or a country where the law applies to those in uniform and religious robes equally or differently to different people? The law should apply to the soldier, the civilian and people who have different political ideologies equally. That is the country that we want to build.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Finally, I would ask, do we want a country which actually upholds the teachings of the Gauthama Buddha and all other religious teachers revered in it and which extends compassion to a mother who lights a lamp for her missing child or a country that is so insecure that it clamps down on those engaged in memorialization?

Thank you, Sir, for the time given to me.

For example, we are working very closely with the SLINTEC in order to develop the graphene market. As you know, particularly the Kegalle District, the area

which I represent, is very rich in graphite. We hope to work with the private sector and then develop the graphene market as the cost of graphene production has come down to US Dollars 100 to 150. Now we feel that within the next three years, this will have a huge potential. We have already introduced graphene producers from Russia, Ukraine, Serbia and Czechoslovakia.

We started a programme at the Harvard University. It started with my sending out a survey to all the Missions asking them how many presentations they had made to Boards of Directors in the various countries they served and the reply was something close to zero. So, we spoke to the Harvard Kennedy School, the Ricardo Hausmann and Matt Andrews and created the first-ever 18-week online programme and 49 persons - Ambassadors, High Commissioners, their Deputies and senior officials - participated. It was a hands-on programme and in the last seven weeks, they started work on 237 contacts and 39 people completed that programme. But, what happened? It had been dumped into the dustbin. Other countries have now started such programmes, but we were unable to leverage that.

Hon. Minister, I hear horror stories about appointments to the Foreign Service, about how people are selected and how political favouritism is ruling all that. There are so many good people. I worked with the most brilliant people in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I recall with pleasure the discussions we had late into the night in some foreign capital far away. They challenged me and I challenged them. Those were intellectual discussions. So, we must make use of those people. We must not let those people feel disappointed in serving in the Ministry of Foreign. . , , .

, , . I would like to tell the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella about the institutions that are working on the ground like the Office on Missing Persons, the Office for Reparations, the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation and the Sustainable Development Goal 16 Council. Every week, I monitor those with the senior officials of the Ministry and very substantial progress is being made in each of those areas. You asked me what I am going to say in Geneva in March. There is a convincing story to tell, not cosmetic, that there is a real progress on the ground with regard to those issues and all we ask for is a sense of objectivity in evaluating the progress which has been made. . .
