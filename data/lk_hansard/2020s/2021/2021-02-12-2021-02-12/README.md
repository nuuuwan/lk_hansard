, .. . , , .. . , , .. . . . [2.23 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, we are gathered today to pay tribute to three of the past Hon. Members of this House.

First, I must say a few words about the former Secretary of the Sri Lanka Communist Party, the late Hon. K.P. Silva. "KP" and I entered Parliament in the same year, in 1994. Both of us entered this House as National List Members of the Peoples Alliance then. We were also Secretaries of our own parties. So, we would meet very regularly in the chambers of the late Hon. Dharmasiri Senanayake, the then Secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, who would summon us for meetings. We would have arguments about nomination lists, timing of elections and a variety of other issues we had with the then Peoples Alliance Government.

The Hon. K.P. Silva, as a very diminutive person, did not have a very overpowering personality compared to his other comrades like the Hon. (Dr.) S.A. Wickremasinghe, the Hon. Pieter Keuneman, the Hon. Sarath Muttetuwegama and others, who were very colourful personalities gifted with a silver tongue, I would say. When the Hon. Sarath Muttetuwegama was in this House, he would outshine everyone in his oratory.

The Communist Party, being one of the oldest parties in this country, owes a lot to an unsung hero like the Hon. K.P. Silva. He was the one who started the 1946-1947 General Strike from the Government Factory in Kolonnawa, which shook the then Colonial Government. He was then with the Lanka Samasamaja Party and when leaders like the Hon. (Dr.) Colvin R. de Silva and the Hon. (Dr.) N.M. Perera had to seek exile in India, it was people like the Hon. K.P. Silva who had secretly kept the party going.

Then, with the effluxion of time, though the Communist Party may have lost its share of power, particularly in the 17-year UNP rule since 1977, they remained together with the other Left forces and kept the Opposition going with the Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike at the helm. But, with her civic rights being removed and with a variety of different challenges, it was people like the Hon. K.P. Silva, together with their colleagues, who kept the flag of the leftist political front flying, surviving the juggernaut of the then UNP Government. They faced atrocities and difficulties and even the JVP insurrection and its wrath, which brought about death penalties to many of these leaders.

The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senarathne is here and he will testify to the formation of the United Socialist Alliance. When the Sri Lanka Freedom Party boycotted the first Provincial Council Election, it was the formation of the USA that was able to give a formidable challenge to the then UNP, which would have otherwise run away with a landslide victory at that Election. So, people like the Hon. K.P. Silva has to be remembered for their courage in keeping the party intact and particularly the period between 1977 to 1994, until he entered Parliament, was the most difficult period for the left parties. He was the General Secretary of the Communist Party then. It was such a personality with whom we have had that camaraderie and company in this House and I treasure it very much. I pay my heart-felt tribute to the fallen Colleague.

Sir, with that, I must say a few words about the late Hon. (Mrs.) Surangani Ellawala who, perhaps reluctantly, was pushed into politics not only because her dear husband Nanda Ellawala passed away a long time ago, but also because of the subsequent death of her dear son Nalanda Ellawala, who was one of our dear Colleagues. I had the opportunity of leading a Parliamentary delegation to a few countries, of which Nalanda was a Member. The Hon. Dilan Perera, the Hon. Dullas Alahapperuma and so would various others remember that when I led those Parliamentary delegations abroad, Nalanda was a unique personality. He would enliven any gathering; he was an entertainer par excellence. I remember his guitar and the strings would dance to his tune. He would keep us all enthralled with his ability to sing all the time and keep us all happy. When he started cracking jokes, all of us had rib-tickling laughter. He was such a lively personality and unfortunately, when he died in Kuruwita on that day it was such a shock to all of us. We all rushed there and we were so saddened by his demise. If he lived, he would have been one of the senior Ministers in the front benches.

Though fate did not spare him for us, his mother took to politics and entered the Provincial Council, became a Provincial Minister and subsequently, entered Parliament. When she contested the Provincial Council Elections, such was the stature of the Ellawala legacy that she scored the highest preference votes in the Ratnapura District. She was made a Minister in that Provincial Government. Subsequently, she entered Parliament and was here with us, I believe, from 2001 to 2004. But as it always happens, you know that people think when

1469 1470

women enter politics, it is not by design but by default because one of their dear members in the family would have departed and that is how ladies get into politics. So was the Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike. None expected the reluctant widow to rise up to the level of one of the strongest political leaders that Asia ever produced.

So, we could never underestimate the ability of the Hon. (Mrs.) Surangani Ellawala. She was a gifted writer. She was bestowed a national award for her Sinhala writing. The Hon. Dullas Alahapperuma recited the poetry she had written when the Hon. Nalanda Ellawala departed. She was not only a gifted writer, but a leader whom people could always endear themselves to. That is why, though she was not in the limelight in the frontlines, she was always able to keep the bastion of Ratnapura as a pocket borough of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. So, she had made immense contribution to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and its success. But, unfortunately, since 2004, none of the leaders of Sri Lanka Freedom Party were able to decorate her with a position. But, I must thank the former President Maithreepala Sirisena for he saw it fit to bestow her with the Governorship of the Central Province. Whenever I approached her for whatever work because I represent the Kandy District - she was there for a very short period - she would endearingly refer to me as a good friend of her son and would always be available to do whatever she could though I was from a different political formation opposed to their own political ideologies. But, that never mattered to her and she was always forthcoming to do whatever she could.

Sir, I would like to extend my heartfelt condolence to Vishaka, her daughter and the only surviving member of that family, and of course, Akila, who is now here in this House and would wish that she attains Nibbana according to her own faith.

With those words, I would also add a few words in memory of the late Hon. Kapil Abeyratne, who also had the opportunity to enter this House because of the demise of the late Hon. Nanda Ellawala. When he cam in here, he was a well-known personality in Ratnapura politics. He had adorned the Mayorship of the Ratnapura Municipal Council and that, too, was during the most difficult period for the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, from 1979 to the 1990s. That was the period in which the Hon. Kapil Abeyratne was the Mayor of Ratnapura Municipal Council. It was not such an easy place to be in politics with the Punchinilames in power in that area. So, the Hon. Kapil Abeyratne, being a lawyer, I am sure, had the courage of his conviction to face up to the challenges and keep the flag of the Sri Lanka Freedom flying and finally, he was rewarded in coming to this House. Though he served only for a very short term in this House, he too is being remembered for his services to his party, for that long period in which he served in the local politics and the period in this House for a few years. Like Surangani, he too had two other members of his family as Mayors of Ratnapura: his brother as well as his father. So, he too has to be remembered and tribute has to be paid today in this House for that valuable service they rendered.

Sir, with those words, I would extend my sympathies, on behalf of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, to the families of the departed Hon. Members.

I thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . [ .] ... . [.. 2.37] ( ) (The Hon. John Seneviratne) , . , .. . , . , .
