(ii) the pensioners are in despair owing to the above reason;

(iii) all the public sector pensioners including the officers of the three armed forces and the police who retired prior to 01.01.2016 have been seriously discriminated as their pensions have been formulated based on the salary under two stages as at 01.01.2017 as per the public Administration Circular 14/2019, in spite of the fact that the pensions were to be formulated based on the last salary, which increases over five stages as the Public Administration Circular 03/2016; and

(iv) justice could have been meted out to the public sector pensioners who retired prior to 01.01.2020 had their pension anomaly been rectified by computing the pension payment based on the last salary, which was to be increased over five stages as per the Public Administration Circular 03/2016?

(b) Will he inform this House whether steps will be taken to mete out justice to the pensioners of the public sector by implementing the Public Administration Circular 03/2016 expeditiously?
