REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC

ACCOUNTS

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana)

Hon. Speaker, I present the Third Report of the Committee on Public Accounts - COPA - for the First Session of the Ninth Parliament. Sir, with your permission, I just want to make one or two points regarding the Report.

This Report aims at evaluating the financial discipline and the management efficiency of all State institutions, of about 840, on an annual basis, using an online Management Information System. This Report specifically indicates the performance level of all the Government institutions, drawing attention to the institutions that achieved the highest level of financial compliance for the Financial Year 2019. It is the responsibility of the respective Ministers and the Chief Accounting Officers of all institutions to ensure that the highest level is achieved through proper planning and decision-making by rectifying their shortcomings.

Everyone including the general public can access this Report through the Parliament website from today.

Sir, I take this opportunity to extend my gratitude to the Hon. Lasantha Alagiyawanna, former Chairman of the Committee, for the innovative concept and the initiatives taken to implement this programme with the support of the COPA Secretariat headed by Mrs. Anusha Suriyapperuma.

Thank you. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena - Minister of Education and the Leader of the House of Parliament) " " 0

Especially, they were citing the Interpretation Ordinance and certain other difficulties that you may encounter.

Then, the Hon. Sumanthiran, as a Member of Parliament, has already submitted a very simple Bill before this House. The Government can take charge of that Bill, take it to the Cabinet, get it approved and bring it as a Government Bill and enable Provincial Councils Elections to be conducted without any delay.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) We will also support it.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes, the Opposition is quite willing to; as the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella says, we are also willing to support it. Sir, today's Virakesari newspaper states in Tamil, I quote:

" 13

"

The visiting Indian Foreign Minister, too, has made a specific request about the implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment. The implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment means conducting elections and re-establishing Provincial Councils. Therefore, he is making a request to the Government that the Provincial Council Elections be conducted early. The former Minister of Foreign and current Minister of Education, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, is quite aware of the interest of the Government of India regarding the need to strengthen the Thirteenth Amendment. In order to strengthen the Thirteenth Amendment, in the first place, we have to conduct the elections. But, the elections have been postponed for several years now. I am sure, with this simple Amendment, the Government can enable these Provincial Councils Elections to be held fast. Therefore, I would, once again, urge that the Government considers this so that we need not wait until the next Local Government Elections are due to conduct the Provincial Councils Elections, which are already well past the due date. I must say that as the Opposition and being the previous administration, we also must bear responsibility for having messed up the electoral system. I am one who opposed that Bill from the very start. The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena is aware of my opposition regarding that Bill, but, unfortunately, it became law and then, the delimitation process became such an antagonistic process. Finally, the Hon. Minister himself voted against the Delimitation Report. That was the biggest joke we encountered in this House.

Having said that, may I also make another request regarding the internally displaced people in this country. On the coming 30th October falls the completion of 31 years after the incident where almost 100,000 Muslims were forcibly evicted from the Northern Province by the LTTE. That forcible eviction has resulted in all those internally displaced people having to live in other parts of the country being unable to return to their original homes. Even after the war was concluded, though peace has returned, they are unable to return there for a variety of other practical reasons. A vast number of these people are now resident in the Puttalam District and perhaps, in a few other districts. So, they have various practical reasons. Their children, to pursue education, have already been enrolled in schools in the other areas where they are now resident. Though they have been relocated and residing in other districts, their desire to be voters in their original district of birth - in the Vanni District or the other districts of the Northern Province including Jaffna -

1205 1206

is something that they are not willing to forgo; it is their desire to be voters in that district. .

So, this particular request can be looked into very carefully without insisting on their having a place of residence and showing proof that they are residing in a particular district to obtain the voting right. Similarly like how you prepare a supplementary list, please enable these internally displaced people who had been chased away from their places of birth by force by the LTTE to be voters in that district without depriving them of their desire by insisting on this requirement of proof of residence. This is a serious problem for those people because they still have their lands in that area and they go there for cultivation, but the only issue is that most of them do not have their residence to prove. That is the only difficulty.

But, we have temporarily accommodated them for several years as voters. Until about three years ago, we had this practice of preparing a supplementary list. When an election is announced, the Election Commission calls for applications and registers them in a supplementary list and they are allowed to vote from wherever they are residing. So, a similar supplementary list, like how you are enabling a supplementary list to be prepared for the youth of this country when they complete 18 years, can also be prepared for those who are willing to vote in the Northern areas, from which they have been forcibly evicted. This is a special circumstance and even internationally, in the international conventions relating to refugees and IDPs, this is a right which they would always be entitled to and that should be respected by the Government. Therefore, I look forward to making this request from the Hon. Minister and will also make a specific request in the Parliamentary Select Committee regarding this, to enable these IDPs to continue to exercise their franchise, not in the place of residence but in the area of birth, which right they do not want to forsake for the reason that they have forcibly been displaced. Therefore, that must be respected and the injustice that they have been made to suffer for 30 long years must be remedied through a simple amendment, enabling a supplementary list to be prepared permanently as long as they are forced to live outside their areas of residence.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) The Hon. Rauff Hakeem would remember, I, too, remember - then, the Speaker was the late Hon. M.H. Mohamed - that dreadful news asking people belonging to ethnic communities other than Tamils to leave Jaffna within 48 hours. The Hon. Speaker summoned us. We were in the Opposition. All of us got together and made an appeal, but it was not heard. What the Hon. Rauff Hakeem referred to today dates back to a long period, Sir. The Select Committee should go into this matter. We will discuss and try to make recommendations. A remedy

could be made through the advance postal voting that we are trying to propose.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Johnston Fernando) 0 5000 6000 0 0 0 5000 6000 0 0 0 15 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0

talking about now have revealed the wealth that is generated in this country. There are people who have so much money that they do not know how to spend it and they spend that money on purchasing objects of art, which are then stored in warehouses depriving even the public of having access to those works of art. As we all know, works of art should be accessible to the public; the works of art are created by the artists for the public enjoyment, for the people to see and enjoy those creative works. But today, in our society, these objects of art have become a source of investing, through which people who have too much money or money earned in illegal ways use their wealth to buy up those and then deprive even the general public of having access to them. That is just one example of the utter level of inequality in our country, which creates such a huge disparity among those who have access to wealth and those who have not.

Sir, I just want to say one last thing. There is one more issue which has come to our notice. As everyone knows, Sri Lanka is a country where we revere religions; religions are held in high regard. Let it be Buddhism or Hinduism, we worship "Gana Deviyo" or "Pillaiyar". Though we worship the "Elephant God", whom we keep

in such high regard, yet, it is shameful to say, we are the ones who abuse elephants. Therefore, I think our mindset needs to change. Mahatma Gandhi once stated, I quote:

The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated."

So, I think it is time that we take a step back and honestly see how great we are.

[3.15 p.m.]

() ( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Suren Raghavan) Hon. Presiding Member, I am glad to speak today on these two critically important Bills which are being debated in this august House. The Registration of Electors (Amendment) Bill has been brought to reform the registration of electors that we have been practising. The other Bill is not directly related to it, but is indirectly and structurally related to the rights of our labourers and their security in a working democracy.

A working democracy must have minimum conditions. Elections are one such condition. Fair, frequent and transparent elections are a demonstration of the commitment of the society and that of the State to the citizens of the land. Sri Lanka, my motherland as well as yours, has a proud history of electoral politics which had started in 1911, almost 110 years ago. In 1911, 1923, 1930 and then in 1940, there were drastic revolutionary changes that Sri Lanka, as a one-time colonial country, had introduced, if not to the whole world, at least to the South Asian Region. Sri Lanka was one of the first countries to recognize and fulfil the citizens right to vote, by which we exercised representative democracy in this land.

But, Sir, unfortunately, I also have to reiterate certain truths about our own electoral journey. In 1948, one of the reasons why we received Independence was that our forefathers fought, not with arms but with ideas and ideologies to enhance democracy in this country and winning electoral rights was one of the forefront struggles that the Muslims and the Tamils dedicated themselves to led by the Sinhalese leaders in this country. But, unfortunately, the first decision of the first Cabinet of the first Government in 1948 was to disenfranchise nearly 300,000 citizens of this country. They were not just citizens, but those who were, for more than 100 years, supporting the economy - the tea industry - of this country. I think that wrong turn - we can only read about it historically and time can judge it - took our motherland on a different trajectory altogether, completely.

Even today, when I listened to the Debate in this House, I could see how ethno-nationalist we have become instead of paying attention to the deepening

1253 1254

issues, to our economy and the place that Sri Lanka should be holding internationally and in the region. We are still blaming each other. The reason for this is that we have adopted the ethno-nationalist fever as our fundamental way of doing politics.

0 - - 0 0 0 We need a reimagination of our State where all the citizens are equal, where democracy will be the most qualifying condition to draw a social contract between the State and society, for which I think we have the opportunity. In my humble learning as a political scientist, my prediction is that there would not be a stronger Government than this in the future. 14 0 0 0 0

His Excellency President Gotabaya Rajapaksa addressing the most important international body, the UNGA - United Nations General Assembly - for the first time referred very clearly to three critical areas. In his speech, he mentioned that Sri Lanka is willing and ready to work with the international community for economic development and international security. It is very important for us.

Then, to me, as a Tamil in this country, the most welcoming statement my President made was that Sri Lanka is committed to restorative justice and accountability based on a home-grown solution to address our violent past.
