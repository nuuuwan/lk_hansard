PARLIAMENT - 2021 20 2021 20, Tuesday, 20th July, 2021 ____________________ .. 10.00 . [ ] . .. 10.00 . [ ] . The Parliament met at 10.00 a.m., MR. SPEAKER [THE HON. MAHINDA YAPA ABEYWARDANA] in the Chair. ANNOUNCEMENTS PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO NO CONFIDENCE MOTION AGAINST HON. UDAYA GAMMANPILA ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I wish to make a Ruling on the amendment to the No-Confidence Motion which was handed over to the Secretary-General of Parliament by the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, MP, yesterday.

The No-Confidence Motion, which was given notice of by forty three Members of the Opposition, is in respect of the Hon. Udaya Gammanpila, Minister of Energy and the notice relating to the Motion was handed over to the Parliament Secretariat on the 22nd of June, 2021 and was included in the Order Book of Parliament on the 23rd of June, 2021. The Committee on Parliamentary Business held on the 5th of July, 2021 decided to take up the Motion for debate on two consecutive days including a special Sitting day on the 19th of July, 2021, and on the 20th of July, 2021. The Notice of the Substantive Motion of No-Confidence had no indication that it could finally be converted as a No-Confidence Motion on the Cabinet of Ministers, which is the Government. The Committee on Parliamentary Business was also not informed that an amendment would be moved to convert the No-Confidence Motion against the Minister of Energy to be a No-Confidence Motion against the Government.

Furthermore, the debate that took place yesterday in the House was very much focused on the No-Confidence Motion against a single Minister, namely, the Hon. Udaya Gammanpila.

The legal effect of the amendment handed over to the Secretary-General of Parliament by the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe is to convert the No-Confidence Motion moved against the Hon. Udaya Gammanpila to assume a new status as a No-Confidence Motion against the Cabinet of Ministers, which is the Government. This was not intended at any stage since notice was given on the Motion.

Standing Order No. 43(4) states as follows:

An amendment to a question shall be relevant to the question to which such amendment is proposed.

According to this principle, the proposed amendment must be relevant to the Motion and fall within the scope of the original Motion moved in the House. The Indian authority Practice and Procedure of Parliament by Kaul and Shakdher, Sixth Edition, Page 705, States;

In order that an amendment to a motion may be admissible, it must satisfy the following conditions; An amendment should be relevant to, and within the scope of the motion to which it is proposed. It should not introduce new or foreign matter or widen the scope of the motion.

Accordingly, an amendment which seeks to convert a No-Confidence Motion against a Minister to that of a No-Confidence Motion against the Cabinet of Ministers is certainly not within the scope of the original Motion nor is it relevant to the original Motion either.

Standing Order No. 43(5) states as follows:

An amendment shall not raise any question which, by the rules of Parliament can only be raised by a substantive motion after notice.

We all are well aware that a No-Confidence Motion against the Cabinet of Ministers could only be brought forward by a Substantive Motion after due notice is given. Any attempt to subvert this process by bringing in an amendment to an existing No-Confidence Motion against a Minister is out of order and contravenes the Standing Orders.

In the above circumstances, I rule that the proposed amendment to the No-Confidence Motion against the Hon. Udaya Gammanpila, Minister of Energy, handed over to the Secretary-General of Parliament by the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe is out of order and cannot be accepted. Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) , . ,

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS () ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana) Hon. Speaker, I present the First Report of the Committee on Public Accounts for the First Session of the Ninth Parliament. In presenting this, I would like to make one or two comments.

Firstly, the Report presented by the COPA refers to a large number of irregularities in the institutions. There are a number of irregularities and some of them appeared to be due to the defects and shortcomings in the relevant Acts. But, there also seems to be definite connivance between officials and the members of the public, which has led to a considerable loss of revenue to the Government and the people. So, those have to be rectified. In this Report, we have made extensive comments regarding them. Due to the shortage of time, I will just mention a few of them.

If we take the changing of provisions in the Acts, for instance, to the Department of Inland Revenue, we found that large, powerful companies which have good auditing systems and accounting systems had not paid taxes on their revenue for five years, six years and so on. When we looked into the matter, we found that there is provision for them to appeal three times to the Inland Revenue Department against the amount that is being asked of them as taxes. There is no need for the same Department to have three Boards of Appeal. That has dragged on the process. At the end of that period, the matter is taken up in courts also. So, there is further delay. Therefore, for about five, six years, money that is due to the government coffers has not come in. This practice of having three Boards of Appeal should be done away with. So, I think amending the Act should be done accordingly. One Board of Appeal is enough. In addition, the period for an appeal should be limited. The whole process should be over in a period of about six months instead of it being allowed to be dragged on because what that means is, those big companies are able to have a large amount of money for their use without paying any interest on it. So, there should be provision made in the Act for interest payment also. That is one example.

Then, there are also examples of wrong policies. One burning issue in our country is the question of human-elephant conflict. During the course of the discussion with the Ministries concerned, it was very clear that over the last nine to 10 years, the cost has been going up, but, at the same time, the number of conflicts also has increased, causing more human and elephant deaths. So, obviously, the policy adopted was wrong because the policy was to herd the elephants into a restricted area of forest and when we checked up, we found that only the female elephants and the baby elephants were getting into

2109 2110

that area. Then, after some time, when the food ran out, the animals have been starving and dying. The real trouble-makers, the big elephants, were roaming around continuing to create troubles. So, we pointed out to the Ministry officials that this policy has failed and a new policy should be implemented, and now, there is a new policy. Dr. Prithiviraj Fernando, who has been working with elephants for a long time, has come up with a new policy, which is far more sensible. All he has said is to have the electrified wiring around the villages and the cultivated areas and leave the rest of the jungle open. He has tested this out in Galgamuwa for seven years. I went there, saw what has happened and I spoke to the villagers and they said that there is no such conflict now, that there is actually a friendship between the elephants and the humans. So, this type of reluctance to change the obviously wrong policies is also a factor which needs to be corrected.

Besides that - Sir, I do not want to take too much of time - I would like to discuss the question of the Customs and the import of vehicles. We found that there were a lot of irregularities taking place there and just to give you one or two examples, - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) We can discuss those details at a debate, not this time. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana) Okay, I will stop at that.

If I give you an idea of the nature of the COPA Report, it is comprehensive and covers a number of faults which, if corrected, Sir, would bring in the money which is due to the Treasury, to the Government and would probably help get rid of the Budget deficit. So, I would strongly appeal that this Report be studied and acted on as best as possible. Thank you very much.

So, I would strongly appeal that this Report be studied and acted on as best as possible. Thank you very much. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena - Minister of Foreign and the Leader of the House of Parliament) , " " . , . . Question put, and agreed to. . . Ordered that the Report be printed.

Hon. (Dr.) V. Radhakrishnan Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka,- Vote of No Confidence in the Hon. Udaya Gammanpila, Minister of Energy,-

Whereas the Hon. Udaya Gammanpila, Minister of Energy, has taken action to raise fuel prices without the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers as stated in writing by the General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, which is the main party representing the Government, although the Cabinet of Ministers is collectively responsible and answerable to Parliament in terms of Article 43(1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka;

And whereas has derogated from the principles guiding the State policy in contravention of Article 27(1) of the Constitution and shirked the fundamental duties in contravention of Article 28 of the Constitution, thereby breaking the Oath taken in terms of Article 53 of the Constitution;

And whereas has not informed Parliament and people of this country of the profit which the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and the Government earned by not reducing prices of petroleum fuels but keeping the prices at a high level since January, 2020, when petroleum prices fell excessively in the world market, up until now;

And whereas has not fulfilled the pledge given to people that the advantage of the falling prices of petroleum fuels in the world market will be given to people by reducing the prices of essential goods;

And whereas has not kept to the pledge given not to raise fuel prices within two years based on such price advantage;

And whereas has failed to inform this Parliament and people what happened to the Fuel Price Stabilization Fund, claimed to have been established by the Government to use the advantage of falling prices when oil prices rise;

2173 2174

And whereas has not fulfilled the pledge given to use the profit earned by the Government when prices were falling to rescue the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation from its indebtedness to state banks;

And whereas has, through the raising of fuel prices, led to the rise of production cost in all consumer goods parallel to it and the accompanying escalation of inflation, thereby placing people affected by the COVID-19 Pandemic in further suffering economically;

And whereas has led to the possible adverse effects on exports and the overall economy due to the escalation of production cost;

And whereas has failed to fulfill promises given from time to time by directly and indirectly contravening the peoples agenda given in being elected to the Government, the policies of the Government and the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka;

That this Parliament resolves that it has no confidence in the competence of Hon. Udaya Gammanpila, Minister of Energy to function as a Cabinet Minister any longer."

[2.20 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the No-Confidence Motion moved against the Hon. Udaya Gammanpila has been moved for several different aspects of the management of his Ministry. He has, perhaps, mismanaged the affairs of the Ministry for the reasons given in the Motion. I would like to deal with just one aspect of it. We say in our Motion, I quote:

"And whereas has not fulfilled the pledge given to use the profit earned by the Government when prices were falling to rescue the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation from its indebtedness to State banks;"

2213 2214

That is a very serious matter for this reason. Sir, I would like to quote from an article published in the Business Times section of the The Sunday Times dated 18th July, 2021 which carries the title US dollar shortage burdens debt-ridden CPC. This happens at a time when this particular Ministry should normally hold the subjects of power, energy and renewable sources together. But, those subjects have been divided among three Ministers. So, his focus is basically on managing the energy side of it. In managing the energy side of it, where does he falter? The said article states, I quote:

The debt-ridden Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) is heading towards an unprecedented financial crisis due to a dollar shortage in State banks to settle its fuel import payment bills when clearing shipments from the port.

The CPC had to face severe difficulties in clearing its recent crude oil shipment which arrived on July 5 at the port and another refined petrol cargo is expected on Thursday July 22,..."

That is, the day after tomorrow.

"a high ranking Customs official told the Business Times.

There are several matters regarding this. Particularly, how does this dereliction of duty, using utmost care while he discharges his functions as the Minister, come about? It is for this reason. Usually, the practice of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation is that they open a Letter of Credit and they have to retire the Letter of Credit when they receive the goods. But, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation has been following the practice of taking on DP terms for 90 days, 180 days and their monthly commitment has been in the range of about US Dollars 200 million to US Dollars 215 million to 220 million. So, they collect weekly, monthly and settle the money to the commercial banks and the State banks so that they retire the Letter of Credit. For the last one and a half years, having had a massive profit, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation has failed to retire the bills to the State banks, thereby causing a serious run on the State banks' deposits. The people will really panic, if this situation goes on.

They have virtually brought the State banks into a serious positon. US Dollars 3.4 billion worth LCs had been opened for energy imports, whether for petroleum products, for coal or for various other purposes, and the failure to settle those in time is what is important. The earlier practice had been to collect monies that are due every week or monthly. When they are earning so much of profit, without allowing the consumer to get the benefit of the price reduction in the world market, they do not even retire the bills, but take all the profit. This has finally resulted in a serious problem, not only the energy crisis but also the crisis of foreign exchange reserves for the State banks. That is why we say that there is a serious dereliction of duty by the Minister and that is all the more justified by their failing to do it for one and a half years. For one and a half years, they have failed to do it. I say that this is so serious because our energy imports are almost in the region of US Dollars 5 billion every year.

This US Dollars 5 billion is almost equal to 25 per cent of our countrys entire imports and is almost 50 per cent of the export earnings for the country. So, this is a serious matter. The treasury management in the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation is dragging the country into a serious crisis whereas they have earned heavy profits for the last two years when the world prices had come down. So, why have they not settled the bills for one and a half years? This is the serious failure for which the Minister has to face this No-Confidence Motion.

Sir, he has also proposed to the Cabinet an amendment to the Act to privatize the functions of the Petroleum Corporation. His Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Party's Manifesto . , " , , , , , . " . Having said that in his Manifesto, he goes and brings an amendment to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Act to enable him to privatize all its functions. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees)Hon. Member, please wind up. ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) Okay, Sir.

So, it is for that reason alone, for having fooled the people, that the Opposition is now bringing this No-Confidence Motion. He has gone against his promise to the people, having brought these amendments to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Act as well as by not passing on the benefit of the price advantage in the world market to the consumers. Together with that, having failed to settle and retire the Letters of Credit that they have obtained from the State banks, they have put the State banks into a crisis and have also brought the foreign reserves of the State banks into a serious problem, thereby causing a serious situation in the future of having long queues before petrol sheds and creating a serious energy crisis, plunging the entire country into a serious financial problem. Therefore, we say that we will be supporting this Motion for those reasons.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees)Next, the Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera. You have nine minutes.

, , , , . ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .. . . [3.51 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, whilst I would like to state at the very outset that we will be supporting the No-Confidence Motion against the Hon. Minister of Energy, I would also like to state that we do not hold him personally or the Government responsible for this situation we are in, but we blame all Governments that have taken office and the policies that have been pursued by them.

I say this, Sir, because energy is the backbone of development. You have global superpowers going to war to secure energy. So, for a small country like Sri Lanka, when it wants to develop, energy is something that they have to plan for far ahead to secure. In that sense, the question that has to be asked by every Member of this House and also by every Member that has sat in this House previously is whether the policies that this House has pursued - I am saying this House, not only the Government but also the Opposition - could have alleviated this position or could have found an alternate route than where we find ourselves in today.

Today, you are spending on defence, if I am not mistaken, 10.35 per cent of your annual Budget in a situation where there is no war. Who is your enemy? No country has attacked Sri Lanka. No, your enemy is within; you consider your own citizens enemies. Why? Because you do not want to recognize their rights. You would rather kill them, you would rather wage war against them than have them become productive citizens and contribute to the growth of this country. Earlier, it

2243 2244

2021 20

was the Tamils. You spent 32 years, much longer actually, waging the war. Your defence policy is based on making sure that the Tamils do not get their rights; your Foreign Policy is based on making sure that the Tamils do not get their rights. You thought you are done with it after 32 years of war. Now, you are picking another enemy. This time it is the Muslims. You are radicalizing the Muslims. Why? You need that, you need the bogeyman to continue your racist and corrupt policies, where only you line your pockets, not the citizens of this country. ( ) (An Hon. Member) Agreed. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) And now, you continue to militarize. Why? Because today, you need to militarize to make sure that you are protected against your own Sinhalese because he is the common man who is being targeted now. That is the truth.

We, as Members of the Opposition, can preach, but you will never listen to us. Why? Because we may be Tamils; we may be Muslims; we may be Christians. That is fine. But today, the question is not whether the Motion is brought against an individual Minister or the entire Government. The people are not bothered about any of that. What the people are bothered about is that they cannot make ends meet and those people will not forgive because for the good part of the 73 years since Independence, you blamed the war and the Tamils and the Muslims, now. No more people to blame. This time, you will pay a price because today more than ever before, what the Tamils have been saying for 73 years is beginning to be believed and understood and what the Muslims are facing is beginning to be understood. The Muslim Members of Parliament who supported whichever Governments when the Tamils got a beating are opening their eyes today; they are going to their citizens and telling the truth. Sinhalese leaders, who have been culprits engaged in corruption and racism, also have to begin to tell the truth to their people today. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I am winding up, Sir.

That is the situation we are finding ourselves in. If you do not change your path, the people will come to the streets. There is no point in blaming the Hon. Udaya Gammanpila; there is no point in blaming just this Government. You have to call into question 73 years of policy. And if you go down this path, we will be right; you will be wrong.
