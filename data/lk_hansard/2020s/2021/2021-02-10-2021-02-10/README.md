( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Hon. Speaker, I would like to ask the following Question from the Hon. Prime Minister.

(a) Will the Hon. Prime Minister inform this House - (i) of the total number of political prisoners in the country and the number of camps they are detained in; (ii) why expedited measures have not been taken yet with regard to their release; (iii) of the number of lands occupied by the security forces in each district across the country; and (iv) number of private lands and the lands of the Government offices controlled by the security forces;

(b) If not, why?

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa) : : : .

: : : .

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Hon. Prime Minister, my first Supplementary Question is this. There are people who have been in custody since even before I was born. Some of them had died in prison in the last couple of years. One of your main election promises was to release these political prisoners. This promise was made during the canvassing campaigns conducted in the North and the East. Even the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa, when he was released from remand prison, mentioned that these political prisoners need to be released.

At the same time, I need to place on record that during the JVP insurrection, the people who were arrested were given a general amnesty. The Hon. Johnston Fernando mentioned the other day that Pillayan was a political prisoner. He was not a political prisoner; he was under arrest on suspicion of murder of the Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham. Also, there are other people who have been pardoned. Sergeant Sunil Ratnayake who was charged with murder and sentenced was pardoned. Cases against some of these political prisoners have still not been filed; they are still being detained without charges being filed.

As you may have been aware, we had a campaign called "From Pottuvil to Polikandy" from the 03rd to the 07th of February, -last week. One of the primary requests that was put forward by the people who joined that protest was the release of these political prisoners. In Kilinochchi, there were some people who were relatives of those who had surrendered to the Army at the Vadduvakal paalam during the last days of the war and along with them, there were the parents of the youngsters who were arrested on the 27th of November last year for posting photos on Facebook. Their genuine concern was the release of those arrested. The people who were arrested back in the day and those who surrendered to the Army in 2009- all of them were taken by the armed forces. On the 27th of November last year, nearly 40 odd youngsters were arrested for posting photos on Facebook and so on and so forth. Still, no charges have been filed against them as well. So, naturally, there is a concern that in a few years, those boys could also go missing because they were arrested.

So, my question is, why are there two laws? The law is being enforced differently for certain people and why are these cases not being expedited? As the Prime Minister, I know that you have the capacity to do it and you are genuinely concerned about these people. I would like to see you, as the Prime Minister of this country, take some action regarding this because you are the only one who can do this; we have 100 per cent faith in you. This was an election promise that was put forward. It was not just the TNA who was asking for this, but also the nearly 100,000 people who joined the march "From Pottuvil to Polikandy"and one of the main slogans or requests was the release of the political prisoners. Likewise, even with regard to the Easter Sunday attacks, there are people who have been detained for almost two years with no cases being filed against them.

So, my first Supplementary Question, Sir, is what is happening to them? Are they going to be released? The Presidential Election had been won by you and you have got a two-thirds majority and these matters were used for politics. Are you all going to hold these people in prison just for political mileage or is there a plan? That is my first Question, Sir.

... ( ) ( ... - ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry - Minister of Justice) With the permission of the Hon. Prime Minister, I would like to answer that Question of the Hon. Member of Parliament.

Immediately after the 2009 defeat of the LTTE, there were about 12,843 LTTE suspects who surrendered to the Government.

The Government, as a policy, rehabilitated them and put them back to the society; all of them were reintegrated into the society. They were given skills training and they, including 600 child soldiers, are now, more or less, living in harmony with the rest of the people. So, throughout, that has been the policy of the Government.

1111 1112

2021 50

As the Hon. Prime Minister very clearly explained, there are no political prisoners in this country detained anywhere, but there are a few people who have been charged, detained or whose cases are pending under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. I would like to bring to the attention of the Hon. Speaker and also the Hon. Member of Parliament that I submitted a list of all such people who have been either detained or whose cases are pending consequent to a Question raised by the Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan a few days ago. I will resubmit that list and give you a copy for your information.

Furthermore, Hon. Member, on the direction of His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister, about couple of weeks ago, the Minister of Public Security and I had a discussion with the Hon. Attorney-General and also His Lordship the Chief Justice on your concern. One is, how to expedite those cases - we also believe that those cases have to be quickly disposed of; we cannot keep them eternally on remand - and the other is, to file cases against those who have charges. Therefore, if someone says that we have deliberately kept them behind, it is not correct. It is a very limited number and the charges against them are very high and grievous. Also, the Hon. Attorney-General has been asked to look into those individually. So, Hon. Member, we will keep you and the House updated on the progress of the cases.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) It is very ironic that the Hon. Minister of Justice is responding to these Questions when his own communitys issues including the "Janaza issue cannot be resolved by himself and the Hon. Prime Minister. - [Interruption.] Please, this is not your time. Also, you said that it was on very serious or grievous concerns that they are detained. But, some of them have been detained most recently for posting photos and poems on Facebook. I am very shocked to hear that it is a grievous crime.

Then, I would like to move on to my second Supplementary Question. As you know, during the protest march from Pottuvil to Polikandy, while we were going through Mullaitivu, Mannar and Kilinochchi, it was clearly evident that there are so many military camps. With regard to the military camps, the Hon. Prime Minister said that he is unable to disclose information due to security concerns. I understand that. But, however, there are so many military camps throughout the North and the East. But, I would say that this Governments primary slogan was establishing national security. So, if this Government is able to establish national security, I wonder why there is such a need for so many camps. But, at the same time, why are we not worried about setting up some camps in Colombo and Hambantota? Like I mentioned in my Parliamentary speeches, Tamils and Muslims in this country would not be the threat to this Government in the near future. We are giving out plots of lands in the South and in Colombo to different countries. So, why do we not set up some army camps and camps of other security forces around those ports and districts as well? Because like I mentioned earlier, they would be a threat to this Government in the future. I am sorry if I am

offending anyone by saying this, but these are all concerns, not just of mine, but also of others. These are not questions I am asking for myself. I do not have any family members or friends who are political prisoners or who have been affected by this.

Even in the Divisional Secretariat Office and the Irrigation Department Office in Kaluwanchikudy in the Batticaloa District - [Interruption.] I will ask my Question. This House wastes a lot of time on random issues. There are a lot of Hon. Members who waste time on random issues. These are genuine questions of the people. - [Interruption.] You mind your own business. You are not the Prime Minister. So, my Question is - [Interruption.] Please! People who want to be the Prime Minister of this country can talk. I am asking this Question from the Prime Minister. The Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan is not the Prime Minister. - [Interruption.] You are also not the Prime Minister. So, let me finish my Question. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Order, please!

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) : .

() ( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Suren Raghavan) Ask the Question directly. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) I will. Do not waste my time; do not waste the time of this House. This House wastes a lot of time on unnecessary issues every day. I have observed that so many unnecessary issues are being raised. I get this opportunity, maybe, once a year. We only get the opportunity to ask a Question from the Hon. Prime Minister, maybe, once a year because there is only - [Interruption.] Just mind your business, Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan. You have been appointed on the National List to Parliament.

() ( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Suren Raghavan) It is my business as well to ask questions.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) You are shouting because you came on the National List. Just mind your own business. I did not come on the National List; I have been elected by the public. You are just trying to build up your political career. I have already been elected to Parliament by votes. Unlike you, I did not

1113 1114

come on the National List; I was elected by votes. Let me finish my Question. . My Question is, - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Order, please! ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa) Hon. Rasamanickam, without making statements, just ask your Question. Then, we can answer that Question.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Sir, I cannot finish asking my Question. Thank you. - [Interruption.] Listen to the Hon. Prime Minister.

My Question is, will these private lands, Government lands and State buildings like the Irrigation Department Office, the Divisional Secretariat Office in Kaluwanchikudy occupied by the security forces ever be released or are you going to hold on to them so that you can show the South that there is a major national security threat in the North and the East, which is not there? That is my Question.

() ( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Suren Raghavan) Finally. ( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) You worked enough for your appointment on the National List.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) You have finished asking your Question.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) What is the point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera, you cannot say that it is not true. There are such lands. You just came into the House; you just walked in. You did not listen to the entire Question. So, do not say that I am saying untruth. Sir, that is it and thank you. I just wanted to make the point that I was not lying. He just walked in and did not even listen to the entire Question. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Nimal Lanza - State Minister of Rural Roads and Other Infrastructure) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Nimal Lanza, what is the point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Lanza) . : : . 38. () " " . : . .

But, before you give a ruling, I want you to consider this aspect as well. I would like the officials also to advise you. Now, the matter concerning contempt of court as far as the Supreme Court is concerned, the matter he raised, is a question of affirming the rule and that is quite different from any other

conviction. As a matter of fact, the position had been taken before courts now that with regard to affirmation of a rule, the punishment does not amount to a conviction per se as far as the interpretation of the law relating to imprisonment of Members of Parliament is concerned. The imprisonment over that matter is for a very lengthy period, which was a very unexpected thing and we feel that it is up to the Government. I am sure - the Hon. Minister of Justice is here - it is high time now that we enact a contempt of court law in the country because a matter of contempt of court cannot be just left to the discretion of court to interpret as they please. The Law Commission has already examined this matter and there is already a draft law available in the Ministry of Justice. I hope you will quickly bring it to Parliament.

Then, you also have to look at the question of having a permanent sentencing policy law because the sentencing policy also differs from court to court now. So, it is a matter of concern for the entire country and in this case, it was certainly felt by everybody that it was a very excessive punishment going beyond the thing. We have heard that when contempt of court matters occurred, there had been times when people had just been asked to be imprisoned for the day. That is what happens. The gravity of the matter, in the consideration of courts, would have been somewhat grave, but still, this matter seems to be too excessive. Anyway, these are matters for us to argue in courts. But, the fact that the issue relating to the matter is an affirmation of rule and it is not a conviction must be considered in view of the fact that a Member of Parliament who has been convicted for murder has already been allowed to come to this House. So, that is one matter I would like to urge.

The other thing is about this new issue, the Presidential Commission Report to be tabled in Parliament. This is a matter regarding which several Party Leaders and Members of Parliament of the current Parliament as well as other party leaders outside Parliament have all been named and that a Special Presidential Commission has also been appointed with instructions to consider whether the civic rights of those Members could be removed. So, now, the guillotine is hanging over all of our necks. And it is pertinent because the other Presidential Commission relating to political victimization is connected to that. According to the Special Presidential Commission Law, finally, it is the Parliament which votes to take away the civic rights of the people concerned. So, therefore it is a matter for Parliament and you cannot deny the rights of those people and then just leave us in abeyance without producing the Report. So, forthwith, by tomorrow or the day after, the Report must be produced in Parliament so that we would be able to examine it. That is a very important matter. I hope the Hon. Speaker will speak to the Presidents Office and the Leader of the House will also take it up.

Now, let me also add to the last matter which was raised regarding the Hon. Sumanthirans protection. That is a matter relating to intelligence. I am sure the Minister of Public Security is quite aware that there are intelligence reports regarding threats to the life of the Hon. Sumanthiran. That is why special protection was

1169 1170

given to him. In the past, so many Hon. Members of Parliament like the Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar and the Hon. (Dr.) Neelan Tiruchelvam were murdered. Of course, the LTTE may not be there, but - we all know the stand of the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran and his political stand - there are certain extremist elements on both sides who are opposed to him. So, there is a real danger. And I do not think this kind of impulsive decision should be taken just because the Hon. Member took part in a procession where legitimate political issues were raised. So, this is a very impulsive decision going to the extent of taking revenge politically. But, when there is an intelligence report - I am sure that the Hon. Minister concerned is aware that there is still a threat to Hon. Sumanthirans life - it is incumbent on you, Sir, as the custodian of our rights to see that the Hon. Sumanthirans security is restored forthwith. You have to give an instruction now. I do not think we can rely on the Hon. Minister. So, Sir, you have to tell the Hon. Minister not to resort to taking such impulsive decisions.

Thank you. () ( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera) that this is not a matter of taking revenge.

( ) (An Hon. Member) Otherwise, what is it? () ( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera) You cannot take revenge - [Interruption.] No, this has nothing to do with revenge. -[Interruption.] You had better wait till I answer.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I just want to - [Interruption.] Hon. Nimal Lanza, just give me a moment. I will finish soon.

Sir, I just want to clarify only a few things. Firstly, criticizing a court order can be done, not only in this House but outside also. That is possible; we can do that. We always do that. So, there is no bar to criticizing a judgment. That exercise happens in a very decent way.

Secondly, with regard to the Report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry, that inquiry has gone against the conduct of several Members of Parliament and therefore, it is incumbent on yourself, Sir, as the Hon. Speaker to make that Report available in Parliament.

Thirdly, with regard to the removal of my special security, I heard the Hon. Minister of Public Security say that I have violated court orders. I want to clarify that. These court orders were obtained under Section 106 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. It has to be against named persons or against a person. In all of these court orders, I have now found out that there are several persons' names; in some place, names of 14 people and in another place, eight people and so on. So, there is no court order against me anywhere; there is not a single court order against me. Therefore, I have not violated any single court order. But, even if I did, that is no reason to remove the special security accorded to me on account of a threat assessment that they themselves have done.

The Hon. Minister was good enough, just one month ago, to send me a note, meet me outside in the Lobby and tell me that the threat still persists. I do not want to reveal other details for security reasons. He told me the details, that the threat persists even now, told me to be careful and he increased my security. In fact, I do not know whether you did it, Hon. Minister, but in certain areas, it was not just the contingent given to me, but there were additional STF personnel. In some areas, motorbike contingents came and covered me because they had information about those particular areas.

Yesterday, I mentioned in this House that three, four cases are pending in court. One case is under the PTA. Four persons have been indicted for attempting on my

1175 1176

[ ]

2021 50

life. That case is going on. I am about to give evidence in that court. More than 30 persons are in remand for attempting on my life. I did not know that I was that important. But, this is what the State has done. I have not made even a single complaint. All this has been done according to the State and the Hon. Minister, just one month ago, privately warned me that that threat still persists. If that is so, then, I do not think it lies well in the mouth of the Minister to say We gave him a pardon once. Now, we cannot. What is their pardon? What is there to give a pardon? I do not need any pardon from anybody. I have not done anything wrong. If there is a threat to my life - you yourself have said it - then, it is incumbent on the State to provide me with that special security which you deemed necessary. How I behave is of no relevance to the matter of granting me security and if anything should happen to me - I said this yesterday also - it is the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera who will be held personally responsible.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Speaker, - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Eran Wickramaratne? ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Speaker, I would like to appeal to you and also to my friend, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera, that the Members of Parliament be protected irrespective of who they are, from where they are and what background they come from, whether it is from a terrorist background or non-terrorist background. Once they are elected Members of Parliament, they should all be protected only based on a threat assessment. We should not go by the principle of whether they have infringed on the law or not because if we go by that principle, we would find that many Members of Parliament here would have infringed the law at some stage or the other.

Our profession is such that as politicians, when we work, we sometimes have to take action thinking of the greater cause and sometimes, it gets justified only after we have taken the action. Therefore, I would appeal that the Hon. Sumanthirans matter be carefully looked at purely on the basis of threat assessment and nothing else and that principle be applied to all Members of Parliament, whoever they may be. Otherwise, if we have a dispute with former President Maithripala Sirisena, who is sitting here now, tomorrow we might be trying to decide whether he should be protected or not. There is no question about the need for him to be protected because of the position he held, irrespective of whether we had agreed with him or not. I am drawing it just as an example to establish the principle that all Members of Parliament must be protected based on the threat assessment.

Hon. Speaker, I would like to conclude by raising this matter too. As we know, there has been a special Presidential Commission of Inquiry and its Report has not

been tabled in Parliament yet. In three months, there may be another Resolution brought in to this Parliament and that could be voted on. That is a possibility. It is unfortunate that we had this incident occurring 40 years ago with regard to Madam Sirimavo Bandaranaike and I speak irrespective of political parties. I was only a student when that happened to Madam Bandaranaike. For 40 years in this House, we, on both sides of the House, have been criticizing that decision and I do not think that we should leave any room for such things to happen again. Therefore, I join the Hon. Leader of the Opposition in asking that the Report be tabled and also I would like to say that the Report must be tabled in its full form, including the typographical errors and the subsequent amendments that were made. All of these should be tabled immediately in the House so that we could debate it rather than having it given at the last minute and a Resolution being passed, which Resolution we would be voting on without having had enough time to actually consider. So, please consider this, Sir. Thank you.

That is what happened a few years ago.
