2021

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Sumanthiran? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir.

Without taking too much time, Sir and without going into any debate, I want to just flag one or two issues concerning the responsibility of Parliament in this regard. But before I do that, I am bound, by law and tradition, to disclose my interest in the matter. - I am the Counsel who appeared for the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake in the Supreme Court. I was privileged to appear for a clean, honest politician in Court and I am proud of that. Nevertheless, he has been convicted and sentenced. The sentence of four years' rigorous imprisonment is unprecedented and exceptionally severe.

Parliament has a responsibility in this regard because we have not enacted a law for contempt of court. This has an implication to the Article in the Constitution that the Hon. Leader of the Opposition just mentioned because it states for an offence for which the prescribed punishment is two years or more. There is nothing prescribed in the law because for long, Parliament has failed to enact a legislation for contempt of court. Although there have been in the public realm a lot of instances where even drafts have been made, we have not done that. That is one. By failing to do that, it has been like a freedom of the wild ass; anything can be given as a sentence and that is not a good thing.

I do not want to go into the merits of the case or anything like that, but in this case, Parliament has to take steps to enact a law. English Law is supposed to be the substantive law because we do not have a statute law now. In English Law itself, scandalizing the court is no longer an offence of contempt of court. Unfortunately, the Court disregarded that and has misdirected itself. That is my position. Therefore, I want to bring to your notice that serious lacuna in the law with regard to a statute for contempt of court, which has resulted in this unprecedented injustice to an honest Member of Parliament.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) ? . . . .

I will quote Article 89 of the Constitution because the Hon. Leader of the Opposition brought it to the attention of this House. Article 89(d) is very clear. I will quote it so that you could take an informed decision. This is what Article 89 states, I quote:

No person shall be qualified to be an elector at an election of the President, or of the Members of Parliament or to vote at any Referendum, if he is subject to any of the following disqualifications, namely -

Then, Article 89(d) states, I quote:

if he is serving or has during the period of seven years immediately preceding completed serving of a sentence of imprisonment (by whatever name called) ..."

"By whatever name called".

"......for a term not less than six months imposed after conviction by any court for an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term not less than two years or is under sentence of death or is serving or has during the period of seven years immediately preceding completed the serving of a sentence of imprisonment for a term not less than six months awarded in lieu of execution of such sentence:

Provided that if any person disqualified under this paragraph is granted a free pardon such disqualification shall cease from the date on which the pardon is granted;

Sir, it is very clear that the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake is presently serving a sentence. Unfortunately in his case, unlike in the case of the Hon. Premalal Jayasekara, it is the Supreme Court which sentenced him. The Supreme Court is the apex court of this country. Since 1972, we do not have any other appeal process to Britain or to the Privy Council. So, there is no appeal pending. That is the difference which I want to bring to your attention.

It is also important to note that the Supreme Court is given that power in terms of the Constitution. I will quote Article 105(3) of the Constitution, which is very important because all of us, including you, have given an Oath to uphold and defend the Constitution. Article 105(3) very clearly states, I quote:

The Supreme Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka and the Court of Appeal of the Republic of Sri Lanka shall each be a superior court of record and shall have all the powers of such court including the power to punish for contempt of itself, whether committed in the

693 694

court itself or elsewhere, with imprisonment or fine or both as the court may deem fit.

Sir, here, power had been conferred on the Supreme Court is unlimited; it had been given by Parliament itself. So, until that law is in operation, unfortunately that would be the situation. I understand the matters the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran brought before this House, that there is no contempt of court law in this country. Maybe. That is a matter to be taken up on another day. We might have to discuss that later and bring about that statute. Until such time, what is there in the Constitution itself is very clear. The Supreme Court has done it; the Supreme Court is the apex court; the Supreme Court has the power to do so; we have conferred that power on it; the Supreme Court had given a hearing and the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran himself, as he claimed today, represented the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake. So, it was after a proper hearing the sentence was given.

I am not a great fan of contempt of court, I agree with you, but it is a necessary evil. I went through the judgment itself where the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran had very correctly pointed out and referred to certain judgments, in which the Privy Council set aside the Sri Lankan judgment when it came to constructive criticism. So, you can constructively criticize, but if you go beyond your limit and if you want to scandalize the court, I do not think that court can sit idle and wait because if so, nobody would take the court seriously and respect the law.

So, as the Hon. Members pointed out, it is important that we protect and preserve the dignity of all three institutions: the Judiciary, the Executive and Parliament. Therefore, to that extent, it is important that we preserve the Constitution.

So, I bring those matters to the Hon. Speakers concern because the law is very clear. Nothing has happened against the law; nothing has happened above the law and it all had happened in terms of the Constitution and the laws promulgated by this particular House. As long as that is the law, we are all bound by that law. That is all I would like to say.

- - . ? . . . 66 2, . . I do not mean to challenge the knowledge of the Hon. Minister of Justice as far as judicial issues are concerned. But, you also have to understand the fact that the Constitution does not prescribe a specific punishment for contempt of court. That is amply illustrated, if you read the specific provisions of the Constitution.

. . . . . . ; . . . . . ?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) Hon. Speaker, .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Before you speak. may I - ... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) Okay. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, while supporting what the Hon. Leader of the Opposition said with regard to the non-attendance of the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake today - that is the only issue that he raised and that is what the Hon. Speaker is asked to act on - I would like to say that there were so many things raised about the Constitution, its meaning and all

the rest of it. I only want to commend the Hon. Members to read Article 125 of the Constitution which states that the Supreme Court has sole and exclusive jurisdiction to interpret the Constitution. So, whatever we may say in this House, eventually, the Supreme Court will have to interpret those provisions. Therefore, I just want to draw the attention of the House to that. But, the matter that is being raised and being supported by me is only the non-presence of an Hon. Member of Parliament today in the House. That is all.

Thank you, Sir. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) One matter which I want to clarify to the Hon. Leader of the Opposition is, normally, other Acts prescribe a maximum punishment which could be given for a particualr offence. If it is kept open, that means power would be enormous, power would be more than that. So, the Supreme Court can decide what to be given. I do not say it is right or wrong. But, that is the law; that is a part of the Constitution and that is how it is now. Therefore, we cannot interpret and say that because it had not been defined, the Supreme Court could not have given it. The Supreme Court could have given anything.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Death sentence also. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) Exactly. If it is warranted or the court wanted, even death sentence could be given. That is how the Constitution is now. So, let us look at it when bringing in the new Constitution.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. S.B. Dissanayake) - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) .. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. Speaker, let me quick reply to the - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, you can reply later.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir.

Arising from what the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake just said, we have enacted a law which says that for any criminal conviction, here must be at least one appeal. So, that is a provision of law in our statue books. There can be an appeal from this order and that will be made and therefore, it is wrong to say that there is no appeal from this.

with the Supreme Court. So, let the Supreme Court do its duty. But, what I am trying to say is, there is no specific punishment that is specifically prescribed in the Constitution with regard to contempt of court.

I do not want to go into any other details for a longer time, but what I am trying to impress upon the Hon. Speaker is this. . . ? .

We have a statute called ICCPR Act. In that, we have accepted a principle that with regard to any criminal matter, there must be at least one appeal. That has been enacted as law in our country. That is why I said that there are whole lot of lacuna in this area of contempt of court. It is true, the Supreme Court is the apex court, but we also have a principle that this Parliament has enacted subsequently where it is said that in any criminal matter,

707 708

2021

there must be at least one appeal. So, those are matters that needs to be canvassed in the Supreme Court, as to whether the Supreme Court itself can act as an Appeal Court. In several jurisdictions, the Supreme Court, the highest Court, has two divisions; they hear appeals also. So, in keeping with the principle of ICCPR Act that Parliament has enacted, there must be at least one appeal for any criminal conviction. So, I am saying this to the Hon. Minister of Justice to have that also in mind.
