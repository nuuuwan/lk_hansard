Is there any epidemiological or political reason as to why the alert level for COVID-19 in Sri Lanka has not been raised to level 4? We are interested to know that. Admit that there is community spread. Instruct the public accordingly. Close the borders till the epidemic is arrested. We need to save the lives of our people. This is what we have to do.

City possesses many potentials and advantages for being a financial centre in the Asia-Pacific Region and from 2011 to 2017, the proportion of the unskilled workforce has reduced from 38 per cent to 21 per cent of the total labour force. More astoundingly, the proportion of highly educated workforce grows from 18.9 per cent to 25 per cent. Also, Singapore has been growing as a key Asian financial centre. Dubai has been growing as a key Middle East financial centre. For a long time, there had been a very dry spot in between. This long due need will now be served by the Colombo International Finance Centre of the Port City. . , . Finances are not limited to one country, Hon. Speaker. It deals with the entire international community. With the available resources, this will be extended to facilitate our immediate neighbours too in the SAARC, the BIMSTEC and the IORA. As the Minister of Foreign of Sri Lanka, I wish to take this opportunity to invite, as the Hon. Prime Minister also requested, all Sri Lankans, business entrepreneurs to take steps for investment in the Colombo International Financial Centre.

(a) In order to attain the policy objective of creating a Special Economic Zone within the reclaimed land area and enhancing ease of doing business, it is important that the Port City land must operate outside the authority of the Colombo Municipal Council....

Then, Sir, I would like to make my submissions in English because it is important that the International Community understands what the benefits we are accruing out of the Colombo Port City are. The new Port City will comprise five main urban precincts or districts, namely, the International Island, the Island Living, the Central Park Living, the Financial District and the Marina. It is the single biggest private sector development in the country and is expected to transform Colombo into a commerce, tourism and a cultural hub. The International Island will be a commercial and leisure destination, featuring a resort and a theme park, a convention and exhibition centre, healthcare and education facilities as well as a waterway park. The Island Living district will feature villa-style residences and public parks. , public park . Galle Face . upset , . . .

[2.11 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya - State Minister of Regional Co-operation) Hon. Presiding Member, now that the Sarath vs Sarath battle has been halted temporarily, I thank you for granting me nine minutes of the time of this House to speak on the subject matter, the Bill which has been presented before us. I see this Bill as a turning point in the economic progress of this country.

Before I commence my speech, I would like to take a moment to remember all those who had perished in the final stages of the war on terrorism. I would like to pay my respects to the gallant war heroes and the people who sacrificed so much for so long. The 30-year conflict not only stole from our people their lives and livelihoods, but also stole us our future. What was far more damaging was the opportunity for economic progress, which we lost. We had to enviously look at other nations forging ahead of us and wonder when we would achieve that success. So, it is that potential we are striving to achieve; it is that promise we are working to fulfill and it is that prosperity we are trying to make a reality.

The Colombo Port City Project reflects that vision and today, we stand on the cusp of actioning a project that can be a game changer for this country. Sri Lanka has been involved in global trade for centuries. From the time we walked into school as children, we have been speaking of the potential that Sri Lanka has to stand at the centre of global trade given its strategic placement. While we have been open for business for so long, we have fallen far behind our regional competitors with the likes of Singapore and Dubai rising to global prominence. These are countries that we, at one point, claimed modelled their development agenda based on our development. Today, unfortunately, we can only look on them in admiration.

Hon. Presiding Member, this kind of legislation is not something alien. Special Economic Zones have been put in place in a number of countries across the world and a number of them are already in place within our region alone. Particularly, what is interesting to note is that the number of SEZs have increased drastically during the last 25 years. In 1995, there were approximately 500 SEZs around the world. It is estimated that now, there are more than 6,000 SEZs and a two-thirds of them are based in Asia. The facilities offered by these SEZs tend to vary with, I believe, countries like Azerbaijan even enforcing the British Commercial Law within some of their SEZs. However, the point that needs to be noted is that each of these SEZs has a unique selling proposition. For example, in certain African countries, SEZs are located close to raw materials. So, that is their unique selling proposition.

In South Asia, India has over 240 operational SEZs and in Gujarat, they are currently building a city similar to that of the Port City. It is estimated that Bangladesh has over 88 SEZs and Pakistan has around 46. The concept of

807 808

Special Economic Zones has brought glaring success to China as well. The City of Shenzhen is probably the best example for that. In the past 40 years, Shenzhen has been transformed from a fishing town of less than a 30,000 population to the third largest city in China with a population of more than 12 million and a GDP of more than four times that of Sri Lanka. Not only that, it is probably the most technologically advanced city in the world with mobile payments virtually replacing cash.

There are a number of considerations that any business makes in planning their investments. Among those, priority is given to the countrys rule of law, infrastructure and connectivity, but most importantly, its ease of doing business and policy stability are considered. How does Sri Lanka rank in some of these areas? According to the World Banks Ease of Doing Business Report, Sri Lanka is ranked 99 out of 190 countries and the World Bank ranks Sri Lanka at 164 out of 190 for its legal system and for taking, on average, nearly four years to enforce a contract. Given that, it is clear that there is a need for a solution for those shortcomings.

We believe that this Bill sets the foundation to make Sri Lanka the next big global investment hub through the establishment of the Colombo Port City Economic Commission. The potential opportunities that will arise as a result of the Colombo Port City Project have been spoken of in depth in this House. Similarly, the pros of establishing a special Economic Commission to manage the Port City have also been spoken of. Most of the objections that the Opposition has pointed out arise out of providing plenipotentiary powers to this Commission. I have pointed out the need and the case to provide such powers.

Prior to the Presidential Election in 2019, many in the benches across the aisle made unfounded allegations against His Excellency the President. It is unfortunate that in this national developmental initiative also they have decided to once again spread falsehood. I heard an Hon. Member of the Opposition from the Kurunegala District stating that this reclaimed land would become a separate State. Some Hon. Members in the Opposition claim that this land belongs to China. The Members of the Opposition seem to forget that a great number of the Clauses of this Bill were agreed to by the then Yahapalana Government. The decision to renegotiate the current holding of the land by the stakeholders was also negotiated by the Y ahapalana Government. Following an unnecessary suspension, it was the Y ahapalana Government that thought it was prudent to continue with this project as well.

It is interesting to note that many who are speaking against the Colombo Port City Economic Commission Bill today are also those who spoke against the national interest at the United Nations. They were the same people who proposed federal Constitutions; they were the same people who were happy to pass Resolutions against this country and betray our very people.

Please note that this Government has followed the due process in bringing this Bill. The Government gazetted the initial Bill and allowed it to be challenged in court, following which a Ruling has now been given. The same way we have abided by this procedure up to now, we will continue to do so. The Government has already informed the Supreme Court through the Attorney-General that the Supreme Courts recommendations will be adhered to and those Amendments will moved at the Committee Stage.

It is of paramount importance that we remember that the process of Sri Lankas economic revival has not been straightforward. The COVID-19 pandemic has made this situation worse. Building the economy is not something that we can do overnight, but instead, it is a process of taking risks and learning from our mistakes.

The Port City Project is the same. We are all looking to get the best deal for Sri Lanka and to do so, we must embark on an evolving process. We note that there can be certain legitimate reasons inherent with SEZs, which we have to be wary of. Issues such as a two-level tax system within an economy can create tax distortions. Entrepreneurs might find innovative ways of reducing their tax burden, thus reducing Government's revenue and distorting a level playing field.

This Government believes in an economic growth that is not just reflected in numbers, but one that contributes to the improvement of the lives of ordinary people and one that sees new opportunities and opens new doors. We are confident that this Bill and this Project will do just that.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . 10 . [.. 2.19] (, , , ) ( - , , , , ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe - State Minister of Samurdhi, Household Economy, Micro Finance, Self-employment and Business Development) , . , , . .

Hon. Presiding Member, I thank you for giving me some time to speak on this Colombo Port City Economic Commission Bill.

I would like to say at the outset that unlike most Members of the Opposition, we look at this Bill through somewhat different lenses. Our view is that Sri Lanka, being a small country, needs to think innovatively, if it wants to compete globally. Particularly given the current pandemic situation where the global economy itself is in recession, Sri Lanka will have to do that much more, if it is to be competitive. So, when you look at things from that perspective, our view is that to think in terms of Special Economic Zones or whatever name you want to call it and to think in terms of being so innovative that you need to, even at times, look for Amendments to the Constitution or bring in certain laws that require a two-thirds majority or even, for that matter, a Referendum in order to create that space is not a wrong thing. This Constitution is 73 years old and you have already made 20 Amendments to that. The problems are increasing; divisions are getting worse within the country; polarization is getting worse. This is a defunct Constitution. Our position is that this Constitution is currently kept alive purely on emotional grounds, purely on ethnic grounds. It does not make sense for you to centralize in this way. So, in that sense, actually the idea of creating a Port City, looking at it in a totally different way to create Foreign Direct Investments, using it even as a laboratory to create job opportunities and to create capacity building where the rest of the country has failed, is not a bad thing at all.

Madam, we are opposing this Bill. If this Bill was actually intended to generate economic growth, if it has been brought in with that as the primary objective, then, quite honestly, I do not think there is anything wrong. We are a party which has stated for quite some time that this unitary Constitution is defunct; it is not relevant in todays era. This concept of sovereignty, in the sense or the way in which this Government talks of it - the chief Opposition, very unfortunately, tries to outwit the Government when it talks about sovereignty - and which you want to hug onto is a defunct concept. You cannot go on to be a part of the global economy and then also want to close yourself from it. So, those are issues that have to

815 816

be thought anew. This Constitution itself is something that has to be thought anew. If this country is to compete in an era such as this, then, taking drastic measures is something that ought to be welcomed.

So, we are not opposing this Bill for the reasons that the Government officially states they are bringing this Bill for. Make no mistake, we are opposing the Bill, but we are not opposing it for the reasons this Government states it is actually bringing this Colombo Port City Economic Commission Bill for. The reality, Madam, is that there is no such thing as a free lunch. In todays world, there is no such thing as a free lunch and the fact remains that this Government, like the previous Mahinda Rajapaksa Government, has been the primary party in Sri Lanka which has, thus far, chosen to challenge the geopolitical balance that has remained a constant almost since the British departed this country. The reality is that the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government had been and now, the Gotabaya Rajapaksa Government is China-centric; there is no running away from it. They are so China-centric that they use ideally good concepts which could actually be used for the benefit of the economy of the country in its most genuine sense to rather compromise this countrys geopolitical strategic position in order to give an advantage to China. That is the reality that we contest. Madam, when a previous Government of the J. R. Jayewardene Era chose to join the war of the United States, again there was a geopolitical contestation that took place. That geopolitical contestation took place to a point where our neighbouring power, India, chose to support the armed struggle in order to create leverage to prevent Sri Lanka from drifting more and more towards the United States. That is the reality. In order to prevent Sri Lanka from becoming a US hub during the Cold War Era, you had the adjoining superpower or the regional power looking for leverage. Today, you have created a situation where you have already brought into this country a power that is contesting the hegemony of the neighbourhood, a power that is choosing to challenge the current geopolitical balance that has existed in this region. That is what you are doing and that, we oppose because more than anyone else in this Island, it is the Tamil nation that has suffered the most by your geopolitical extravaganzas. We do not want that to happen again; we do not want to be a party to that. And, it is for that reason that we oppose this Bill.

May I also say this, Madam. Here is the tragedy; here is the racism and here is the communalism that most majority Members of this House are reeking of.

In the height of the peace process, with regard to the LTTE-controlled areas, under the Ceasefire Agreement, in order to facilitate talks, there was a concept of an ISGA - an Interim Self-Governing Authority - offered. The Governments concerns were prepared to consider federalism on paper and it was in that background that the LTTE offered the ISGA as a proposal. But, you rejected that. As an interim measure, you rejected it. You chose to destroy, you chose to commit genocide in order to prevent the Tamil people, in some way, getting some sentiment of

self-governance. But today, you have no qualms, no hesitation of creating a similar concept for other purposes - as I said, there is no free lunch - of serving the interests of competing global geopolitical powers. And that is the racism that this House reeks of, Madam. So, it is on that basis and it is in that same spirit that we reject this Bill, and we hope that the Sinhalese people will realize the irony and the tragedy in what is happening today. Thank you.

. 1978 .. Greater Colombo Economic Commission . . , . .. . It states as follows:

Constitution of Commission. 6. (1) The Commission shall consist of give members to be appointed by the President, one of whom shall be appointed the Director-General of the Commission.

.

(4) The President may, in his absolute discretion - this is President J.R. Jayewardene - and without assigning any reason therefore, by Order published in the Gazette, remove any member with effect from the date of such publication.

.. , .. , . . , . , . ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , .. . 12 . [3.29 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, for giving me an opportunity to speak on this Bill. Before I commence my comments on the Bill itself, I must place on record our protest at having this Debate at a time like this when there is a third wave of COVID-19, when many experts have publicly declared that the alert level should be level 4 and not level 3. Professor Malik Peiris and Prof. Gamini Mendis have jointly issued a statement to the public. The Government has failed to adhere to professional advice in this matter, all for the sake of hurriedly having this Bill enacted in Parliament today.

There is a lot of talk about why this landmass still remains a part of the country. Government speakers have repeatedly asked the question as to why focus is being

835 836

made on Chinese when anyone can come and invest in this artificially created landmass that is annexed to the City of Colombo. When I appeared in the determination of the Bill before the Supreme Court, I asked their Lordships the question as to why they were wasting their time, trying to determine on a Bill that related to a place which is not a part of Sri Lanka, and it is that intrigue with which I speak today as well, as to why this House is deliberating on something that does not relate to Sri Lanka. I will tell you the reasons why I say that at the end of my speech. - [Interruption.] I will deal with the Supreme Court Determination on that, Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara.

With regard to the Chinese issue, just two days ago, the Hon. Shanakiyan Rasamanickam tweeted about a nameboard that was placed in this place called the "Central Park", which is in Sinhala, English and Chinese. Hon. Vasudeva Nananyakkara, you were the Minister of National Languages and Social Integration in the previous dispensation.

The nameboard is in Sinhala, English and Chinese. And you dare ask the question why people are saying, Chinese, Chinese in this. That is not all. When he raised that question, no Sri Lankan authority gave a reply. There is only a tweet by the Chinese Embassy. There is a tweet in reply by the Chinese Embassy saying, I quote:

We noticed an interim sign in a JV building site not abiding by trilingual rules. Request raised.

We respect all 3 official languages......., and urge Chinese companies to follow.

They are saying that they would rectify that, not your Government. What does the Chinese Embassy have to do with how nameboards are to be put in this place? They have taken responsibility; they have taken over the land and you are engaging in an exercise trying to enact law for that area.

Then, with regard to the Supreme Court Determination, the Supreme Court engages in one exercise, to go Clause by Clause to see whether it is inconsistent with any provision of the Constitution. You tried to avoid that also from happening. In a way, there was only one day available for anyone to invoke the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Yet, more than 20 petitions were filed. If they had not been able to do that, you would have passed the Bill in the form in which it was gazetted. For all that you say about the Legislature and its powers and the supremacy of Parliament, you had given powers to make rules, even criminal laws to punish people to that Commission.

The Supreme Court has ruled that out as requiring even a Referendum because it violates Parliaments legislative powers. Because of shortness of time, I will give you just two examples as to why the Supreme Court Determination is not so relevant to us today. When we make laws, we not only look at the constitutionality, but we also have to look at desirability and what is good for the country. Look at Clause 41. There was a lot of discussion here about Clauses 30, 33 and 40. According

to Clause 30, you require a licence to visit this place; it is there. Any person wishing to visit this place requires a licence. The Supreme Court has said, You cannot have that word visit. Take it out. But, you tried to have it. That is an additional requirement. This has to be read with Clause 74 which gives this Commission concurrent powers with several regulatory authorities and one of those regulatory authorities is the Controller of Immigration and Emigration. What has this Commission got to do with the Controller of Immigration and Emigration? What you try to sneak in was, in fact, a visa requirement and an additional licence for anybody to visit. Even now, if you have to reside in that place, you have to get a separate licence.

If you look at Clause 40, Hon. Nanayakkara, you will see border control. Now, so much you say about federal structures. Where in the world, in a federal arrangement, do you have border control between federal states? You do not have that. That is why we say this is not even federal, this goes far beyond that. It is border control. Clause 40 states that any Sri Lankan who enters that place can use Sri Lankan rupees. All that is said, but when he leaves that place, in terms of Clause 40(2), he has to pay a levy. The Supreme Court has said, No, change that, change those wordings. Do not say leaving the place, say taking the goods out . That is Customs control. Does that - "leaving the place" and "taking the goods out" - make any difference at all? If you purchase any goods, the original Draft said, Leaving the place, you must pay a levy. Now, the Supreme Court wants you to change it to taking goods out. It meant the same thing. There is no difference at all; they are cosmetic changes. That is what the Supreme Court has prescribed. But, what is more important? There is still going to be border control. That is something that you do not have. Now, you have to subject your things, your baggage to a Customs check and you have to pay a levy. If you buy something, if you buy a pizza and when you take it out, you will have to pay a levy. These are only examples that I can refer to. It is a private company. This is not a Government corporation. I heard the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris saying that this is a Government corporation. No, it is not. It has not been made one and the Supreme Court has not declared it to be one. Even the members - five or up to seven - who are to be appointed to this Commission can be foreigners. That is what the Bill states and that is what the counsel for the Secretary to the President told the Supreme Court, that even the Chief Justice can be appointed, who is a foreigner. "So, what is the big deal?, he said and the Supreme Court has not dealt with that. The Supreme Court has thought it fit not to deal with that because that has been our position right along, that there is nothing unconstitutional about appointing any foreigner to even be a judge. So, that position has been retained in the Determination of the Supreme Court. But, nevertheless, even though it is not prescribed by the Supreme Court, you are now bringing an Amendment to say that the majority of them will be Sri Lankans.

There is an argument that the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella just referred to, which Dr. Kanag-Isvaran advanced before the Supreme Court. It is in page 14 of the Determination, that this does not form part of Sri Lankas territory in terms of international law or even

837 838

[ .. ]

(11th Start)

2021 20

domestic law. The Supreme Court has dealt with that in page 19. It does not merely dismiss it, as you said. This is what it states. It states that so far, no court has ruled it to be so; so far, no court has ruled it to be that it is outside Sri Lanka. Referring to annexation of this as part of the District of Colombo, they say that presumption of validity exists pending a final decision by the court and they say that the Supreme Court exercising special jurisdiction for Determination is not that court. So, it is still open for anybody, particularly the Chinese authorities to claim this to be not a part of Sri Lanka and this Determination will assist them in that.

Finally, I will say this. I said that you would not even consider a federal arrangement, something that exists in almost 100 countries in the world. But here, you have given away a part of what you claimed to be of Sri Lanka to be a part of another country. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . .. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) I am concluding, Sir.

You say so much about Eelam, but this is Cheelam, this is Cheena. This is Cheelam where you are enacting your own laws when you even do not have jurisdiction over that territory, but declaring it and gifting a landmass in your territorial waters to China and you will reap the consequences of this. The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam was to refer to various factors about the region. I do not want to repeat that. You will reap the consequences of this injudicious act of yours very soon.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . 9 . [.. 3.41]

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Sir, the Hon. Sumanthiran in his speech said that the Supreme Court has left it open on the question of whether this reclaimed land is part of the territory of Sri Lanka. That is the Colombo Port City. This is what the Court states in very clear terms in just two lines. I quote:

"For the aforementioned reasons, Court holds that the Colombo Port City is part of the territory of Sri Lanka in terms of the law and Parliament has legislative power over the reclaimed area."

So, what an untruth he has uttered! .. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) . . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . .. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) I will read from page 19 of the Determination of the Supreme Court. It is just two lines. I quote:

"Court observes that by this Bill, the Colombo Port City has not been made part of the Administrative District of Colombo. It became part of the Administrative District of Colombo by virtue of the steps taken under the Administrative Districts Act, No. 22 of 1955 described above. Its validity has not been challenged and the presumption of validity applies."

So it is only presumption of validity that still applies. That presumption can always be taken away. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . . ( ) ( - ) (The Hon.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Sir, in regard to Clause 46 (h), when you delete lines 34 and 35 of the Clause 46.

(g), there is the word, "or" at the end of it and that word, "or" has to come at the end of the Clause 46. (f) because when you say there, in Clause 46., "... on all or any of the following businesses :-" which follows (a) (b) and so on, there has to be this word, "or" before you get on to Clause 46. (h) . But when you take off the Clause 46. (g), the word "or" is also being got rid of. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Wigneswaran, which Clause are you talking about? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) I am talking about Clause 46. (f) and Clause 46. (g). We are now getting rid of the Clause 46. (g) and at the end of the Clause 46. (g), you get the word, "or" which is an alternative with regard to the next one, (h). Therefore, this word,"or" must go at the end of the Clause 46. (f). I hope that is understood. ( ) (The Hon.
