. . . [ ] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Speaker, - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) , .. . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Thank you, Hon. Speaker.

Firstly, I would like to associate myself completely with what the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayaka stated today. I also wish to state that the only difference is that I welcome your decision to appoint a senior Committee to investigate into what happened. But, as he said, I think if you do not take it seriously and make sure that this Committee does not just prolong or drag things out without giving a finding, the behaviour of this House is going to get worse, if it is at all possible. That is the first point I want to make.

The second point I want to make is - I made this point at the Party Leaders' Meeting also - with regard to the matter of Members just standing up and raising points of Order, which opportunity is totally abused. It is a way in which a Member who is on his feet making a speech or a point is disrupted. If we do not start from there or when a Member stands up and raises a point of Order and if that point of Order is, in fact, not a point of Order and if you do not take action against that Member for wrongfully disturbing the Member on his feet, I think we cannot maintain the decorum of this House.

Then, Sir, abusive language from both sides of the House is appalling! By whoever who is in the Chair, if abusive language is used by an Hon. Member, he must be named and thrown out. If we do not start from there at least now, I think this Houses reputation is going to get far worse and it is not going to be worth us coming here.

Thank you. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. K.P.S. Kumarasiri) , , . ,

Ever since they have been first elected as MPs from the Northern Province, they have been asking for a separate State and also wanted to celebrate the Mahaviru Day. But, no one, either from the Government or the Opposition, assaulted those MPs. But now, what they are trying to say

1995 1996

to the whole world is that this Parliament is not giving them the opportunity to talk or express their opinions, obstructing them in expressing their ideas. So, Sir, that is a very bad interpretation.

But, what initially happened was, the Hon. Manusha Nanayakkara obstructed what you were doing, your conducting the House. So, actually we have to look at the primary question. Nobody has ever assaulted the Hon. Members from the Northern Province, though they are still asking for a separate State. At the same time, when the Hon. Anura Dissanayaka criticized the whole Government, we have never assault him. So, this is a wrong message sent out to the entire world. I saw the Hon. Members of the Opposition leaving the premises of the Members' Dining after having breakfast. So, there is no issue at all.

Sir, thank you for the opportunity given. ( ) (The Hon. Udayana Kirindigoda) , . , . , , . , . .

other Ministry, have not just been working for the Ministry, but have also been a guiding light to the youngest Minister in this country. For that, I am forever in their debt, especially to the Secretary to my Ministry, the staff including the DG and the Chairman of the Plantation Human Development Trust, the staff of the Saumyamoorthi Thondaman Memorial Foundation and also to the staff of the NEVIDA. All of them have made their contribution towards the Ministry and for the upliftment of the estate community. I can assure you that in the following years to come, we will not only work towards the upliftment of the estate community, but also of the community as a whole.
