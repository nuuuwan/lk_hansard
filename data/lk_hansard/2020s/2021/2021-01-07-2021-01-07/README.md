.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member, what is the point of Order? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Minister, I was the one who raised the Question under Standing Order 27(2) on the 10th of December, 2020, to which, I think, you replied. After I raised that Question, Madam, your Ministry has appointed a committee on the 24th of December. It is an Expert Committee of Virologists. A report has come out and it states that you can bury the COVID-19 victims. In fact, that committee report gives details as to how the burials must take place, how the funerals must take place and how to handle the dead bodies; all of that has come out. So, which committee report are you referring to? In fact, the committee that your Ministry appointed on the 24th of December refers to the earlier committee and says that those recommendations of the earlier committee were outdated because those recommendations were given prematurely, whereas now, there is much more substantial information on these matters. So, may I ask you on what basis you give this Reply and also could you please share with us the report that you rely on? ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Pavithradevi Wanniarachchi) , , Dr. Channa Perera, Consultant JMO, Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama, Consultant Physician, Dr. Rohan Ruwanpura, Consultant JMO, Dr. P.B.

Virologists . . , .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Minister, may I have a clarification?

I thank you for that Reply, Madam. So, you agree that the committee that was appointed on the 24th of December which consists of Prof. Jennifer Perera, Prof. Neelika Malavige and so on - there are several names and I do not want to read them out - was appointed by your Ministry, that that committee consists of Virologists who are the relevant experts who can actually pronounce on this matter, that it was a subcommittee to the main committee that you referred to and that you have referred this subcommittees report to the main committee, but the main overall committee chooses to ignore the experts who can actually pronounce an opinion on the question of whether burials can take place or not and whether it is safe - it is the virologists who are experts who can actually pronounce on it - saying that you cannot bury. Is that your Ministrys response, Madam? ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Pavithradevi Wanniarachchi) , Virologists , , . . . . , . . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) So, Madam - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) That is all, Hon. Member. She says that she has to wait till the main committee gives a decision. So, why do you want to drag it on? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Member? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) That means the committee that was appointed was not appointed by the Hon. Minister of Health, but, if I am not

mistaken, by the State Minister of Primary Health Care, Epidemics and Covid Disease Control, the Hon. (Dr.) (Mrs.) Sudarshini Fernandopulle. Am I right? ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) That is not a point of Order, anyway. ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Pavithradevi Wanniarachchi) Hon. Speaker, unofficially, they met Hon. (Dr.) (Mrs.) Sudarshini Fernandopulle. So, I called a meeting with them and they handed over their decision to me. So, I referred that decision to the main committee. That is what happened and the main committee is studying it. - [Interruption.] Sir, we cannot take political decisions on it because it totally depends on experts advice. So, we will wait for the main committees report. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Please, Hon. Member, that is enough. I think she explained it.

, . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Can the Hon. Leader of the House, on behalf of the Government, give us at least a date when this main committee will come up with the final decision? This is not an Answer to my Question under Standing Order 27 (2). ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Ponnambalam, the Hon. Minister has answered the Question in detail and she has very clearly said that the matter had been referred to the main committee and that she will come back - .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I need an Answer to my Question. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Yes, surely. We are not in courts. She said that she will come back immediately when the decision is made. That is more than enough for an assurance. I think you can take that assurance. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.L.M. Athaullah) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Ponnambalam? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Speaker, with all due respect to the Hon. Minister, I understand the difficulty that the Hon.

389 390

Minister faces. But, from my point of view, Sir, I raised that Question under Standing Order 27(2) and I have not got an Answer. The statement made by the Hon. Minister is simply that a report has been handed over to a main committee and the main committee is deliberating it. That is not an answer to my Question. So, with all due respect, I want a firm date. When experts are discussing a report, surely, it is not going to take one month. Is it going to take one month? ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Now, she has explained it. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Surely, you can give me a date, at the next Session, to give us a firm answer and produce the final decision of the committee. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) No sooner she gets the report, will she submit it to you. Do not worry. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) That is not an Answer to my Question. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Speaker, the assurance has been given by the Hon. Minister that she will come back and inform Parliament about it. That is more than enough. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, the assurance has been given. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) But, that is not an Answer. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You might not get the Answer in the way you want it. - [Interruption.] Sorry, we differ. We cannot be giving answers in the way you want. But, the Hon. Minister has considered the whole issue and given you a very clear Answer step by step.

, , let us move on to the next Item.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Leader of the House, you go ahead with moving the next Item. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Speaker ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Wait, I will give you the chance later. MINISTERIAL CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEES

All I am asking the Leader of the House is to stand to the convention and give me a date. On the last occasion, you said that the latest date would be the 05th of January, 2021. Then, on the 5th, you sent me a message saying that you will give me an Answer on the 07th. Now, you are not giving me an Answer. So, I am asking you to give me a firm date.

Today, before I speak about intellectual properties as I planned to, I would like to request for a response from anyone responsible from the Government side regarding the Orders under the Ports and Airports Development Levy Act. I hope someone would respond to that towards the end of my speech without interrupting me now. I want him to clarify why only the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport and the Katunayake International Airport have been included and why not the Jaffna International Airport. I want to understand why it is so. I hope for a clarification on that matter by someone who has the authority to do so after my speech. So, there is 10 more minutes for you to think of an answer.

The Amendments to the Intellectual Property Act, No. 36 of 2003 propose a lot of changes and give details about how beneficiaries should respect the integrity of the original work done. I want to mention in this House that we have to look at the number of original work that has been done, the number of people who have done original work and the number of applications for patents that has up come for registration. According to the National Intellectual Property Office, in the year 2019, 353 applications were made by residents for patents, out of which only 39 were registered and in the year 2020, up until August, 248 residents had applied and only 17 were registered.

We live in a nation of almost 21 million people. Have we been able to get only around 250 creative minds to apply for patents in this country? Are we that brain dead?

Are we that brain dead or have the successive Governments failed to invest in the IT industry and in intellectual properties? If you take intellectual properties, they may mostly be databases, software programmes and so many other things can come under intellectual properties. So, have we been so brain dead? Or have we not invested in this field as we do not have anyone who is capable of even applying for patents? There have been only about 200 people.

According to a report by the London School of Economics, in 2018, out of 135 multinational IT companies, one-third has established offices in Asia. Out of that one-third, how many do you think have established businesses in Sri Lanka? That is something that we all need to worry about. In 2016, only 1 per cent of our workforce had been doing jobs related to the IT industry. Unlike us, countries like India and Malaysia have capitalized on the IT industry and they have caught on to the IT boom. So much so, 45 per cent of the service revenue in Malaysia is through IT. We are not worrying about creating jobs through new technology, but we are worrying about creating jobs for political gains. I will come to that later.

If you look at simple industries, Sri Lanka still does not have access to platforms like PayPal. You cannot receive money through PayPal. PayPal is one of the fundamental things in the e-commerce platform. We can create so many entrepreneurs using PayPal. The e-commerce platforms work with PayPal. In Sri Lanka, we are not even able to get funds through PayPal. These are little things that we need to worry about and we need to fix these issues so that we can encourage youngsters to do more things. The world has evolved. We are in 2021. So, why are we not looking at this sort of things?

We speak about the LTTE being a terrorist organization. But, even the LTTE had been way ahead of the Sri Lankan Government. Way back in 2003, there was a proposal made called Vanni Tech. Experts from the Silicon Valley were brought down here to create an IT hub called Vanni Tech in the year 2003. I would like to table that proposal if anyone who is able to do something in that regard is here. They can have a look at this and I table* this document.

We are still trying to focus on the wrong issues. I went to the up-country last week; I went to Nuwara Eliya and met there a young girl. She has to spend Rs. 300 to travel to a place where there is network access for her online education. She has online classes. 300 three-wheeler , Internet . . , Wi-Fi . . , the successive Governments have failed to invest in an industry that is so crucial for the future of this country. Free Wi-Fi was supposed to be given, but it was not given. I attended a

COPE meeting last month and at that, it was revealed that the Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka had budgets up to Rs. 17,000 million, if I am not mistaken, from the year 2003. Where has all this money gone? There is not even Wi-Fi. But, there has been so much of money available. I am glad that the proposal to give Tabs to Grama Sevakas was abandoned.

But, there is something that this country has been interested in when it comes to IT, which is the TRC. IT TRC - Telecommunication Regulatory Commission - . TRC Chairman .

"'However, we are of the opinion that the virus would most probably have entered Sri Lanka through the Ukrainian flight crew members', he emphasised."

, :

"A flight crew consisting of 11 members arrived in Sri Lanka from a Turkish Airline on September 11, and was quarantined at a hotel in Seeduwa. These crew members had organized a reception inside the hotel prior to their departure. According to informed sources, people from outside too had participated in this reception.

Accordingly, one of the crew members tested positive for the virus on September 13 and admitted to IDH for treatment. Subsequently, five hotel staffers were also identified as COVID-19 positive patients. The first COVID-19 case from the Brandix apparel factory was reported on October 2, 2020 and it was a 39-year-old Brandix apparel factory worker who was identified as COVID-19 positive at Gampaha during a random test. However, she had shown symptoms since September 21."

strategic development ; Port City . . Steering Committee . And I would like to mention here that we had already prepared the draft Colombo Port City Act; It is there. I read in the newspapers that the law for the Colombo Port City Commission is going to be brought before this House very soon, which is good, and it is exactly the same that I, as the Chairman of the Steering Committee, had proposed. Maybe, you all made some changes along the way. That is all right. But, what I am saying is it is a continuation of a process. I must admit that just because Governments change, the policies we have adopted for a longer period of time need not change. I do not need to table this draft Act, but it is about setting up the Colombo Port City Commission, the business enterprises and what kind of laws they should have. .. ( ) ( .. - ) (The Hon. D.V. Chanaka - State Minister of Aviation and Export Zones Development) Madam, I rise to a point of Order.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) , . I understand monetary economics just like you do, Hon. Cabraal. You were the Governor of the Central Bank. I appreciate that. You and I both know that MV equals PQ. So, if the velocity and the output stay the same - in this case, the output is coming down - if you increase the money available, what happens is that the price goes up. This is a simple equation of monetary theory. . . . . . , . . , , . . . . expressways Secretary to the Treasury . . * ; .

I would like to quote what Mr. S. R. Attygalle, Secretary to the Treasury, had stated to the "Daily FT" of Wednesday, 23rd December, 2020. He was asked, "What reforms are you expecting in the State-Owned Enterprise sector?". State-owned enterprises .
