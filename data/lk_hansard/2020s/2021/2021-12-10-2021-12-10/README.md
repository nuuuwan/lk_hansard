COVID in late June, 2021 and during the second week of July. However, the Embassy carried out its duties as usual. (Only the two officers concerned and their family members were quarantined.)

At the moment, no Embassy staff members or family members have contracted COVID and the Embassy performs its duties with the full capacity of all its officers.

(b) (i) Yes.

(ii) Since the majority of the embassy staff and 44 of the clients in the safehouse were diagnosed with COVID-19 according to the PCR test results, action was taken to close the Embassy completely from 27.09.2020 to 07.10.2020.

The Government of Kuwait had declared 03 public holidays from 29th September to 1st October, due to the death of the King of Kuwait on 29.09.2020 and received 5 days of leave including the weekends. Accordingly, the actual number of working days that the Embassy had been kept closed is 06.

Since there could have been germs even in the Embassy premises and it could endanger people, no one was allowed in or out of the embassy premises during that week.

Steps taken to restore services:

Arrangements were made to distribute the new passports to the public on prior appointment basis, through a single counter operated by junior staff officers who had not contracted the disease, from 08th to 15th October, 2020 including the weekend.

The officers who were confirmed to have recovered by 18.10.2020 after a second PCR test were called for duty. Accordingly, action was taken to provide services starting with 35 clients per day, which was expanded by increasing the pre-allocated hours in proportion to the recall of officers who had recovered from their illness. As of 25.10.2020, almost all officers had reported for duty and arrangements were made to cater to about 50 people per day on prior appointment basis. Also, the number of service counters were increased to five and arrangements were made to provide services to the applicants who arrived without making an appointment in advance.

Although Sri Lankans have been advised to make advance arrangements for consular work, it was observed that a significant number of people came to the Embassy without following that procedure. Since it was found that this system could not succeed and that it was somewhat unfamiliar to the Sri Lankan community, arrangements were made to conduct a special duty day on Saturday, 21.11.2020 with the participation of 160 clients who had made prior appointments.

By the end of November, the Embassy staff was able to provide services to a large number of people who had been unable to obtain services at the time and the duties had returned to normal by 01st December, 2020. To this day, the Embassy continues to provide services to the general public as usual, providing a same day service.

As a measure to protect Embassy staff from external COVID infections, the service was provided to the clients of the Consular Division of the Embassy up to 1st November, 2021 through specially constructed counters. However, considering the risk of COVID in Kuwait being low at present, the working method has been brought back to normal by giving the opportunity to the clients to enter the Consular Division and obtain the services subject to proper hygienic procedures from November 01, 2021.

Services provided to the public

(1) Services provided to the inmates in the Safe House 1. Providing food and beverages 2. Giving medicines to the clients including the ones who had contracted COVID with complications during their stay in the Safe House.

3. All clients who were at the Safe House were provided with airline tickets and PCR tests before departure at the expense of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment.

(2) Steps taken to provide services to other Sri Lankans in

the country

1. The whole State of Kuwait was inactivated to control the COVID-19 pandemic and some districts were isolated from April to July, 2020. Measures were taken to distribute food aid to about 5,000 Sri Lankans who had lost their income during that period. In addition to the funds approved by the Foreign Ministry and the Bureau of Foreign Employment, dry rations were procured with the support from NGOs and private philanthropists in Kuwait.

2. Sri Lankan doctors in Kuwait were connected by telephone to provide necessary medical advice to the Sri Lankans who had been quarantined at home due to COVID-19 pandemic.

3. For the Sri Lankans who volunteered to quarantine in hotels, action was taken to remit their money to the hotels.

4. Information of Sri Lankans who wanted to be repatriated was registered by email. Government quarantine-linked flights were organized and the Sri Lankans who were registered were contacted by telephone in the order of registration and their information was collected to be referred to the Sri Lankan Airlines.

5. Issuing necessary documents to the Sri Lankans staying in Kuwait without a visa to seek treatment at hospitals.

6. Issuing necessary travel documents for the detainees at the Kuwait Deportation Centre and arranging air travel to repatriate those detainees by providing quarantine facilities in Sri Lanka.

7. According to the agreements reached with the officials of the Kuwait Deportation Centre, arrangements have been made for the nominal detention and subsequent deportation of sick Sri Lankans who were staying without visa. Such Sri Lankans who were hospitalized due to illnesses were provided with air tickets and repatriated with the financial assistance of the International Organization for Migration (IOM).

In addition, the Embassy has taken the following steps

to provide a continuous service to the public:

i. The public who come for consular activities can reserve a date and time in advance by phone/email and come to the Embassy. However, such reservation of time in advance is rarely used for this process. The daily activities have returned to normal from the beginning of December, 2020 up to now and the people come to the Embassy as usual and get their requirements attended to on the same day.

ii. The public is provided with the email address slemb.kuwait@mfa.gov.lk to forward their requirements. Also, the email kuwaitrepatriation@gmail.com is provided to register for repatriation. However, since the Sri Lankan Government relaxed the quarantine procedure for obtaining government quarantine after returning to Sri Lanka with effect from April, 2021, registering through this email was gradually abandoned by the people since the intervention of the Embassy is not required for the quarantine process.

iii. Sri Lankans contact the Embassy on landline hotlines (00965-25354633/36/38/11) during office hours five working days a week and the officials are committed to fulfilling their needs. iv. The Sri Lankans living in Kuwait forward their problems through the Official Facebook account maintained by the Embassy and the information and services they require are conveyed to them through Messenger.
