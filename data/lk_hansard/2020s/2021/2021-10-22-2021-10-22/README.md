, . . . . , all of us know about the DI - Department of Industries. They initially made shoes for the Army. Finally, it became a department and later on, it became a corporation which came under the COPE. Thereafter, it was privatized and slowly went out of the State exchequer and its control. , , . , . This has been so in Germany. Lufthansa was a State investment, but came up as a company for development. But, the German Parliament went into its matters and reflected the amount of investment the Government had made.

. . , . . .

. So, how can one make mistakes? Who is answerable? How can the Treasury, the State exchequer, make mistakes and later on come and say, It was a mistake; it was an error; it was a waste? . . .

. , , . . . , . . ? - waste - . , . , . ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. You have 10 minutes. [1.08 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for the opportunity to say a few words at this Adjournment Debate on the COPE Report to Parliament. The Hon. Leader of the House just concluded talking about the importance of protecting our environment and due to the shortage of time, I only wish to deal with some of those aspects connected to the environment.

But, before I get to that, I want to draw the attention of this House to an important issue that arose this morning at the Ministerial Consultative Committee Meeting of the Ministry of Wildlife and Forest Conservation. My Colleagues, the Hon. Sivagnanam Shritharan and the Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam were present at that Meeting and tried to raise certain issues, of which the Hon. Rasamanickam had given prior notice and which were part of the Agenda. The Hon. Minister presided, but they were not allowed to raise those matters and the Hon. Members of Parliament from the Government Benches who were present there shouted that down and shouted at them saying kotiya, thrasthavadin, LTTE and both Members had to walk out saying, Well, if that is what you want, that is what you will have. That is a most unfortunate incident and I want to place on record that this happened this morning at the Ministerial Consultative Committee of the Ministry of Wildlife and Forest Conservation presided over by the Hon. Minister, a sad moment. I see the Hon. Leader of the House coming back to his seat. I am told that only the Hon. Chandima Weerakkody - I must put that also on record - protested and said that it was unbecoming behaviour and told his Colleagues not to behave in that manner, but the others did this and two of our Hon. Members of Parliament had to leave the Ministerial Consultative Committee.

Now, Sir, coming on to the environmental issues, there is the Special Audit Report on the Operational Activities of the Lakvijaya Power Plant and its

Environmental Impact. Then, there is also the Environmental Audit Report concerning the water pollution in the Kelani River, which is a very serious issue.

I want to raise two matters concerning the environment. One is regarding the marine environment, particularly in the Northern seas, about which we staged a protest a few days ago by a procession in the sea, as many say, a novel way of protesting. Yes, we did that with a few hundreds boats because there is a practice of using bottom trawlers in that area. Bottom trawling completely destroys the marine environment. It scrapes off the seabed with corals and everything in it and most of what it scrapes off, about 80 to 90 per cent, are thrown away because they are of no use. That causes a serious environmental pollution, not just for us now, but more for succeeding generations. We will not have any fish and it is because of this that for a long time, we have been agitating that this practice must stop. I myself brought a Private Members Bill in 2013. There was no time to bring that in because after the various Committees and all of those processes a Private Members Bill goes through, that Parliament was dissolved. Subsequently, in 2016, I brought another Private Members Bill, which, when the Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera was Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development, was taken up and brought by him as a Government Bill.

Then, I withdrew my Private Members' Bill. The Bill was passed and now, remains on the statute books as Act No. 11 of 2017, which amended the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act, making bottom trawling an offence. This was done after high-level consultations with the Government of India. I am saying this because there is a puerile attempt to make our protest as something that was done against India; that is far from the truth. I have with me the Joint Statement, which I will table, on "Ministerial level talks on fishermen issues between India and Sri Lanka" dated 05th of November, 2016, at which I participated. All that is recorded here and the first matter that was agreed upon in this is, I quote:

(i) expediting the transition towards ending the practice of bottom trawling at the earliest,

So, it was agreed between the two countries that the practice of bottom trawling must end at the earliest, as far back as November, 2016. But, unfortunately, five years later, what has happpened? Sir, I table* the English version of that Joint Statement and also its Tamil version, which the Ministry of External Affairs of India issued. I will read that part in Tamil.

Sir, the other matter that I want to raise is the sand mining that is going on both in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. The Hon. Shanakiyan Rasamanickam, who is here, has raised about the sand mafia in the East and now, it is happening in the North also - in Mannar, Kilinochchi, Vavuniya, Mullaitivu and even in Jaffna. Two days ago, I was present in Ubayakathirgamam in Point Pedro and I witnessed with my own eyes the illegal sand mining happening on private lands and the owners of those lands are scared even to put their heads out of the window in their houses because they get threatening calls. When they call the police, the police give their numbers to the sand miners and the sand miners, in turn, call them and say, Why did you complain to the police? Do you not have a daughter? We know the time you come back from work and so on. This is open daylight robbery that is happening with the connivance of the police and I personally witnessed it just two days ago. So, it is something that cannot be allowed; it must stop.

Again, with regard to bottom trawling - I will finish with that, Sir - there are almost 500 local trawlers. That, too, must stop. There is a law that has been passed. The Ministry of Fisheries must enforce that law. It has been reported that each of the local trawlers pays Rs. 5,000 per boat, per night to the Minister

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

as protection money. That is why it is being permitted to go on and it must end. Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees)Thank you. The Hon. Mohamad Muzammil, please. You have nine minutes. [.. 1.18] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamad Muzammil) , COPE , , .

Shanakiyan Rasamanickam had to leave a Ministerial Consultative Committee today because they were called "Tigers and shouted at, at the Meeting. I want to add our voice also to it. Certainly, the Hon. Speaker should look into that kind of behaviour and we completely deplore such behaviour, due to which some Members of Parliament, who had been elected by the people, had to leave a Ministerial Committee Meeting. It does not matter where they come from, but they were elected by the people.

Sir, on the 31st of January, 2020, in the Crown Court at Southwark, the case between the Director of Serious Fraud Office and Airbus SE was taken up. I am reading from the Judgment made on the 31st of January, 2020. It particularly states, I quote:

"The second count alleges that contrary to section 7 of the Bribery Act 2010, between 1 July 2011 and 1 June 2015, Airbus SE failed to prevent persons associated with Airbus SE from bribing others concerned with the purchase of aircraft by SriLankan Airlines from Airbus, namely directors and/or employees of SriLankan Airlines, where the said bribery was intended to obtain or retain business or advantage in the conduct of business for Airbus SE."

Now, listen to this carefully, Sir.

"In 2013, Airbus engaged the wife of a person concerned with the purchase of aircraft from SLA through a straw company (the Company of Intermediary1). Pursuant to the engagement, Airbus employees offered up to $16.84 million to the Company of Intermediary 1 to influence SLAs purchase of 10 Airbus aircraft and the lease of an additional 4 aircraft. In fact, only $2 million of the $16.84 million was paid."

That is, at that point in time. Then, the verdict goes on to state, I quote:

"The seriousness of the criminality in this case hardly needs to be spelled out. As is acknowledged on all sides, it was grave."

So, my question is, what is really happening to such revelations? We have COPE Reports presented, in which these things are exposed. But, nothing is actually followed up and the people responsible are not brought to justice.

Sir, I refer to an online article published in the Daily Mirror" dated 16th November, 2017. Please excuse me for mentioning names of some Hon. Members who now represent Parliament as well of some who do not represent Parliament now. This article states, I quote:

. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 10 . [3.48 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Presiding Member, the Minister of Agriculture, the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage, my Fellow Member of Parliament from the Kandy District, was very combative in making certain suggestions regarding these

1749 1750

[ ]

2021 22

COPE Reports. But, I also regret to say that these days and perhaps in the history of this country, if at all going by the number of effigies burned in the country, the highest number of effigies burned must be of the current Hon. Minister of Agriculture. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) All the farmers all over the country are burning his effigies. It is very unfortunate. He is a fellow Member of Parliament, but that is the situation in which he is today with his current subject of agriculture. Let me not go into this whole issue of chemical fertilizer and organic fertilizer, which has now become a serious talking point in the entire country.

Putting that aside, with the suggestion he made regarding the COPE Report and the action to be taken by the Speaker, I must concur. The correct position, as the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella said, is that once a Report of the COPE is presented to the House, it becomes a property of the House and it also becomes incumbent on the Hon. Speaker to take action from there onwards out of his own volition, as mentioned by the Report. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) It was sent once. ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) Yes, earlier it had been sent once, in terms of whatever the suggestions that had been made by the Committee, either to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, the Attorney-Generals Department or to the Criminal Investigation Department to take action. So, it has to be pursued by the Hon. Speaker himself. Therefore, I believe that that suggestion will be looked into.

Regarding this particular Report relating to the SLIIT, which incidentally comes within the Electorate that you represent in Parliament, Hon. Presiding Member, it is a very interesting story because in all times material to this inquiry and investigation, I had been the Minister-in-charge twice. Once, in the year 2000/2001, I was the Minister-in-charge of the Ministry of Internal and International Trade and Commerce, under which this institution came. Subsequently, in 2019/ 2020, I became the Minister of Higher Education, during which period the then Secretary to my Ministry, Mr. Priyantha Mayadunne, who is currently the Secretary to the Ministry of Justice, initiated a report to the Cabinet regarding the decision that had been taken previously to delist the SLIIT from the subject matters of the Minister of Higher Education. So, in all times material to this investigation, I had held office as the Minister twice. Therefore, I need to discuss some

of these matters because there had been some serious issues and a lot of anomalies regarding the structure, the functioning and the entire organization of the SLIIT.

The relationship between the Mahapola Trust Fund and the SLIIT is being questioned here by the current administration of the SLIIT on the basis that the letters that had been sent to the COPE state that the SLIIT was never funded and established by the Mahapola Trust Fund. That is the position they are taking, that they are an independent institution and they have absolutely no connection except to say that the Mahapola Trust Fund is the lessor who had leased the property in which these buildings have been set up. Now, Sir, there are serious conflicts arising out of these statements. That is why, because there are serious issues, the COPE Report wants to present this matter to the House so that it can be looked into.

The current administration of the SLIIT is contesting this issue in several ways. One is this. We have the Cabinet Memorandum dated 01st April, 1998 establishing our provisional company limited by guarantee on the 26th of March, 1999. It is the contention of the current administration that this Cabinet Memorandum was submitted with the intention of setting up of this campus as part of the Moratuwa University and subsequently, because the Finance Ministry's observation was opposed to the setting up of that institution and because there was no possibility that it could rely on the Consolidated Fund to meet the recurrent costs, it was not accepted and that it was through the efforts of certain private individuals that, as a separate project, it was started. That is their contention; I am only saying that it is their contention. They are also contending that this was set up by the Board of Investment as the city campus of the SLIIT at the Bank of Ceylon Building in Colpetty way back in 1999, that it continued to function and thereafter, the buildings were put up in the current Malabe premises. Their contention, of course, is that they only got it as a lease from the Mahapola Trust Fund and the Mahapola Trust Fund, for all purposes throughout, has simply been the lessor of this property and has not, in any way, involved with the institution.

Sir, this is a very contentious issue because there are several matters to be considered. You have to examine the minutes of the Mahapola Trust Fund. There are several minutes that had been referred to by the current administration of the SLIIT as well as in our Report. So, we have to look at why this conflict has arisen. Subsequently, several times, the agreements had been changed. In 2005, it had been changed. Thereafter, the Cabinet took a decision in 2017 to delist the SLIIT through a Gazette from the functions of the Ministry of Higher Education. It is only after that that my former Secretary, Mr. Mayadunne, sent a Cabinet Paper under my name to the Cabinet in the year 2019. There was a four-member Subcommittee of the Cabinet appointed to look into this matter, as to the truth behind this whole contention, which has now become a contentious issue because of this COPE Report. Therefore, it is important for us to look into this because at all times material to this Report, there had been several conflicting positions taken.

1751 1752

Even with regard to the setting up of this company, it is the contention of the present administrators of the SLIIT that it is a guarantee company, a guarantee company only has subscription shares, there were no dividends paid and therefore, it is a not-for-profit institution. It is a fact that all over the world, important reputed universities - for instance, the Ivy League Universities like Harvard, Yale and Stanford - are all set up through a trust and that they are all not-for-profit institutions. So, that is a good way to follow and set up a university. At the time the SLIIT was founded or set up, these professionals say, there were only 200 graduates passing out of the university system in Information Technology. Now, it has increased to almost 3,000. By the SLIIT alone, almost half that number of IT graduates are produced in this country. Therefore, this is a very important institution. So, we need to look at the future administration and functions of this institution with a lot of responsibility.

This conflict of interest as far as the ownership or the functioning and the organizational structure is concerned, whether it should come within the purview of the University Grants Commission, be considered as a State University or as a part of a State university, as it had been suggested or whether to allow it to continue as a non-State university supervised by the UGC, of course, regarding their degree-awarding status, as in the model of the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University, whether it should to be allowed to continue in that fashion are the issues that we need to resolve because there are several allegations coming out as a result of the actual, original documents not being properly gone into. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , . ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) Thank you.

Sir, I am told that originally, way back in 2019, the matter was referred to the Attorney-General to look into that and send a report. I refer to page 21 of the COPE Report, where it states, I quote:

"(i) To foreword all the documents connected with this matter to Attorney-General seeking his opinion on the proposals of this Memorandum.

Subsequent to the Cabinet Memorandum dated 13th August, 2018, on 18th December, 2019, my Ministry too submitted a Cabinet Memorandum, about which the COPE Report states in page 21. It states, I quote:

".......to re-gazette the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology under the subject of the Ministry of Higher Education, Technology and Innovations with immediate effect and seeking approval to appoint a controlling board securing the official representation of State institutions.

It further states, I quote

"After considering aforesaid memorandum, the Cabinet had taken a decision on the date of 14th January 2020, to appoint a four-member committee to make recommendations to the Cabinet within 3 weeks time in that regard.

But, by this time, by March, Parliament was dissolved and the Cabinet also stood dissolved thereafter, and that Cabinet Subcommittee could not submit a report. So, the matter stands there, and it is only thereafter that the COPE went into this matter and has raised the issues concerned in the House.

There is also another pertinent issue. The original Board of the SLIIT Guarantee Company had a few professors from the University of Moratuwa, the ex-Chairman of the Board of Investment, Mr. Thilan Wijesinghe, and a few others, which positions, according to the COPE Report, are ex officio positions held on behalf of the institutions in which they held those offices. But, those individuals' contention is that they never subscribed to the Memorandum as ex officio members of those institutions, but in their private capacity. So, that is another matter we have to go into and see whether, in fact, the Articles of Association - ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have been given an additional four minutes and now, you have only one minute left out of that. ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) Okay, Sir.

In fact, we have to examine the Articles of Association in the Memorandum of Association of the Guarantee Company that was set up way back in 1999, whether there is any reference to these individuals, whether they represented their respective institutions in that particular Guarantee Company. That is another contention they are taking and they have sent a letter through Julius & Creasy, their lawyers, to the COPE refusing participation. So, that is another issue.

We had to, time and again, face the same issue with regard to various institutions. The other day we had the a similar issue with regard to Litro Gas and Laughfs Gas. They sent a letter to the COPE saying, We are not answerable to you. The Government does not have material interest in this company. They do not provide us with funds. Therefore, we are an independent institution. We refuse to come and answer before the COPE. That is the contention they take and they have even refused the Auditor-Generals Report saying that the Auditor General has no right to look into the audited accounts of their institution. If those institutions come before the COPE rather than writing letters, they can, of course, explain. If they produce documents and justify their position, if they exonerate themselves before us, then there is no reason

1753 1754

2021 22

for us to find fault with them. Here, they simply send letters refusing to come before the COPE and take cover under those letters or go before the Court of Appeal, file action, take some spurious Stay Orders and then, try to stall our going into these matters. I do not think our going into these matters can be stalled by court orders and it had been held previously also that Parliament has absolute right to go into these matters.

As the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage and also the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella suggested, this Report is a property of the House and it is up to the Hon. Speaker to see that this matter is referred to the relevant institutions for further inquiry and take a final decision.

Thank you. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Charitha Herath) Hon. Presiding Member, - ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . () ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Charitha Herath) Sir, I have just one matter to clarify. Today, we got a letter from Litro Gas saying that the issue had been settled and the case against the Auditor-General had been withdrawn by them. So, now, they are going to do the audit on Litro Gas. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

, This statement is grossly incorrect ; that a provisional company be established to run this institution . 2021 16 - - :

Despite many efforts, the proposed IT institute never came into existence due to the lack of support from the Treasury/National Planning Department. Therefore, the proposals contained in the 1998 Cabinet Memorandum were not implemented. Its contents, therefore, have no bearing whatsoever on the eventual setting up of SLIIT.
