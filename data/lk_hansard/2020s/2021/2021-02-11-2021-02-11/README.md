( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Speaker, I just want a clarification from the Hon. Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Quickly, please. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Minister, this is regarding hockey. You are doing some good job as far as a lot of sports are concerned. One main problem is, like the Sri Lanka Cricket, the Sri Lanka Hockey Federation has also been involved in court cases and therefore, several problems have come up: matters have been delayed; no proper administration has been running for long years and no competitions have been held. The worst thing is, we do not have artificial turfs in this country except for Colombo. Even the Matale turf is getting destroyed. So, at least in Kandy and Matale where hockey is being played, you must give us an assurance that you will take some action to build artificial turfs.

( ) (The Hon. Namal Rajapaksa) Sir, can I have a minute to answer this? ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Namal Rajapaksa) Thank you very much, Hon. Member, for raising that. I thought my Friend, the Hon. Buddhika Pathirana, would ask that question; I was expecting him to ask something to do with hockey.

With regard to the Matale hockey turf, we have already spoken to the Sri Lanka Army and given a Rs. 50 million allocation to refurbish it this year. Hon. Speaker,

we will be refurbishing the Colombo hockey turf along with the Asian Hockey Federation. But unfortunately, as you correctly said, Hon. Member, the Sri Lanka Hockey Federation has a lot of internal problems. So, yesterday, we gave instructions to DG, Sports to appoint the Election Committee and we will have its election within the next two months. After the election is held and once the new administration comes into force, we will go for a matching grant with the Asian Hockey Federation with Rs. 100 million from our side and the rest from their side. So, we are in discussion with them. And also in Kandy, we want to have a normal turf, not an artificial turf because the distance between Kandy and Matale is not that far. So, what we are looking at is to have a normal hockey turf in Kandy, an artificial hockey turf in Matale and then, the Colombo hockey turf to be refurbished to have international events.

Hon. Member, since you mentioned about Matale, I must also mention this. , . , (00-metre track . delay . But, I do agree with you and I will guarantee you, Hon. Member, that within this year, we will take action and move forward.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) . . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Rauff Hakeem? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yesterday, the Hon. Prime Minister made a very categorical statement that burials will be permitted and we are now hopeful that it would be permitted. I have to say that it is better late than never - a mature decision by a very mature politician. He understands the predicament of not only the Government, but also of the minorities and the reconciliation of this country. Such an issue is now repeatedly going back to this so-called expert committee, which is full of people who are pseudo-scientists. It is not going to solve this problem. The Hon. Ali Sabry knows that all Muslims on both sides have been agitating for this and finally, the Hon. Prime Minister has given a solemn undertaking in this House. What more than that?

( ) (An Hon. Member) The words were, " ." ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) He very clearly said, " ". Now, it is up to the authorities in the Health Ministry. Who is better than the Hon. Prime Minister to make a decision on behalf of the Government? Who are these so-called experts in the Health Ministry who are blocking this, unfortunately creating an unnecessary racial tension in this country? We are dragging this whole country into a total abyss by this conduct. I implore and plead that the Government must not drag their feet on this issue because this issue has already gone to Geneva as well and we do not want that to happen. None of us want this to happen to this country. Therefore, please take a very mature and a considered decision and do not insult the Prime Minister, for God's sake. Thank you.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Sir, this is with respect to the point that I raised with the Hon. Speaker yesterday. Thereafter, in the afternoon, he summoned me to his chamber along with the Secretary-General and requested for further information. I had to wait till now to bring this matter up. So, give me two minutes, Sir, and let me speak in Sinhala because it is referred to in Sinhala.

The Cabinet Paper regarding the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Political Victimization very clearly states the following, "

1,2,5 ." So, what it clearly states is that the Report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry has to be tabled in this House.

Then, it goes on to state as the second point, " 8 1 1 - I reiterate that word ' ' - , ." So, Sir, the Cabinet Paper - this was put by the President himself - directs Parliament to appoint a Special Presidential Commission. Now, I would like to ask you or the officials here, under which law can Parliament appoint a Special Presidential Commission? Subsequent to that authority he got from this Cabinet Paper, the President went ahead and appointed the Special Presidential Commission. He says, "This Special Presidential Commission has been appointed under the authority he has, based on the Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry Law, No. 07 of 1978 as amended by the Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry (Special Provisions) Act, No. 04 of 1978. 1978 , . , , . , -
