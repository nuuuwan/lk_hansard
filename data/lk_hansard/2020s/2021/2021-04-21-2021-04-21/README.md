. , , . , , . ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees)The next speaker is the Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya. You have eight minutes. [2.08 p.m.] () ( () () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, today is a day on which many people, many families and many individuals, in our country are in mourning. I would like to start by extending my condolences towards all those who lost their loved ones two years ago on this day.

When we think about what happened two years ago and when we look at what happened in Parliament this morning, it is not surprising that many people in our country are questioning the very existence of Parliament and the Members of Parliament. Scenes in Parliament this morning showed the lack of empathy that the peoples Representatives have towards the people of this country because on a day when people are in mourning, remembering the traumatic incidents and the events which led to the death of their loved ones, we have to think whether what we did in Parliament today reflects, in any way, those sentiments or conveys any sense of sympathy towards those people.

Such behaviour, I think, increases the sense that is quite prevalent or quite common in our society today that Parliament and the peoples Representatives are of no use for this country. This is an extremely dangerous situation where democratic institutions are under assault from all sides and for the people also to feel that these institutions are irrelevant to their lives. It is an extremely dangerous sentiment and is very detrimental to preserving democracy in our country. Therefore, I appeal to all my Colleagues here today to reflect on those things when they intervene in matters relevant to the people of this country, especially on days such as this when so many of our citizens are in mourning.

Todays Debate is about some Regulations under the Convention Against Doping in Sports Act. Though it feels odd to speak about such a matter on a day when we are remembering a sad event like this, I still would like to speak a few words about these Regulations and sports in general. I think it is important that we look upon sports and the area of physical activity not simply in terms of competitive sports, but also in terms of how they contribute to our health and well-being, especially to the psychosocial well-being of the people.

1855 1856

In that context, I would like to raise a few points which we need to pay our attention to. As far as I know, the National Olympic Committee of Sri Lanka had initiated the Sexual Harassment and Abuse Policy in 2019. That was a very good move and something that is much appreciated. However, as we all know, formulating policies is certainly not enough when it comes to addressing matters of sexual harassment and abuse. There needs to be far more done, far more mechanisms introduced and initiatives taken to ensure that sportsmen and sportswomen can actually make use of such policies and pieces of legislation to protect themselves. To my understanding, up to now, not a single complaint has been lodged despite the existence of this Policy. That is not because abuse and sexual harassment in sports do not take place, but because the mechanisms through which such complaints can be lodged are absent and also because awareness and support necessary to make such complaints are lacking in our system. So, I urge the Hon. Minister of Youth and Sports to look into this matter.

Secondly, I think when we talk about sports, we often tend to focus on those who are able and who are excelling in sports. But, as I said earlier, sports is not something that should be thought of simply in terms of competitive sports or even in terms of excellence, but as something that is good and has to be a part of our overall existence, overall life. In this regard, I think it is essential that we look at facilities that are available for those with disabilities. Very often, what we see today is that those who engage in sports designed especially for people with disabilities are mainly from the military. But, we know that there is a much larger disabled population in this country. So, how we can also include those civilians suffering from disabilities or living with disabilities in sports is also something that we need to consider.

We also know that there is far fewer women and girls take part in sports. If you look at any public playground in any part of the country, you would see that mostly men and young boys make use of those facilities. You hardly see women and girls using public facilities for sports and it is so even in schools. Therefore, special initiatives need to be taken to make sure that women and girls also have access to those facilities, and the facilities that we provide are accessible to all.

Finally, I would also like to highlight the fact that funding and promotion of sports for women is not up to the satisfactory level. We know that womens sports always tend to get less priority and less attention, whether it is in the media or when it comes to sponsorship or promotion. So, I urge the Hon. Minister to look into these matters because given the chance, there is no doubt that young women in this country can excel in sports. There is plenty of potential for our girls and young women to excel in this area as well. Therefore, I think this is also an area that needs to be looked into and attention paid to.

Thank you very much.

, , , . , , , . ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . . [3.38 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, I do not wish to be left out by talking to the point. So, I shall detract and bring to the notice of the Government something that has come up this month.

Sir, the State Ministry for Home Affairs has, by a letter dated 08th April, written to the Government Agent of Ampara District to consider the Kalmunai North Divisional Secretariat as a sub-office of the Kalmunai Divisional Secretariat. In other words, it is a demotion from being recognized, since 1993, as a separate Divisional Secretariat to a sub-office of the Kalmunai Divisional Secretariat. A Memorandum dated 09th of July, 1993 by the Ministry of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Home Affairs and Cabinet Paper No. 93/600/034(1) were presented and eventually, on the 28th of July, 1993, Cabinet approval was obtained to convert what was known as the Kalmunai North AGA Division to a separate Divisional Secretariat. Thereafter, Sir, for the last 28 years, the Kalmunai North Divisional Secretariat has been functioning. There were, originally, eight Divisional Secretaries appointed, but subsequently, due to a political interventions, unfortunately, Divisional Secretaries were not appointed but instead, Assistant

Divisional Secretaries were appointed. Nonetheless, the Kalmunai North Divisional Secretariat has been recognized as one of 20 in the Ampara District. The State Ministry of Home Affairs formally recognized it as a separate Divisional Secretariat along with all the other Divisional Secretariats in the country. There are 29 GS Divisions under the Kalmunai North Divisional Secretariat, 39,000 individuals fall within that territory and there are 22,605 registered voters. Of the 39,000 individuals coming within that, 33,000 odd are Tamils, 3,215 are Muslims and 124 are Sinhalese.

The Voters Register recognizes the Kalmunai North Divisional Secretariat as a separate Division; the Registrar Generals Department for births, deaths and marriages recognizes it as a separate division and the Land Registry does the same. There is a cadre of 235 functioning under the Kalmunai North Divisional Secretariat. All Government Ministries recognize it; all development fund allocations are made to the Divisional Secretariat of Kalmunai North, separately. The DCC meetings are also recognized and held separately. However, whilst this be the case, Sir, unfortunately, for 28 years, the Kalmunai North Divisional Secretariat has not been gazetted for political reasons. Today, it is being used as a justification to demote the Kalmunai North Divisional Secretariat to merely a sub-office. This is completely unacceptable, Sir. There are so many examples of Divisional Secretariats that are functioning today, which have not been gazetted. The Koralai Pattu Central Divisional Secretariat in Batticaloa has been functioning since 2002 as a separate Divisional Secretariat and it has not been gazetted. The Vuvuniya South Divisional Secretariat is functioning separately and it has not been gazetted.

So, why is this special discrimination against the Kalmunai North Divisional Secretariat? It is completely unacceptable. That Divisional Secretariat area is almost entirely Tamil. Is that the reason? Surely, this sort of behaviour does not stand well. Therefore, it is with that urgency that I raise this issue and I hope some responsible Members, Ministers or State Ministers within the Government would bring this matter to the notice of the State Minister of Home Affairs, the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa, to get his Ministry to rescind that letter forthwith which was issued on the 08th of April this month and instead take steps, as it rightfully should be, to formally recognize by gazetting the Kalmunai North Divisional Secretariat as a Divisional Secretariat and also take all other steps to appoint a Divisional Secretary and give due recognition to that area. Otherwise, a travesty is being done to those people and I think it is important that the Hon. State Ministers intervention takes place as a matter of urgency.

Thank you. Sir ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 14 .
