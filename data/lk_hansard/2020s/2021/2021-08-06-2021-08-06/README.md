Sumanthiran, now raise your matter of Privilege.

: BATTI TV : "BATTI TV" PRIVILEGE: VIDEO FOOTAGE PUBLISHED ON BATTI TV CHANNEL .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, today, I am raising a Question of Privilege which is of utmost importance.

On 19th July, 2021, the Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan, the oldest Member of this Parliament, was helped by the Parliament staff to walk down the steps

517 518

2021 06

inside the Chamber. That was because he presently has an ailment in one of his knees, which is under treatment and also because it was not possible to bring the wheelchair to the front row. That is despite the fact that Parliament itself has passed laws making it mandatory to have disabled access in all government buildings. By noon that day, that is on 19th July, 2021, a Facebook page by the name Batti TV published a video footage of the Hon. Sampanthan being helped down the aisle inside the Chamber. The voice-over stated that the Hon. Sampanthan was selfishly occupying a Parliament seat without being useful to anyone due to his greed for such position. I have forwarded this video footage to the Secretary-General by e-mail yesterday. The above video has been recorded using a phone by another Member of Parliament. I am also attaching two still photographs and tabling* them now, one of which clearly shows the seat from which this video was recorded.

That, together with the Facebook page Batti TV, points to one particular Member of Parliament from the Batticaloa District whose allocated seat is precisely from where the video seems to have been recorded. From the video footage I have provided and from the CCTV footages available in Parliament, the culprit can easily be identified. .

Sir, I am raising this Question of Privilege on behalf of all right-thinking Members of Parliament who will agree that this is a despicable act which has not just breached the Privilege of one Member of Parliament, but also that of the whole House. No one with a semblance of culture in him will resort to this kind of guttural behaviour.

Therefore, I strongly urge the Hon. Speaker to take immediate, stern action to identify and punish the person who video recorded this as well as those who run the website, Facebook page and the YouTube Channel called Batti TV. Thank you. : : PRIVILEGE: DENIAL OF PERMISSION TO ENTER HARBOUR POLICE STATION ( ) (The Hon. Nalin Bandara Jayamaha) , , ,

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) .. . , .

[11.42 a.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to participate in this Debate on the Regulations framed under the Immigrants and Emigrants Act.

Right at the outset, I want to agree with the Hon. Member who preceded me on the question of entry visas. He cited the examples of Singapore and countries that want to encourage foreign investments. It is good to have a window such as that, without the requirement of visa or rather to stamp visa on arrival so that that will encourage persons who go round and look for places which are useful to invest. One month of such a visa is useful. Such businessmen do not stay for more than a week. So, I would encourage a relook at the Regulation to allow entry visas on arrival.

But, today, as we look at all these Regulations, what strikes us most is the fact that Sri Lanka is on the red list in many countries. It is on the red list in many countries in the Middle-East. Some countries do not even allow transit for passengers coming from Sri Lanka and others do not permit us to land in those countries due to the poor record we are having in countering the COVID-19 challenge.

There are accusations being made across the isle on how effectively or otherwise the Government has been dealing with this issue. It is a fact that we are entering a fourth wave now. The health authorities have in the last few days told the country repeatedly and effectively not to hold them responsible for the decisions that are being taken. What are they saying then? They are saying that their advice is not being heeded. We have a Task Force headed by the Army Commander, quite inappropriate, to deal with a health issue such as this and they make decisions; we do not know on what grounds.

The hospitals situation is pathetic, to say the least. You cannot hide these in todays world. There are pictures we have seen with our own eyes. The situation is worsening by the hour. I say "by the hour" because after coming to the House this morning, we have been informed by text that several of our Colleagues from both sides have tested positive. That is an indication, if you like, of what is happening in the rest of the country and in such a situation, we are relaxing rules with regard to movement. This virus does not move by itself; it is carried by humans. So, permitting free movement at a time like this is a sure recipe to have a disaster. When we had one or two persons tested positive in April last year, we closed down the country for two months practically. But, when a near 100 are dying every day we are removing these restrictions.

Sir, I have said this several times before, that even those restrictions are not being imposed legally. So, there is a huge problem with regard to that. We have been saying this from April last year. A Bill was drafted and given to the Government. Because the Government was not moving ahead to bring in necessary legislation, I even presented it as a Private Members' Bill. That was tabled in this House on the 28th of April this year, but the Health Ministry, to which it has been sent, is quiet with regard to that; It is not responding. That Bill provides a mechanism by which these restrictions can be brought into play legally. Now, it is all ad hoc. They are called travel restrictions, provincial travel restrictions, but there is nothing in the law that provides for any of those to be done. Quarantine law only permits quarantine. How many times should we say this? Parliament has met regularly since August last year, and we are still unable to do that one thing that this House is empowered to do in fighting this pandemic. We can talk, we can debate, but we are a legislation-making Assembly. That is our primary duty and we are not doing that. We are not doing that because the Government or those who are actually wielding power want to keep that power in their own hands, continue to keep it and exercise it on an ad hoc basis so that they can act according to their whims and fancies.

There is no rule of law. From this morning, with the several issues that have been raised, we know that. The Minister of Public Security is unable to answer those questions. All he could say is, Ask that question officially. Then, why do we meet here? Questions such as that of persons being abducted, I repeat, abducted, by the police not in uniform is a very serious issue. It only shows a thorough breakdown of the law and order situation in this country. I do not know why we even have a Minister called the Minister of Public Security when senior lecturers, student leaders and others are abducted in broad daylight - all of that has been filmed - by police personnel in civvies. Why do they have to come in civvies? Why do they have to come in white vans? You are reminding the white-van culture. You want to tell the country, Remember, we did this earlier and we have brought it back. You want to bring back those memories; you want to instill fear in the peoples mind and that is why you are doing this.

But, as was raised by the Leader of the NPP, the Hon. Anura Dissanayaka, somebody else would do this tomorrow and we would not know whether it is the police or someone else. The underworld would do this; there would be abductions for ransom. Not that the Navy is above that. You know very well how they abducted 11 students, young people in Colombo, purely for ransom. And, what do we have today? Those persons who were suspected, named suspects, are not being prosecuted. The Hon. Attorney-General is not acting independently; he is looking for orders from above and granting all those that the Executive wants. How then can abductions such as that go unpunished and unprosecuted? This is the news that we get every day.

So, on the one hand, we have this huge problem of pandemic which is not being addressed by the country, resulting in Sri Lankans being blacklisted.

535 536

The WHO has given a statement and Sri Lanka is one of those countries which have not dealt with this issue properly and therefore, the Delta variant spread is on the rise.

On the other hand, utilizing a pandemic you are wreaking havoc in the law and order situation in the country. You are terrorizing people; you are trying to get them to kneel down in submission to your whims and fancies. The culture of impunity is at the highest ever since the war ended in this country and that is, because no one knows what will happen. If a person can be arrested after going for a live TV show outside the studio, MPs can be arrested as they leave the Parliament for what they have said here. Of course, you would not say it is because we made this speech in Parliament and it is our Privilege. But, that would be the real reason for taking - () ( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. The Hon. Sumanthiran referred to me as the Minister of Public Security. The Hon. Sumanthiran is talking ; .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] he is making a statement which has no meaning. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, that is not a point of Order. The Minister has no business to describe my speech as "nonsense". () ( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera) You mentioned my name. Okay? - [Interruption.] You criticized me and that is why - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You have the brass neck to call my speech nonsense! Who are you? Absolute havoc you are wreaking in the country and you have the brass neck to stand up here and try to answer me. Sit down, please! You speak when you have to speak. You do not answer when questions are raised. All you can say is, Raise it officially. - [Interruption.] I am talking about what you are doing today, how

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

have set the goons not in uniform to attack and to arrest university academics, teachers and trade union leaders . [Interruption.] ( ) (An Hon. Member) Sir, let the Minister reply. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Please do not disturb the Hon. Member. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) If the word nonsense is to attach to anything, that is to the Hon. Minister, not to my speech. I am making a point. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, there is no point of Order. Ask him to sit down.

All I am saying is that the teachers are demonstrating today on a very justifiable ground. They have come out in protest against the General Sir John Kotelawala National Defence University Bill. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , ; you have only two more minutes. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir.

We saw how they were arrested and produced before the Magistrate who enlarged them on bail, and at the gate of the Magistrates Court, they were bundled into a jeep by this [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

goons and taken to Mullaitivu. What kind of justice is that? Therefore, the teachers came out in protest. Now,

537 538

[ .. ]

2021 06

the Minister walks away unable to say anything. - [Interruption] He must be going now to organize my arrest as I leave the Parliament. - [Interruption]

Sir, there is the B.C. Perera Salary Commission Report. That Report has recommended how the anomalies with regard to teachers and principles salaries are to be resolved. So, that must be implemented. That is all what the teachers are asking for. You do not have to attack them like this; you do not have to arrest them for that; you do not have to arrest trade unionists like this. After all, the SLFP, which is a core, a foundation of who the Government consists of, is based on trade unions and trade union rights. If trade union rights cannot be respected by this Government, I do not know what they will respect. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , . Thank you. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am winding up, Sir.

Thank you, Sir, for the opportunity. I am saying that on the COVID-19 challenge the country faces, you all have failed. You have made that situation far worse by how you deal with law and order in the country today. Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) () . . [.. 11.56] () ( ( ) ) (The Hon.

But, we, as a country, must move forward. If we are to move forward, what are we to do? How are we going to do that? We have to get together; we have to come

together as a country and change this situation. If not, everything in Sri Lanka will fail. Our children and our childrens children will pay the price for the failures of this Government. We, as politicians and Members of Parliament, have failed the next generation. Therefore, I urge this House and the Government, let us work together. This is a crucial juncture in our history. The future will be determined on what course of action we, as politicians and leaders of this country, take. Wherever my father is, I think he will be watching us. Great leaders have emerged in this country; we have had many great leaders. We need to work together and fix the issues of this country so that we can move forward as a country, as a nation.
