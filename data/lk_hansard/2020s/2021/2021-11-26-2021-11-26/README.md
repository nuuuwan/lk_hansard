. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Next, the Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran. You have ten minutes. [1.28 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Let me first thank the Chair for giving me this opportunity to speak at the Committee Stage Discussion of the Budget, 2022. Even though each day, the Committee Stage Discussion centres around Ministries and their subject matters with the relevant officials being present on that day, discussion of matters important would entail not only the subjects pertaining to the respective Ministries, such as the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Irrigation taken up today, but many other matters intricately interwoven with the Budget, its purposes, its possible effect on the country, its peoples and on our relations with the international community. Therefore, let me refer to certain matters pertaining to agriculture, irrigation and allied matters and also stray over to other matters later in my short speech.

I am told that there was a Presidential communique released recently, which said that Government subsidies and allied reliefs would hereafter be available only to users of organic fertilizers. That seems to have meant that anyone could import inorganic fertilizers or chemical fertilizers, but those who would use them would not receive any governmental subsidies or benefits. Instead of saying the Government has changed its mind on account of the peoples protests, especially the farmers protests, and therefore has allowed import of inorganic fertilizers, it has used this ruse to circumvent the politically embarrassing situation. Now, the law seems to be that anyone can import inorganic fertilizers, pesticides, weedicides and so on, but the Government will not give any benefits to those who use them. That means that the subsidies and other benefits given so far to the agriculture sector would be discontinued to a certain extent. All in the name of sustainable organic agriculture! But, this could have been done right at the beginning instead of getting the masses to get agitated and to demonstrate against the Government. We are an agrarian society and we place farmers as an important part of our society, not a demeaning one where we can play with their livelihoods. The Thaipongal Festival, as all of you know - the Minister

is a Tamil-speaking Minister and he knows - is celebrated to thank the farmers contribution to the world at large. So, farmers who have been penalized due to the inconsistent and wrongful approach on fertilizers should be compensated for the loss of efficiency and the yield suffered due to the arbitrary policies pursued by the Government with regard to fertilizers. Therefore, I would suggest that on the upcoming Thaipongal Day, all farmers in the country be compensated accordingly.

Today, the Government, on its part, has started using the Army more and more in order to control its dissatisfied people: Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims or others. The country now seems to be dependent entirely on its armed forces and its retired fraternity to run this Government. The highest allocation in this Budget has been made to the Ministry of Defence. The direct allocation to all armed forces is a staggering Rs. 308 billion! That is, 12.3 per cent of the total estimated government expenditure of Rs. 2.5 trillion, which is an increase of 1.74 per cent from the 2021 allocation. The use of the Army seems to be given preference in recent times more and more. The Minister of Finance Hon. Basil Rajapaksa said in his Budget Speech the other day that the government employees have turned out to be a big financial burden on the country. But, that is not so. Even after the war, continuing to keep an armed force far in excess of the countrys needs, paying their salaries and other infrastructural dues, bringing back officers of the armed forces after their retirement and employing them in high governmental posts and in the Foreign Service have become a huge drain on the countrys finances. So, it is not the government employees who are a drain on the countrys finances. Maybe, there is a lack of fraternal communication between the President and the Minister of Finance on these matters. The huge sum now paid to the armed forces, if reduced, could be used to pay off part of our foreign debts or agricultural and irrigational projects. Despite the end of the war in 2009, the defence expenditure has been rising every year. There is an unfortunate slant given to the people by successive Sinhala majority governments that defence should be the most prioritized expenditure in the Budget. Defence from whom, is an unanswered question. This only shows that there is no real peace in this country, that there is only absence of war. It is high time that we realize that our so-called enemies are not Indians nor the Maldivians, but our own people, whom we want to repress through our armed forces.

The Budget, as a whole, has been prepared not for long-term benefits for the country, but to gain short-term political benefits. It lacks the blueprints or plans and schemes prepared for the long-term amelioration of the people. If it did, there would have been the mention of a production economy, long-term proposals for the ultimate reduction of our foreign debts, ways and means to save the people from impending famine pestilence, schemes for the reduction of unemployment and so on.

I would like to point out that poverty is significantly higher in the Mullaitivu, Mannar, Batticaloa and Monaragala Districts. It is high time that separate urgent budgets are prepared to allocate for their needs based on

611 612

actual poverty rates found in those districts. In addition, the baseline poverty calculation needs to be updated as per the World Bank guidelines since we still have, I am told, the 2002 baseline, which is outdated.

There is reference to the increase of foreign tourists in the coming months. But, the Hon. Minister of Finance has forgotten that unless a solution is found to the burning, unresolved ethnic question, it would be futile to expect a sizable increase in the coming of foreign tourists.

The Government acts as if there is no political question to be solved. The desire for a new Constitution is based on the anxiety of the Government to get rid of the provisions of the Thirteenth Amendment to the present Constitution brought in through the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord in 1987. Even if a new chapter with the provisions of the present Thirteenth Amendment enshrined in it were to be passed, it would effectively deter India from interfering.

This Budget has not provided any reliefs for the people of the North and the East, who were the main victims of the war. There is no reference to those widows who lost their husbands to the war, to those seriously disabled by the war and those who lost all their worldly belongings to the war. Even after 12 years since the end of the war, these victims of war continue to be ignored. No government has formulated policies in that regard. Of course, as Chief Minister of the Northern Province, I started talks with the Former Prime Minister Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe to prepare a Needs Assessment for the North and East. But, little was allowed to be done in that regard. We have not been able to prepare even until now a Needs Assessment for the war-affected areas like it was done in the year 2003. That needs to be done comprehensively. Only then could we find out the needs of the war-affected families and individuals and provide them relief.

Still, a large section of our people who had lost their residences to the war remains to be compensated. It is a criminal waste of finances to continue with the building of war memorials and the like twelve years after the end of the war. These are political gimmicks which will not help the country in the long run. Instead, the people will feel the pinch of the financial drains on such ethnically and religiously designed war memorial projects, and their resistance and antipathy will increase. The Government will be forced to depend on its armed forces more and more.

The One country, one law project would not unify the country. Instead, it would polarize the different communities further. This country cannot be one country except due to its insular location. There are more than one nation within its boundaries. Only if we recognize the right to self-determination of those nations within their determinable boundaries and give equal rights and opportunities to all communities would we be able to bring this country back on the road to peace and progress.

Thus, only a federal type of government which would recognize the right to self-determination of determinable categories of people living for centuries in defined areas within the country would bring reconciliation, peace and prosperity to this country.

Before concluding, I would like to remind the Hon. Members that today is a special day for the Tamils of the North and the East during this special week, the Maaveerar Week, during which they remember the martyrs who were killed in the war. I would like to quote what the non-violent Mahatma Gandhi said of Subhas Chandra Bose, who took to arms against the British. He said, Netajis patriotism is second to none. His bravery shines through all his actions. He aimed high and failed. But who has not failed. On another occasion Gandhi said, Netaji will remain immortal for all time to come for his service to India. As a votary of non-violence, may I commit those words vis a vis the North and the East of Sri Lanka in remembrance of the brave Tamil whose birthday is today.

Sir, I take this opportunity to thank His Excellency Gopal Baglay, the Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka. His recent visit to Tamil Nadu is historically significant. The High Commissioner had met the Sri Lankan people living in refugee camps in Trichy and discussed their welfare and resettlement in their own interest. The High Commissioner of India had also met the representatives of the Fishermens Association in Rameswaram. We hope that amicable solutions would be found to the various problems that have long existed between the Sri Lankan and the Indian fishing communities.

The High Commissioner also called on the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, the Hon. M.K. Stalin, Governor R.N. Ravi and the officials and attended high-level talks. A new twist has begun with constructive meetings at all levels without distinction between the Central

619 620

Government and the State Government. The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, the Hon. M.K. Stalin, has officially announced the various welfare schemes to be started at the grass-roots level for the benefit of the Sri Lankan Tamils who have been living in the refugee camps and the Tamil people living abroad. We warmly welcome the Chief Ministers excellent performance. Our thanks go to the leaders of the Central Government and other political parties, including the Hon. Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India.

The blessings of India in the political, social, educational, religious, cultural, economic and development spheres and the continued contribution of technology in relation to devolution and power sharing with guidance are welcomed.
