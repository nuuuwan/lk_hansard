Sir, do you know the difference between complete and finish? I do not know whether you are going to give the answer or not. But, anyway, I will give the answer. If you have a good wife, you will complete your life; if you have a bad wife, you will finish your life. That is the way. Like that, if you have good governors in the country, they will complete the entire period; if you have bad governors, they will finish the entire period. Therefore, be good governors, do good work and we will appreciate your work in the future. Thank you.

, . , Committee Stage , , . , . , . . . ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . . [3.46 p.m.] ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Diana Gamage) Hon. Presiding Member, thank you very much for the time given to me to speak on a matter that has become the need of the hour.

I would like to thank the Hon. Minister for actually taking an important step to legalize the minimum age of employment in this country, which has been an issue for quite a while. This step should have been taken quite a while ago, but I am happy that it has been taken at least now to make the minimum age of employment as 16 years. I would say that, in my personal opinion, it should be 18 years. But, nevertheless, it has been done at least now and I would like to express my gratitude to the Hon. Minister for that. We have seen how young children have been used in households as labourers, the circumstances in which they have been working and the tragedies that they had to face in the past and also recently.

Next, I would like to bring up gender equality. For the 52 per cent of women, being the majority of the 22 million population of this country, there should be more provisions made under the labour law. Due to the discrimination that women have to undergo, they tend to end up in insecure jobs. They have to face a lot of harassment due to discrimination. It could be sexual harassment, mental harassment and in some cases, physical harassment. So, that needs to be changed. Therefore, I would urge the Hon. Minister to take the issue of discrimination against women workers very seriously because it has been quite an issue for the last so many decades in this country. We need to address that as soon as possible.

Also, if we take the workforce that goes abroad, which brings us foreign currency, we send our women as housemaids. But, to that type of labour, do we actually give some security? Is there an insurance for what they have to undergo in those countries? A series of offences are being committed against them like harassment and

death in those countries. Some have returned home with some of their organs missing. So, we need to address this issue and give them some sort of security. Before we send our women workforce abroad, we should conduct some training programmes for them.

We should also encourage more women in this country to start working online and engage in what is called the gig economy. I am sure you have heard of the gig economy. People working from home should be encouraged to engage in that and I think we should make it more encouraging especially for women and the youth. There are a lot of young ones who are very clever in IT. So, we need to encourage them and invest in it. Investment in empowerment of women in a country brings an economic gain. That, we should be able to understand. I would like to take up gender equality and investment in women empowerment further during the Budget Debate.

. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .. . 7 . [3.53 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, when I saw the Order of Business today and read the term Land Acquisition

2387 2388

Act, it sent shivers down my spine because land acquisition has been the bane of the Tamil people, the Tamil people's experience.

Today, in the North and the East, land is being grabbed from the Tamil people. Privately-owned land which they have had for generations, permit land and even public land which should ideally be enjoyed by the people of that area are being grabbed for purposes that are, in no way, in the interest of the Tamil people of that area. A good example is that, just two or three days ago, in Allaipiddy in one of the islands of the Jaffna Peninsula, eight parappu, which is about 80 perches, were to be acquired by the armed forces and also in Mankumban, 70 perches and in Pungudutivu, 14 acres. This is land owned by private citizens. They have deeds for that land, but just for the mere convenience of the armed forces, they are being deprived of their privately-owned land. That is a formal attempt being made at acquisition of land, but the forces have, in fact, been occupying those land illegally for decades and decades, not allowing the owners to have the benefits or the fruits of those lands.

This sort of land acquisition is not only happening through the armed forces. For example, in Mayilathamadu in the Batticaloa District, Tamil people have been denied of over 15,000 acres of grazing land and instead, Sinhala people of other districts are allowed to come and occupy those land, do corn cultivation and various things, which are illegal. So, when the Tamil people of that area went to court against the illegal grabbing of those grazing land, the court gave an order with the consent of the Attorney-Generals Department. The State Counsel, in fact, agreed that that was a grazing land which had been allocated through a Cabinet Paper passed way back during the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government and those Sinhala encroachers were given time up till the end of February, this year to vacate it, but they have not vacated. They still continue to occupy those lands, again to the deprivation of the Tamil people of the Batticaloa District.

Sir, this sort of activity has taken a new twist in Nedunkerny, which is in Vavuniya North. Again, in the name of delimitation, 600 families from the Kebithigollewa Divisional Secretarys Division and 430 families from the Padaviya Divisional Secretary's Division are going to be annexed to the Vavuniya North Divisional Secretary's area. In total, 1,030 families, in the name of delimitation, are being brought into the Vavuniya North Divisional Secretary's Division and it is systematically changing the entire demography of that region. In fact, that latest move, we, not only just our party, but also the other Tamil parties in Parliament, opposed. We asked for an appointment with the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa, who is the Minister concerned. He was good enough to grant us an appointment, but then he had to cancel it at the last minute. Still, there has not been an appointment granted. This must stop, Sir. The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva is a very senior Member of this House and someone who is extremely influential. He has been a Minister for several decades. So, I think he must use his good offices to explain to the Hon. Chamal

Rajapaksa that these sort of activities must be stopped immediately because changing the demography of a region is not development. Changing the demography of the region, bringing in people who do not belong to that area when the people of that area themselves do not have land is just unacceptable and it is only going to cultivate animosity and by no means is going to help the already pretty bad relationship that exists between the various ethnicities, particularly in the North Eastern Region precisely because of these State-aided colonization schemes and land grabs that have changed the demography of that area. So, I would like to urge the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva once again to use his influence with the Government, particularly with the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa.

One other matter I wish to raise is that in the Jaffna District, as of present, because of the floods, 10,188 families comprising of 33,853 individuals have been very badly affected. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I am winding up, Sir.

There are six camps currently housing the displaced people. This displacement, Sir, can be expected because of bad weather. But, the reality in Jaffna is that under the various road development schemes that are carried out, they are not putting up culverts and drains and also there is no planning, as a result of which the drainage in the entire Jaffna District is appalling. We have repeatedly raised this matter at the DCC meetings, but to no avail. The Chairman of the DCC is not interested in taking up these issues. So, when you consider the monsoon rains that we have been facing over the last years, if this drainage issue is not taken seriously and tackled in a comprehensive and holistic way while having a master plan, then, people are going to continue to get affected in a very bad way.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .. . . [.. 4.00] .. ( ) ( .. - ) (The Hon. S.M. Chandrasena - Minister of Lands) , 1950 9 2013
