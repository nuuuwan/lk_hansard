Sir, I wish to continue in English. I was speaking on behalf of my people earlier. Now, I wish to speak to everyone else and I hope that they would understand this situation.

In this case, the facts are quite simple. The victim was underaged; she was employed by a family illegally; she was raped and now, she is dead. The investigation is still ongoing. So, we have to wait for the results. That being the case, we have to ask ourselves why it takes the death of an individual for us to shed some light on this situation? Similarly, why is that, whenever an issue regarding sexual harassment comes up, we have learnt to forget and forgive? In the same way, why is it that we have conditioned our society to teach our girls not to speak up and our boys to not to understand the meaning of no? That is where we are and in order to progress, we have to identify where the issue is. The issue is not with the 30 odd people who have raped a girl in Mount Lavinia; the issue is not with the thousands of other girls and boys who are getting raped and killed as we speak. The issue is with ourselves; the issue is with the system. We need to fix everything from the bottom up. We need to fix everything from the education system to the bureaucracy, because only then will we be able to progress as a nation.

What saddens me most out of all this is that many people are pointing a finger at the up-country community, saying that a significant number of domestic workers have been coming from the up-country community, especially from the community of Indian origin. That is not true at all; that is completely false. We have recent statistics, I think, of 2020. As I mentioned earlier, there are about 103,000 children who are engaged in hazardous jobs. When there are 103,000 children engaged in hazardous jobs, how can we say that all of them are from the up-country? Poverty does not know caste, creed, religion or race; that is something that all of us have to come to terms with. When it knows no caste, creed, religion or race, anybody who is faced with poverty will go for any hazardous job and it is our duty to protect them. So, please stop targeting and marginalizing our

community saying that we are downtrodden. We are downtrodden because we were neglected for over thirty years; we were neglected by every Government that came to power during that period. Now, we are trying to develop everything from ground up. We are 30 years behind, but that does not make us any lesser. We have come up and shown that we can achieve in various sectors. We have youth who have achieved medals at international competitions; we have people who are judges, lawyers and doctors. All what we are asking for is not your pity or sympathy. What we are asking for is the respect that is due to us.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. State Minister, please wind up.

( ) (The Hon. Jeevan Thondaman) Sir, if I could have just one more minute, lastly, I would like to say that even though we are a disadvantaged community, we never took part in any war, riots or anything that threatened the nation. All I am saying is, we looked after the nation when the nation needed us most. And now, we need the nation and we hope that the nation will look after us.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. Vijitha Herath. You have eight minutes.

() ( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Suren Raghavan) Hon. Presiding Member, I must register that a speaker before me mentioned about the protracted ethnic war that this country experienced. Unfortunately, the most popular interpretation of the war was that it was one-sided, but I would like to stand here and correct that no war can be fought by a single side. There were reasons, there were factors why that so-called war protracted or continued.

We can go for another debate, if one wishes to, but I would like to correct the record here that it is not merely the Sri Lankan Government which imposed a war on another ethnic community. We had a war, which was unfortunate. We had to depart from that war and we are now living in post-war conditions. Therefore, we need to focus on our reconciliation and rebuilding processes and that is what all of us here in this Assembly must aim at.

Now, I would like to come to my point. Today, there is a presentation -

( ) (The Hon. Selvarajah Kajendren) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have two more minutes.

. ( . ) (The Hon. M. Udayakumar) Okay, Sir.

. , 15 , 13 . , . , , , , . , . , , .

Hon. Presiding Member, I will just take a minute from the Hon. Waruna Liyanage's time.

Today in our society, child exploitation is on the rise. It is evident with the increasing hardships faced, be it on the Internet or on account of poverty, by the children from all corners of the society. It is the concern of the law-makers to save the children from this grave situation. Children are being dragged into illegal activities such as forced child labour, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, negligence, cyberbullying and so on. Child exploitation does take place widely and does not vary according to race, religion or status.

In Sri Lanka, it seems that we have neglected solving this problem in Parliament. I would like to say that we, the law-makers of this House, have a bounden duty to safeguard and protect our children in the country, and I propose the Government to take tougher action against those who indulge in child exploitation. Finally, I request the Government to bring in and enforce laws which set work standards such as the minimum age for employment as 18 years, anti-discrimination laws, laws which uphold child's rights such as education, with that made compulsory, and which prohibit child labour.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . . .
