Through the media, we came to know that a group of tourists from the Ukrainian arrivals went on excursions to Mirissa for Whale Watching and Yala."

"The agreement at the Task Force Meeting was for the tour organizers to provide SLTDA detailed itineraries in advance, including details of the drivers and guides who would be involved in these excursions to be relayed to the regional health authorities for screening and quarantine purposes."

Sri Lanka Tourism , , . . , I quote:

"The Director-General of Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority has tried to obtain the necessary information in this regard from the travel agents to no avail."

"We have heard that private boats are taking the tourists for Whale Watching and 28 safari jeeps would be taking them inside Yala.

However, to this moment we have not received any of the above information from the promoter of this project nor the Travel Agents concerned. We are gravely concerned and seek your urgent intervention as when we requested information it was informed that he is working with the Presidential Task Force."

. , 6, 7 , . . . The risk has been reduced comparatively. As a result, most of them are able to do their businesses much better. So, that is why we see a change in the sentiment held as far as all the businesses are concerned.

We also see that the rupee has become stable. The rupee has been depreciating at a rate of about 6.8 per cent in the last five years during the time of the Y ahapalanaya. An average depreciation of 6.8 per cent is an enormous depreciation, but in the last one year, we have been able to control it quite effectively. As a result, its depreciation has been limited to just 2.8 per cent and if not for COVID-19, we would have probably seen an appreciation of the currency as well.

I also want to meet the challenge that was put forward previously by some of the Hon. Members of the Opposition, where they were talking about money printing, that a large amount of money has been printed. In this period after COVID-19, we have seen that every country has been having excessive issues of Treasury Bills to their respective Central Banks. We are no different. The last person who can make an allegation of that nature is the Members of Parliament of the former Government because from 15th of February, 2015 onwards until November, 2019, every month, they had been having excess Treasury Bills issued to the Central Bank. It was a completely different situation in the year 2014, at the time when I was the Governor of the Central Bank. There were hardly any monies printed in excess of the requirements, but that had been completely changed from the time the Y ahapalana Government came into office and we had seen that happening continuously.

The third area that I want to speak about, Sir, is the external sector. We have seen the external sector being revived quite substantially over the last one year. The trade balance has improved. Although the imports and exports have fallen at the same time - we have seen that both have fallen disproportionately - the trade balance has

615 616

[ ]

2021 08

become a lot more positive from the negative stance it has been in previously. Remittances have also improved. We have seen the exchange rate stabilizing. I already spoke about that and we are now working out a swap arrangement with a Central Bank of another country, where we would have a stand-by arrangement which would ensure that the rupee would stay stable even in the longer term.

So, we are comfortable about making payments of our debts. Although there were some instances where the rating agencies had made some remarks which were not very complimentary, we are now seeing that they themselves have been able to come back and say that Sri Lanka would probably be able to maintain our impeccable position vis--vis debt repayment.

, . , . . . . , . . , .

. , , . , . . , . . , are on track and on budget. We are working towards that. There are some projects which are somewhat delayed and some are not on the right track already. But, we are working towards ensuring that those projects are also brought back on track so that we will be able to proceed with a greater amount of economic activity next year.

The final area that I want to talk about, Hon. Member, is the banking sector. We inherited a banking sector which was in total disarray; we found that the banks were having very high NPLs. In the financial sector, we also found that the finance institutions were also undergoing serious stresses; we found that many of them were having difficulties in ensuring their liquidity and there had been a large amount of money that had to be paid out through the Deposit Insurance Fund in order to make those depositors have some benefit. That has now been reversed and we are seeing stability returning to the banking and financial sectors. We are comfortable that the financial sector

would also stay stable. So, the point that I am trying to make, Hon. Member, is that, overall, there is no challenge that we cannot face as a result of COVID-19.

, . . , . , , , . , , , .

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. State Minister, you have two more minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal) I will finish before that, Hon. Presiding Member.

. , , . There is no way that Sri Lanka would default on its loans; there is no instance possible for Sri Lanka to be in a position of not being able to pay its loans. So, we want to assure all those who are dealing with Sri Lanka that we would be in a position to ensure that the debt payments are made, all our bonds are honoured and that all the deposits, as far as the finance companies are concerned, are honoured.

Therefore, we would urge the Opposition also to please ensure that these kinds of stories about instability in our economy are not conveyed to the rest of the world to make it difficult for the country to move forward. We have seen how they did that in the past; we have seen how some of the current Hon. Members also went around the world asking them not to provide loans to Sri Lanka. We have seen that. In fact, when I myself went on roadshows during the time of the war in order to have bonds being issued to the country, we found that some of the Hon. Members had made representations against our country to so many investors at that time. So, since we have noticed that, we urge them now, once again, not to do that in the future so that we, together as a country, can go forward.

Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity, Hon. Presiding Member. I also want to thank the Hon. Member who moved this Motion today as it has given us the opportunity to make these clarifications. I would urge people not to accept that, but to ensure that they vote in order for Sri Lanka to progress further in the future.

Thank you very much.
