, there is a poet called Ahnaf Jazeem. . . , Amnesty International and all the other organizations have written to the Government, asking to reverse that action. You have been keeping him under custody for one year.

, .

, I want to very responsibly say that the case against Hejaaz Hizbullah is totally fabricated. You have filed a case for different reasons, because he was politically opposed to you or for whatever reason.

There has been evidence to show that small children have been forced to give statements against him. Hejaaz Hizbullah is a lawyer. He studied at the S. Thomas College. I know the Hon. Minister of Justice is also aware of that. The Hon. Prime Minister is also nodding his head. So, please look into this because by these false allegations and false cases, the entire credibility of the Government and the effort to find the real culprit behind the bomb attacks will be lost.

Speaker, Mr. Hejaaz Hizbullah, as a lawyer, has had an impeccable career, and they are trying to say that he was a chairman of a charity. Of that charity, he was just a nominal chairman. He had never cited this so-called "Madrasa". They have totally fabricated this evidence by forcing young children. There is evidence and affidavits for that from the parents of those children and others. So, in this case, you are losing credibility. The Government will lose credibility; even the Attorney-Generals Department will lose credibility. The TID and the CID, which should do a fair job, are totally -

Hon. Speaker, now, I would like to get down to the main thrust of my submissions today. I think the background, as far as this Port City Law is concerned, must be clearly established. First of all, I think we have to understand that since 2015, there has been a regular deterioration of our economy. Up to 2014, as the Hon. Prime Minister mentioned in his speech, we found that the GDP of our country had been improving from US Dollars 24 billion in 2005 to US Dollars 79 billion by 2014. However, the country hit a stagnant patch and as a result of that stagnant patch, we found the country being at the same position for the last six years. So, I think now, we need to understand that as a result of that situation, we have had a rising debt, particularly the foreign debt, a fall in the GDP and a drop in world rankings, particularly in doing business rankings. We found that in 12 instances, Sri Lanka has been dropping in its rankings regularly over the past five years from the 85th position right down to the 99th position. So, we need to do something in order to move away from that situation. We have found that our resources are low and our currency has a tendency to

627 628

depreciate. We had high interest rates right up to 2019 and our ratings were downgraded consistently during the period of the Y ahapalanaya. At the same time, Sir, we also found that the Foreign Direct Investments were also dwindling. In 2014, the Foreign Direct Investments were US Dollars 1,635 million, but it gradually reduced each year and by 2018 only, there was an increase up to US Dollars 2,367 million. Therefore, now, we need to give a new impetus to our economy in order for it to go forward.

We have already fixed some of these problems. We have found that our interest rates are today much more manageable. We have slowed down the rupee depreciation and in due course, once the economy gets back to normalcy after the COVID-19 impact is reduced, we would be able to appreciate the currency. We have responded to the COVID-19 situation quite magnificently. As I mentioned in yesterdays speech in Parliament, we have already expended Rs.138 billion in order to ensure that the country is brought to some position where we can go forward with a certain element of confidence. We are fast-tracking stagnant development projects, we are improving our doing businesses indicators and are increasing our public investments. As the Hon. Prime Minister mentioned, we have started a programme to develop 100,000 kilometres of roads and a project to provide water for all. Those projects are driven in order to ensure that Sri Lanka would get back to the fast track of development.

But, at the same time, Sir, we have to provide more opportunities for FDIs as well. We need a new burst of at least US Dollars 3 billion to come into the country on an annual basis in order to ensure that we maintain a growth rate of at least 6 per cent in our country. So, that is why we have identified certain key projects in our country as being the ones that will take this country forward. The Port City is one of them. The Port City has tremendous potential and we need to ensure that the Port City will be one of the drivers of the development activities in our country. We had already identified the Hambantota Port to be another, but, unfortunately, that is no longer under our purview. Therefore, we need to ensure that at least the Hambantota Industrial Zone is given impetus to go forward.

Yesterday, this august Assembly approved a strategic development project in relation to the tyre project that is being already carried out at the Hambantota Industrial Zone. Those are important projects that will take our country forward. At the same time, various strategic development projects are also being mooted now and the farmer zones too will take our country forward. But with all that, Sir, we need to have a game-changer and a turning point in our countrys economic march. We identify the Port City as being one of those areas in which we can make a significant change in order to have a game-changing turning point in the history of our nation.

There, we have 269 hectares of land and it is a very special land because it has been reclaimed and at the same time, it is adjoining the commercial capital of Sri Lanka. With that reclaimed, we have the potential now to build it

the way we want, to make it work the way we want and that is why we need to get it right this time.

Sir, there will be many instances where we talk about missing the bus and we are quite good at that. We consistently say that we missed the bus in such and such a year, we missed the bus in another year and we missed the bus again. This time, we cannot miss the bus. We need to create an impact, a situation where we can compete, Sir, with Dubai, Schengen, Port Klang and Singapore. We have only been talking about it in the past. We, now, need to convert our talk into action. That is why we have to make a compelling value proposition as far as the Colombo Port City is concerned. It must be a place to which people will come because it is efficient, because it has speed of delivery, because it is consistent and because it gives a secure environment for investors. So, we need to create that atmosphere, that environment in order to ensure that people from all over the world could come to Sri Lanka and make Sri Lanka their hub of future. That is not easy; that is going to be a tough call and that is why we have to do it in such a way that we should have an enabling law which will support that kind of activity.

Our enabling law, Sir, must be such that it should provide space for the Colombo Port City Economic Commission to do their work and confidence for investors to come and invest in Sri Lanka and in Port City activities which they themselves would be carrying out. So, the proposed law will be amended, as I said earlier, in accordance with the Supreme Court Determination which has already been read out by the Hon. Speaker. From the beginning, Sir, we took that stance. We never said that we are going to push this legislation through only in the way we have drafted it. We have been humble enough to admit that there may be certain instances where the expert knowledge of the Supreme Court would determine the best way possible for our country and in determining whether it is consistant with the Constitution, they could give us advice as to how this should be structured. So, nobody must say that it was a kulugedi pahara or use some obnoxious term like that. It is nothing like that. It is a question of submitting the intended legislation to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court giving its Determination in accordance with their own mandate given by the Constitution. Once it is given, we, as Parliament and as the Government, will respect that position of the Supreme Court and enact the law in accordance with the guidance given to us by the Supreme Court, and that is what we would do tomorrow.

Sir, we are encouraged to hear the Hon. Member who spoke before me mentioning that they too would like to support this particular piece of legislation and we are happy that they also have been supporting this. Even the Leader of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya and the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe had supported this very intently. In fact, Sir, in 2018, at the World Cities Summit held in Singapore, the then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was the keynote speaker and he promoted the revamped Port City Project at a time even when the land was not complete; even when the land was not complete, he promoted this.

. . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal) Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva, could you please sit down? I listened to you intently for 30 minutes.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Sir, I just rise to a point of Order. Hon. Minister, I said that we will support you with the condition that you accept our few amendments. Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal) Please, sit down and listen, Hon. Member. I listened patiently to you. Try to become a little more flexible in understanding these points.

Then, at the same time, the UDA signed a Master Plan with the Development Control Regulations. The Sri Lankan President at that time attended the deeds transferring ceremony. Then, one of the Ministers, a key Minister of that Government, mentioned - I must read it out to you as it is very important - The construction of a 60-storeyed building would be completed by 2025." That is, in the Port City. He further added, "The best answer we can give critics is to go to the 60th storey once the building is completed and see if Colombo would sink. This is an open challenge and I wish to mention the names of those who made bland criticisms on the project, on its opening day.

So, they supported it. I hope, in 2025, those former Ministers - they are MPs now - would come to the opening of that project and they could even mention the names of those who criticized it. I do hope that their names would not be in that list of MPs who had criticized it because we do not want them to be in that list; we want them to support this project.

So, what are we intending to do with this law, Sir? We intend to create a Single Window to support all the investors who come to Sri Lanka. It will be operated by an efficient Commission and we will provide attractive and competitive benefits to investors. We would be consistent as well as ensure the safety of those investments. All that is provided for in the law that we are going to pass tomorrow and we hope that you would support it. The Commission itself would consist of five to seven members. We have already agreed to the proposal of many people who suggested that the majority of the Commission should be Sri Lankans and we would provide for that. We would also provide for the Chairman of the Commission to be a Sri Lankan and I think one of

the reasons for that to be accommodated was the fear that people had that we would do a Y ahapalana stunt because we found, for the first time, a foreigner coming and becoming the Governor of the Central Bank at that time. We all know what happened. We are still trying to get him back to answer for the sins that they had committed. So, we would make this Commission to be the Single Window which will provide all the services and all the guidance to investors who come to the country. We know, Sir, how many times people have to go to various Government institutions in order to get their things done. Whenever they have to get anything done, they have to rastify in corridors, wait for officers to come, wait for excuses and we want to eliminate all that so that we can go up in rankings as far as doing business is concerned. This special Commission would be able to liaise with all the other institutions and then provide the service to those who intend to have that.

If this would be a successful project - we are endeavouring to make it so; we are making every effort to ensure that this would be successful - we would have, Sir, a state-of-the-art international financial city. It would compete with Singapore; it would compete with Dubai and it would compete with Schengen. That is the type of model we are hoping to create in the Port City. I think one square meter of land there could be valued at around US Dollars 2,500 and if so, the 69 hectares that Sri Lanka has with complete rights of leasing out for 99 years whenever we want to, could yield us US Dollars 1,725 million in addition to what the Commission would receive as a 1 per cent charge on all the other transactions the other companies in the Port City would be handling. So, these would be the benefits that we would enjoy as a Government and also the envisaged earnings that are due to the Consolidated Fund and we are happy to support that because it will also provide additional opportunity for all these investments to take place. So, we expect US Dollars 15 billion worth of investments in the next five years, 200,000 jobs and livelihoods opportunities during the construction stage and 83,000 US Dollar-based jobs in five years. It would also provide the people of our country the opportunity to work within the Port City and have dollar-based jobs. Today, they have to go to other parts of the world to enjoy such opportunities.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. State Minister, you have consumed five minutes extra.

( ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal) In another five minutes, I will be able to finish my speech, Sir.

Also, we would have a gradual improvement in Sri Lankas doing business. There would be a major impetus for conferences, tourism, theme parks and we will have 5.7 million square meters of built space. This would add approximately US Dollars 4.5 billion to the GDP of our country in the first few years and thereafter, an additional

631 632

GDP to our country at the rate of around US Dollars 12 billion and that would make a vast difference to the US Dollars 80 billion GDP that we have had in the past in the country .

Sir, there have been many criticisms that have been levelled by the Opposition. I believe the speakers who follow me would deal with those. So, I will not go into depth in responding to those. At the same time, I wish to talk about one other item, which is about money laundering. I am familiar with the controls that Sri Lanka has put in place in order to deal with money laundering because at the time when I was the Governor of the Central Bank, we had to deal with the laws related to money laundering. As that has given me experience, I know what that law can do. That is why that law has not been touched, Sir, in the enactment of this new Act. That law will prevail; that law is available to be used for any kind of situation where there is money laundering. So, we need not fear at all. We can ensure that those protections are provided. Sometimes, the people who have been talking about these have other regimes on which money laundering suspicions are being cast, particularly certain cities which have made investments in their own countries. So, I think we need not fear because Sri Lanka has the ability to ensure that money laundering is not an issue in Sri Lanka.

Lastly, Sir, I want to make an invitation to the Opposition. I believe they have seen the benefits of this because they themselves supported that when they were in power. So, we hope that they would do the same tomorrow when this Bill is taken up for voting. , . , , . , .

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) The next speaker is the Hon. Selvam Adaikkalanathan. You have seven minutes.

[1.41 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, may I digress for a moment from the Debate of the day to bring the attention of the Government to the following issue:

The horrendous developments in occupied Palestine dominated international headlines for the past two weeks. The long-delayed Open Session of the UN Security Council held on Sunday, the 16th of May has done precious little to reprimand Israel and/or attempt meaningfully to de-escalate the hostilities. It has failed to produce at least a joint statement by the UN Security Council. The death toll exceeding 220 on both sides has resulted in nearly half the number being children, women and elderly. Given the asymmetrical military might of Israel as opposed to that of a belligerent entity such as Hamas, the human toll on the Palestinian side is

645 646

[ ]

2021 5

incomparable. The damage and destruction of civilian infrastructure on the Palestinian side is going to take years to rebuild. Israel has been typically hiding behind the excuse of legitimate right of self-defense narrative, paying callous disregard to all human rights and humanitarian related protocols under the Vienna Convention. It is obvious that they have either been encouraged or emboldened by the self-imposed prevarication and bias of their notable allies in the Western world.

Sir, in such a situation, regardless of the marginal impact or leverage our position could exert on international forums, Sri Lanka cannot remain a silent onlooker. We have questioned the rationale behind some of the decisions taken at the UN forums in this regard. Regrettably, we have been known to prevaricate and/or remain stoically silent not wanting to go the extra mile to condemn these atrocities unequivocally. Therefore, I urge that the Government should act the very least, react to the situation reflecting the outrage that the preponderant majority of Sri Lankans feel at this time and join in the sentiments of the ever-growing opposition in the wider world against these heinous atrocities by Israel in the occupied territories of Palestine. Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition called it genocide. I hope that the international community would realize the type of war crimes that is being committed in the occupied territories and those leaders would be hauled up before the International Criminal Court, Sir.

Having said that, Sir, let me move on to today's Debate. Now, what do we have here? We, of course, know that this so-called Port City has now become an issue like damned if you do, damned if you do not. Why am I saying this? Because we have totally been ignoring the geopolitical issues that may impact when this becomes a reality. Let us be very frank, Sir. The Indian Ocean has become a hotspot for superpower rivalry. Your attitude was to turn a blind eye and start the landfill. Then, there was an unexpected change of Government. The Port City Project was like an unwanted pregnancy. Initially, our Government said, We will terminate this unwanted pregnancy. They went for abortion. Then, what happened? Doctors said it was too late to do the abortion; if you did the abortion, the mothers life would be at risk. Sri Lanka was caught in a debt trap. Therefore, we could not afford to abort that.

Finally, we are left to hold the bastard child. Sorry to use that word, but we are left to hold this bastard child.

Then, you come back to power. Having come back to power, you have now realized that you have to do something about this superpower rivalry issue and that the Indian Ocean has become a virtual hotspot. Therefore, this issue, the investment companies and all these have become a serious burden. Then, what do we do? Then, we offer the Indians the Eastern Terminal. There were agitation instigated by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority unions, the Buddhist clergy and various organizations. Who could have instigated those protests is anybodys guess. Then, you say to India, "We cannot give the Eastern Terminal, but we will give you the Western Terminal". To that, nobody knows what is happening now. Surely, nobody is happy about all this. So, this whole thing has resulted in this mess.

I call this Port City Project an "illegitimate child", we will say. But surely, even if it is an illegitimate child, that child need not suffer because of the parents' mistakes. You have the opportunity to teach good manners to the child and let all the neighbours and the wider world forget about the origins of the child, purely because he has the qualities of attracting everybody's serious attention. That would have been somewhat possible if you followed the draft proposal prepared by us and endorsed by the Committee appointed by the Prime Minister.

Then what happened? The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva, in the morning, very carefully laid out what happened. The Draft Bill that was prepared by the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silvas Committee was finally accepted by the current Prime Minister and he appointed another Committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Ferdinando and they virtually adopted the Draft we prepared. Now, somebody at the Presidential Secretariat has totally changed it upside down and that is why you had to finally face this situation in the Supreme Court. It is a serious embarrassment to the Government. The Supreme Court has virtually given you a thorough slap on your face. So, now you are saying, "Okay, we will now accept all what the Supreme Court says and amend the Bill". But even with the Amendments, this is virtually a child without limbs; it is a total convolution of the original Bill. What has finally happened? I can go Clause by Clause, but I have absolutely no time. Do you know what happened in the Supreme Court? The Attorney-General had to be jumping over provisions to make Amendments, which has become a virtual jumble.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Nobody is going to come and invest here in the state in which this Bill is. Therefore, I am asking the Government to take a bipartisan approach and accept the Amendments that have been proposed. Those Amendments have been accepted by the Prime Minister's Office and sent to the President's Office. It has been totally changed. The entire BOI Law has been thrown out; the baby with the bathwater has been thrown out and this has once again become a virtual devil.

Looking at the provisions in the Bill, I do not think even the fly-by-night investors will come here because there must be some certainty. Therefore, there has to be some bipartisan approach between the Government and the Opposition. We have offered some amendments. Accept them or otherwise, refer the Bill to the Legislative Standing Committee, before taking the Vote, refer it to the Legislative Standing Committee. Let us look at it and take a bipartisan approach. Otherwise, what will happen is, no investor will come; even the so-called money launderers will not touch this Bill and come here, if it goes through in this form.

With those words, I conclude, Sir.

( ) ( ( ) ) (The Hon. Jayantha Weerasinghe, PC) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I was told that I have been given about 15 minutes. I have got ready to speak for about half an hour, but just to break that into -

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, because of the earlier delay, time has been reduced for everyone.

[2.07 p.m.] ( ) ( ( ) ) (The Hon. Jayantha Weerasinghe, PC) But, Sir, what is the point in talking like this? Anyway, in deference to what you say, I will make it as short as possible. I intend speaking in English today, but where necessary and where I have to emphasize, I will resort to my own language.

653 654

2021 5

At the commencement, Sir, I wish to answer to what some of these Hon. Members from the Opposition said. One Hon. Member referred to the Supreme Court Judgment saying, " ". The English word for that is, "bludgeoned" by the Supreme Court. Another Hon. Member said that the Supreme Court gave a "slap in the face" and I will answer the Hon. Member who spoke before me in Sinhala after this. Please remember, there was no necessity for anyone to bludgeon or slap in the face. In submitting whatever Amendments that were suggested by us, the Government, through our lawyers and the Attorney-General to the Supreme Court, we gave an assurance there itself that we would incorporate them into the Bill after the Cabinet approves. Therefore, there was no need for it to be bludgeoned. That is, " " or " ". Those, the former Government would have got, certainly not us.

Then, the other Hon. Member who spoke just before me compared this Bill - I am surprised that he did - to Don Juan Dharmapala. I must say this to that Hon. Member in Sinhala. , . , . , !

Now, Sir, let me come to the subject under discussion. This particular project has now been approved by the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court, in its approval, has cited some Clauses where amendments are necessary. Some try to show that there are 26 such places. What are those? In some places, the Court has suggested just to delete one word and insert another. That is how it is. I have gone through the whole thing. So, do not try to mislead the public as you have been misleading right from the beginning.

Sir, why are we launching into this project right now? At the stage of construction of the Port City, 160,000 jobs are to be created and once it is fully completed, direct and indirect employment opportunities of 300,000 are expected to be created there. Then, FDIs - Foreign Direct Investments - are certain to double once this City comes into operation. I think that is their biggest fear.

Also, everybody knows that we are in a strategic location as far as the sea lanes are concerned. We are almost bordering the Silk Route. Then, because of that, every investor would know that if they invest in this Project, they will have access to, at least, 50 per cent of the world population. I will further explain that in Sinhala also.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, I am sorry. You have been allotted seven minutes and now, you have run out of your seven minutes.

( ) ( ( ) ) (The Hon. Jayantha Weerasinghe, PC) The list I was given states that I have been given 10 minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Yes, but because of the time delay that took place earlier, three minutes have been reduced.

( ) ( ( ) ) (The Hon. Jayantha Weerasinghe, PC) Sir, due to the time constraints, I am forced not to come out with all the facts that I have prepared to present. Anyhow, let me say this. This Project is certainly the turning point for the economy of this country. That is very well known by the Opposition. That is why they made every endeavour by going to the Court -

[4.01 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Hon. Presiding Member, I thought it was nine minutes.

Sir, I thank you for this opportunity given to me to speak on such a highly important Bill.

It is highly important from the point of view of the Government because the Government tabled this controversial Bill during the New Year holiday period. The duration for petitions to be filed before the Supreme Court was restricted to a week from the date of the Bill being tabled in Parliament. Five out of the seven days available for potential challengers were New Year public holidays. Yet, I found that a number of petitions had indeed been filed including by the Bar Association, the Transparency International, the Centre for Policy Alternatives, the JVP, the UNP and by many others. This shows how controversial the Bill has become. Fortunately, the Supreme Court has dampened the spirits of the Government. If the Government intends to respect the views of the Supreme Court, it must table the corrected version of the Bill and give us time to study it instead of taking the Vote tomorrow in a hurry.

Controversy centres around the Bill because it allows the establishment of a separate entity so close to the commercial capital city of Colombo. The fear seems to be that the setting up of an autonomous administration for the Port City would be the creation of a Chinese colony within Sri Lanka. The irresponsible borrowings and the isolation from the rest of the world because of our abysmal human rights record has driven us now to grovel before the Chinese again. One cannot ignore the fact that a desperate Chinese loan was signed just as the Bill was being gazetted.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Let me continue, Sir.

After all, we, the Tamils, are only asking for a confederal unit within the territorial integrity of this Island, but instead of discussing with us our rights and suitability to claim such a unit of self-determination for the Tamils, the Government seems to be very lavish to the Chinese all because we borrowed from the Chinese to fulfil our pet dreams like the establishment of the Mattala Airport. Our thanha has led us to this impasse.

695 696

The message that is being brought out by the actions of the successive Governments of Sri Lanka is that they are not moved by principles or pragmatism, only by military might and pecuniary considerations. It is no wonder then that, from time to time, citizens of this country attempt violent revolutions. On a cursory glance at the Bill, there is no doubt that there would be lack of transparency in relation to the operations of offshore banks in the Port City, which would be free from the purview of the regulatory framework applicable to local banks. I had no time to study the recommendations of the Supreme Court in detail, but it is patent that the Bill, as it is, would enable the evasion of Parliamentary oversight on public funds and matters taking place within the Port City would be creating a serious gap in public accountability. Many Acts of Parliament enacted in the country would not be applicable to the Port City. The Port City land has been released from all 14 Tax Acts, including the Inland Revenue Act. The Government seems to have been very lavish in telling the Chinese, Ask and it shall be given!

When I was Chief Minister of the Northern Province, I repeatedly called for the creation of a Chief Ministers Fund under the Thirteenth Amendment to help our people affected by the war and the Government, which refused to give even such a small power to its Tamil brethren who have lived together with the Sinhalese in this Island for thousands of years, have today offered to give the land and sea off this country to the Chinese who come from afar.

This Government recently chanted the slogan One country, one law. Where has that slogan gone now? Or did we mean Chinese law for the whole country? Are we not mortgaging the future of the people of this country by piling debt on the shoulders of many generations to come? Hope this country realizes the tragedy enacted. The majority community, in order to enslave the Tamils, went on borrowing from outside to fight the war.

Our politicians and others made hay while the sun shined, but the stage where we were fast becoming bankrupt was reached. And here, we are trying to give our prime land on a platter to our new colonial masters. If only the Sinhalese leaders, instead of beating the anti-Tamil drums, sat down to make amends with us Tamils, we would not have reached this pathetic stage. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike who tried to make amends was brutally killed by a Buddhist monk. The Buddhist monks have recently met the Governor of the Northern Province and made sure that she handed over the administration of 13 villages in Mullaitivu to the Mahaweli Authority, which had always acted contrary to the interests of the indigenous population of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. The Mahaweli Authority has hitherto grabbed traditional Tamil lands and given to the Sinhalese without bringing a drop of water to the Mullaitivu District from the Mahaweli as promised at the time of its establishment. Very recently, name boards in government departments in Manal Aru in the Mullaitivu District, which had existed as "Manal Aru" for centuries, have given first preference

to the Sinhala language to call the village "Weli Oya", while in the Port City, Sinhala takes second place and sometimes, no place at all, giving first preference to the Chinese language. It is funny that the Buddhist monks are in the forefront in the North and the East to grab traditional Tamil lands, but in the Western Province, they are allowing their Veerayas and Surayas to give over our land to the Chinese on a platter.

The Hon. Members of this House must realize that we, Tamils of this country, are in complete agreement with the patriotic Sinhalese in opposing attempts to compromise the sovereignty of this country. No doubt, we, the Tamils, are conscious of our identity as a nation in terms of international law. But, we still belong to this country; this is, no doubt, our country. We cannot allow the Government to surrender and mortgage our country to the Chinese. We need to revert to our former non-aligned status. Such thoughtless actions can cause permanent damages to this country, which may become irretrievable. Let me explain, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Sir, a little of my time was taken by another Hon. Member. Please give me that time.

Under Clause 6 (1)(i) of the Colombo Port City Economic Commission Bill, the Commission, for example, is given a general power to plan, issue and monitor compliance of permits and authorizations, which Clause further states, ...notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other written law,..... That is, the power to create new rights and obligations disregard of the national law. In other words, it is legislative power in the strict sense granted to the Commission in violation of the Sri Lankan Constitution.

Further, Clause 3(5) of this Bill requires the Commission to obtain the concurrence of the relevant Regulatory Authority. However, the second proviso of Clause 3(6) stipulates, I quote:

The relevant Regulatory Authority from whom such concurrence is being sought by the Commission, shall as soon as practicable in the circumstances, as a matter of priority, provide such concurrence to the Commission. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Okay, Sir.

697 698

[ .. ]

2021 5

On the one hand, the Commission is required to obtain concurrence and on the other, it could compel prompt concurrence! Thus, the Commission has power to override national regulatory law at will.

Therefore, it would appear that the Colombo Port City Economic Commission Bill, as currently drafted, would be contrary to the Constitution, if passed.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) I am finishing up, Sir.

If the Government intends avoiding a Referendum as prescribed in Article 83 of the Constitution, it should take the advice of the Supreme Court, redraft the Bill, circularize it among the Hon. Members, give sufficient time for them to peruse the new draft and thereafter, have discussions and take a decision.

[4.11 p.m.] () ( ) ( ( ) - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana - Minister of Plantation) Hon. Presiding Member, let me remind the learned Hon. Member of Parliament who spoke before me that it was the Tamil people who suffered more than the Sinhalese people during the 30-year civil war in this country. It was the heroic forces, under the stewardship of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and His Excellency Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the then Defence Secretary, who liberated this country from the clutches of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. By that liberation of the country, the Tamil people benefited more than the Sinhalese people. The LTTE killed more Tamil leaders than

Sinhalese leaders in this country. So, not only did we liberated this country from that ruthless organization, but we will also ensure that development would be imparted to the people of this country, including to those in the Northern Province as well under the leadership of His Excellency President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. M. Udayakumar. You have five minutes.

[4.28 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. M. Udayakumar) Hon. Presiding Member, the Colombo Port City Project has created a lot of arguments among all citizens, organizations, environmental groups, lawmakers and many others in the country. At the outset, Sir, I would like to say that any new development project should bring about benefits to the country and its citizens as a whole. But, at present, the people and we have differences of opinion about the Colombo Port City Project, which need proper clarifications. The reclamation of the project was done through Foreign Direct Investments amounting to US Dollars 1.4 billion by a Chinese company, the largest of its kind in Sri Lanka. In return, the company would get the right to monetize a major portion of the marketable land, which is largely perceived to be a threat to the sovereignty of the country. For this reason, we, as Parliamentarians, need to push the Government to seek alternative arrangements rather than go for a locked-in strategy with China for generations under this Project. I would also like to say that the outlook of the project might look great, but the concessions granted to that company and China under this Project look like that the Government has agreed to give much more benefits to an outsider to control the entire Project with minimum benefits to its own citizens.

Sir, even Sri Lanka, like much of the rest of the world, is still plagued by the COVID-19 pandemic. The nations energy is being sapped by the ongoing controversy over the Colombo Port City Economic Commission Bill presented in Parliament. Under the countrys law, every Bill has to be cleared by the Supreme Court before Parliament votes on it.

The Government stated before the Supreme Court that certain amendments are possible and listed out some specifics. But, the Supreme Court pointed out other provisions which were more contentious than those.

Along with the Hambantota Port Project, the Colombo Port City Special Economic Zone also became a controversy at birth. The Colombo Port City itself faced a lot of criticism from the time the project kicked off. The Colombo Port City Economic Commission Bill has become a very controversial and a sensitive issue in Sri Lanka. Therefore, the Bill has to be reviewed in that background. It has become evident that various provisions of the Bill go against the spirit of the existing laws, the judicial pronouncement and the socio-political realities of the nation. To begin with, the Bill provides for the setting up of the Colombo Port City Commission with five to seven members as a one-stop decision-maker on all matters of the Colombo Special Economic Zone. The Commission is to be a Single Window investment facilitator. The powers of the Colombo Port City Economic Commission include clearing of individual applications for authorized persons to do business in the Colombo Port City, grant tax breaks, Customs Duty, VAT, import and export concessions for investors and exemptions from casinos and gaming laws. No such investment protection or concession has been available for the domestic and foreign investors who have been in business in the country for a long time and with greater commitment to the country. Sir, unlike under the existing norms where the Auditor-General is the constitutional authority to do the audits, private auditors alone can audit the Colombo Port City Special Economic Zone. For this reason, the Colombo Porty City is out of bounds for Parliament and the Parliamentary Committees. So again, this is a travesty of the existing laws and practices. I would say that the Bill should ensure that the Special Economic Zone would be overseen by the Parliamentary Committees like the COPE and the COPA.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. . ( . ) (The Hon. M. Udayakumar) I am winding up, Sir.

So, we have to look at the whole issue as a taking away of the powers of Parliament, the Cabinet and the Judiciary through this Bill. Through this Bill, the Government should at least convince the people that the Special Economic Zone would provide jobs and incomes to the local population and also involve local suppliers and enterprises.

Finally, adding to the objections, the Supreme Court in its Determination on the Colombo Porty City Economic Commission Bill has concluded that several Clauses of the Bill are inconsistent with the Constitution. So, I think this highlights the seriousness of the unlawful agenda proposed by the Government, which made the

705 706

[ ]

2021 5

highest court to intervene and make directives to uphold the Constitution of the country, which is the first in the history of Sri Lanka.

Let us, as Parliamentarians, abide by the Oath that we took and act with honesty and integrity for the sake of the people, reaching for the best solution for the Colombo Port City Project to benefit our own citizens and not limiting those only to a few.

Thank you.

[4.52 p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Jeevan Thondaman - State Minister of Estate Housing and Community Infrastructure) Hon. Presiding Member, first, I would like to start off by saying that I am well aware that the Hon. M. Rameshwaran has been diagnosed with COVID-19. I would also like to state that he has been in isolation for the past 11 days and nobody has come in to contact with him, despite some accusations which I heard earlier.

Sir, the discussion at hand today is about the Port City, the main objective of which appears to be encouraging Foreign Direct Investments in a bid to show our country as an economic powerhouse in the global market. First, we must understand that in terms of economic growth and the rate of growth, we are far behind some of our neighbouring countries and it is a very disappointing start. Looking back in history, we should also understand that we have always relied on our internal resources and have not paid heed to attract Foreign Direct Investments to the amount that we should have. So, with that in mind, the Port City was formulated in order to drive the economic growth of our nation.

There seems to be an issue with regard to the authority of the President, which, I feel, needs to be addressed. You would have seen that during the past few weeks, there was an issue saying that the President would be appointing a self-governing body which would do all the regulation of the Port City and whatnot, making it seem as though it is a dictatorship, but in reality, that is not true. I would like to say that His Excellency the President is someone who was elected by the majority of the citizens of the country, thereby giving him the trust of the citizens. Apart from that, the current President is someone who, based on his merit, has received an overwhelming majority and who has been evaluated, judged and decided by the people of Sri Lanka. Other than that, we, the Ceylon Workers' Congress, as an aligned party, strongly support the vision of the President and believe in his firm bid to grow our country.

We also believe that Parliamentary supremacy will be upheld as what I am made to believe is that any Regulations that are going to be put forward in relation to the Port City have to be passed by Parliament first and if, in three months, a Regulation is not passed or approved, it is automatically deemed null and void.

In addition to that, if you look at the population of youth in Sri Lanka, you would notice, as the Hon. (Dr.) Seetha Arambepola also mentioned earlier, a brain drain. We have a lot of skilled and educated youth leaving our country. The number is alarming as it is close to 100,000 and they are leaving our country in order for better opportunities in different countries and in global giants. If that is the case, if we can offer the same opportunities here in our country, I feel we can find a solution to this particular issue. We can create jobs not only through global giants, but also through tech startups and foreign investments here in our country.

The main objective of the Colombo Port City Economic Commission Bill is to showcase Sri Lanka to the entire world as an investment destination and as an economic hub. We also need to understand that disagreements are natural because when the countrys governance is solely based on the ruling party and the Opposition, the way the disagreements are portrayed could be different is what I feel. The Port City is coming up not only to boost Sri Lankas economy, but also to place it on a global scale. If industrialists with an interest of bringing in FDIs or whatnot see how we argue about this particular issue, it discourages them, even turning them back from this particular economic hub. Therefore, I would like to urge the Hon. Members of this House to put the country and the nations economy above politics during this pandemic. I strongly agree with what the Hon. Leader of the Opposition mentioned earlier, that we must put politics aside and come together as one without partisanship in between in order to get out of this pandemic, in short.

Other than those arguments regarding the Port City, there are many arguments, that it will be a separate entity and a pseudo-Chinese colony, but those arguments frankly hold no water.

Since my time is short, I would also like to say that all those arguments that have been put forth today in this House by the Hon. Members of the Opposition or anybody else for that matter against this Port City issue are the same arguments that had been put forward at the apex judicial body of this country, which is the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has clearly given its opinion, that if we are to incorporate its Amendments, then we can rightfully go ahead and I feel that it is the stance of the Government as well.

Lastly, on an unrelated note, other than that of the Port City, I would just like to say a few more additional things. As the Ceylon Workers Congress, a party of Indian origin and a party within the Government, of which I am the General Secretary, we have expressed our displeasure

and discontent at the non-inclusivity of the Tamil language in the Port City premises. However, I would also like to state that we are extremely pleased to inform this House that we had a discussion with the Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal and he has agreed to resolve that issue and make sure that there would be no repetition of it. We hope it would not be a cause to stir up a hornet's nest. Lastly, Sir, I wish to say a few words in Tamil.

Sir, I would just like to make one more unrelated point. Today, I witnessed something. There was an altercation between two individuals, in which one individual assaulted the other. Not only did he assault the other individual, but also inhumanly attacked an animal. This may seem like a small issue to everyone, but the pictures that I saw had extreme graphic content. The legs of the dog were chopped off and the head was split into two. All those were done by that individual. This sort of barbaric activity, I feel, needs to be changed. We are still governed by an archaic law, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance, adopted in 1907. Therefore, I feel that an Animal Welfare Bill should be looked at right after all this.

Thank you for giving me time, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. Charles Nirmalanathan. You have five minutes.
