( - ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena - Minister of Education and the Leader of the House of Parliament) Power cuts is a separate matter.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) No. If you do not have money, you cannot import fuel, you cannot import coal. So, if you cannot have coal and fuel, then you will have to go for power cuts; power cuts ,

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Former Prime Minister, at the moment, there is no power cut. There is a serious problem, to which you are trying to draw the attention of the Government. The Votes of the relevant Ministries and Corporations are taken up for discussion today. So, you can ask those questions. There is no power cut issue at the moment. There is a go-slow by the engineers union. That is a different issue. So, do not link up the two matters together.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) No. I am not linking up - ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I appreciate what you are raising. At the moment, there is panic about a foreign exchange crisis, but still, we are in control.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) What I am saying is that we have to discuss what will happen next year because we are making appropriations for the next year.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) That will be explained.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) The President himself, at the Presidential Export Awards ceremony, said, We will have to take unpopular decisions. So, he was prepared to say that the Government has to take such decisions. We are not saying that these are popular decisions, but let us all get together and look at this issue of power cuts.

The Accord, Hon. Minister, was entered into specifically to deal with Resolving the ethnic problem of Sri Lanka, and the consequent violence, and for the safety, well-being and prosperity of people belonging to all communities of Sri Lanka. There is no reference whatsoever in the Accord relating to economic rights between the parties, and it is limited to the ethnic conflict. There is also no reference to the oil tanks even in the annexures, that the oil tanks should be given. It is mentioned only in two letters that were exchanged between the Late Mr. Rajiv Gandhi and Late President J.R. Jayewardene, one of which states,The work of restoring and operating of the Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm will be undertaken as a joint venture between India and Sri Lanka. So, it does not talk about leasing or anything like that. There is nothing about a lease of the entire oil tank farm in it, which you have been touting for the last few weeks.

So, you have been telling untruth on the question of the legal validity of the Agreement relating to the taking over of possession and related matters of the China Bay installation of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. You referred to the Agreement saying that it is a legal Agreement. That is a Memorandum of Understanding. MoU , 1 2 , 6 , 2003 ,

[3.00 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake)

Hon. Presiding Member, at the United Nations Climate Change Conference held between 31st October and 12th November, 2021 in Glasgow, His Excellency President Gotabaya Rajapaksa said that there will be no more new coal power plants in Sri Lanka in the future and the country will achieve 70 per cent of its energy requirement through renewable energy by the year 2030. That is a very good thing.

, if we are looking at alternative energy, we must look at renewable energy. Renewable energy has been classified as biomass, hydropower and so on. , . , 50, , wind power, solar power and geothermal power are also classified as renewable energy. There is a huge potential in this country for solar and wind power. There are also onshore and offshore wind farms. The Hon. Duminda Dissanayake also spoke about wind power and the huge potential for it. The cost of wind energy and solar energy is coming down with the development of new technology. We have the potential to develop at least a 1,000 megawatt offshore wind plant in Puttalam and the Hon. Minister mentioned the Mannar Basin also.

But, the issue here is the worsening economic crisis in this country. The economy has been mismanaged by this Government. How will this Government face the looming power crisis? , ,

995 996

, The fundamental question on the share sales agreement of the Yugadanavi Power Plant is, who decided on that value of US Dollars 250 million? Was it the Auditor-General? If so, is he so qualified? Or, was it someone else who decided on that US Dollars 250 million value? Can the Government table the valuation report? Keep in mind that your Government came to power by promising the people of this country that not an inch of this country's lands will be sold; If this Government wants to sell some land, why do they not tender for it or, at least, go for a Swiss Challenge inviting all parties to come and participate in that tender? I am asking the Government to be transparent.

Now, Hon. Minister, the name of the game is LNG - Liquified Natural Gas. All future transportations of shipping lines will be done by using LNG. Container ships will require at least US Dollar 1 million worth of LNG in the future. So, I think the New Fortress Energy Company is targeting that, trying to make Sri Lanka a global hub for LNG supply, which is a good business strategy for them. But, where will that lead Sri Lanka? Where will we stand in that deal? Why is the Government not disclosing the details of that Agreement to Parliament and the people of this country? Do all the Cabinet of Ministers know about the intricate details of that deal or not? The Hon. Minister, when he replies, will probably touch on that. The people are asking, Who is getting paid? Clause 3.1 (b) of that Agreement states that the maximum unit price is US Dollar Cents 9.9 for the Yugadanavi Power Plant.

However, according to the Cabinet Paper dated 06.09.2021, the Government has agreed to increase the unit price to US Dollar Cents 12.32. ? Who is the one who increased the agreed unit price of US Dollar Cents 9.9 to US Dollar Cents 12.32? Who is getting paid, is the question that this entire country is asking.

Now, there is a talk of a price formula for fuel. I must remind that when the late Hon. Mangala Samaraweera brought a price formula, your party criticized it. What is happening now? Is there a price formula coming up? I think the Hon. Minister has to answer that question.

Then, let us look at the State-owned Enterprises and their losses. The Hon. Anura Dissanayaka also touched on that. With regard to the CPC, there are unpaid bills worth US Dollars 1.3 billion and the loans to banks stand roughly at US Dollars 2 billion. So, the total liability is around US Dollars 3.3 billion. Then, if you look at the Ceylon Electricity Board, there is US Dollars 45 to 50 billion worth of debt that has to be settled per year. Sir, if you look at the SriLankan Airlines also, there is a colossal debt which has to be settled. But, I do not know how the Government is going to settle these amounts. We, as the Opposition, have always maintained that whenever the Government proposes something good for the country, we would certainly support it.

Then, what has happened to the fuel credit line with Qatar? Did that work out or not? I think the Hon. Minister has to disclose to this House the details of that discussion as well. Will India give us a credit line? If so, how much? Earlier, the Hon. Anura Dissanayaka said that it is about US Dolalrs 500 million, but what was reported in the newspapers was that it is about US Dollars 250 million. So, what is the real status of that agreement or deal with India? Then, what will happen to the Sapugaskanda Refinery? What will happen to the Trincomalee oil tanks? These are questions that have been raised in the House from this morning. The Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka and the Hon. Kabir Hashim also raised them. So, I think the Hon. Minister will have to answer those questions.

Fortunately for the Hon. Minister and the Government, 65 to 70 per cent of our households still cook using firewood. , especially after what has been happening with the gas cylinders, people will start resorting to alternative means of cooking, and firewood will be used more, going back in time.

I do not wish to speak much longer, Sir, but I wish to say that there would be more burning issues in our country. , , , , ?

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have four minutes more. ( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) ,

Sir, I will conclude my speech by quoting Richelle E. Goodrich. She stated, There are far too many silent sufferers. Not because they don't yearn to reach out, but because they've tried and found no one who cares. : You can fool all the people some of the time and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.
