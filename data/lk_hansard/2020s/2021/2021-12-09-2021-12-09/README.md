[11.22 a.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, for the time allotted to me today to speak at the Committee Stage Discussion.

Last year, when I spoke on the Votes of Ministry of Justice, I said that the Minister of Justice must be feeling like the Minister of Ports and Shipping of Afghanistan. I like to repeat that today because he is, in fact, very uncomfortable in that post. We have seen in the media that the Minister of Justice had tried to resign. It is very strange that a person "tries" to resign, but he is unable to resign. He, being a member of the legal profession, a member of the Inner Bar at that, should know how to

2493 2494

resign, if he wants to resign. What is there "to try to resign and not being able to resign"? It is very strange, but that is what we read, that the Minister of Justice does not know how to even resign from his post. But, all that points to his uncomfortableness in holding this post, that of Minister of Justice in the current regime. I do not blame him for that.

The Government, for all its rhetoric, has unashamedly been interfering in the administration of justice in this country. As I speak, I read the news that the former Navy Commander Wasantha Karannagoda is tipped to be appointed a Governor, to replace former Governor Raja Collure, who passed away recently. Let me express our condolences on the death of the Communist Party stalwart who also succumbed to COVID-19. But, Wasantha Karannagoda is an accused, a suspect in one of the emblematic cases in this country - the abduction for ransom, not for anything else, by naval personnel of 11 youths in Colombo, who were taken to the Trincomalee Naval Base and done to their deaths. Now, the police, having conducted investigations, have named several suspects including the Navy Commander at that time and inexplicably, the Attorney-General in a mighty hurry, in an indecent hurry is trying to withdraw or has intimated that he would withdraw indictments against Wasantha Karannagoda. The families of these young men have been agitating for justice for so long and during the last regime, managed to move the wheels of justice a little bit, but now, it is being reversed and it is such a person that you want to appoint the Governor of a province.

It is not only that, many indictments filed during the last Government by the then Attorney-General, who incidentally is the Chief Justice today, are being withdrawn by the current Attorney-General. As soon as he is appointed to that post, the first thing that he is doing is to withdraw indictments filed against Hon. Members of the current Government. The Attorney-General is supposed to be independent in our country; his appointment is supposed to be independent and during his tenure, he is supposed to act independently, unlike in many other countries which have their own tradition, where the Attorney-General is a political appointee. Even in Britain, he is a political appointee; in India, he is a political appointee, but in those countries, even though they are political appointees, we find that they act independently once they are appointed. Here, the reverse seems to be true.

The Minister protested at the appointment of another pardoned convict, who was convicted for contempt of court, where he was so convicted and sentenced on a complaint made by a Magistrate for disturbing the proceedings in court and where the Magistrate himself had the power to punish him summarily for contempt. The learned Magistrate chose to make the complaint to the Court of Appeal and after a full-blown inquiry, where the venerable monk was afforded a hearing, he was convicted and sentenced, and then he was pardoned. He was contemptor in another contempt proceedings presently pending before the Court of Appeal, where he

violated the Order of the Magistrates Court in Mullaitivu and facilitated the cremation of a body of another monk in the premises of a Hindu temple. Now, such is the person you find suitable enough to appoint as Chairman of a Task Force and naturally, the Minister protested also for the reason, I suppose, that he was not even consulted. And originally, no Tamil was appointed to this Task Force. That was a good thing. I did not think that any self-respecting Tamil would have served in that Task Force. We said that also, but as it often happens, you find all kinds of people in every community and so, you found three people who were willing to bury their dignity and go and sit in that Task Force. I say this because that Task Force is captioned One Country, One Law. Most people think that that is something to do with personal laws, but it is far worse than that.

If the Government is committed to devolution of powers as you have been saying to the international community - Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, when he was President, repeatedly assured India in three joint statements and in another joint statement with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, which, in fact, is a promise made to the entire international community, that he would enhance devolution - then, there cannot be "One Country, One Law" because even in this broken provincial council system under the Thirteenth Amendment, which we do not accept, there is legislative power over certain subjects that are devolved to the provinces.

The provinces can make their own laws in respect of matters in the Provincial Council List and even in matters that come under the Concurrent List. We have been saying that the subjects that are devolved to the provinces must be exclusively devolved to the provinces and the provinces must be supreme in respect of those issues; the legislative power given to them must be supreme. The Centre ought not to override that. But, that is not the case under the Thirteenth Amendment. The Centre can, with a two-thirds majority, override it, as we saw happening in the Divineguma Bill and various other instances. Nevertheless, under our Constitution, we still have power devolved to the provinces to make statutes, to make law. Legislative power is devolved and the promise by the Government to the world is that you will enhance devolution. So, on the one hand, you say that you are enhancing devolution, which means even legislative power that is given to the provinces would be enhanced or, at least, dealt with in such a manner that the Centre ought not interfere with those subjects, and on the other, you are appointing a Task Force to ensure One Country, One Law. How can there be One Country, One Law if legislative power is devolved to the provinces? It runs contrary to the current constitutional arrangement and to the various promises that you are dishing out to the world that you would enhance devolution. That is, that Task Force. That is why I said that we did not think that any self-respecting Tamil would serve on that, but as I said, for various reasons, people do go and sell their dignity. There were already some persons from the Muslim community who had been appointed to that. So, that is another matter to be taken note of. Whether this Task Force is worthy of being appointed or not, in the original

2495 2496

[ .. ]

2021 09

appointment, there was no Tamil appointed. That says something. We were elated that no Tamil was appointed, but from the Presidents side, when he did appoint, no Tamil was appointed. So, what does that mean? What does that reveal? Later, some people were added; earlier also, something like that happened. Afterthoughts. So, do you think that we are afterthoughts in this country? We have lived in this country as long as or longer than anyone else. This country belongs to us as much as it belongs to anybody else. We are not afterthoughts in this country. In any case, this particular appointment and the Task Force are something that we totally reject. In fact, we do not even have to say it because with the type of person you have appointed as Chairperson to this Task Force and with the Hon. Minister coming from the community that he does, stomaching this is something that we cannot accept. It is like those three Tamil people who have been appointed to this Task Force. Hon. Minister, I did not think that you also would, at some point, sell your dignity like this and continue in this office. Merely telling the country or your community that you are trying to resign, but you are unable to resign is a joke!

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Okay, Sir.

It does not do you any good. So, my plea to you, if I might call you even in this august Assembly my learned Friend, is to stand up straight and resign before these sessions are out.

Thank you.

[1.01 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, may I, at the very outset, share our serious concern and also condemn what has happened to a precious life of a Sri Lankan in Pakistan. All of us have been thoroughly shocked, caught by utter dismay and disgust and to a certain extent, revulsed at the way in which this inhuman, gruesome murder had been committed by a vigilante group, as we are told. If this had been done in the name of religion, who will ever condone such brutality and the horrendous manner adopted to put an innocent man to death is a question that everybody is asking.

Sir, it is important for us to remember that according to Islam, this type of extremist action goes against the teachings of the Quran and I would like to quote this from the Fifth Chapter, Verse 32 of Quran.

Whosoever has spared the life of a soul, it is as though he has spared the life of all people. Whosoever has killed a soul, it is as though he has murdered all of mankind.

2517 2518

Such is the attitude of Islam towards this type of horrendous and totally unpardonable murders that take place in the name of religion. It is also a matter of solace for all of us that the Pakistani Prime Minister, the Hon. Imran Khan, had acted swiftly and very firmly in this regard. No less a person than the Most Venerable Mahanayaka Thero of the Asgiriya Chapter has appreciated the conduct of the Pakistani Prime Minister. It is indeed a move that we all appreciate and we also should thank the Pakistani Prime Minister for having come here and persuaded the Government to reverse another horrendous policy of the Government to cremate the Muslim dead who had been affected by the COVID catastrophe. I do not want to dwell much on this aspect, except to say that we are all very pleased that Pakistan is taking action. We hope that all those people responsible will be apprehended and such things will never be repeated. Of course, we, Sri Lankans, had experience. We had been coming to the rescue of Pakistanis when there was a boycott by several cricketing nations. We sent our team and our team had to face a terrible situation, where they also came under a terrorist attack. But then, that did not deter us from continuing to maintain our sporting ties as well and, I am sure, all these will be remembered by everyone concerned.

Having said that, Sir, I, as a former Minister, would like to say a few words regarding the Minister of Justice. Initially, in the morning, I heard the Hon. Sumanthiran taking a few pot shots at the Hon. Minister, saying that he threatened to resign and did not resign. I would say that - I would not be so uncharitable to the Hon. Minister - he would stay there and fight it out rather than resigning because if you ask me, as somebody who had resigned previously, thrice over, I would rather say that it is better to stay and fight than to tender a resignation. Of course, the indignation that he suffered has been corrected, perhaps, to some extent.

But, the way in which this particular Presidential Task Force is going around with pomp and pageantry all over and is being received by some is very surprising to all of us because we see that this countrys criminal justice system is facing many challenges. Those people who are chairing such Task Forces had not only been convicted earlier for the offence of contempt of court, but had also been granted a Presidential Pardon and that issue had been taken up many a time.

But be that as it may, it is important for us to look at the manner in which certain pieces of legislation are enforced now because it is seen as a most damaging mechanism by which minorities have been targeted by weaponizing the specific pieces of legislation to detain and silence individuals. I am specifically saying about the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Act and the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Both have been combined and are being used to take revenge against minorities and important individuals. Now, I would like to refer to the case of Mr. Azath Salley. I would like to quote from the column "In the National Interest" written by Mr. Javid Yusuf appearing in "The Sunday Times" of

05th December, 2021. He normally writes his column particularly on legal matters and had been a former Member of the Constitutional Council. He says this in his column, I quote:

The Magistrate had delivered an order drawing attention to a strong discrepancy between the views expressed by Azath Salley during the media conference which was at the heart of the indictment against him and the content of the edited version published by the media. It was on the edited version that the indictment against Mr. Salley had been based.

The Chief Magistrate had observed that if the entire unedited version of the media conference had been published, it would have been clear that the suspect had expressed an idea of building peace among the people and to rise up as one nation.

This column pointed out that if the findings of the Chief Magistrate were upheld it would be an uphill task to establish the prosecutions case against Azath Salley.

This column also urged that in view of the order by the Colombo Chief Magistrate it was incumbent on the Attorney-General to review the indictment against Mr. Salley and take appropriate action.

But, what happened? The Attorney-General did not pay any heed to the comments made by the Chief Magistrate and went ahead with the indictment; he did not withdraw the indictment and went ahead with the case. I made it a point to be present in court on two days in order to just give some moral support to Mr. Azath Salley for what had happened and the way in which he was being victimized. Finally, we were pleased to see that the learned High Court Judge had acquitted him from all charges and had also found fault with three of our Members of Parliament who had made a very damaging and false representation to the police in order to say that he had engaged in hate speech. That was how the provisions of the ICCPR Act and the PTA had been combined in order to refuse bail for Mr. Salley. For nine months, he had to be in custody without bail and it is a very serious matter. The High Court Judge has now summoned those Members of Parliament in order to see whether some damages could be awarded.

But be that as it may, this has now become a common practice. The Attorney-Generals Department has a very important function in the country. The Attorney-General, being the Chief Law Officer, is the main adviser to the Government. But be that as it may, he also has to oversee the criminal justice system as all the prosecutorial functions regarding criminal matters come under him. Sometimes, there seems to be some confusion, particularly when it comes to the independence of the Attorney-General.

There was a very important Judgment recently by the Supreme Court. I would like to read from that recent Judgment by Justice Janak De Silva. In the Judgment, he very clearly quotes Lord Denning. It states, I quote:

The Attorney-General is vested with extensive statutory powers in relation to criminal investigations and prosecutions. Such powers are held in public trust. They must be exercised for the due administration of justice according to the rule of law which is the basis of our Constitution. Any type of dictation from whatever quarter will compromise the independence of the Attorney-General

2519 2520

unless such dictation is permitted by law. Any compromise of the independence of the Attorney-General will have a negative impact on the rule of law."

That was regarding a Cabinet decision which forced the Attorney-General to withdraw indictments against several people who had been having domesticated elephants. In some parts of the Commonwealth, we have the Attorney-General as a member of the Cabinet. But here, it is not so. Still, with regard to this type of serious matters, particularly when it comes to criminal matters, it would be rather advisable to create a separate directorate of public prosecutions because there appears to be undue pressure on the Attorney-General.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I know with the limited time, it is difficult to say any more.

Finally, we are very pleased to see, at least now, some activism from the Judiciary regarding matters where fabricated evidence is being used to keep people in custody. We saw in the newspapers today about the case of Ahnaf Jazeem, a poet who have been held in custody for several months now, almost a year or more, under the PTA as well as the ICCPR Act in a similar manner. The Attorney-General has perhaps consented to give him bail. But, similarly, there is the case of Hejaaz Hizbullah and also other such cases. These are serious matters. Those have already been raised by the European Commission regarding the GSP Plus and also in the Report by the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Therefore, it is important for the Attorney-General to realize the dangers of fabricating evidence and to look at the veracity of evidence available for him to carry on with a case or otherwise, withdraw the indictment, whereas he is seeking to withdraw indictments of some politically interested parties. Rather than that, he must apply his judicial mind and take action accordingly.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . .

Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly, said civil rights leader Martin Luther King.

If we are to apply that to us in the context of a Buddhist country, we cannot be satisfied. We cannot construct a working democracy, if we do not have a justice system that is equal to all. A countrys quality and the depth of civilization is measured by the way it offers justice to all its peoples irrespective of ethnicity, religion, language, gender, disability or even sexual orientation. Sri Lanka, my motherland, is named as Dhammadeepa not merely because we have thousands of temples and tens of thousands of Sangha restoring "dhamma in this country, but because we are a society committed to justice for everyone, even to the most marginalized, the very weak and the voiceless. It is the great chronicle of "Mahavamsa" that records how Elara, the Tamil King, was a symbol of justice to his friends as well as to his enemies. And the same book, the same chapter records how the great King Dutugamunu accorded his opponent, after his defeat and death, a royal symbol of respect and honour. We cannot be a true civilization unless we make sure our justice system is fair and open.

It is for that reason that I take this opportunity to thank President Gotabaya Rajapaksa for having courage to appoint a Muslim, a community considered as a numerical minority, as our Minister of Justice. And in turn, to his credit, the Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry has boldly, honestly and very openly taken some unprecedented steps to restore, repair and reconstruct the justice system in this country in an era where the younger generation is either cynical or not believing in the highest court of this land.

Sir, I wish to draw the serious attention of this House, at this stage, to the issue of prisoners kept under the PTA. , . . , , ? , , . , ) . We have hundreds of citizens in prisons for suspected or convicted acts of terrorism. That is a fact. Some of them have been in prison for more than half of their life. The miscarriage of justice is that some of them are there even without proper charges and some are there without being charged at all. While reimagining to construct a new democracy in the post-war society under our new leadership, still, even 12 years after the war was over, we have not brought justice to those voiceless people. It is true that we defeated one of the most ruthless groups of terrorists in the world 12 years ago, but true peace will come only when we restore our motherland to a status where the citizens believe in justice and could seek justice for them. We must take serious steps in order to redress this issue, which has become one of the issues that our

2521 2522

people have to contend, not just with the Tamil diaspora, but also with the international community. I am glad that the President has appointed a national committee for a speedy decision on these otherwise unfortunate lives. But, it seems that the process is so slow, that the hopes given to them are vanishing faster than they were made. May they be Tamils, Muslims, Sinhalese or even foreigners, but we must bring justice to those people because justice delayed is justice denied. Also, long-delayed justice is equal to ever denied justice. We must bring justice not because of international norms, the international community or international pressure from Geneva or elsewhere, but because it is the teaching of our noble Buddhism, it is the teaching of our civilization and gives a deeper meaning for democracy.

Therefore, I appeal to the President and the Hon. Minister of Justice, who is in charge of these matters, to pay attention to these five simple things: one, release immediately those who have not been charged yet; two, bring charges against those who are lamenting without knowing what their future would be; three, if they are guilty, reduce the sentences considering the fact that they have been in prison for so long without their grievances being addressed; four, bring in a national programme for deradicalization and rehabilitation of those who have given their lives to extreme forms of politics and five, give meaning to democracy not because of any international pressure, but because it is the very symbol and foundation of our Buddhist civilization.

There is a well-known strategy for justice, Hon. Minister: realization of morality within the political domain. The first step is to give an account of the basic goods or basic capabilities to which everyone is entitled simply by virtue of his or her being a human being. The second step is to treat the political domain as a collective effort in ensuring the proper distribution of those goods and justice or realization of basic capabilities.

I thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 1 .

[2.01 p.m.] ( () () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya) Hon. Presiding Member, I think there is no need for any further argument about the state of justice in our country. Over the past several decades, people have lost trust or faith in the system and that is very evident. This is not something that has happened overnight or within the last few days or years, but that is a process that has been ongoing and the result is that today, the peoples sense of justice is heavily compromised. It has come to a point where you could be termed either as a victim or a perpetrator. It is often a matter of how well connected you are before you could be identified as a victim or a perpetrator. We know that those with political, social and economic connections get away even with murder in this country.

Although we talk a lot about the need for discipline and the need for a disciplined society in this country - it was a major part of this current Governments electoral campaign - yet when we look at how people within the system of justice also behave, I think we know that there is a much more serious fundamental problem of discipline than what is generally talked about. This is especially apparent when we look at the way people who are appointed to positions, especially positions that are expected to look into legal reforms, are behaving. Today, the social media is full of memes and jokes, poking fun at people appointed by the President to task forces that are expected to reform law. This not only brings the Judiciary into shame, but also makes the President a laughing stock because it is actually questioning his ability, his discretion when it comes to making these kinds appointments.

Sir, even the way in which the Members of Parliament and the responsible Ministers react to instances of

2537 2538

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

injustice also speaks volumes of the real problems within our judicial system. For instance, we know that the killings that take place in police custody are deeply unacceptable. But, when matters such as those are raised, the Minister in charge of the police responds by pointing out that the person who was killed was a bad man. What kind of logic is that? We are not here to make judgements; Ministers are not expected to make judgements like that. That is why you have a legal system. We cannot just kill people we do not like and let off those we like. That is not up to us. But, that kind of remark, that kind of attitude by responsible persons is highly damaging to the sense of justice that people expect in this country and they erode the honour and faith that people should have in the system of justice.

Law's delays have been talked about extensively in todays Discussion and I want to point out how law's delays affect especially women and children. The cases of violence against women, especially rape - statutory rape and gang rape - record a really low prosecution rate due to systems followed by law enforcement in evidence collection. Sometimes, it takes over 48 hours to produce a victim survivor to the JMO and almost all medical evidence of rape has disappeared by then. Cases are being thrown away due to lack of evidence or because the rape survivor married the rapist many years after the incident had taken place. The Sri Lanka Police, the Attorney-Generals Department and the Judiciary, although mandated to bring about justice, do not work together sufficiently and do not ensure that justice is served to the people of this country, particularly to the vulnerable sections of this community.

Sir, the other point that I want to raise is about the approach that is taken in high-profile cases which are deemed to tarnish the reputation of those connected with the Government. Well-known cases like that of Prageeth Eknaligoda, Wasim Thajudeen and Lasantha Wickrematunge are being delayed or being neglected because of the high-profile people who are involved in those cases. The recent acquittals by the special High Court has also brought the Government to disrepute and all of this contributes to people continuing to lose faith in the justice system.

I also want to spend a bit of time speaking on the State Ministry of Prison Management and Prisoners Rehabilitation, under which comes an issue that affects a very vulnerable section of our community. We know that, currently, there is a large number of unconvicted persons kept in remand, whose trials are yet to begin or ongoing or who have not received bail.

This number keeps changing, but as of 31st December, 2020, 90,362 persons had been in remand. Over 650 of those have been awaiting trail for over two years. Sir, I think you would agree that this is completely unacceptable. It would be really interesting for somebody to engage in a -

... ( ... - ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry - Minister of Justice) Hon. Member, that is not correct. That is not 90,000, but 19,000. Only 19,000 are in remand now. Earlier, it was 31,000 and we brought it down to 19,000.

( () () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya) Okay. If you say so, I will accept your figures. But, still, I think it is unacceptably a large number to be in remand and I also think it would be really interesting if we do an analysis of those because then, we would find that they are the ones who are unconnected to political power, who come from the lower socioeconomic classes and who are the marginalized and the vulnerable in our society. This speaks volumes, I think, about the state of justice in this country because it clearly shows that its only people with power and connections who are able to work with the justice system and that the rest of the citizenry basically have to face the music or undergo whatever that is meted out in the name of justice. Sir, if you think about why we have a prison system, the whole objective of prisons should be about prevention and rehabilitation. The number of prisoners increasing is not a good sign for the health of the society. Again, if you look at the numbers, a little less than half of those convicted prisoners are repeat offenders. What does this say? That means that our prison system is not really delivering on the objective of rehabilitation that is expected. As we know, our prisons are severely overcrowded and there are reports which say that some prisons are 400 per cent over capacity. Sri Lanka has been used internationally as a model to describe the problem of prison overcrowding in Third World nations, that we do not adhere to the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules regarding accommodation for inmates. In Sri Lanka, the problem of prison overcrowding is also exacerbated by gross inadequacy of essential basic facilities as well as insufficient staff. All of these issues - the delays in the judicial system, lack of sufficient resources and lack of appropriate training for prison staff - are connected, all of those factors contribute to the problem of delays and overcrowding and ultimately end up not really delivering what is expected from the justice system in this country.

The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka last, I think between 2018 and 2020, conducted an extensive research on the situation in prisons. They came up with many recommendations and it would be good to know where we are in terms of implementing some of those recommendations which came from within the Government itself. There have been many requests and many recommendations made about the need to improve the physical conditions and administration of prisons, to enhance the welfare of prisoners and reforms that are necessary for the criminal justice system.

One of those we can focus on is, adopting a different method when it comes to those who have been arrested for drug use. People who have been arrested for drug use

2539 2540

[ ( ) ]

2021 09

should not be treated in the same way as those who are arrested for criminal offences. These are also health issues which need to be dealt with differently. Do we have sufficient rehabilitation centres for treating people with drug abuse conditions? Then, young offenders should be kept in separate prisons and should not be kept in adult prison facilities. We know that still, it is ongoing, that when they are brought in for cases and held in remand, often young people are held with adult prisoners. There are many other suggestions that can be made for improving or reforming the prison system, which are long overdue and are simply having a cumulative effect on the prison system in this country and ultimately, not contribute in any way to reducing crimes in society at all.

Sir, I also want to speak a little bit about the working conditions of the staff in the prison system. There had been a Commission appointed, which had recommended reforms to wages of the prison officials. I think that Commission was called the Pillai Commission, but those recommendations have not yet been implemented. The prison officials have reported that they have to deal with severe mental health issues, for which they get no support or no service. We know these are highly stressful jobs and the quality of the prison system also rely on the well-being of the people working within the system. So, ensuring that they are well paid and their mental health needs and other needs are taken care of, are also important factors.

Also I just want to point out one other matter. According to the information I received, the prisoners are being used to produce bakery goods large scale, maybe, as a form of vocational training. Businesses then buy those products and make huge profits out of them because they basically use the prisoners pretty much free labour. There are well-connected businesses making enormous profits out of the labour of these prisoners. It is good to have prisoners engaged in productive work, but we must ensure that some selected companies do not profit out of the work or the labour of prisoners unnecessarily.

Finally, Sir, I want to point out one particular matter related to the Ministry of Youth Affairs. I think this country badly needs a national evaluation policy. We have had such an initiative in the past, but there has been no progress on that front. Even in Parliament, we are very concerned about financial auditing. But, the real audit comes with how this money has been spent and the impact of what has been spent. So, a national evaluation policy is an essential part of this whole process of oversight, and I urge you, Hon. Minister, to ensure that we have a national evaluation policy which can be quickly implemented.

Thank you, Sir, for the time given. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . 8 .

[3.04 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, when we talk in terms of the condition of justice in this country, we notice a convict of a massacre in Mirusuvil going through the entire judicial process of this country and having his conviction affirmed even by the highest court and then, the President going on to release him, to pardon him. I think that is a good indication of how much justice is valued in this country. Friends, cronies and murderers get pardoned. Sir, the pardon, as the Hon. Minister of Justice fully knows, is a provision that ought to be used by a President under conditions where the law has not caught up with the required standard or in a particular case, the prevalent law has led to inherent injustice, that at that time, the prescribed law was such that in future, the law was to be changed, but the convict, because of that injustice, ought to have been released. That is the reason why a pardon should be used, but not in Sri Lanka. In Sri Lanka, it is used to release murderers, robbers and convicts who are friends or who happen to belong to your ethnicity. That is what this provision is being used for.

You have a State Ministry for prison management and prisoners' rehabilitation. Prisoners are at the total custody of the State; they are totally at the mercy of the State. The fact that they are suspects or convicts is another matter. For them, there is a State Ministry created in this country, and the State Minister concerned goes into a prison and threatens prisoners so much so that the Presidents Media Division issued a statement stating that the State Minister concerned is resigning from those portfolios because he accepted the injustice he had committed. But, that same former State Minister, who continues to be a State Minister in this Government, has the audacity to come here today whilst the Votes of the Ministry of Justice is being discussed and sit next to the Minister of Justice! That is the state of justice in this country.

People whom you know, who everyone knows are guilty, are out, but the people against whom your own laws cannot be used to prove their guilt, the PTA prisoners, are languishing in prison. The Hon. Minister of

Justice knows fully well that if the PTA is reformed to the international standards, not a single convict or an individual remanded under the PTA will continue to be incarcerated; they all will be released. But, that is the state of justice in this country - where your own laws cannot convict people, they are inside, but criminals who should never be even in this House, are outside. That is what we are at.

Talking about prison reforms, since you are in charge of that subject, Hon. Minister, I wish to state that we have work camps. There are 10 work camps in the country, according to the Ministry report. There are two open work camps and correctional centres for youthful offenders, but none of these are in the North and the East, not one.

So, I think that is also something that you must address.

I happened to speak to some recently retired judges and ask them for advice to raise issues that they might consider relevant and here is what some of them had said. They are Tamil retired judges. Trincomalee has had one Magistrates Court and subsequently, became two. The second court that was opened is a Sinhala court; it functions in Sinhala. This is in the North-East and the reason given is, there are some Sinhalese within that area. Likewise, Kantale, which was a Tamil court within the North-East, now functions as a Sinhala court, where records and everything are kept in Sinhala. Again, the reason given is that there is a significant number of Sinhalese in Kantale. Through the colonization schemes over the years, now there is a significant number of Sinhalese in Kantale. In Colombo, almost half the cases are Tamil in nature; the parties to the cases are Tamil, but everything is done in Sinhala. It is a same case in Mount Lavinia, Nuwara Eliya, Avissawella, Hatton and in Walapane; the cases are almost entirely Tamil, Sir, but everything is done in Sinhala. Why these double standards? -[Interruption.] No, Hon. Minister, what I am trying to tell you is that you have created courts - I am not saying that you should not - in the North-East, an area where everything is supposed to be kept in Tamil, for the convenience of the Sinhalese people settled there because that is convenient. Then, why is not that same standard being applied in the South? No, it would not be applied because there is an agenda behind that. Even now, the courts in the Northern Province are being staffed systematically by Sinhalese. In courts of Vavuniya, there is a majority of Sinhala staff. The judge is a Tamil-speaking judge, but because the majority of the staff are Sinhalese, they are asking the judge also to write judgments in Sinhala, to keep notes in Sinhala. So, there is a certain system that is happening here. In the Ministry of Justice, there is injustice. If ever these things are going to be corrected, it is only by someone, an individual like you, certainly not by the State apparatus. So, you must address these concerns.

The Judicial Service Commission, I am told, sends all its circulars, even to the North-East, in Sinhala. This is ridiculous, Hon. Minister! So, these are matters that have to be looked into. These are clearly double standards that are taking place. So, you must address those.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, just give me one more minute to raise one other matter. The Hon. Namal Rajapaksa is here. I think he is the State Minister in charge of technology and the subject of National Identity Cards comes under him. The issuance of National Identity Cards is done when the Grama Sevaka insists that a person can be issued with one or he is prepared to recommend only if the name of that person appears in the Voters List. That is completely wrong, Hon. Minister. As you know, the Voters List, in fact, states that you must not use it to show residency. You can have several areas of residence. You do not need to have only one area of residence and if your name appears in the Voters List, that is not your official residence. You can have you residence in Colombo. I vote in Jaffna, but I also live in Colombo.

If I want to have my Identity Card issued in Colombo, the Grama Niladhari should be told that, in fact, I have a residence in Colombo and, therefore, I must be permitted to have my Identity Card in the place I want.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I am winding up, Sir.

So, that is another matter you must address, Hon. Minister. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Namal Rajapaksa) Hon. Member, we will look into it. Anyway, we will be introducing the new digital Identity Card in the first quarter of next year. I think the problem at the moment is that the entire system is operated manually. So, documentation is a bit difficult. That may be why certain AGAs or Grama Niladharis are using this method, to make it more simple. However, definitely we will look into it and once we introduce the new digital Identity Card in the first quarter of next year, we will be able to get everything in order. Then, I am sure, the complications raised by the Hon. Member will be taken up.

Thank you. ( () ) (The Hon. (Major) Sudarshana Denipitiya) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, can you ask that Hon. Member to be specific with regard to where I said things that were racist in nature or anything of that sort? He must act responsibly. If he cannot understand English, he must go and - [Interruption.] Then, you cannot make that allegation against me. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Namal Rajapaksa) Hon. Member, regarding those prisoners, as you know, the Government is committed to provide necessary assistance to make sure that they are released. But, you must also understand that there is a procedure and we have to follow that legal procedure in doing so. So, the Hon. Minister of Justice is working on it and at the first instance we could do it, we will, as we have done in the past. We are not making this as a political statement because it is not a political promise by us. As you know, your political party never helped us and you will never help us. But, we believe that as citizens of this country and as the Government, we have a responsibility and we will fulfil it.

We are also open for negotiations with any IT sector company to come and invest in Sri Lanka. The BOI will look at it in a very positive way. In fact, the Minister of Finance is personally encouraging the IT sector to be expanded in this country. We are looking forward to make it a ten-billion-dollar industry within the next couple of years. Thank you.

:

" 'It is settled in our constitutional law that in matters which concern the public at large the Attorney-General is the guardian of the public interest. Although he is a member of the government of the day, it is his duty to represent the public interest with complete objectivity and detachment. He must act independently of any external pressure from whatever quarter it may come. As the guardian of the public interest, the Attorney-General has a special duty in regard to the enforcement of the law.'

Although there may be some differences in the two roles, these observations aptly apply to the role of the Attorney-General of Sri Lanka."

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner in his written submissions intimates that the reports of former Attorneys-General who took decisions to indict the 2nd Respondent have not been made available for the perusal of this Court. To our mind, the Attorney-General who was holding office during the time such decision to prosecute the 2nd Respondent has been taken, undoubtedly could take cognizance of whatever recommendations available to him in favour of his final decision. In view of the submissions made by the learned ASG, it is apparent that the present Attorney-General in making the impugned decision, has considered the representations made to him by the 2nd Respondent as well as the matters referred to by the 2nd Respondent in the application No. CA/Writ/77/2020 along with the well-considered recommendations made in the aforesaid reports of the Additional Solicitor General.
