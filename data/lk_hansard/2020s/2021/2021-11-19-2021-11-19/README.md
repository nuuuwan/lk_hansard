. If you look at the history of the apparel industry in this country, a strategic decision was taken by our companies to concentrate on niche products like lingerie, swimwear and sportswear for niche markets. Our large companies like Brandix, MAS Holdings and Omega Line became not just regional leaders, Sir, but world leaders. They were producing certain commodities for niche markets. But, after COVID - 19, the demand

dropped for those kinds of goods. But, those companies had the resilience, the flexibility to shift to other kinds of commodities they produced. For personal protection equipment, gloves, facemasks, they had huge orders from the National Health Service in the United Kingdom. They had massive orders for personal protection equipment. The large companies could not cope with these orders. So, they farmed them out to smaller apparel companies. The result was that the production lines could be kept open. There was no retrenchment. That was a major achievement, and the dynamism and the creativity of our private sector played a major role in that.

. That, I would say, Sir, is the cornerstone of Sri Lankas Foreign Policy under this Government. There is no exclusivity in our foreign relations. We do not do business or have cordial relations with one country only and we continue to believe in the vitality and the justification for the Non-aligned Movement. , " " . " , , " . . It is true that Non-aligned Movement evolved in a different context, in the context of a bipolar world. That geopolitical context has now

881 882

changed. But, it is my firm conviction that the Non-Aligned Movement is based upon a rationale which has immediate relevance to the contemporary world.

, , what is the right approach . It must be based on morality and convictions, not on expediency, cynicism and opportunism. , . . . . . . , . , , , . - .- . . . . , " " . , " . . , " . . , . Connectivity with India is of the utmost importance in the context of Sri Lankan Foreign Policy. Social connectivity, grid connectivity, all that is important.

There should be a political will for reform. Numbers and statistics, we can present and represent. But, where is the political will for us to reform? Where is the political will to say what is wrong is wrong and to correct ourselves? I see there is a light, a distant light in this Budget, particularly regarding appointment and restructuring of State-owned organizations that are incurring billions, if not trillions of rupees in losses.

Whereupon THE HON. MADHURA WITHANAGE left the Chair, and THE HON. (DR.) (MS.) HARINI AMARASURIYA took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please commence your speech.

[3.16 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, I must say that I am quite privileged to speak when you, one of the most honourable Members and also one who consistently and intellectually delivers to the Debates of this House, are in the Chair. So, in that way, I am quite privileged to speak now.

Last year, when the Gotabaya Rajapaksa Government presented its first Budget, I made it a point to state that the country cannot look upon the North-East as the same as the rest and the most important instrument that must reflect that difference is the Budget. I said that one year ago, Madam, because the North-East has been a region that had been affected by war; it had been completely destroyed and the economies of the people there lag behind some 35 years, not only with regard to genuine capital, but also with regard to capacity. So, just because the war is over, to essentially treat that part of the country in an equal footing with the rest is to perpetuate their disadvantage because you have already created a situation where they are in a rut and without recognizing the fact that they are in that rut, you are trying to treat them that way. Therefore, first, in some way, protect whatever that they have and then come up with some sort of policy that can strengthen their economies so that at some point during the course of the incumbent Governments term, they can reach a stage where they can thereafter try to compete with the rest of the country. If you do not adopt such an approach, but rather continue to simply forget the fact that they are 35 years lagging behind and treat them on an equal footing with the rest of the country, you

would be perpetuating their pauperization and disadvantage. By creating a situation, like what you are doing now, where you build infrastructure facilities like roads and various other facilities in the North-East, you are only creating a situation where people from outside the North-East can quite simply come to that area and take over the economy.

I am not a person who essentially takes after protectionism, but in a situation where peoples are not equal, in a situation where regions are not equal, you have to resort to such protectionism if you are to protect those vulnerable people. The previous Budget failed to do that; this Budget goes even further in failing to do that. The justification, if at all, that this Government can give is that the rest of the country has also been suffering because of the COVID pandemic and the whole countrys economy is in a bad footing. But, you cannot compare the negativities of the rest of the country with that of the North-East. The situation in the North-East is ten times worse, at least ten times worse, because of the COVID situation. But this Government does not care; not one utterance from the Government Benches has tried to, in some way, address those concerns.

Hon. Presiding Member, you know that the North-East stands on three pillars economically: fishing, farming and to some extent, trade.

But, fishing continues to be an area where the Government systematically destroys livelihoods. The Navy works in a way where it protects illegal fishermen coming into the North and the East from other areas and using banned methods of fishing and in the process, destroying the fishing nets and the various other assets of the local fishermen. Not only that, you also have the Navy deliberately allowing foreign fishermen, fishermen belonging to India, to come to the northern waters and once again use illegal fishing means and in the process, destroying all the assets. We, my Colleague, the Hon. Selvarajah Kajendren and myself and many other Hon. Members of Parliament belonging to the North and the East, have repeatedly brought this matter up, but the Government takes no action. During the 34 to 35 years of war, you had a ban on fishing and now, once the war is over, those fishermen, who are still fishing only with techniques 35 years old, are asked to compete with the rest of fishermen who come into their own area, use illegal means - those illegal means maybe lucrative - and destroy their assets in the process. What is this? What is the outcome? Those people cannot continue to survive.

Farming has the same story. Hundreds of acres of lands, because the owners of which were chased off due to military activities, have turned into forests. Now, the Forest Department comes and declares private land, permit land - hundreds of acres! - that were used by those people as forest areas. When we bring it up to the notice of the Minister, the Minister is not bothered. On the contrary, if there is a reallocation of those State lands through permits, they are given to border villagers, members who belong to other districts other than the North and the East. Why? To systematically try and change the demography of the North and the East. This is

959 960

2021 19

what is happening. But, when we tell these truths, the Members opposite - even the Members on this side when they were on the opposite side last time did the same, turn around and say that we are racists, that we are communal-minded or that we do not want Sinhalese to come and be a part of the North and the East. No, that is not the reason. You cannot pauperize the people of the North and the East to the benefit of people outside so that they can come and take over the entire area. But, that is what is happening. If that is happening despite the fact that we repeatedly bring it to the notice of this House and nothing happens and, in fact, things are exacerbated the wrong way, then it can only mean that it is another arm of the racist agenda that plagues this House.

Hon. Presiding Member, we talk in terms of a unitary State. I was listening very patiently to the Hon. Dullas Alahapperuma. I was impressed by his honesty. He was honest in the sense that he said every consecutive Government, after, maybe, the first ten years since Independence, must take the blame for the appalling situation to which this country has fallen. That is true. This country began to fall not because of COVID-19, but because whichever Government that came into power ten years after Independence chose to look upon another population that inhabits this country as an enemy and because you chose to deliberately pursue policies, first and foremost, to destroy that perceived enemy so that they can claim no part of this Island, cannot say that the North and the East is their homeland and that it can only be the Sinhalese who can call this entire Island their homeland.

That was the policy that was pursued, which resulted in creating enemies within the State and eventually, the State itself had to spend vast amounts of its money in trying to pursue a military option in order to continue to pursue that idea of this being purely a Sinhala Buddhist country. Well, you succeeded in the sense that you made sure that the war was brought to an end. But, you had 12 years since the war came to an end. What are your achievements? There is no LTTE now for you to blame. Have you achieved anything in the last 12 years? First, there was the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government for five or six years and thereafter, the Ranil Wickremasinghe-Maithreepala Sirisena Government. But, what have you achieved? Every year, you went down! The following year was worse than the previous and now, you have the COVID-19 pandemic, where you have taken a nosedive, you are scraping the barrel.

Even now, you would rather not reconsider your past. We say that Sri Lanka has to change, take a new path. Seventy four years of this unitary State has been a disaster; you have systematically plummeted the country to ground zero. So, rethink! You have nothing to lose because you have hit rock bottom. Rethink, make every part of this Island plurinational where everyone can contribute. Rethink so that the Tamil nation can ask its diaspora to contribute, to invest. But, no, you would rather not do that. You would rather cling to this notion of a unitary State, that Sri Lanka only belongs to the Sinhala Buddhists and go down the path of not only destroying

the Tamils - now, you have started that against the Muslims also - but also that selfishness destroying your own soul. In committing the most heinous crimes known to mankind, fighting the war and winning the war against the Tamils, you became indebted to countries. Now, what is happening? To pay that debt, you are selling off your country to those countries. In the process, you have created a geopolitical contestation. Now, you cannot sell off only to one particular global power, but spread it out and sell it to quite a few others. Are you not ashamed? Honestly, are you not ashamed? Touch your heart and say whether you actually think that your children have a future in this country. I can assure you, Hon. Presiding Member, that every member of this country, if given a choice, would rather have their children go abroad and get educated. Are you not ashamed? After 74 years, this is what you have to show. Well, you have hit rock bottom, but sadly, you can even hit a lower bottom. If you go down the path that you have been going, you are going to sink even further and sink to such a point that your own ideal Sinhala Buddhist nation will decamp, and they are decamping. Listening to the speeches made in the House on this Budget, I think quite a few Hon. Members, both from the Government as well as from the Opposition, were saying how so many citizens are lining up to get passports to go abroad. They all are not Tamils, the vast majority of them are Sinhalese. So, rethink, put an end to the 74 years of stupidity that has brought this country to this stage. You want a unitary State and you are not prepared to consider this as a plurinational federal State because you think that federalism reaches to separation. For 74 years, you clung on to the unitary State and created a separatist war that came up under your unitary State.

There was a de facto State when you were claiming it to be a unitary State. The State structure, whether it be unitary or federal, is not going to be the determining factor of whether there is a separate State or not. That decision is going to be made only by making sure that you convince, in some way, all the peoples of this country to say that this is, in fact, their country. By failing to do that and simply saying that this State is Sinhala Buddhist, you will make sure, no matter whether you have it as a unitary State till perpetuity, that your State will never be stable, that its legitimacy will constantly be called into question and one day, when the geopolitical realities create a situation where strong global powers feel that Sri Lanka need not be looked upon as one unit, that is when separation will take place.

So, you, as the 75 per cent of the population of the country, decide whether you want to go down the path of 74 years of mayhem, hell and disaster, where even 12 years after the end of the war, you are still scraping the barrel year after year, creating not new heights but new depths, I should say, or whether you want to start anew and genuinely put this country on a newer footing where all its members can contribute to the upliftment of the country as a whole.

Thank you.
