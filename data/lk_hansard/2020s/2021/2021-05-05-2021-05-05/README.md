( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the Hon. Rishad Bathiudeen, who is also a leader of a political party, has not been brought to Parliament. We raised this issue at the Committee on Parliamentary Business also and I want to reiterate the fact that it is incumbent upon your good self to protect the rights of Members of Parliament irrespective of their political thinking, ideology and public policies. So, let me once again request you to use your good offices to protect the Hon. Rishad Bathiudeens rights as a Parliamentarian, and he should be brought to this august Assembly. Sir, I would very humbly request you to do so.

In addition to that fact, I would also like to raise another matter, if you permit me, since His Excellency the President is also here. Would you allow me to do that, Sir?

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, go ahead.

Sir, for the first time ever, an Hon. Minister has stated to this House that someone who is detained by an administrative detention order cannot be brought to Parliament. This has never happened in the history of this House. Before a person is, at least, judicially pronounced to be a convict, he never loses his Seat in Parliament. If

what the Hon. Minister says is the rule, then for three months, somebody can be administratively detained on suspicion and lose his Parliamentary Seat. That cannot be the rule. The Hon. Prime Minister and His Excellency the President, I think, are nodding in agreement with me. I wish that they speak up and clarify it. Otherwise, a wholly unprecedented thing will happen, where any political opponent could be arrested and administratively detained even without being found guilty judicially and lose his Parliamentary Seat.

[11.03 a.m.] . . ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Speaker, for this opportunity to speak on this Adjournment Debate, particularly after the Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera who invited the Opposition to point out the shortcomings, mistakes of the Government saying that all of that is welcome. So, in that spirit, I wish to point out certain matters where the Government has failed. But without stopping at that, I would also urge the Government to take some corrective measures and in the course of my speech, hopefully, make some constructive suggestions as well.

Primarily, this pandemic has been with us for almost one and a half years. Very early in the day, in January, 2020, I remember the Hon. Leader of the Opposition raising this matter in Parliament and asking the question as to why the Airport had not been closed. He raised it yet again on the 05th of February last year, I believe, and there was no proper reply at that stage from the Government. The Government was keen to dissolve Parliament and at the very first opportunity, it dissolved Parliament. Parliament which should have been in session and taken measures to combat, to meet with this national challenge, was dissolved for political expediency and thereafter, when we, all the parties in the Opposition, called that Parliament must be reconvened, the Government refused to head that. We gave several reasons why Parliament had to meet.

At that time, those who were being infected were in the single digits. Today, we have actually gone to a point where the Government seems to have lost control. It is a sad situation that when the health professionals and others who are battling this virus are taking enormous risk and are in the frontlines, the decision-making processes of the Government seem to have put even their lives at peril. There is no proper decision-making process and that is why we said more than a year ago that there needs to be a specific law to deal with this situation. Countries the world over immediately passed laws: COVID-19 Act or the Coronavirus Act in Italy, the UK, India and in Singapore. There are several examples. They immediately passed laws to enable a proper legal regime to deal with the situation. I am mentioning this aspect very particularly because we can exchange views in an Adjournment Debate, but over and above that, Parliament has a specific duty as one of the arms of the Government. It is this House and this House alone that makes laws, makes legislation.

We have with us two pieces of legislation: one is more than 100 years old and the other is over 150 years old and not fit to meet with the situation that the country is facing or the world is facing today. Sir, I heard the Hon. Minister of Justice stating the other day in this House that the Government will introduce a new Act to deal with this situation. But where is that Act? There does not seem to be any urgency in doing what this House ought to do. There are other Bills like the Colombo Port City Economic Commission Bill being brought post-haste. But, something that this House should have done in emergency session, having been reconvened even after dissolution, has not been done even to date.

Sir, I have presented a Private Members Bill; I tendered it last year. It was lying at the Hon. Attorney-Generals Department for several months and on the 23rd of April, 2021, it was presented to this House and the First Reading is over. One week has lapsed and no one has challenged that Bill. Now, it can be taken up. I have been informed by Parliament that the Bill has been referred to the Ministry of Health as per the Standing Orders and a letter has been sent to me entirely in the Sinhala language. That is another issue. How many times do we have to raise that a Tamil Member of Parliament is being sent letters in Sinhala? I am told that even circulars et cetera for employees of Parliament are issued only in Sinhala. At least in Parliament, can we give effect to the constitutional provision that there are two Official Languages in this country? Why do you continue to observe this in the breach? That is one matter. So, I have got that letter read to me and it apparently states that the Bill has been referred to the Ministry of Health. That is a good thing. But, I would urge the Ministry of Health and the others to have a look at it. This is only a suggestion. The Government should do it. But, it is upon the Governments failure to bring a law that meets with this situation that I have presented that Private Members Bill.

Sir, the Human Rights Commission, in a letter dated 08th June, 2020, wrote to the Secretary to the President, informing the President that the laws that we have now are not sufficient to meet with this situation. It is a fairly long letter written after considering all the laws in extent

189 190

and they have said that none of these meet with the present situation. Particularly to restrain people from their right of freedom of movement, there is no law.

Under the Quarantine and Prevention of Diseases Act, you cannot stop people from moving; you can only declare certain areas to be quarantined areas. Now, it is almost a year since the Human Rights Commission wrote officially and told the Government about the lacuna in the law. Still, no action has been taken. I am not saying that the Private Members Bill that I have commended to Parliament is a perfect draft; that is only a suggestion. But, at least, when someone has presented something like that, why do you not consider it? Today, in our country, Sri Lanka, the Public Security Ordinance is designed to deal only with public security and maintenance of public order, not to deal with large-scale health emergencies like this.

The Quarantine and Prevention of Diseases Ordinance enacted in 1897 is archaic. I do not like to say that. The scale of emergency should not be managed merely by Regulations under that Ordinance; there must be laws. Particularly because now we have a Constitution and there are Fundamental Rights enshrined in the Constitution, freedom of movement can only be restricted by a law that is enacted by Parliament, not by regulations. Article 15 (7) of the Constitution specifically lays that down and there are several judgments which say that you cannot do it. The Emergency Regulations are an exception. You can do it by Emergency Regulations, but not by any other regulation. So, Regulations made under the Quarantine and Prevention of Diseases Ordinance will not suffice. We have encouraged the people to abide by those Regulations. We are not telling the people to violate them because it is necessary in the interest of public health to abide by those, but they must also be lawful.

I can understand that in the first few months of this pandemic, we did not have a law. But, it is no excuse to say that one-and-a-half years after the pandemic broke out that we still do not have a law. And a Private Members' Bill has to be presented to Parliament from the Opposition ranks and still, the Government is not taking any action. Then, the Disaster Management Act is there. We could have at least used that.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member, your nine minutes time is going to be over.

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I have 15 minutes, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Only nine minutes have been mentioned here. It has been reduced due to the time constraints.

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I will conclude soon, Sir.

Even the definition of "disaster" will not refer to the issue that we are facing today. So, I urge the Government that without trading allegations - I have already said that it is the Governments mismanagement of this issue that we are facing a third wave and even the vaccines were mismanaged - it is important to bring a lockdown for the whole country to manage the third wave of this pandemic. Ministers should not be allowed to interfere in those decisions like the Hon. Gamini Lokuge did. So, all that has to be done. The Government must take those actions, but must also do it lawfully.

Even private hospitals must be permitted to treat COVID patients. I know that the Hon. (Dr.) (Mrs.) Sudarshini Fernandopulle said that ayurvedic institutions can treat COVID-19 patients. If ayurvedic institutions can treat COVID-19 patients, why cannot the private hospitals also be allowed to do that? So, even at this point in time, I urge the Government to take proper and responsible steps and also this House to make laws that are necessary in the interest of the public health situation that we are facing.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) The next speaker is the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera. You have 14 minutes.

At the COVID Committee meeting held on 21st April, 2021, the clinicians reported to the SLMA their observations of the rapidly increasing number of COVID-19 positive cases, numbers requiring hospital admissions, oxygen and increasing needs of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) management in their clinical settings and the increasing number of positive reports at the lab settings. Further, it was also highlighted that the already allocated ICU beds for COVID-19 patients are all occupied at present."

So, there is a serious situation developing. ,, , ? . , .

, . - the Association of Medical Specialists - , , .The press release issued by them on 29th April, 2021 states, I quote:

"At this moment, we don't see any pragmatic strategy in place to face eventualities. Unfortunately, we seem to have failed to learn lessons from our neighbor India to avert such crisis. We wish to stress that we have already reached alarming figures if the number of cases per thousand people are calculated."

So, this is a serious problem. If we really look at the number of positive cases per thousand people, we are in a worse situation than India. That is what the Association of Medical Specialists is saying. It further states, I quote: "For this, we need to utilize the services of relevant experts in these fields to design and implement the best national plan and it should

239 240

be kept strictly apolitical. If such action is not taken in this crucial juncture, we will be another nation who has 'planned to fail' as we have 'failed to plan'. "

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, what is the point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Sir, I just want to make a clarification. This is my 27th year in Parliament. As far as I know, during an Adjournment Debate, a speaker can speak only once. Today, you allowed a speaker who spoke yesterday to speak again under the same Adjournment Debate. Is it the new procedure adopted here or what happened?

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) I will refer it to the Secretary-General of Parliament.

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Because as far as I know, during an Adjournment Debate, a speaker can speak only once, not twice. Yesterday, that speaker spoke and today, just before the Hon. Kabir Hashim spoke, you allowed the same speaker to speak again.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) No, that was a Privilege issue. I think because the Hon. Member was not available, -

249 250

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) But, a Privilege issue has a different procedure. You cannot just get up like a jack-in-the-box and raise a Privilege issue.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) It was a personal explanation and the Secretary-General says that it can be done.

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) As far as I know, it has never happened. That happened yesterday. Does that mean that after three weeks, you can just get up like a jack-in-the-box and raise that? No, there is a way of raising Privilege issues. So, it is very bad.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. Jayantha Samaraweera. You have nine minutes.

Before he starts, will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam to the Chair?

. ( ) ( . - , ) (The Hon. S. Viyalanderan - State Minister of Backward Rural Areas Development and Promotion of Domestic Animal Husbandry and Minor Economic Crop Cultivation) Sir, I propose that the Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam do now take the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) . . Seconded. . . Question put, and agreed to. .

Whereupon THE HON. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and THE HON. SHANAKIYAN RAJAPUTHIRAN RASAMANICKAM took the Chair.

If you go through the Guidelines of the WHO, you would see that they do not allow it to the private sector and that it has to be handled totally by the Government. So, you are wrong in that.
