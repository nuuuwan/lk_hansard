Motor traffic traffic lights . , accident , .

. When we are on the road, we cannot ignore the traffic lights. Sri Lanka is confronted with a red light, particularly on investment at the moment.

Yesterdays Vote at the United Nations Human Rights Council, to which even the Chief Opposition Whip, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, referred a little while ago, is actually a red light. It is a red light of failed diplomacy, failed foreign relations. The Government is stumbling from one crisis to another; from poor economic management, poor management of COVID-19 to disastrous management of diplomatic relations.

The Vote on the Resolution on Sri Lanka showed how many friends we have retained. I was really amused to see somebody computing the population of the countries which voted for us, saying that it is not the country that matters, but its population. So, it means that if only China votes, that really matters. I mean, how ridiculous can it be? If you go by the percentage of population and if you go and vote at the United Nations, Sri Lanka would not even be counted. Now, we are counted as one vote out of 200 member countries of the United Nations. . . , . 220. . 200 . , . The present Resolution is heavily weighted not towards what had happened in the past in relation to the war, but what has happened since President Gotabaya Rajapaksa took office. It is largely about those issues that the present Resolution talks about.

The Government has compounded its policy failures - I want to make this point - by appointing the wrong persons for defined tasks. That is the issue. Even in the fight against COVID-19, you should have put health experts and scientists to combat the virus. You did not do that. Even in combatting the problems with regard to

557 558

Foreign Policy, you should place foreign policy experts including professional diplomats at the forefront of this battle, around the world, to actually handle Sri Lankas case overseas. So, we have a problem here, how it was actually handled.

Therefore, I would say an urgent fresh appraisal is needed to minimize the negative economic consequences of this Resolution. If we do not move quickly and look at this, there will be consequences. We do not want to fight in foreign jurisdictions; we do not want to handle travel bans and we do not want to handle economic and trade embargoes. The economic consequences will be catastrophic and we do not want to get there as a country. Therefore, a fresh approach is needed on the implementation of the human rights initiatives as identified in the Sri Lankan Commission Reports, not in foreign reports. We have had the LLRC Report and also the Paranagama Commission Report. We need to look at those Reports where investigations and accountability are dealt with domestic mechanisms, not with foreign mechanisms, but those need to address the concerns of the International Community.

Arriving at the truth is an essential part of the healing and reconciliation process. This should be coupled with a fresh diplomatic initiative which could avert a further economic and financial crisis within the next two years. We, in the Opposition, will support the Government if it initiates a progressive, fresh initiative in the interest of all Sri Lankans.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, I believe you have started your speech.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Yes. The Hon. Chief Government Whip said that I can have my nine minutes. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) No, no! You have to start the speech now. - [Interruption.]

577 578

[4.09 p.m.]

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I am just saying that the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella actually increased the time. - [Interruption.]

Sir, let me start by saying this. I have been seated here for the last one and a half hours. Almost every speaker from the Government Benches got up and started their speeches by referring to certain comments made by the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran, the spokesman of the TNA, where he had congratulated or had welcomed the 21 odd countries that had supported the recent Resolution in the UN Human Rights Council. They went on to criticize him severely and, in fact, called him a "traitor" to Sri Lanka and condemned him for welcoming that support for the Resolution. Sir, whilst I am not a great fan of the Hon. Sumanthiran - I am, in fact, very critical of him - I think the criticism of him as being a "traitor" to Sri Lanka is preposterous! It is preposterous! The extent to which the Government Members have to go to try and in some way discredit the Resolution in order to justify their own survival, I think, is indicative of how weak the Governments arguments are with regard to the substance of that Resolution.

Let me tell you, I am a Tamil Member of Parliament from the Tamil National Peoples Front and we are very critical of that Resolution. We say that it is so weak, it is so weak that the TNA has called for the support of a Resolution that is not going to result in any accountability for the heinous crimes such as genocide that we say were committed and in justification of that, let me just read out to you the Operative Paragraph 9 of that Resolution. I mean this is common sense. The Operative Paragraph 9 of that Resolution states, I quote:

Calls upon the Government of Sri Lanka to ensure the prompt, thorough and impartial investigation and, if warranted, prosecution of all alleged crimes relating to human rights violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law, including for longstanding emblematic cases;

It is calling upon this Government to, on its own accord, take action to bring to book those who had committed crimes. So, how on earth can you say that this Resolution is against the Government? Our complaint, Sir, is when the Government itself is a party to the conflict, when the Government is an accused party, to expect that accused party to carry out an investigation is against natural justice. The UN Human Rights Council Resolution 30/1 which was passed in 2015, in fact, was also calling for an internal investigation, but, at least for tokenism's sake, it called for foreign judges, lawyers and investigators to be involved in that process. This Resolution 46/1 does not even have that element of foreign involvement. It gives the Government the entire onus to carry out an investigation. Your Foreign Minister went to the UN Human Rights Council as soon as this Government took office and, in fact, told the UN Human Rights Council that they would be withdrawing from co-sponsoring earlier Resolutions because they would carry out their own investigation. That is what this Resolution calls for.

So, our criticism is that the TNA has, in fact, by supporting a Resolution asking the Government itself to investigate into those crimes, gone against natural justice and has betrayed the victims of the heinous crimes that they claim to represent. So, how on earth can Government Members stand up and accuse the TNA of treachery?

Sir, the truth here is that this Government is pro-Chinese. It is tilting to China to such an extent that countries like the West and India will seek leverage in order to put pressure on this Government. That is what this Resolution is about. It has nothing to do with accountability and that is our criticism.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. Your time is up.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Therefore, if you do not get your Foreign Policy right and for as long as you keep messing up with your Foreign Policy, you will be pressured in this way. But, the sad reality is that the victims, who are Tamils predominantly, are caught in this geopolitical struggle and as victims, we continue to be victims. That is the tragedy, Hon Presiding Member.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . 6 . 8 2 .

Though the voices come from the North, they are our own people. Forget the politicians. We may talk about our own agendas, but when we go to ground level, we would find worshipers who have been going to those sites throughout, maybe for the last 50 or 100 years, to worship. Interpretations are different, but they are crying, saying that the takeover of these sites hurts them deeply and that it breaks any possible path they would build with the Sinhalese society.

First of all, I would like to thank the Hon. S. Shritharan for moving this Adjournment Motion today regarding archaeological sites and remains in the North and the East.

As we all know, yesterday a UNHRC Resolution was passed against Sri Lanka and I would like to thank the core group of countries which brought the Resolution, the non-voting countries and even the countries which abstained from voting for it because the Government of Sri Lanka uses matters like this, which has been raised through today's Motion, to violate the basic human rights of people living in Sri Lanka. The appointment of the Presidential Task Force to Protect Archaeological Sites is a very good, clear indication of how the Government of Sri Lanka violates human rights of Tamil-speaking people in this country. I think the Government of Sri Lanka could take a lesson from what happened yesterday at the UNHRC and maybe, start by disbanding that Presidential Task Force which is purely used just for gaining political mileage in the South.
