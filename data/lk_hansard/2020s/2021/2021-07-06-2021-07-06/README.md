I want to tell the Hon.

Now, just because they want to sling some mud, which is their normal practice, they are doing it. - [Interruption.] So, I want to just tell the Hon. Member that we held him in esteem; we thought he is a banker and that he has certain norms which he used to follow. But, I am afraid that now, I cannot think of you the same way when you ask this kind of questions, Hon. Member. So, I would ask you, if you like, to raise it separately as a Question and we will give you a complete answer.

, , ( ) . . Hon. Deputy Speaker, for a considerable period of time, it has been acknowledged that the fines pertaining to the violation of the provisions in certain Acts and Ordinances are totally inadequate to deter such violation. Therefore, one of my predecessors, in fact, had appointed a committee in the past to study it. So, it is appropriate to make recommendations to increase the fines imposed on penalties in certain Acts and Ordinances.

Sir, what is important is, Article 11 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka provides that No person shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Act No. 22 of 1994 was enacted by Parliament, by this House, to give effect to the

Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which is an international Treaty. Sri Lanka follows zero tolerance in respect of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Therefore, increasing the fines provided for offences under the Act to a realistic level would ensure Sri Lanka's commitment against torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and would also be a guarantee for basic human rights. It is important that we understand that 99 per cent or more than that of the law enforcement authorities including the officers of the police and others are doing a great job. They respect the rule of law and human dignity. But, there are a few elements which have created a very bad image for the country and a very bad name for us, as a result of which we have been asked to respond to all these things at various international and local fora.

Everyone's life matters; everyone's dignity matters; everyone should be treated equally, and therefore, it is important that no one should be allowed to treat any other human being, as a citizen of this country or otherwise, in a degrading manner. So, in order to deter that practice, we are proposing to increase the fine from Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 200,000 so that it would work as a deterrent to people who are willing or attempting to violate the law and act against the Constitution of this country.

Then, Sir, there is another important Order I want to present today.

Hon. Presiding Member, it is important to mention that there were a number of decisions taken by us during the last few months in order to activate the reconciliation process and to speed it up. In order to do so, we need to empower various institutions and several bodies. There are three main institutions. One is, ONUR - the Officer for National Unity and Reconciliation. We have empowered that institution though it was brought about by the previous Government. Contrary to their expectations - they thought that we would do away with it - we have empowered it. We will continue to empower it so that we can build national unity and reconciliation.

The second institution is the Office for Reparations. As we all know, it is an institution which succeeded the entity called REPPIA. The REPPIA was established after the 1983 riots to pay compensations for the people who were affected by it. So, the Office for Reparations continues to perform a great service in that regard and has been paying certain amounts to the affected. Not only that, they continue to pay financial reperations and we have empowered them. We have retained the same office-bearers who have been there until their period is over. They are doing a good job. We want to continue with that so that whoever who have been affected by various conflicts in various parts of the country would immediately be paid their reparations and whatever dues they ought to be paid.

In a similar way, the Government and the Cabinet of Ministers took a policy decision that the Office on Missing Persons should also be strengthened and empowered to do their job because we cannot allow people to go on missing forever. We understand that there are parties who are interested in naming and shaming our country, coming out with totally fabricated or fake figures to say that thousands of Sri Lankans - different numbers like 20,000 or 30,000 are being given - have gone missing. So, what we are interested in is to show how many people have actually gone missing from 2009, to trace them, to reduce their numbers and to bring a finality to that. If somebody had actually gone missing, then we have to issue a death certificate for him or recommend his family to be paid compensation. We have to come out with a realistic number. Accordingly, it is important that we empower these institutions.

It is in line with that that we have appointed a new team of office-bearers to man the Office on Missing Persons. The Chairman of that Office resigned and the other office-bearers concluded their term. Thereafter, a new team of office-bearers has been appointed. In terms of the Act, their remunerations, facilities and benefits should be approved by Parliament. We have produced those to the Judicial Oversight Committee and they have gone through and approved those. I will be producing those to the House, bringing those on par with the payments made to the Members of the Office for Reparations.

I invite all the Members of this august Assembly to also look at the Bills taken up today - the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill and the Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Amendment) Bill - and give their concurrence to get them passed along with the Order under the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act and the Revision of Salaries and Allowances accorded to the Members of the Office on Missing Persons. We are in the process of rolling out several amendments and implementing a reform process to strengthen several institutions coming under the justice sector. So, all these are part of that process.

May I know how many minutes more I have, Hon. Presiding Member?

Before he nominates a Bench, at least he must mention it and then see to it that this sort of thing does not happen in a habitual fashion. Now, four Judges of the Supreme Court have recused themselves from the case relating to the Hon. Rishad Bathiudeen. The Hon. Bathiudeen has been under detention for 73 days. His FR case has been postponed on several occasions on this basis alone. So, it is a serious injustice to him. Therefore, the Hon. Chief Justice must be made aware that before nominating a Bench, at least he must find out whether there is any reason for the said judges to recuse themselves from the case. This should not happen because it is unnecessarily creating suspicions. As you said, none of us are alleging that there was some interference, but there is an assumption arising out of it. Because of the nature of the case, since he is a senior politician, this has to be avoided. Therefore, the Chief Justice had better be advised, at least before nominating judges, to make sure that they would not recuse themselves in this fashion, one after the other continuously, finally resulting in serious injustice to the detainee.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, would you like to reply? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) Hon. Member, I also read about that only in the newspapers. I can only convey the concerns expressed by this House. Other than that, I have no power to interfere with it and give directions. But, certainly, there is a concern, I agree with you.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. You have 18 minutes.

[1.33 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for the opportunity to speak a few words at this very important Debate when the Hon. Minister of Justice has presented to the House Bills to amend the Code of Criminal Procedure Act and the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment Act, a certain Order and another Motion for approval. I must thank the Hon. Minister for remaining in the House after presenting these Bills and listening to the various comments that are being made on those. The Bills that have been placed before the House are very, very important and serious in nature. We welcome what we see in both the Amendment Bills and one Bill seeks to make it obligatory on magistrates to visit police stations. If I heard the Hon. Minister right, it is not just the police stations, but also other detention centres that they should visit to examine and see whether the detainees are properly treated, particularly with a view to ensuring that there is no torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment meted out to them.

So, on paper, it is a good move. But, one wonders why this window dressing is being made now. Any of us, who are aware of the actual situation with regard to torture in this country, would wonder why this Amendment is being placed today. So much for shouting from the rooftops that we are protecting our sovereignty, we are not bowing down to international pressure and all of that, but all of these facades are being built and I do not know who you are trying to fool. The Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment Act was passed in 1994 and we have various researches that had been made with regard to the efficacy of this Act. Twenty Six years of this Act has seen just nine convictions, six of which are under appeal. A very

recent research publication by the Law & Society Trust states that there were only 47 prosecutions, less than 0.1 per cent of the complaints that had been made. One knows that even the complaints are only about 10 to 20 per cent of the actual happenings. For various fears - fears of reprisals, of further mistreatment, of family members being put in jeopardy and all of those - only about 10 to 20 per cent actually make the complaints and I just worked out the figures.

This Act, in operation, has been a dismal failure. A very generous calculation will show that only 0.06 per cent of the complaints result in any conviction. How is that to be compared with Article 11 of the Constitution? Articles 10 and 11 of the Constitution are two provisions that cannot be abridged, that cannot be restricted, not by law, not by anything. But, we have a situation in this country where, time and again, we had judgments from the Supreme Court, finding police officers guilty of torture. There are judgments written. The Hon. Minister of Justice, being a lawyer, knows that very well, that every single volume of the New Law Reports has judgments of the Supreme Court, finding police officers guilty of the most inhumane methods of torture, but they are not brought before court.

You have this Act to show people around the world that torture is an offence. Today, you are even enhancing the fine. What for? You do not prosecute them. Why did you waste this paper to put it before Parliament? You do not prosecute them. This is to show others. That is why I called it a window dressing. Already, for over 100 years, the Prisons Ordinance requires the magistrates to visit the prisons. Do they do that? When was the last time a magistrate visited a prison? I am asking this question from the Hon. Minister - you may put it here, making it obligatory and that is salutary - how are you going to enforce this, requiring a magistrate to visit police stations and other detention centres? Is there a mechanism here to do that? No. There is no mechanism. You already had that requirement for 100 years - I have known one or two conscientious magistrates who have gone and visited prisons - but they do not do that. Monthly, they must do that. But, they do not do that. And everyone knows that there is no mechanism to enforce that. But, even if you have a mechanism to enforce that, if the magistrates are not conscientious enough to do what the law has required them to do, can you, by force, have them do that? No, you cannot.

Once the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture - I remember his name very well, Manfred Nowak - who was an expert in the field came and visited places of detention. You must read his Report. I think the Report came about 15 or 20 years ago, but it is still valid because he visited a particular place and then, later in the afternoon, he visited that place again and found that people who were not there in the morning were there in the afternoon. He put it all down because those who had been tortured had been taken away and hidden when he went there announced. So, he went unannounced in the afternoon and found them. All of those facts are there. Later, there was another Rapporteur, Mndez, who had given another Report. You allow them to come to this country because you want to

1549 1550

[ . ]

2021 96

show the world that you are open, that there is no torture. Sri Lanka is one of the worst countries for torture by the police. I am happy that the Minister of Public Security is also present here now. We are one of the worst countries. So, you can say this; you can present this. I heard the Minister of Justice say that buildings are the hardware and the laws that we are passing are the software, and he thinks that that is complete. But, where is the delivery? You have made the computer and you have programmed it, but it does not work. It does not work; even power does not come to your computer with that hardware and software. It is broken. Your whole system, insofar as torture is concerned, is broken and you cannot fix it by passing these laws.

Then, a word about the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Torture, in this country, became an epidemic because of the provision in the PTA that allowed confessions made to police officers as admissible evidence. That is how torture became endemic and that is also how the police officers lost their ability to investigate offences. They no longer had to investigate offences; that skill disappeared long ago. All you had to do was to beat up a fellow or do worse and get his signature. Then, you solved the crime. I have demonstrated that and I do not want to repeat it. I have given stories after stories after stories where crimes are supposed to have been solved. Because you have a confession, you convict the wrong person, but what is dangerous in that is that the real culprit is still roaming free, he is still out there on the street. That is what is dangerous about this. If you are only concerned about national security, as you say, your national security is gone because the one who actually committed the crime is out there and you have caught somebody else, got a confession and put him behind bars. So, not just from the human rights point of view, not from the human dignity point of view, even from your avowed national security point of view, it is a dismal failure.

Sir, the European Union has passed a Resolution that they are withdrawing the GSP Plus. Why? Because in 2017, a guarantee was given by the then Government that they would repeal the PTA and replace it with another law that is compliant with international human rights standards. Some effort was made. When they came up with the CTA, I was the first person to publicly announce that it was worse than the PTA. Subsequently, it came before various Parliamentary Committees. Your Representatives also came to see whether it was complaint and we worked on it and various amendments were brought in. It was not perfect, but it was one hundred times better than the PTA that you have. I repeat, it was one hundred times better than the PTA that is still in our statute books. But, unfortunately, it was not passed because several of our civil society people thought that we must only have a perfect law. So, we now have the PTA because we could not have the perfect law. There were shortcomings in that, but it was far better. The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella mentioned certain matters. Confessions cannot be admissible. In our country, in this culture, confessions made to a police officer cannot be admissible; preventive detention cannot be permitted except for a very short period of time and with judicial supervision.

There are numerous issues with regard to the PTA. Hon. Minister, I can tell you very responsibly that you cannot amend the PTA; you have to repeal the PTA.. The whole basis, the foundation of that law is flawed. I have said this several times. It was brought in just for six months and still bears that name "(Temporary Provisions) Act" brought in 1979. So, you have to repeal it.

We also agree that all the countries in the world have laws to deal with terrorism. We do not say no to that. I agree with you that there has to be a balance, but that balance has to be struck properly. You cannot have Article 11 in our Constitution and then allow even one person to be tortured. I agree with you on that. It is not the numbers, but you did speak about numbers, about the disappeared and I heard you also say that people are making allegations that thousands of people have gone missing. People are not making allegations, your own Government-appointed Commissions have said so. Leave aside what we say, your own Commission, the Paranagama Commission says that it is more than 20,000 people. What have you got to say about that? Your own Commission, the Udalagama Commission, with regard to just the two matters that they inquired into - the deaths of the 17 aid workers in Mutur and the five students in Trincomalee - had said that. Your own Commission, the LLRC - all those three Commissions were appointed by the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa - had said that the persons who had surrendered to the security forces at the end of the war have gone missing. They have given the number: 3000 odd persons. Those are your own Commissions. We have nothing to do with those Commissions.

When your own Commissions had said tens of thousands of people have gone missing and not one has been traced so far, not one has been prosecuted for that, what is the point in saying people are saying so? You have said it; you have admitted to it. Why can you not investigate one case? Eleven young people were abducted by personnel of the Navy in Colombo, not because they were involved in anything, but for ransom. Senior naval officers were involved in that. You interfere in that; you go after investigating officers in that case; you waylay that case and then, you preach sanctimoniously here that this Government will protect the dignity of everyone. How do you make these ends meet then? If you are sincere - I am saying with all sincerity that you are not sincere and this is just window dressing for the European Union - it is too late. I want the European Union and the entire world to know that this is just eyewash, a very weak and feeble attempt by this Government to try to show that they are international human rights compliant. That will not work. Unless you make a genuine turn, you will not succeed in this false effort of yours.

Sir, the rule of law is the cornerstone of contemporary constitutional democracy, as you agree with me. Its role in cementing the recent transaction all over the world is understood, particularly bringing those dictatorial States of the former Soviet Union to democratization in the new process. Those countries kept the rule of law as their compass, as their mind for directional pathfinding in how they would transit and transform their own society. In the absence of the rule of law, contemporary constitutional democracy would be impossible. Beyond that, however, it is not clear what precise characteristics the rule of law must possess to help sustain constitutional democracy.

Therefore, I welcome the Hon. Minister of Justice. He, being a "minority", as this country calls them - possibly his community has faced violence and the most number of cases of human rights violations as much as the community that I represent did - took the chance, the opportunity and the space he has to bring forward these transforming changes.

As great Prophet Isaiah says, learn to do good; seek justice; correct the oppression; bring justice to the fatherless and plead the case of widows.

[2.44 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Presiding Member, we are trying to pass some of these Legislations today as an attempt to improve our criminal justice system when it comes to the liberty of the individual. Today, this afternoon, the Hon. Minister was heard to say that the Government follows a policy of zero tolerance against torture. These are all very pious words; these are all, I would say, utopian dreams. To make it a reality, there needs to be a paradigm shift in the manner in which we administer our criminal justice system. It is a known fact that torture is an endemic problem in the culture of policing in this country.

Together with that comes the need to have a relook at the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Several speakers before me had talked about the Act itself being a very temporary one when it was enacted way back in 1979. But, in its implementation, we have found that it had paved the way for terrible abuse of suspects in custody, particularly when it comes to torture. Torture is not simply physical

1567 1568

torture. What about the mental trauma that you subject an individual when you subject him to administrative detention without any judicial supervision for months on end? For almost one and a half years, you can keep somebody incarcerated without any judicial supervision. So, it is a very draconian piece of legislation which must be revised and we must bring an end to this endemic culture of torture. Arbitrary detention finally ends up in facilitated torture; you facilitate torture by arbitrarily detaining somebody. We have several such people in such detention centres in several places of this country.

Then, I would quote here what the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms while Countering Terrorism said in 2017:

..it -"

That is, the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

"- has fostered the endemic and systemic use of torture. Entire communities have been stigmatized and targeted for harassment and arbitrary arrest and detention.

We saw what happened after the Easter Sunday attacks. Almost 2000 to 3,000 Muslims were arrested en masse and detained. Subsequently, over a long period of time, one by one, several got released. There are 200 others in custody. Among those are some young people who have even got university entrance; some have even got entrance to the Medical College and there are also engineering students under custody. If there is substantial evidence, bring those young people before the court of law and charge them. But now, you are adopting another procedure which some dictatorial, despotic countries have adopted. That is, to set up detention centres where you go with a de-radicalization programme. You have already published a Gazette, but there are certain anomalies in that. If you want to de-radicalize somebody, first produce the evidence before a judge and show why he had been held in custody, why he should be de-radicalized and what are the reasons for that.

You also use various other provisions. About several other notable detainees, we have talked several times. Against Mr. Hejaas Hizbullah, a young lawyer who has been detained for a long time, now you have decided to file a case under hate speech provisions of the ICCPR Act. Up to now, you have only been able to do that. And you have known to have tortured and pressurized witnesses to incriminate him saying that he took part in various radicalization classes, all of which has a figment of the imagination of some of those people who have other vested interests to achieve. So, the abuse of these provisions have finally resulted in the European Union looking at it in a roundabout way, bringing some economic sanctions. When I say economic sanctions, the Preferential Tariff Arrangements are in danger today because of our attitude towards the people who are under custody.

Then, you go and pardon 16 detainees who were held under the PTA, and under that pretext, you slowly also pardon a murder convict to appease one of your supporters who has a very popular TV station, who has been singing your hosannas for several years now and who was responsible even to bring you to power. There are two specific TV stations which have been amply rewarded by several means.

Some are also being awarded tenders to buy rapid antigen test kits and all sorts of things. So, these things are happening. These things are being monitored and looked at. If you look at what is happening in the outside world today, it is very obvious that the Government is becoming unpopular by the day. So, you need all these friends who run electronic media to boost your sagging morale. So, what do you do? You go and pardoned 16 PTA detainees along with another person whom you have pardoned when he had been under the death sentence confirmed by five senior Judges of the Supreme Court. That is a very cynical move. It is seen as a cynical move for nothing else because most of those 16 detainees had been under detention for more than 10 years. Some of them, even if they were convicted, would have already served the sentence, having been there for so many years. So, such cynical moves will be laughed at by the international community. We have already invited a lot of wrath from well-meaning friends among the international community.

Now, let me also move on to some of the other issues. Particularly the Criminal Investigation Department, the Attorney-Generals Department, all these departments are those which had a certain sense of pride in their work. They were seen as very independent institutions. But, because of unnecessary politicization and pressure, they are seem to be losing their independence.

You appoint a Presidential Commission on Political Victimization and some of the Commissioners are instructing the Attorney-Generals Department to discontinue cases which have already been filed in courts and which are in the process of being heard. The Attorney-General openly comes and protests about that. You are also blaming and passing strictures on members of the Attorney-Generals Department who have sincerely done their duty and work. So, such is the attempt that is causing all these problems for us in the international arena. Therefore, we need to have a relook at all these things; we need to have some reform in these areas. Particularly, I would urge the Hon. Minister to look at the so-called de-radicalization Gazette and the manner in which it is going to be implemented. I saw that you have enlisted some Muslim theologians and learned men to de-radicalize those young detainees. By doing such a programme without sufficient evidence against them, you will only radicalize them rather than de-radicalizing. That is what I feel. Therefore, these matters have to be looked at with a different approach and then some of these issues need to be corrected.

I would also talk about the Office for Reparations. The Hon. Minister said that it was a substitute for REPPIA. Now, there are several compensation issues

1569 1570

[ ]

2021 96

pertaining to the Digana riots, the riots in Ampara and the riots in the Kurunegala District, for which large amounts are still to be doled out. Therefore, those people who have suffered serious property damage have to be compensated. I hope the Government will look into it and have those matters also attended through the Office for Reparations very soon.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. Jayantha Weerasinghe, PC. You have 13 minutes.

[4.06 p.m.]

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, I thank you for giving me some time to make a few comments on these Items taken up for debate today.

I would like to mainly restrict my comments to the OMP - the Office on Missing Persons. Initially, I would also like to welcome the Bills brought in to amend the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act and the Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment Act. Those are, no doubt, forward-moving steps. But, as several Members of this House, primarily from the Opposition, have repeatedly stated, I think implementing these laws is a crucial matter, which, I am sure, the Hon. Minister of Justice is fully aware of. This is a country which has a legacy of passing the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution, which is the supreme law of the country, and never implementing it when it came to the appointment of the Constitutional Council. At that time, there was a different President and she herself was involved in bringing the law, but eventually, never appointed that Constitutional Council. That was an Amendment brought to the supreme law of this country, supposedly the Constitution. So, I think there is a valid point made by the Opposition Members with regard to implementing these Amendments. The legacy that this country has created, I think, is appalling on that matter and as a result, there is great doubt with regard to the credibility of the entire judicial system.

Apart from those comments, I would like to talk about the Office on Missing Persons. Sir, the Office on Missing Persons and the Office for Reparations were created consequent to Resolution 30/1 passed in the UN Human Rights Council. That was a Resolution which was brought with the consent of the previous Government. Whilst the present Government vehemently criticized Resolution 30/1 and called it a treacherous act, we, on the other hand - I am someone who goes to the Human Rights Council sessions as often as possible - criticized it as a complete betrayal of the victims. A country-specific Resolution was primarily mooted on the grounds that heinous crimes had taken place and accountability was required.

Instead of accountability being looked at, the previous Government managed to succeed, in my view, in actually getting Sri Lanka out of the clutches of the need for accountability by showing ancillary matters and fringe issues as progress. One of those was the Office on Missing Persons. There is a procedure within the UN Human Rights Council and also within the UN structure itself that whatever decisions taken should be victim-centric, that victims must have confidence in the process because if you do not have the confidence of the victims on board, they are not going to cooperate with whatever steps that are taken. The Office on Missions Persons was created when the victims had given so many recommendations and none of those recommendations were taken by the previous Government, but were ignored

in creating the Office on Missing Persons. The victims or the forcibly disappeared people have repeatedly complained that there is no credibility with regard to this Office. Let me just very briefly quote some of those complaints that they have, in fact, put forward in writing.

How do you expect OMP to bring justice to us, when OMP Act Section13(2) mentions that the findings of the OMP could not be used in any civil or criminal cases for seeking justice?

There is no transparency adopted in the selection of the Commissioners for the OMP. Selections were made by the Constitutional Council in which Sinhala politicians are also members, who repeatedly said that they will not allow any members of the security forces to face justice. Can OMP guarantee that alleged perpetrators will be brought to justice?

Out of the seven Commissioners is a former senior security force officer. How can we go and seek justice from him? Can OMP take steps to remove him as its Commissioner?

So, like that, they have listed so many valid doubts. Today, the victims or the forcibly disappeared in the North and the East - the Tamil victims - do not in fact have confidence in the OMP or in the Office for Reparations and are boycotting them. A vast majority of victims refused to go before the OMP. It is in that backdrop that the OMP was approved by the previous Government in this House and it is for that reason of window dressing, just to show the international community "some progress is being made", that these Offices were created and thereby, the previous Government managed to prolong the question of accountability for six years without any progress being made at all. Therefore, Sir, it is not surprising that the only Offices that this Government is willing to hold on to are the OMP and the Office for Reparations, which were created by Resolution 30/1. I think it is tragic, Sir, that we still, 12 years after ending the war, cannot understand that grave crimes had been committed against ordinary people and that it is the duty of the State to protect its people. If, in fact, those crimes had been committed by the armed forced, then those must be prosecuted. Even 12 years after the war, knowing fully well that crimes have been committed - these are responsible members who are holding office today - simply refusing even to go into it, I think, clearly shows how tragic this country is and quite honestly, for as long as this culture continues, we only create a perpetuated system of impunity.

Thank you. [. . 4.14]
