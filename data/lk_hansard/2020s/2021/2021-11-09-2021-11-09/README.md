:

PRIVILEGE: STATEMENTS BY GOVERNOR OF

EASTERN PROVINCE

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Hon. Speaker, I would like to raise a matter of Privilege. I hereby wish to bring to your attention that my Privileges as a Member of Parliament have been violated by the actions of the Governor of the Eastern Province, Mrs. Anuradha Yahampath. As per a statement issued by the Governor on the 09th of September, 2021 to the Divaina Sinhala newspaper, she has instructed the Senior DIG of the Eastern Province to initiate an independent investigation into a statement I made in Parliament on the 07th of September, 2021. I would like to table* that statement of the Governor and would also like to read out what it states. It is in Sinhala and states, I quote:

: .

The Senior DIG was actually put in a very uncomfortable position. He spoke to me and said in Sinhala, " , . . , ." He contacted me and agreed that this was a violation of my Privileges. Therefore, I do not want to raise a matter of Privilege against the Senior DIG.

2045 2046

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

Sir, I would also like to bring to your attention that this is not the first time that the Governor has violated my Privileges. She had issued statements to newspapers against me on prior occasions also. So, Sir, I would like to request you to inquire into this violation of my Privileges and take stern action against the Governor, as I believe that you, as the Speaker, are committed to protecting the Privileges of all Members of Parliament.

Sir, this is not the only time where my Privileges have been violated. As you are aware, in this House during Questions for Oral Answers, I am being called names; at Consultative Committees, I am being called names and when I speak also, I am being called names. So, as the youngest Member of Parliament in the Opposition, I would like to request you to take serious action to protect the traditions and quality of this House. Is this the example that I should take forward for future generations?

Sir, also regarding the Governor, she has violated the Constitution of this country by some of the appointments she has made to the Municipal Council in Batticaloa. I am a petitioner in a case against some land grab in the Mahaweli area in the East. She is disrespecting the Judiciary by some of her actions. I really request you to take stern action against this Governor because she is not fit to be a Governor.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) That is enough. I will consider that matter. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , ?

FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD REPORTS OF COMMITTEE ON

PUBLIC ACCOUNTS [12.14 p.m.]

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I move the following Adjournment Motion:

"The Motion for the Adjournment Debate is being moved to discuss the issues mentioned in the First, Second and Third Reports presented to Parliament by the COPA in the First Session of the Ninth Parliament.

The First, Second and Third Reports of COPA were presented to Parliament on 20th July, 2021, 06th October, 2021 and 07th October, 2021 respectively.

The First and Second Reports include the details of the investigations carried out by the Committee on the Department of Inland Revenue, Sri Lanka Customs and Excise Department, which contribute to approximately 90 per cent of Government revenue, a few more State institutions and also the details of 10 investigations carried out by COPA based on special and performance audit reports of the Auditor-General presented to Parliament.

The Third Report of COPA includes the online evaluation results of all State institutions based on Financial Year 2019."

Sir, according to the mandate, more than 840 institutions should be examined by the COPA.

First, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the First and Second Reports of the COPA and to some issues of special importance in those.

Attention should be focused on the existence of vacancies in the Departments of Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise. The vacancies existing in those Departments hinder the proper functioning of those institutions which generate the majority of Government revenue. The Committee also observed that serious lapses in the relevant Acts affect adversely on the proper functioning of those institutions. I am of the view that the relevant authorities should pay attention to rectifying these matters.

Then, it has been observed that many irregularities occur at the Customs by using wrong HS Codes in importing vehicles and other goods as well. When the

2049 2050

vehicles are registered in the Department of Motor Traffic, the same Code is used so that the owner pays a lower road tax. So, Sir, the Committee has suggested that the best way to prevent those irregularities is to develop an integrated computer programme. Although such programmes have already been commenced, there are issues which need attention to ensure their proper functioning. Therefore, the Committee is of the view that the irregularities can be prevented if an integrated computer programme is put in place, which would resolve the prevailing issues. Such a programme would reduce the income lost to the Government.

Sir, the human-elephant conflict is a very controversial matter which has caused immense difficulties to the people living in remote areas. Recommendations have been made by the Committee to minimize this conflict. The Department of Wildlife cannot act alone. A collective assistance from the Department of Wildlife Conservation, the Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority, the security forces and the Civil Security Department is needed for this purpose. Any successful solution cannot be found without the assistance of the villagers. I am of the view that the solution submitted by Dr. Prithiviraj Fernando will help solve the problem.

Sir, another special observation made by the Committee is the irregularities occurring in the Local Government Authorities. Action should be taken to minimize those irregularities by paying special attention to the issues raised by audit reports.

A large amount of tax and penalties in default are to be recovered from the taxpayers by the Department of Inland Revenue. The main reason for this is that a long period is taken to dispose of appeals by three appellate bodies when one would suffice. I stress this point because it seems meaningless to have three appellate bodies for an institution since the practice is the same everywhere. A longer period would be taken if the taxpayer goes for judicial proceedings as well. So, the Committee is of the view that these periods should be minimized. Government revenue could be increased by expediting the recovery of outstanding taxes.

Sir, there was Rs. 18 billion - I stress, Rs. 18 billion! - of taxes in arrears pertaining to identified institutions with respect to the Legacy System as at 30th March, 2021. Out of that amount, only Rs. 424 million - only Rs. 424 million out of Rs. 18 billion - had been recovered in cash. According to the RAMIS, there was Rs. 87 billion worth taxes in arrears pertaining to the identified institutions and only Rs. 4 billion had been recovered in cash. The balances in the Legacy System and the RAMIS were settled in the form of suspensions, tax and penalty deductions, penalty cuts, journal transfers and tax refunds. That is how things are being done. However, taxes classified under the category of Recoverable Taxes were not in a position to be collected without any problems. Hence, an overestimation of the taxes which could be levied, due to this, does not reflect the real

situation. Therefore, attention should be focused on this matter as well.

Then, we observe that not much attention is drawn towards the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals - SDGs. It is important that every State institution focuses on the implementation of the SDGs.

Sir, the issue of preserving the Muthurajawela Wetland is one of the main items in the Second Report. There were a number of illegal activities carried out such as unauthorized constructions and sand mining in that area. The Committee recommends to stop those unauthorized activities. Muthurajawela is a nature reserve. Here, I must mention that I am shocked to see in the newspapers that there is a proposal now to hand over some lands of the Muthurajawela Wetlands to the Urban Development Authority - the UDA.

Also, special attention has been focused in the Second Report on road safety in Sri Lanka. It has revealed that Rs. 1 million to Rs. 10 million is spent to treat a person subjected to a road accident. Therefore, the Committee recommends to provide necessary technical equipment to the Police to prevent the road accidents.

The Committee also recommends that transportation of goods by railway be increased since it is the cheapest and the most environmental-friendly form of transport, reducing the cost of fuel borne by other means of transport such as by private vehicles, three-wheelers et cetera.

Then, the Committee has observed that our country is lacking an acceptable agricultural policy and a systematic cultivation plan, resulting in both excesses and shortages of the harvest, incurring losses to the Government and the farmers.

Sir, the Committee also considered the issue of unemployment of Arts graduates. The Committee has proposed the formulation of a National Academic Plan to suit the job market and its early implementation so that the whole educational system would be geared to provide what the job market requires. Therefore, I propose that speedy action be initiated to implement these recommendations.

Sir, the Third Report of the COPA incudes the online evaluation results of all State institutions based on the Financial Year 2019. The Committee, for the first time in the history of Parliament, launched a computer-based online evaluation system to evaluate all State institutions, about 840, annually during the Eighth Parliament. The system had been initiated based the on Financial Year 2015 and has been ongoing. A financial and performance evaluation of State institutions is carried out in that. The Committee scrutinizes the compliance of State institutions with the provisions of the Constitution, the Financial Regulations and other legal provisions. The State institutions attempt to work in compliance with the existing rules and regulations, minimizing the possibility of occurrence of irregularities and lapses. It is very

2051 2052

[ () ]

2021 1

important that the attention of Parliament is focused on all State institutions annually.

In terms of the Article 148 of the Constitution, Parliament has full control over public finance. As such, COPA oversees the financial control of the State institutions. Through this process, these institutions are able to function with financial discipline and better management practices to eliminate wastage, fraud and corruption and to realize the expectations of the general public for a more efficient and effective delivery of services.

Finally, I believe that each institution would rectify the shortcomings pointed out in this Report. I wind up my speech with the hope that the Ministers in charge of the relevant institutions and the responsible officers take action to eliminate or minimize the shortcomings pointed out in this Report.
