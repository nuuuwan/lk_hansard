. , . , . . . . , , 80 . , . The entire defence expenditure is out of our Consolidated Fund; there are no foreign funds. But, when it comes to education, absolutely the entire amount - there is hardly anything allocated out of the Consolidated Fund for education - is foreign funds. So, where is your priority, particularly when you are facing so many challenges? With the closure of schools, we are having several problems. 2020 , -19 .

. , , , . . The Minister, in his speech, went on thanking

all those agencies for allocating these monies. What ultimately happens is, you have to be bound by their conditions. You have to use the monies for the purposes which they have designed it and the Minister has no way to manoeuvre here; he is bound by the rules and conditions set by all those multilateral agencies because you are using their monies. Hardly any monies from the Consolidated Fund have been allocated to the Hon. Minister. The Hon. Minister is an experienced politician coming from an important political legacy in the country and he knows about education very well. But, what has happened ultimately? His hands are tied and nothing can be done because you all are bound by the conditions that have already been laid down. That is what I am trying to say.

, . 250. 250 . . , . , they are allocating Rs. 1 trillion for the next two, three years! But, the education sector is getting only US Dollars 250 million. So, what is this joke? Can you fill all the gaps that had been created in the education sector because of this pandemic with this type of allocation? We say that in an upper middle-income country, normally, there must be an allocation of at least 6 per cent of GDP for education. At least 6 per cent. But, what have we been doing? This fault had happened with every successive Government, even with the previous Government. We must admit that. They keep talking about allocating 6 per cent for education in their manifestos during the election time, but later, it comes down to, at the most, 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent. That is what we have achieved. So, this is a long legacy that you have inherited and you are continuing with it, particularly when you are faced with this pandemic and the challenges that come with it.

, . , . . , .

, . You all suddenly introduced the General Sir John Kotelawala National Defence University Bill. I am sure the Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya will talk about this. The General Sir John Kotelawala National Defence University Bill was also brought in a very surreptitious, suspicious way. With that, you took away all the powers belonging to the University Grants Commission. Then, what about quality assurance and accreditation in the

1241 1242

higher education sector? Our Government - I held the portfolio of Higher Education for about a year - completed the Higher Education (Quality Assurance and Accreditation) Bill. That is yet to be finalized. The Hon. Minister must present it to the Cabinet and finalize it because it is brought for a certain purpose. Now, that you all are bestowing all types of advantages on the military establishment, they want to run away with the education and higher education sector also with their own degrees, which they can dole out at their whims and fancies. You cannot allow them to do that. There must be some quality assurance and accreditation which must be properly ensured. . , . UGC General Sir John Kotelawala National Defence University Board of Governors , , . . . , . .

I must say that our country, with all our faults and difficulties, is almost at the level of an upper middle-income country, even almost equal to Turkey when it comes to literacy and education. But, with all these challenges of the COVID pandemic, we are going backwards. There is no programme, nothing has been provided to the people. Now, there are various problems; families are facing problems. . With distance learning requirements, children are facing problems; they do not have the required devices. Have you ever thought about these families and trying to help them? Now, you are giving loads of money to the Members of the Local Authorities to do rural development projects, but education has been totally neglected. So, this is a very serious matter.

( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) Due to the recent flood situation and various other disasters like landslides and all that, we find buildings in several schools in the Central, Uva and Sabaragamuwa Provinces and even in the Southern Province damaged with roofs been blown away and the walls broken down, which have been declared as totally unsuitable for use.

Now, you have created, like in the past, a programme to develop schools. These programmes come in different names. We called ours - .

You are taking away the powers of the Provincial Councils, about which there is a big debate. Be that as it may, what have you done so far? , . You have just given them some money - about Rs. 2 million - to put up their name boards. ( ) (An Hon. Member) And the school gate. ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) Of course, a gate. A lovely gate has been prepared by each school. Beyond that, nothing has happened. And in that also, you have alllowed your MPs and your DCC Members to go and select these schools. There is no scientific selection of schools. What nonsense is this? Therefore, Hon. Minister, I think you have to at least revise these policies and make sure that education does not become a tool in the hands of the politicians.

Protection of rural schools will be guaranteed. The programme gears to establish 1,000 National Schools when completed. As a priority development project, the Government will establish National Schools in 123 Divisions and will increase the present 373 to 500. An additional allocation of Rs. 2,000 million has already been allocated to provide facilities for technical and technological education. Special attention has been paid to skills-based education and sports facilities.

The required tax concessions will be provided for the implementation of fibre-optic connections and other services to all schools.

No country can ever truly flourish if it stifles the potential of its women and deprives itself of the contributions of half of its citizens. When girls are educated, their countries become stronger and more prosperous.

Malala Yousafzai once stated, We cannot all succeed when half of us are held back. No struggle can ever succeed without women participating side by side with men. There are two powers in the world; one is the sword and the other is the pen. There is a third power stronger than both, that of women.

Sir, let me conclude by reiterating the great importance that I attach to the initiation and the formulation of a national nutrition policy with the mother, the woman and the child in the household as a major focus. In addition, I also would like to emphasize the indispensable requirement of our society to establish a womens commission that would be all empowered, legally, morally, ethically and in terms of a plethora of policy instruments, in order to ensure that the political, economic, social, cultural and religious rights of the woman in our society are protected. It is vital that we pay our fullest attention to this noble objective. Our country should prioritize the promotion, protection and the initiation of welfare projects with the mother and the child as a focal point.

I am sorry to say that this particular Government, this particular administration has not given the women and the children in our society the due prioritization. It is amply apparent to all of us by the non-existence of a Cabinet Ministry on womens affairs. It exhibits the lack of interest this Government is showing as far as the woman and the child are concerned. So, I urge the Members of the Government to impress upon His Excellency the President about the vital need to immediately establish a Cabinet-ranked womens affairs ministry together with the subject of children so that adequate and ample attention would be paid to those two noble causes.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake. . [.. 11.27] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. S.B. Dissanayake) , .
