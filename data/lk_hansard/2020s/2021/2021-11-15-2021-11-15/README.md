Sri Lanka has honoured all foreign debt payments that were due within the past two years, amidst the COVID crisis and misleading false statements by the Opposition. Irrespective of what the Opposition is saying, we have fulfilled our financial obligations and won the trust of the international financial agencies that we are managing under the present circumstances and amidst all these problems, without going into any kind of a sovereign default. This House remembers what you all were saying. You all were predicting that we would be going into a sovereign default. How many times you all have repeated that in the House. Why are you all behaving like this?

In a national crisis, all of us must protect our citizens, our country and our economy, and not just reasons to oppose.

Why do you all not restart flights from India to Palaly, Jaffna? If 100 monks can travel to India to open an airport in India, why can the Government of Sri Lanka not invite the Prime Minister of India and open up the

427 428

Rameshwaram-Talaimannar ferry service? Why can you not do that? Are you worried? You cannot have two faces; you need to stop having two faces because, otherwise, people are not going to trust you. That is the problem. You are not supportive of restarting the Rameshwaram-Talaimannar ferry service; you do not want to restart flights from Palaly to India, but you want to say that we are very close to India. I do not understand the logic behind this.

In all honesty, I know that all the senior Ministers and senior politicians of this Government are aware that the TNAs position is that we want to live in this country as Sri Lankans. We want to live in one undivided and indivisible country as Sri Lankans. We have said that; we have said that again and again and again. But, you do not want us to live like that because that is what your politics depend on. You want to keep us divided; you do not want to work with us. You do not want the Sri Lankan Tamils to say, We are Sri Lankans and want to live together because your politics fully depend on that. You are worried that the minute you say, No, look, the TNA is not a separatist political party. Let us work with them, you would lose your vote share.

The present Prime Minister Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa had two opportunities in the past. When he finished the war in 2009, he had his first opportunity to unite this country and solve this countrys ethnic problem. At the end of the day, all these economic constraints come down to us because we have not addressed our national ethnic question and the current Prime Minister of this country had an opportunity for that when he ended the war. He had the support of the international community too. Then, in 2010, he had a two-thirds majority in Parliament. He could have solved this ethnic problem then. That was his second opportunity. But, what did he do? He got the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution passed and got more powers to him. Now, this is the third time. "The third time is lucky" . You know that for the third time, you have been given an opportunity by the people of this country to solve this problem. So, you can solve this issue. Your name would be written in golden letters if you solve this issue. Right now, Hon. Prime Minister, you are seen as one of the most senior politicians in the Asian Region. You could even win the Nobel Peace Prize. Why do you not do that? Why do you not solve this issue? All we are asking from you is to solve this issue.

Right now, we are lobbing for a political solution; we are lobbing for our rights; we are lobbing for the rights of our Tamil people. All that we are asking is to be treated equally in this country and let us enjoy the same privileges that everybody else does. How hard is that? How hard is that for you to do? Sir, imagine the amount of money that we could bring in if we work together. As the TNA, we are happy to help you. But, first, you need to solve this issue. Think about it this way. Rght now, we go to most of the countries to speak about the human rights situation of this country and the political solution that has been pending in this country. But imagine, if you solve this issue, we would go to those countries on your behalf, on behalf of this country and bring money into this

country. Then, you will not have a debt crisis. You will have foreign reserves that will surpass your needs. So, do that; all that we ask for is to resolve this issue. If you do not resolve this issue, your names will be written in this country as the worst - Sir, I will say that in Sinhala because the country needs to understand.
