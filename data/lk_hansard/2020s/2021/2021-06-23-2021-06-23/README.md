( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Next, the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran to raise a Question of Privilege. - [Uproar.]

:

PRIVILEGE: BREACH OF LANGUAGE RIGHTS

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Speaker, I wish to raise a Question of Privilege. And while I associate myself with the protest of the protestors, I would request them to kindly keep quiet for a while because it is an important issue of Privilege that I am raising.

You will recall, Sir, that it was agreed that the language preference of Members of Parliament would be sought when certain reports are tabled in Parliament. This is a question with regard to the Report of the Commission to Investigate into Political Victimization that I raise in the House today. When I was asked of my language preference, I indicated that I would like to receive it in English. There was a form that was circulated and our preference was obtained. However, the Final Report was initially tabled only in Sinhala and contained three volumes, running into 2043 pages. Much later, a CD was distributed among the Tamil-speaking Members of Parliament, which was said to contain a Tamil translation of the said Final Report. I never received a translation in English.

I have now managed to compare the contents of this CD that is said to contain the Tamil translation with the Final Report in the Sinhala language with the assistance of others proficient in Sinhala. I am appalled to find that what is said to be the Tamil translation contains only a few pages of the Final Report in Sinhala. For instance, Volume II of the Sinhala Report is totally missing; pages 160-554, 572-608, 667-1556, 1565-2043 are all missing in the CD that is said to contain the full Tamil translation. There are a few other pages that cannot be identified with the Sinhala text. I do not know if all the copies of this CD contain the same information.

I wish to know why a fraud of this magnitude had been perpetrated on the Tamil-speaking Members of Parliament. Who is responsible for this? I was told earlier by the staff that Parliament did not wish to take responsibility for the translation and that is the reason why an English translation was not provided. I was also told that the Tamil translation was done by the Presidential Secretariat and the Parliament merely copied the CDs and circulated among the Members of Parliament. I wish to know whether this is true.

You will agree that this is a serious breach of my language rights in addition to it being a breach of my Privilege as a Member of Parliament. Sir, I also want to say that this is a very serious issue. In 1987, we were supposed to have amended the Constitution and accepted Tamil also as an Official Language of this country. More than 35 years later, I have to stand in that very Assembly which passed that Amendment and plead for equality and for the rights of Tamil as an Official Language. Most people ask when they talk about the grievances of the Tamil people, What are your grievances? You had a language grievance that was resolved in 1987 and they belittle all our other serious grievances. But, even this particular language grievance that is said to have been resolved in 1987 is not even adhered to in the highest

forum in the country, and it is a sad day. I have raised this a number of occasions. I am told that the Presidential communiques are issued only in Sinhala and English and they are not issued in Tamil.

If this is how you treat Tamil as an Official Language, then is it any wonder that you have the wrath of the world on you?

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I am very sorry, Hon. Member, if that had happened as you said. I will look into this matter and see how best we could resolve it.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) The next speaker is the Hon. M. A. Sumanthiran. You have nine minutes.

[11.45 a.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on this very important issue that is before the House at a time when the countrys financial situation is in dire straits.

But, before I get on to that subject matter, since the Hon. Minister who preceded me made mention of the

Tamil political prisoners, I would like to tell him that this is a matter that we have been agitating for, as far as I remember, from 2010 when I entered this House. We have not allowed even one Session of Parliament to pass by without raising this issue. So, for over a decade, we have agitated for this. In the year 2011, His Excellency Gotabaya Rajapaksa, when he was the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, facilitated me to visit prisons and obtain details of these prisoners, which I did and gave the details to the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa. So, for 10 years, this has been talked about. You express interest in doing something. No Government ever said, No, we cannot release them, but you kept them for 10 years. Even yesterday, it was strange that a Minister from the Government was pleading with the Government - that is what the Statement said - to work out a system of release. There was a prominent judge before whom I used to appear and he used to say, If somebody is threatening to mark a document, you can rest assured that that document will never get marked with the case. So, if the Government is continuously saying, Oh, we are going to do it, we are going to do it, our suspicion is that they are not going to do it. Therefore, without talking, without saying this ad nauseam, release them. What is standing in the way of releasing them? You do not need 10, 11 years to be talking about this. It is quite obvious why you are talking about it now. That is what we pointed out yesterday. There was a statement the day before yesterday and before that too.

The Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act was brought into this country in 1979 for six months as a temporary provisions Act. Even now, it bears that name. That is how serious it is. It is still called the "Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act". It was brought in for a duration of six months, was extended in 1982 and was made permanent, but the title remains. When you were on this side, Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara, you have attacked the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act; you have talked about political prisoners and today, you say that you welcome this move. Do not just keep welcoming it, do it! We want to -

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) There is no point of Order in that. If you want to reply, you can reply me at any other time.

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) I just want to clarify it. We never attacked the PTA. When we were in the Government, we wanted to change it, but the problem was with the way it was going to be changed. With the Clauses that they wanted added, we did not agree because terrorism has somewhat developed now. That was the issue.

1281 1282

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Okay. Thank you. Let the Hon. Sumanthiran continue. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, it is not a point of Order. You cannot let him go on like this. How much time did you give him? It is not a point of Order. As he started, you knew it was not a point of Order. You could not have allowed him to take my time like that. Surely, you know what a point of Order is.

So, all I am saying is that there is no point in just threatening to repeal the PTA or change it. Just do it; show it by your action. Just because some meeting is coming round or some report is due somewhere else, you jump and say these things, but you do not do it. I challenge the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa who made that Statement to do it. I welcomed it yesterday without reservation because the Government was trying to give a wrong message to the country that we are using it like a beggars wound, that we want them incarcerated and that we do not want them released. That is far from the truth.

We have agitated for this. You know it very well. During every Session of Parliament, we have agitated for their release, and because you were trying to send a wrong message, without reservation, I welcomed that Statement. But, I am challenging you, do it! Tomorrow is Poson. So, release them; release some of them immediately with the others that you will release and release the rest as soon as possible. None of them needs to be incarcerated anymore. They are political prisoners. We have told you why we call them political prisoners.

Yesterday, the Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan went and sat behind the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa to be seen in the videos when that Statement was being made and today, he has written on social media saying that he played a small part in this. He calls them political prisoners; a person in the Government ranks calls them political prisoners. So, they are political prisoners.

() ( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Suren Raghavan) Hon. Speaker, he mentioned my name.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, no. I will mention your name any number of times. You cannot stand up whenever I mention your name. Right? You have to lick the boots

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

of the Government because you have got some position there. - [Interruption.]

() ( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Suren Raghavan) Hon. Speaker, I have - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Raghavan, I challenge you! Let us see how many people you are able to release without boasting about this. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Why do you want to get involved in these kind of things? - [Interruption.] Both of you are responsible Members of this House. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You are playing politics with prisoners lives. That is what you are doing. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Raghavan, could you please raise it when his speech is over. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You do not need 11 years to do that. Before Sunil Rathnayake was pardoned and released, how much time did he spend in prison? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Raghavan? () ( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Suren Raghavan) You have been in Parliament for 15 years. What did you do? What have you been doing during the 15 years in Parliament?

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) All that is over now. Hon. Sumanthiran, you continue with your speech. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) All right. - [Interruption.] Sit down! Sit down without barking!

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

1283 1284

2021 26

I will say what I did. I have not been here for 15 years; I have been here for 11 years. During all the 11 years - I said that, if you were not listening - during every Session of Parliament, we have asked for their release; we have done that. We sit in the Opposition. We do not go licking the boots

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

of the Government and get positions like you. We sit in the Opposition and that is all we can do: we have asked for that repeatedly. We do not hang on to coat-tails of the Government and get positions. -[Interruption.] That is not what we do. A turncoat like you does not have any policy. You come and ask us for nominations and then, go and get nominations from the Government. You do not have any policy.

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) Hon. Speaker, - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara? ( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) I would like to ask, Hon. Sumanthiran, what did you do for the last five years? You were licking the boots

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

of the then Government. What else, had he done?

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Sumanthiran, you carry on. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I will answer you. More than 100 prisoners were released between - [Interruption.] Please sit down! Sir, tell that dog not to bark.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Sumanthiran, do not get involved in that. You go ahead with your usual speech. Why do you worry about it?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, Sir, he keeps barking [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] behind me. Ask him to get out.

Between 2015 and 2019, more than 100 Tamil political prisoners were released. I am not satisfied with that. We pressed for the release of everybody. If you ask, "What did you do?", we pressed for it. We sat in the Opposition. We were not part of the Government. We are not like you. - [Interruption.] When the Hon. Maithreepala Sirisena gives you a position, you can become the Governor and then, come and sit here in the Government ranks. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Sumanthiran, again you are getting involved in that. Please, address the Chair.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Now, Sir, I will get onto the matter at hand. There is a very serious financial issue that the country is facing and today, a Supplementary Estimate has been presented. The justification for that is, COVID-19. We do appreciate that you need money and that you have to fight this hard. But, it is only in this House that we can actually talk about whether you are doing that in the proper way.

I am glad that two of the persons I wanted to mention are in the House today. The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana is here. The most respected, the most senior person in the field of virology is part of the Government. He is an MP; he is in Parliament. One who knows about viruses more than most people is with you. I saw a few days ago that he had made a public statement saying, The Army Commander does not know anything about viruses. Very true. The Army Commander does not fight viruses; he cannot even see them. You have to look at it through a microscope. The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana knows about viruses. So, why do you not use him? Why are you using the Army Commander? The other person is the Hon. (Dr.) (Mrs.) Sudarshini Fernandopulle, an expert in public health. That is her field. You appoint a Minister in charge of COVID-19, but none of what she says happens in this country.

When she raised an alarm about money - today, you have presented a Supplementary Estimate - what did the Chief Government Whip do? He went before the press and said, Oh, she is under immense stress. Hon. (Dr.) (Mrs.) Fernandopulle, your Whip wants you to be referred to a psychiatrist. That is what he was telling the people. The Chief Government Whip was referring you to a

1285 1286

consultant psychiatrist. This is a Government that is so fortunate to have two people who must make decisions, who must take the lead. You have them with you and you are fighting the virus like fighting some foreign troops by giving it to the Army Commander. What does the Army Commander know? What does the Army Commander know even about the law to say that there is a lockdown here and there is a travel restriction there? Where is the law? A law must be in writing and must be published. Only then it qualifies to become a law. There is nothing. Then, there is the PMD, the Presidents Media Division. Is that how laws are made? Now, the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara is silent. You have been in this House for so long. Is that how laws are made? You pride yourself calling yourself a democrat. You give all that power to one man and he issues media statements and that is considered law. He says, If I speak, that is the circular. Sir-cular; that is the law; "Sir-cu-law". Now, you can laugh; you are enjoying what I am saying. But, you must not allow that to happen. If you are a responsible Minister in the Government, you must not allow that to happen. You are mismanaging this pandemic. That is why we are in the third wave now. You are unable to manage it. We will have even the fourth wave and more people will die. There are variants evolving. This is a new phenomenon. So, health authorities and health experts must take the lead in this matter.

We do not mind voting for Supplementary Estimates. You need the money, we do know that. Around this time last year, we even went to court asking that Parliament be reconvened and one of the reasons we asked for that was to pass Supplementary Estimates so that money could be used to fight COVID-19. At that time, you did not want that; you did it by Executive fiat. Now, you are coming before Parliament because this is the proper procedure. Another thing is, you need laws. Sir, I keep saying this not only because I have presented a Bill, but because you need laws, you need proper laws. A country must be governed by laws, not by Executive fiat and not at the whims and fancies of the Army Commander of the country. This House is redundant if this House cannot make laws for one year on this crucial issue. Most other countries, within weeks, made special laws to combat this situation and here, we do not want to do that. Why do we not want to do that? Because that will impede with the way the Army Commander will function. He wakes up one morning and decides how this must be handled.

Then, you have the Itukama" COVID-19 Fund. Only after a Question was asked about its utilization, you came up with the 23 per cent that had been used. In January, only 6 per cent had been used. So, you have that money; you have called for funds and people are donating. Use that first. Up to now, only Rs. 300 million has been used and you have another Rs. 1.75 billion in that account.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member you have consumed five minutes extra.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I think there is more time, Sir. Some of the Hon. Members have conducted another session of Parliament in the Well of the House today and walked out. They may not come back. They are now holding Parliament outside, I am told.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Anyway, help me by finishing your speech. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Okay, Sir. I will wind up.

The only other point I want to make is that we must get together and fight this pandemic. On this issue and on many other national issues, we do not play politics. Just to get popularity, please do not accuse us of playing politics. But, you are not utilizing the Hon. Members who have been elected by the people to get together and face this situation.

But, you are not doing that. The Constitution of our country is not designed in that way. True enough, the Executive President is the Head of the Cabinet, but he is only the Head of the Cabinet. The Executive consists of Cabinet Ministers and others. We are a House of Representatives. We must express the views of our people; we must participate in decision-making. So, we are appealing to the Government, do that. If you do that properly, we can win this battle against COVID-19. But, if you go the way that you have gone so far, I am afraid there will be no place to lay our heads.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Next, the Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem. You have eight minutes.

[2.45 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Madam Presiding Member, today we have this Debate on the effort by the Government to increase the borrowings on Treasury Bills by another Rs. 1,000 billion.

At the outset, I would like to quote what the Government states in the Fiscal Management Report 2020-21 of the Ministry of Finance. Under the theme Fiscal Developments, Treasury Operations and Foreign Financing it states, I quote:

The government introduced a simple, transparent and efficient tax system in the latter part of 2019 and the beginning of 2020 to stimulate the economy by augmenting aggregated demand. The tax structure was simplified by removing Economic Service Charge (ESC), Nation Building Tax (NBT) and Debt Repayment Levy (DRL). Personal and corporate income tax structures were revised. Value Added Tax (VAT) rate slashed to 8 percent from 15 percent and VAT registration threshold expanded.

Madam, this quote, when looked at it in isolation, looks very elegant and inspiring. Holistically, every economic action has an economic cost. The question that I would like to pose to the Government is this: did the Government evaluate the economic impact of this elegant and inspiring course of action to introduce the simplified, transparent and efficient tax system which was later endorsed in November, 2020, this too amid the worst economic calamity the world in general and specifically Sri Lanka was facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic? Madam Presiding Member, prudent fiscal management dictates economic decision-making to be done based on sound macroeconomic fundamentals and economic realities and then, presents what is foreseen or projected in the future with no room for political agendas to tweak the decision-making process.

Yesterday, I took up the issue of the European Union taking a decision in their Parliament to recommend the withdrawal of the GSP Plus concessions for Sri Lanka.

1323 1324

[ ]

2021 26

Today, the Hon. State Minister of Money and Capital Market and State Enterprise Reforms was heard to say that while diplomatic efforts are to be pursued on one side, they are looking at alternatives to the GSP Plus conditions, that they will explore possibilities. While you are looking at alternatives, look at the reality on the ground. Let me show you some examples. The total exports, as per the Central Bank Annual Report 2020, have altogether been US Dollars 9.8 billion, of which the European Union accounts for 31.6 per cent or US Dollars 3.1 billion; the United States accounts for 24.9 per cent or US Dollars 2.5 billion, the Middle Eastern Bloc accounts for 9.1 per cent or US Dollars 900 million and India accounts for 6 per cent or a further US Dollars 606 million. All these countries put together, the export revenue that this country got from those countries is US Dollars 7.1 billion. Now, all this is at stake because of the way in which we are proceeding on the human rights agenda. That is why the European Union is asking you to reconsider revising the Prevention of Terrorism Act. - [Interruption.] Let me finish.

You have been using the Prevention of Terrorism Act in order to muzzle dissenting opinion. You have been taking into custody political opponents; you have been using the provisions to detain people for a long time and force confessions out of them. Now, this is what happened in the Court of Appeal in Shani Abeysekaras bail application. The Court of Appeal very specifically says that the Government is guilty, that the CID and the CCD are guilty of fabricating evidence against Shani Abeysekara. That is a very damning indictment against the Government by the Court of Appeal.

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Lohan Rathwaththe - State Minister of Gem and Jewellery Related Industries and State Minister of Prison Management and Prisoners' Rehabilitation) Madam, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .

( ) (The Hon. Lohan Rathwaththe) Madam, this case is proceeding in the Court right now. So, he cannot speak about it in the House at this moment.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, no. That is the judgment already given; already, the judgment had been given. Those are the reasons given by the Judge of the Court of Appeal.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) For granting bail.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes. Court of Appeal Judge Bandula Karunaratne, in his Order granting bail, has very specifically said that evidence had been fabricated. And those are the reasons why we are on the verge of losing the GSP Plus concessions.

Madam, the Government is getting its priorities mixed. That is why I told you that almost US Dollars 7.1 billion of export revenue from the Western world and the Middle-East is under some danger. Particularly, the European Union accounts for almost 31.6 per cent of our total export revenue. So, we are in danger of losing all this. As against this, the import bill that we pay to China is a staggering US Dollars 3.6 billion! So, we spend that amount on importing goods. While we export, we are importing from China; we are paying all this money to China and that is the reality.

Then, we depend on some friends and we antagonize other friends. We cannot carry on our Foreign Policy in this manner. We are going to totally become a pariah State, if we go on in this trajectory. So, there has to be a change and there has to be a course correction by the Government. This is what we are pleading or asking them to do: try and reform the way in which you are governing this country; try and ensure that minorities and religious minorities have their freedom. Certain poets who had written poems have been incarcerated for more than a year. There is Ahanaf Jazeem. He has been held in custody for almost a year for having written a poem and its translation does not reveal anything to do with terrorism. So, these are matters which have now been quoted by the European Union as reasons for them to withdraw the GSP Plus concessions, Madam.

So, the Government should not take this position like how the State Minister of Money and Capital Market and State Enterprise Reforms took in the morning saying, Let diplomacy be on one side, but let us look for an alternative for GSP Plus". What is the alternative? Some of the big exporters might find alternate ways. But, several medium and small-scale factories will have to close; all those people will be out of jobs. With this pandemic staring in our face and with all these problems, are we going to heap upon ourselves this economic catastrophe as well? So, in order to escape from this, there is no other option but to agree to reform ourselves. That is all what we are asking for. So, you have a course correction or at least realize your folly. You may have taken up quite an intransigent position before the Human Rights Commission. But, see the damning report by the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva the day before yesterday; that damning indictment is very clear.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member please wind up.

1325 1326

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) It talks about custodial death. How many people have been dying in custody? The police is taking a suspect to identify a scene of crime and suddenly, they say that the person tried to jump out of the police jeep and he was shot. The drug offenders are taken and shot in cold blood. All these things have now been recorded and this custodial death issue is seen as a serious issue. These are all human rights violations.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, we are running out of time. Please wind up now.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Seven people have died in custody. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes, seven people have died while in police custody within the last one year. So, this is a very serious matter. Therefore, all these have to be corrected if we are to save our country from losing the GSP Plus concessions and if not, that will finally result in a serious impact on the balance of payments debacle that we are facing.

Thank you.
