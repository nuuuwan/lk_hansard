Ali Sabry) I will explain that. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) All right. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) Hon. Member, Item No. 1 is the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill to amend the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979. In terms of that, we hope to introduce pre-trial procedure, but for us to do that, the Judicature Act has to be amended and we also have to appoint pre-trial judges. So, both those Bills have to be introduced simultaneously. Otherwise, if we introduce this Bill alone, this will become part of the law, but the judges will not be there. The other Bill is now being drafted by the Legal Draftsmans Department. We will introduce both Bills together in Parliament on the same day. So, we are not withdrawing Item No. 1, but actually postponing it.

Sir, Item No. 4 relates to some Regulations made under the Civil Procedure Code: the Civil Procedure (Costs) Regulations, 2021. Currently, the Civil Procedure (Costs) Regulations are governed by a Gazette published in 1997, which gives prescribed rates of bills of costs, whether between party and parties or between a registered attorney and client, to be taxed by the Registrar of the court.

The said Regulations, as provided under Section 214 read with Section 840 of the Civil Procedure Code (Chapter 101), have not been revised since 1997, are archaic and the costs are extremely low when compared to todays costs of litigation as the monetary value of the rupee has depreciated a great deal over time.

Therefore, I appointed an Advisory Committee to Review the Process of Service of Summons and the Writ of Execution under the Civil Law Reforms Committee of the Ministry of Justice to pay attention to this area and develop and provide a draft scheme of costs of litigation in a timely and a reasonable way. The Advisory Committee submitted a draft scheme of costs of litigation summarizing the basic steps followed in a case and calculating the costs for those steps in a timely and reasonable way. Having considered the proposed scheme of costs of litigation submitted by the said Committee, the proposal was sent to the Legal Draftsmans Department for finalizing the working draft and thereafter, we published the same in Gazette Extraordinary No. 2234/67 dated 02nd July, 2021.

The idea is, when taxing the costs in a civil matter, between client and clients and between client and a registered attorney, to bring the rates to the current level and to make it practical because we all know that from 1997 to the present, after almost 25 years, everything else has appreciated, but the value of the rupee has depreciated across the board. Accordingly, what we are trying to do is to tax the costs at a meaningful, practical amount suitable to the current level so that it will prevent frivolous litigation on the part of seasoned litigators who litigate for no reason, as a result of which genuine matters which have to be resolved in courts get delayed. So, we feel that this measure will ultimately address and support administration of justice in genuine cases of civil dispute.

Therefore, I expect the support of the House, of both sides of the divide, to get these two Bills and those Regulations passed.

Thank you very much. . . Question proposed.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Member, may I ask a question? ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Yes, Hon. Ponnambalam?

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Kiriella, if I may just ask you a question, why was your Government so frightened of a Referendum? I think because of the way the Presidency and its powers were used by the previous Government for ten years, after all, when your Government came into power, in fact, there was hope that there would be some fresh air into politics, where a lot of progressive amendments would be made. So, why did you not take the advantage and go before the people?

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, I wish to remind the Hon. Member that when the Draft went before the Supreme Court - 99 per cent of the powers of the President were given to the Prime Minister, Parliament and the Cabinet of Ministers - it was the Supreme Court which said that for these changes, you need a Referendum. There were so many changes and it was difficult to go for a Referendum on so many issues. If there was one issue, it was possible. But there were so many issues. So, that was the reason and it was a decision taken at the highest level.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) I will conclude, Sir.

So, ultimately, what we did was, we decided to do only the changes that were possible through Parliament. That is what really happened.

- - . . ; a multi-sector collaboration is essential here. And the point is, it is not just the legal reforms, Hon. Minister, but the implementation of these reforms which is incredibly important. . . .

. .

The regulations relating to that, the recruitment procedures and circulars affect on how these institutions function. You talked about the certified schools, the remand homes which are there for such children, but for many decades, people have been fighting to increase resources for those institutions because often, the children who are placed in those institutions face much greater problems than at the homes which send them to these institutions, in the first place.

So, I urge you, Hon. Minister, please look at this in a holistic manner, not as separate laws which are not connected to each other. And, also pay attention to the implementation of these laws because the implementation cannot happen just through legal reform, but by sufficient allocations for these instutions and their functioning as well as by having a complete review of the regulatory mechanism through which these institutions are expected to perform these functions.

I have been to many of these institutions and the situation of the children in these institutions is completely unacceptable. Also, there are huge delays in processing these cases. But much more than that, the treatment they undergo in these cases, where they are ostensibly sent for rehabilitation but are subject to further abuse because of lack of care and protection within those institutions, is a serious problem and that cannot be fixed by legal reform alone. This requires a much more wider, collaborative process, whereby child protection is understood in a holistic manner and where all the different elements of child protection are taken into consideration.

So, I urge you not to make these kinds of piecemeal reforms, but rather to look upon this in a holistic way as they are interconnected and also look into the implementation of these laws and the very serious inadequacies of these institutional structures.

[2.29 p.m.]

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, I thank you for allocating some time for me to speak on today's Debate, which the Hon. Minister of Justice has called for. In general, I would like to say that we are in agreement with the direction in which these Amendments have been suggested. I do not think there is an issue regarding that, but, Sir, since the Hon. Minister is present, I wish to make certain general points.

Firstly, if we take the way in which these Amendments have been brought in, they have been brought in, if I may say so, in a piecemeal way, Hon. Minister. We know, for example, that there is an Amendment being suggested to the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. We also know that there have been further Amendments tabled for the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. In fact, those Amendments, a few days ago, caused a lot of confusion; the people who are interested and who look at these Amendments quite carefully were thoroughly confused. In fact, the Opposition was also confused, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella is aware, that we had to scuttle through various legal procedures to find out which Amendments are being brought in and when. That sort of confusion is genuinely not good. It must be avoided because we all know that there is no judicial review in this country and we are given a slight window of only one week, during which we have to challenge whatever laws that are being brought in, and if we miss that one week, then, everything would be doomed.

So, under those circumstances, as the Hon. Minister and his Ministry know, when certain Amendments are brought in to the same law, I think it is only correct for those to be brought in together. Bringing this sort of piecemeal Amendments also run the danger of missing out not only those within the Code of Criminal Procedure, but even connected or related laws, and certainly, we, the people who are interested in contesting those laws, if in case those ought to be contested, with regard to their legality, too, run the risk of missing very important points. So, I want to make that as an initial point.

The second matter that I wish to raise is with regard to the Amendment to the Penal Code. With regard to the death penalty, I think the direction in which that Amendment is suggested is welcome, but the question is, why are we still not making a decision with regard to the death penalty itself? If I am not mistaken, since 1976, there has been a moratorium on the implementation of the death penalty. So, if we have been having a moratorium since then, I think it must be a settled matter, that we should do away with it and not keep it in our books and leave room, like the way during the previous Y ahapalana Government, for a President to suddenly decide that he would implement it and then, not implement it and cause utter confusion. I think the Hon. Minister of Justice should seriously consider doing away with it; it is a matter of good practice. In todays world, we all agree, the death penalty is not something that is going to deter crimes. There is no scientific basis for it and certainly, in Sri Lanka, there is no scientific basis whatsoever to suggest that the death penalty is a deterrence. So, on that basis, I think those amendments must seriously be considered.

The reality though, Sir, is that the fundamental question which concerns Sri Lankas judicial system is the question of impunity. If you have a justice system, the whole point of that justice system is to create conditions for justice, not to allow impunity. But, the tragedy is - I am not blaming just this Government, I am blaming all Governments, even the previous one - impunity is at its height. When you have a scenario where impunity is so high, so rampant and almost encouraged, certainly, all of these Amendments become meaningless, just mere window-dressing exercises. A good example is this. I raised a Question under Standing Order 27(2) with regard to an incident that took place in the Anuradhapura Prison and the Hon. Minister of Justice responded immediately, for which I am grateful to him. He mentioned as one out of the three proposed actions that the police - the CID - will conduct an investigation. To date, the CID has not gone there and recorded statements. So, this must be understood in its proper context.

When you have brought in the Twentieth Amendment, where checks and balances are done away with and which essentially politicizes the whole system, and when you allow the State Minister concerned, who is the accused party, to keep his Ministry except for that particular Ministry even after that incident took place, which we all know took place, what is the message that you are giving to the officials in the justice system? It is

1549 1550

that these people are untouchable. Even if they go and commit such acts, when everybody knows that they have commited those crimes, they are pardoned, the higher-ups do not take steps which ought to be taken. So, this is the culture of impunity that you are struggling against.

The Hon. Minister knows that if the PTA is amended according to international standards, all those PTA prisoners, even the convicted persons, would be released; not a single person can be kept in remand. If you are true and conscious, even the convicted would have to be released. The nature of the PTA, that draconian Act, is such that they have been kept there for years and years and all that we have been told when we called upon the respective Governments, not just this Government, to release those prisoners is, We will expedite the cases. We will make sure that the cases go to trial quicker and verdicts are given". You know, it never happened and will never happen. That is impunity. People against whom you do not have evidence are kept under remand, but the people aganst whom you have evidence, because they are on your side, are allowed to go scot-free. That is impunity and that is what is so rampant in this country. So, if you do not tackle that, no matter whatever amendments you bring in, they all would be meaningless, Hon. Minister; they would become irrelevant to the society and the society will take its own course and that is the danger to which this country is edging day by day.

I thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . .
