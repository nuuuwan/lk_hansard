But, the Government has gone the other way, making sure the industry does not go further from its mere position of survival.

The recent Budget also does not showcase the required support for this sector. Today, besides water, tea

is the most popular beverage in the world. To the US alone, the import of tea has risen by almost over 400 per cent since 1990. So, I think it would be futile if we do not utilize or capture this trend and reinstate Sri Lanka's position as the number one tea producer in the world.

However, Sir, the living standard and the working conditions of the estate workers are still a far cry from those enjoyed by others with necessities such as healthcare, education and housing still being luxuries for our people. With all the odds against them, the plantation workers have stood with others in challenging times with unparalleled commitment to the economy of our country. Though the export of tea is on the rise, that does not resonate the living condition of the workers. Even though the tea industry is one of the foundations of our economy, plantation workers often face exploitation.

Hon. Minister, I think you all are still dragging your feet in implementing a proper wage structure for the workers who contribute more than any other working class in the country. So, I think the demand for the minimum wage of Rs. 1,000 per day is more realistic now with the exchange rate - parity rate - increasing against the US Dollar. I think this will enable the plantation companies to utilize its extra cash flow to offset against the increased minimum wage.

Hon. Minister, I think this Mount Jean Estate does not come under your Ministry. If it has been under your Ministry, definitely this would not have been done. But, at the same time, they are destroying the tea estates and the tea industry as well.

The golden shareholder was the Secretary to the Treasury. When the Government handed over those 22 estates to the RPCs, the golden shareholder was the Secretary to the Treasury. In addition to that, in the Ministry of Plantation, there is a separate division called the Plantation Management Monitoring Division. Both the Secretary to the Treasury and the Plantation Management Monitoring Division, not during your period, the Hon. Minister, did not perform well. The Plantation Management Monitoring Division was created to monitor those plantation companies. But, they did not do that. In spite of that, I very openly say, they are doing some other business. For a very short period of time, I was the State Minister of Plantation Industries. That is how I learnt about it. So, they are doing some other business. Soon after they retire from the PMMD, they would become CEOs of those companies. That is the

853 854

situation. I can name them with evidence. So, the staff of the PMMD also join them and become part and parcel of the RPCs.

From time to time, the Governments that came to power brought amendments to strengthen the RPCs. Ultimately, the present situation is, when the Government, which had leased out the lands to those companies, asks for a land from them for any special purpose of development, they would lease out that land to the Government! This is the present situation; it is a very bad situation. Every Government which comes to power builds infrastructure such as housing - an Indian housing project is also going on - electricity supply and all that. When the estates were under the Government, the estate schools were managed by the estate management; the estate school teachers were paid by the estate management and even the doctors in the estate hospitals were paid by the estate management. But, now, purposely, everything has been completely abandoned, including the lands.

Those lands are being leased and subleased. The Watawala Plantations is no more now in the Hatton-Dickoya area. Originally, the Secretary to the Treasury signed an agreement with the Watawala Plantations. They have subleased it to the Hatton Plantations. Also, earlier, the area from Ratnapura to Labukele were leased out to the Mackwoods Company. Now, there is no Mackwoods Company and it comes under the Damro Company. So, those are under some other companies, which is illegal. Whenever an industrial dispute comes up, the workers go to the Commissioner General of Labour. But now, they are having problems because the chairman and the board of the original company to which the estate was legally handed over are not there, but there is some other company. As a result, all these things have been dragging on and ultimately, the entire industry, whatever you do in the interest of the workers and however much the Government invests in it, would be affected. There is no point in doing all that because they just lease and sublease the lands.

Sir, in my Electorate, there are 16 estates from Badulla to Passara and first, the Government leased them out to the John Keells, the John Keells subleased it to the Namunukula Plantations and then, the Namunukula Plantations subleased it to the Royal bottling company, which is owned by a Hungarian businessman. That businessman had mortgaged the entire land and property to Bank of Pakistan. I must say that I brought this matter to the notice of the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa during his regime and he immediately paid the necessary money through the Treasury and got the estates cleared. So, that is the situation.

Whereupon THE HON. SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. AJITH RAJAPAKSE took the Chair. () ( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Suren Raghavan) , , , , , , ,

The struggle of the Palestinian people for the right to self-determination as a sovereign State according to the borders of the United Nations of 1967 needs to be reiterated. For a long time, the PLO, the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, has undertaken to achieve national aspirations by negotiating in a peaceful manner with Israel, the other State. However, Israels refusal to halt illegal settlement activities is endangering this peace process. Therefore, I would like to ask this honourable House to stand by the Palestinian people, extend our solidarity and stand up for their legitimate right for a sovereign State so that we may have a peaceful Middle East and a peaceful world order. Palestinians meet all the legal requirement for a new State and the denial of that new State has created a vibrant anti-democratic movement in the entire Middle East, Sir.

The State of Palestine remains committed to a negotiated peaceful settlement or for the resolution of the conflict between its neighbour Israel and herself. It will also continue to cooperate with Israel in security and civil matters. It is very clear according to President Abbass recent statements. Palestinian people have an internationally recognized right to self-determination and sovereignty. The international community first confirmed that right of the Palestinian people decades ago, but they have still not achieved that.

In conclusion, I would like to say this. In the attempt to advance the cause of freedom, self-determination, independence and human rights of Palestine, the display of actions by both States in unavoidable, but should be avoided. The Palestinians are calling the international community to make good on its promises, which were made long ago. International law and the Palestinian people is the rationale for the Palestinians call for international recognition of their State and its admission to the United Nations as an equal, honourable State of the new world order.

Thank you.

[5.25 p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya - State Minister of Regional Co-operation) Hon. Presiding Member, at the outset, let me thank the Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan for bringing this timely Motion.

I think the Hon. Presiding Member knows that Sri Lanka joins the other nations in observing the International Day of Solidarity with Palestine People, which falls on 29th November every year. I remember, when I was in Belgrade this year to celebrate the 60th Anniversary of the NAM Conference, one of the topics which was prominently taken up was Palestine. It is also regrettable to note that 60 years ago, when the world leaders were meeting in Belgrade, the same topic was under discussion.

Sri Lanka has consistently supported the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and their right to an independent and sovereign State based on the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions. The Government of Sri Lanka supported the Resolution granting Palestine Non-Member Observer Status in the United Nations in 2012. Sri Lanka continues to support full membership for Palestine in the United Nations.

Since 1968, Sri Lanka, which has chaired the United Nations Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories, has been one of the most significant voices at the United Nations on the subject of the unfortunate conditions of the occupied territories.

Sri Lankas long-standing principled position on the Israel-Palestine issue is that we support the diplomatic efforts to find a lasting solution to the conflict and request both parties to engage in a dialogue to achieve durable peace. We believe that two States living side-by-side in harmony with one another within the secure borders is the key to achieving long-term security, peace and prosperity. Sri Lanka reiterates in this context the importance of an

early implementation of the United Nations General Assembly Resolutions regarding a two-State solution on the basis of the 1967 borders.

Sir, in line with the aforesaid position, we have supported Palestine at multilateral fora. For instance, at the WHO and the United Nations General Assembly, we have always supported Palestine. In 2011, Sri Lanka voted in favour of Palestine becoming a member of the UNESCO. Sri Lanka continues to support full membership of Palestine in the United Nations.

Sri Lanka has chaired the UN Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories, as I mentioned before, since 1968. And also, as you are aware, our Prime Minister has been the President of the Sri Lanka-Palestine Friendship Association for a considerable period of time, I think for over three decades. So, we are with the people of Palestine.

We hope that this issue of Palestine will not drag into another century and the world leaders will put enough pressure on the two States of Palestine and Israel to come to an agreeable settlement.

Thank you.
