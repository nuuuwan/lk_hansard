Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Madam Presiding Member, on the Final Report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Easter Sunday Attacks, I would like to say a few words because all I have seen over the last ten days is, different people accusing each other of who is responsible for the attacks. But, I did not hear anyone proposing anything as to how we could avoid such a situation in the future. So, as a young Member of Parliament, I would like to say a few things about what I have observed and about the things which had happened in the history so that we can avoid a situation like this, where innocent lives were lost,

happening ever again. It is really important that we ensure that it does not reoccur since the war has ended in Sri Lanka and one of the most important pillars in transitional justice is also to ensure that it does not reoccur; non-recurrence is important. So, first it is very important that we understand some incidents which had happened in the history.

It states, I quote:

During my political career I have discovered that in all communities, African, coloured, Indian and white, and in all political organizations without exceptions, there are good men and women who fervently wish to go on with their lives, who yearn for peace and stability, who want a decent income, good houses and to send their children to the best schools, who respect and want to maintain the social fabric of society.

Good leaders fully appreciate that the removal of tensions in society, of whatever nature, puts creative thinkers on centre stage by creating an ideal environment for men and women of vision to influence society. Extremists, on the other hand, thrive on tension and mutual suspicion. Clear thinking and good planning was never their weapon.

From around the end of 2017, Zaharan was in contact with one Abu Hind who was in India. Naufer also knew and communicated with Abu Hind. Zaharan told Hadiya that Abu Hind has links to Syria. They used to speak in Tamil using threema and telegram apps.

"On 10th October, 2018, Zaharan issued a letter on his facebook account claiming that a person called Pakkam Bin Abu who maintains a facebook account by that name is in reality an informant of the Indian intelligence although he publishes material justifying the IS ideology.

It further states, I quote:

In response Pakkam Bin Abu has on 11th October, 2018 claimed that Zaharan was an agent of Israel intelligence and that although he tries to project himself as a hero by attracting youth towards the IS ideology, he is in fact equal to a lady.

This is what is mentioned here. These are all referred to in the Report. These matters have been overlooked by these people, these forces. . . , . . , " " . , Is your source a wiretap? . , . , No, it is a live source . , source , - live source - , . , ? .

It is definitely an interpolation not related to any other training camps that have been conducted by Zaharan. I must say very clearly that Zaharans training camps and all the incidents connected to this had been properly examined and had been included in this Report.

But, the Report also goes on to deal with other issues which have serious implications, particularly to individuals. Prof. Lukman Thalib . . , declined the allegations made against him and his son as baseless, scandalous and defamatory. The statement added, Prof. Thalib and his son have no relation with violence or terror groups or with any other plots that have taken place. Our client's fundamental rights, reputation and honour have been violated and his safety has been placed at risk. , . , Prof. Lukman Thalib ? He was acting against the blockade of Gaza. His son and grandchildren, his family, were partaking in MV Mavi Marmara invasion in to Gaza Strip. Therefore, the Israelis want to somehow frame him. That is why this has happened. They have been bringing that into this issue and of course, they might try to connect up various other details also.

Hon. Presiding Member, I must also refer to the naming of Islamic scholars as extremists, which is a very baseless, unnecessary exercise by this Commission. An article by Mr. M.M. Zuhair, former Member of Parliament and Presidents Counsel, and a few others in the "DailyFT of 5th April, 2021 states, I quote:

The Commission on Easter Sunday attacks has named a number of Islamic scholars of international repute as extremist preachers and extremists. The Commission has failed to define extremism or to provide in its report a single instance of extremism..

Further, it states,

The Commission has failed to quote from the writings of the scholars themselves or from any of their original works. . the Commission has relied on hearsay and third party anti-Islamic sources, some of whom are proxies of the US and NATO countries, at war with Islam since 1990. .. the Commissions edict on Islamic scholars, most of whom are no longer living, is not acceptable because they are judgmental without any reasonable evidence. These scholars have nothing to do with the 21/4 attacks.

Similarly, there is an attempt to frame Hajjul Akbar. He is an Ameer of the Jamaat-e-Islami Movement here. Now, they are trying to proscribe that entire Movement. I see no reason to do that. But, they are trying to frame him as if he was preaching extremism because there are several schools of thought in Islam. Moulana Abul A'la Maududi, who was the main architect of the Jamaat-e-Islami Movement, is a scholar of repute and has also interpreted Islam as a religion which is very tolerant and peace-loving, and there are several ideologies like this. Moulana Abul Ala Maududi is one. Then, Yusuf Al-Quradawi is another. He is also one of the foremost thinkers of the current era. All these people are being blamed and labelled as extremists. Particularly, Yusuf Al-Quradawi is a big problem for Israel because he had, at one time, justified suicide terrorism against Israel. What he said was this. If a Palestinian resorts to attack by suicide because of the atrocities in the occupied territories of Palestine, he justified it. Then, you look at the Sri Lankan scenario.

. , . . , . , , . . .

, , . . , . 2019 26 . So, he was part of the military intelligence. There is one other person in custody who had been training people in all these training camps. , ? ;

. , around 2006, Milhan made contacts with Razik Mohamed Faiz aka "Police Faiz" who was, at that time, working as an intelligence agent of the Sri Lanka Army in the fight against the LTTE. During that period, Muslim youth were being recruited as intelligence agents due to their proficiency in Tamil. Thereafter, Milhan worked with "Police Faiz" as an intelligence agent of the Sri Lanka Army and this is the very person whom Zaharan used to give weapons training in these training camps.

There he says, 'Accordingly, the AG has informed Inspector General (IGP) C.D. Wickramaratne to expand criminal investigations into Abu Hind, Ahamed Thalib Lukman Thalib, his son Lukman Thalib Ahamed aka Abu Abdulla, Rimsan and Mahendran Pulasthini alias Sara'.

There are very good things in the Report; there is a very deep analysis of various matters. I have my respect for these Commissioners. I appeared before them. There was an attempt to even frame me in some way or the other. So, finally, when you look at the Report, you see that there are so many positive things. But, of course, there are certain areas where they have just misguided themselves on hearsay evidence. That should be avoided. That is important. I need to mention that because hearsay evidence is something that needs to be avoided in the matters of this nature because it is unfortunate. - hearsay evidence - . , . . , , . . , . ( ) (The Hon.

Hon. Presiding Member, we are living in an era of dilemma, unspeakable horrors and an era where extremism has rendered us all hostages; this is an era of extreme confusion. We have looked to our allies for peace and some amongst them have looked back at us as villains instead of victims of a global conspiracy. Our allies in peace have forgotten that we stood with them even in the face of adversity.

Sir, I wish to table* this book titled "The Muslims of Sri Lanka; One Thousand Years of Ethnic Harmony, 900-1915" by Dr. Lorna Dewaraja first published in 1994.

This book outlines over 1,000 years of peaceful coexistence of ours. Our ancestors came here as traders. The Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into and Report or Take Necessary Action on the Bomb Attacks on 21st April, 2019 states that the first traders came here in about the 7th Century AD and this book also establishes the mutually beneficial relationship that the Muslims shared with the Sinhala community of Sri Lanka, which laid the foundation for racial and religious amity. The Muslim traders brought enormous assets and the Sinhala monarchs of the time offered protection and permitted them to settle. Since then, we have remained in amity and sought to make our investments here in Sri Lanka.

1327 1328

This is our motherland. Our assets and finances remain in Sri Lanka. We did not plunder this country like the Dutch, the Portuguese and the British. The Sinhalese, the Tamils and the Christians are our brothers in our quest to serve our Mother Lanka and nobody can or should take that right away from us. When the Muslims were demanded to support the LTTE or else be evicted from the North, we, the Muslims of Sri Lanka, chose to lose our homes and our belongings to be loyal to our motherland. We gave up our assets and our livelihoods to live as refugees. I was also one of those evicted by the LTTE. We earned the wrath of the LTTE because we chose our motherland over our own lives.

We have lived with you and among you as one of you. We have loved each other, protected each other, shared in the spoils of the war and celebrated our victory over separatism. We, the Muslims, never asked to be regarded separately. We only asked to be given the right to live as Sri Lankans and as Muslims.

I must admit that there were extremist elements who exploited the name of Islam and caused turmoil. The terrorists behind the Easter Sunday attacks are not Muslims. They are terrorists who hijacked the name of Islam for their own sinister agendas. I am not here to defend them. I cannot and will not defend or support any terrorist even if my life is on the line. I am here to tell you that we, the Muslim community, will stand with you today and forever against any and all forms of terrorism and violent extremism.

Today is the fifth day of the Adjournment Debate on the Final Report of the Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into and Report or Take Necessary Action on the Bomb Attacks on 21st April, 2019. The Parliamentary Select Committee appointed by the then Speaker and the Presidential Commission of Inquiry appointed by the then President have both exonerated me from all of the crass allegations falsely linking me with those terrorists. Ever since the Easter Sunday attacks, the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa has been making controversial statements at my expense. He said that I was in contact with Zahran even when there is no evidence. My brother or I had never known or met Zahran in our lives. He made this statement in a programme named "Islam Anthavaadaya - Paasku Komisamen Obbata" in February this year. His

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

entire speech during the programme provoked both the Muslim and Sinhala youths. He [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

incited racism and religious bigotry.

I asked the CID to inquire into that programme. I have formally submitted a complaint, but nothing has happened

so far. The Presidential Commission does not mention anything as such. So, that is what has to be stopped.

In page 331, the Commission Report states, I quote:

"Reciprocal radicalization is the cycle of radicalization which promotes each other's radicalized ideologies."

Sir, I would say that if the Government can keep their own Representatives like the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa in check and prevent them from inciting racism, the de-radicalization programme will be half-completed.

He even made allegations against a renowned Government entity, claiming that Sathosa vehicles have been used to transport Zahran, which is now proven to be just words to mislead the public for his political motives. I am challenging him as a Minister in the current Government to prove those allegations he made with facts and figures.

The Report only refers to me in respect of two allegations. One is regarding the sale of scrap metal from the IDB, which was under my Ministry at that time, to Colossus (Pvt.) Ltd. Here too, the Commission has not made any findings but states that that is a matter to be taken up by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. I plan to visit that Commission tomorrow, Insha Allah, and ask them to inquire into this immediately because I want to prove without doubt that I have no involvement with these terrorists.

Secondly, the Report of the Commission of Inquiry has referred to a call I made to the then Army Commander General Mahesh Senanayake. That call was only to inquire whether Ihsan Moinudeen was in custody of the law enforcement authorities. His father, who is a Special Grade - Class I - SLAS officer and an Additional Secretary to a Ministry, is known to me and he called me as a concerned parent. He not only called me, but also wrote to the then President and the media about the abduction of his son. First, I called the OIC of the Dehiwala Police and then, SSP Wickremasinghe of the Dehiwala Division, who responded saying that Moinudeen had not been arrested by the police and suggested me to check with the Army.

Then, I called General Mahesh Senanayake to make inquiries about that person and he said he was not aware of him and that he would try to find out. I called him for the second time to find out if progress was made and again, he said he could not check that yet. When I called him for the third time, he told me that Ihsan was in their custody and that was the end of it. For the information of this House, I table* the affidavit with all relevant documents and evidence which I had submitted to the Commission.

People seem to perceive this phone call to the then Army Commander very negatively. I ask them, what is wrong in what I did? It is the right of every citizen in this country to make inquiries from the law enforcement authorities in this country. I am an elected Representative; I am a Representative of the people and it is my obligation to make inquiries in these times on behalf of them.

Sir, the Commission Report, in page 395, also makes reference to a call made by State Minister Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara.

He intervened on behalf of six people who were arrested by the Bingiriya Police and brought to the Hettipola Police Station. He even got permission from the DIG, Kurunegala to have them released on police bail and transported them in his vehicle. Those were people arrested for torching and destroying the Muslim-owned shops and Muslim places of worship. They attacked innocent Muslims. This is in the Commission Report. But, no action against him has been recommended by the Commission. Why? I wish to clearly mention that such people are also extremists.

But, what did I do? I made legitimate inquiries about the whereabouts of a missing person, whose father was serving the State in a high position. Over 2,000 Muslims were arrested over the Easter Sunday attacks. But, he was the only person regarding whom I made inquiries. Why? It was because he was kidnapped. Therefore, making inquiries about a missing person is a legitimate right that any citizen is entitled to exercise.

The fake news media say that I was trying to influence the then Army Commander. I am tabling* here the video clip and other evidence of the testimony of retired General Mahesh Senanayake, where he admits that I never influenced.

That is a preposterous allegation. Have some humanity. I ask the parents who are listening, how would you feel if your child was kidnapped? Imagine the plight of the father of that child. Would you not have acted in the same manner? I just made inquiries about him and the media went into a frenzy. But here, in the case of the Hon.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

an elected Representative against whom I have nothing personal, he was not just making inquiries, but also intervening on behalf of criminals of non-bailable offences, securing sureties and securing their release. From this, we can learn that justice was not meted out evenly. I wish to ask all concerned parties, why was

greater weight placed on my call to the then Army Commander over and above the actions of the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara?

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

Is it because I am a Muslim? If so, is it not discrimination?

The Report also identifies that several Local Government Members were instigating violence. The Report points out that the police did nothing to stop those mobs. Apparently, they did not have the strength. Those attacks were anticipated. Curfew was in motion. It is the duty of the law enforcement authorities to enforce the law. They were aware of the situation and did not reinforce security in the areas. They allowed the mobs to create unrest at will. This was willfully executed against a religious minority in this country. However, not enough action has been taken till now. If my call to the then Army Commander had received such prominence, why are such strong matters just limited to a few paragraphs in the Report, I must ask.

The Report reveals several incidents of post-Easter Sunday violence. There were 78 incidents in Minuwangoda, 37 incidents in Kuliyapitiya, 200 incidents in Hettipola, nine incidents in Chilaw, 47 incidents in Koswatta, 67 incidents in Nikaweratiya, 55 incidents in Negombo and many more incidents against the Muslims. Sir, if you look at the involvement of some of these Local Government Members and the non-involvement of the law enforcement authorities, it definitely seems like State-sponsored oppression against minorities. Fouzul Ameer Mohamed Sally of Kottramulla, a poor man, lost his life in front of these criminals, these extremists and in front of his children. In any other country, this would be reported as genocide and all the inflammatory speeches would be branded as incitement to genocide under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. I wish to table* the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide before this House.

The State has allowed the killing of Muslims; the State has allowed bodily harm to Muslims; the State has now begun imposing conditions that threaten the physical destruction of Muslims. This is genocide under Article 2 of the Convention. Do not forget that we are now a party to the Rome Statue and we are accountable for our actions and omissions.

In view of these incidents, I must once again extend my sincerest gratitude to His Eminence Cardinal Malcom Ranjith. In the wake of an outbreak of post-Easter Sunday violence, he effectively managed to limit the damage. His actions were exemplary of the virtues of the faith of the Catholics.

Then, I would like to make reference to certain points made in the Report. In page 145, the Report states that 17 video recordings were made by Zahran and his group. In those videos, he gives 10 reasons why Sri Lanka was chosen for the attack. I call upon all Hon. Members of the House to pay full attention to some of those following points:

1. Defaming and insulting Allah.

2. An incident in Kuliyapitiya where an image of a pig was shown with "Allah" written on it.

3. Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thero insinuating that Allah will be reborn.

4. Scolding and defaming Prophet Muhammad, Sallallahu Alaihiwasallam.

5. Tearing and burning of the Quran.

6. Destruction of mosques.

7. Destroying Muslim houses and forcible land grabs.

8. Rape of a Muslim woman by intelligence officials and its cover-up.

So, I would like to ask, who is to take responsibility for those actions? Is it the Muslims or the State? Incidents that had never happened in thousand years have happened in 10 years soon after the end of the LTTE war. It is not the Muslims, but certain extremist elements that provoked the sentiments of the Muslims and more importantly, the Governments allowed those elements to operate freely. His Eminence Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith addressed the people in Kottampitiya and publicly stated that it was not the Muslim community who was at fault. He identifies that an external hand was involved. I also feel the same. Therefore, I urge the authorities to identify and bring to book this external hand regardless of its religion, stature or political position.

Sir, we must understand that such extremists gain power at the expense of our failures to protect our people. When people are dejected by the fact that their Government is not interested in protecting them, they are likely to develop animosity and anger towards the Government. They are likely to join hands with people who are ready to oppose the Government at any cost because they lose hope that the Government would protect them. This is the normal reaction of any human being. We do not, however, justify any form of violence. If you antagonize repeatedly an entire community for the crimes of a few, you will note their lack of willingness to stand by you. Eventually, they will get more and more radicalized and stand against you. It is not that we have not seen this before, but we have not learned from those mistakes.

Look at the history of the ethnic conflict with the LTTE. The 1956 "Sinhala Only Act was instrumental in creating anger among the Tamils. Further actions including the burning of the Jaffna Library triggered their emotions and then, the war had become inevitable. The controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act was used more often ruthlessly. It was brought as a temporary Act. The

then Government thought that armed with the PTA, they could finish off opposition in two years. But, what happened? The abuse of the PTA and other oppressive tactics dragged the war for 30 years. But, the problems that led to the war still remain unresolved. The UNHRC has demanded the repeal of the PTA. The Government should not repeat the same mistakes now against the Muslims. Thereafter, you will anger the Muslim countries that stood with us in our adversities. If we had learned from these mistakes, we would not have permitted the extremist actions against innocent Muslims. We can still be hopeful. The Muslims are peace-loving people. Long before the attacks, the Muslims warned the Government. In the aftermath of the Easter Sunday attack, the Muslims helped the armed forces track down the terrorists and neutralize them. The Muslims are on the side of the nation. Do not push us away; do not compel us to give up our religion.

The vast majority of Sri Lankans chose to side with the State because it is our faith that has taught us to side with the nation; it is our faith that taught us that Zahran and his group were wrong; it is our faith that taught us to expose his group of extremists. A very good example was the incident which took place in Sainthamaruthu on 26th April, 2019 following the Easter Sunday attacks, where a Muslim family gave information to the security forces on the whereabouts of Zahrans family. We, the Muslims, do not consider Zahran as a Muslim; they are terrorists. They have tried to force your hand; they want you to make mistakes. The Commission Report, in page 94, confirms that Zahran wanted to build tension between the Muslims and the Sinhalese of this country. Therefore, it is imperative that you act wisely. Do not play to his tunes; do not compromise national harmony. In the name of national security, do not take actions that would jeopardize that very national security.

The process of State-sponsored discrimination has already commenced. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Rishad Bathiudeen) Sir, please give me some more time. I think I can speak till 4.30 p.m.

For example, a notice signed under the hand of the Deputy Director of Customs dated 05th of March, 2021 states that any Islamic religious books brought into the country should only be released upon the approval of the Ministry of Defence. There is also a word from the Minister of Public Security that Madrasas are to be banned. As a Member of the Muslim community, I am offended and so are my people. These are acts of discrimination, and particularly a violation of the right of the Muslims to manifest their religion.

The Minister of Public Security also informs that there will be a burqa ban. People are mandated to wear

1333 1334

masks all over the country and all over the world. You cannot make a description under any Act to ban the burqa and niqab unless you also ban the medical mask, the motorcycle helmet, sunglasses, spectacles, bandages and so many other pieces of garments. I wish to ask the Minister, how do you constitutionally make such a law? How do you make a law with such effect without making it racist and Islamophobic?

We, as minorities of this country, are all entitled to our Constitutional right to practise and manifest our religion freely in this country. Any legislation or administrative action targeting one particular community is a violation of our Constitution. It is also in violation of every known core convention and treaty ratified by Sri Lanka. No monitoring body of any of these treaties, let alone the UNHRC, is going to spare our country for acting so arbitrarily against the Muslim community. This is extremism in another form; this is oppression. We, the peace-loving people of this country, will not stand for extremism and will most definitely not stand for discrimination, even if it is endorsed by the State.

The Commission Report will hold good testimony that other groups have engaged in extremist activity. The activities of Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara have been highlighted for the term he coined Aba Saranai. And the Report also calls for the proscription of the Bodu Bala Sena. Further in page 332 of this Commission Report, the Attorney-General considers instituting criminal proceedings against him under the ICCPR Act for his speeches made during the Maharagama and Aluthgama incidents. They have also highlighted organizations such as Sinhala Ravaya, Mahason Balakaya, Sinhala Jathika Balamuluwa, Sinhale Jathika Sanvidanaya and the Siva Senai Movement. It is not me who is presuming their extremist nature, but the Commission Report serves as my evidence. The actions of these extremists began in 2011 and owing to impunity, the extremism grew. If not for impunity of these extremist thugs, the Easter Sunday attacks would have been unlikely to have happened. Where do you believe their extremist nature comes from? Over and above the Commission Report, there is plenty of videographic evidence of their extremism. What measures do you propose to quell the extremism in these factions? At least, will you de-radicalize them first?

Hon. Presiding Member, I draw your attention to the arrest of Muslims who have been very vocal against the acts of Zahran. It has been about 22 days since Azath Salley was arrested. I must remind you that it was he who publicly stated in 2017 that Zahran was a dangerous criminal who needs to be arrested. Yet, the Government has arrested Mr. Salley under the Prevention of Terrorism Act for alleged connections to the Easter Sunday attacks. How could this be fair? You are holding him without a charge only because he spoke on behalf of the Muslim community. This is political victimization. Another distinguished personality who has actively contributed towards the upkeep of human rights, Hejaaz Hizbullah, Attorney-at-Law, has also been arrested under the PTA. Ahnaf Jazeem from Pandaraweli, Mannar was arrested for

writing a poem against the ISIS. He was arrested on April 15th last year and continues to be detained with no charges against him simply because he wrote a poem against the ISIS.

Under the pretext of national security, you have oppressed the Muslims. I am afraid their frustrations from your actions may lead to radicalization. You must arrest the extremists who have harmed or will harm our people. But whether you arrest the extremists or not, you are definitely arresting innocent people who are speaking against extremism. There is another word for this - oppression!

The countrys policies must not be biased against the whole Muslim community. This is not what is intended through the One Country-One Law policy. In no country are there different sets of laws applicable to different segments of the society other than in confederate States. Even in federal countries such as America, all laws, whether federal or state, including State Constitutions are in conformity with the Federal Constitution. In Sri Lanka too, there is only one Constitution which provides for enactment of provincial statutes containing different clauses. Yet, so long as they are in consistent with the provisions of the Constitution, they fall within the concept of One Country-One Law. What is understandably alluded to as One Country-One Law in Sri Lanka is the targeted elimination of the personal laws, particularly the Muslim Personal Law. The Constitution has guaranteed the freedom of religion, culture et cetera in Articles 10, 14 and 9. Personal laws mean laws personal to specific communities. The Buddhist, Hindu, Christian and Islamic communities have laws personal to them. They are relating either to their religions or their cultures which, in no way, infringe on the rights of others. In the first place, if you are to do away with personal laws, then all these laws have to be removed from the statute book.

Be that as it may, if you take marriages for instance, marriages need not be registered under any law. If the girl reaches the age of 16, she can live with anyone she wishes even without formalizing the union in any manner, whether legal or cultural, under the Sri Lankan law. In Sri Lanka, there are hundreds of elderly couples who have not got their marriages registered, particularly in the hill-country and Jaffna. What the laws relating to marriages do is that they give extra protection to the union of the couple. That is all. Since the Constitution guarantees their freedom of religion and culture, the personal laws give a legal cover to the enjoyment of such freedom. In what way can they be construed as different laws?

What is surreptitiously clothed in the slogan One Country-One Law is to call for assimilation, which is an antithesis of integration. Assimilation is to deny diversity and expect everyone to follow one culture and one way of life, which is not possible in any part of the world. Integration is to call for unity whilst recognizing the diversity. The Preamble of our Constitution has recognized this diversity by employing the word Peoples in itself. I call upon everyone to understand the

1335 1336

[ ]

2021 07

difference between assimilation and integration, on the one hand, and on the other, the fact that the existence of personal laws is not inconsistent with the concept of One Country-One Law. So, please do not hurt the sentiments of all the Muslims because it can only marginalize the Muslim community even more. We have lived in peace practising these customs and traditions in marriage for over 800 years. It has never become a problem to any person. So, do not try to abolish our customs and traditions. It will not be a positive step towards de-radicalization.

Talking of de-radicalization, a Gazette was published on 12th March, 2021 with reference to a proposed rehabilitation and de-radicalization programme. We cannot accept that. That is focusing only on the Muslims and not on the country. I am sure the majority of the monks in Sri Lanka are peace-loving people who truly believe in the four immeasurables: "Metta", "Karuna", "Mudita" and "Upekkha". Many of these monks tend to disagree with the violent ways of some of these extremists and I am certain they will be willing to assist in the process of rehabilitation and de-radicalization of the extremists amongst them.

Hon. Presiding Member, actually I have some more to say. I am tabling* my full speech with all these documents including the book "Proceedings of ACJU against ISIS and Extremism". Actually, the ACJU worked hard to guide our community against criminals like Zahran. I think they did a lot of activities and there are 34 such actions that have been taken.
