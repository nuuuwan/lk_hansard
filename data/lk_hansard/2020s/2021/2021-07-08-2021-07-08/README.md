We have not accepted their input or the amendment suggested, but I stand by my speech and also stand by the Statute. Let the court decide what I meant. That is how the law works.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Sumanthiran, what is it? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir. It is just one word on this issue. I am thankful that the Minister of Justice says that he stands by what he said. But in interpreting, only in Constitutional interpretation, debates in Parliament can be taken as relevant. On other matters, debates in Parliament cannot be taken as relevant. So, your speech would not be relevant. That is why we wanted that clarification. You have to make that clarification in the Act itself.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) The calrification has been done; he has clarified what is required to be done. What more do you need?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) We have brought a Statue and there was a suggestion from the Hon. Member from the Opposition. He is entitled to that. Similarly, as the Government, we are also entitled to accept it or not. We have not accepted it. So, the matter ends there. Thereafter, it is not a matter for any sort of ruling.

attempt at creating anarchy. I repeat, these are all anarchist ideas. They first agree and then, we also agree. Adjournment Debates . You go through the original decisions taken on the Adjournment Debate. We have given those. And also to facilitate, we have done this so that the Adjournment Debate will not be postponed. But, if you all want to, we can postpone it. If you do not want to have the Adjournment Debate tomorrow, you can take it up at the next Party Leaders' Meeting, where the Minutes are going to be challenged. Sir, if the Minutes are going to be challenged in this manner, it is very irresponsible because you chair this Committee. We had not challenged the Minutes when they were unfavourable to us. No.

Sir, I was also at the Meeting of the Committee on Parliamentary Business. I am thankful that the Leader of the House confirmed that this issue was originally raised by the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayaka. It was his request to have an Adjournment Debate on that. It was only the fixing of the date that happened at the last Meeting. So, it has to be in the name of the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayaka. That is the understanding reached at the Party Leaders' Meeting and that must be what that should be implemented because as the Leader of the House correctly said, at the previous Meeting, it was recorded that the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayaka requested for an Adjournment Debate. At the next Meeting, we only fixed the date. So, there is no question as to who moves the Adjournment Motion; it has to be the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayaka. That is the decision taken at the Meeting of the Committee on Parliamentary Business.

Thank you.

Labour Minister of Lebanon assisted to obtain amnesty for visa overstayers, enabling them to leave. The Government of Sri Lanka arranged five evacuation flights and however, those who want to leave are few. They registered to leave out, but when the flight is announced, they decline or say that they will leave later.

, UGC .

Madam Presiding Member, in conclusion, I want to say a few words quickly in English. The KDA was set up in 1981 by the UNP Government on a land gifted by our former Prime Minister Sir John Kotelawala to provide education for those wishing to join the Sri Lankan armed forces. Though he had never said it, I am sure that Sir John Kotelawala would have looked at places like West Point, seen the Military Academy there and thought that for the military, a special training is needed, which cannot be given in civilian universities. Therefore, that dream he had, we want to take forward .

But, we are cautious about this particular Bill for several reasons. The students intending to serve in uniform need a specialized education and they would not get it in non-military institutions. So, we want to strengthen the intentions of the donor. The number of graduates produced by the Defence University in a particular field is going to be limited. For example, in the past year or so, I was told that there were 40 medical students while there was only one student to follow a course in law. That will differ from year to year, but the actual issue is that it is going to be limited. So, that problem is there. Therefore, it makes no sense to expand the intake beyond the requirements of the military, in that sense.

We are not opposed to the principle of the Defence University, but we are opposed to the Bill for three reasons. The self-regulator and the supplier cannot be the same. That is why the UGC needs to be brought in to its education; regulations should be distinctly different. The Defence University does not solve the lack of space for higher education, one of our biggest issues stifling progress. We need to increase the quality of the supply of education in this country. We do not want to compel parents to send their children overseas, not just because the country is losing foreign exchange, but also because they are doing it with some discomfort. We do not want to limit the intellectual freedom of the civilian students engaged in higher education as that is a threat to their personal development. So, to develop a holistic education, an environment of freedom and intellectual space is needed. We need to have checks and balances for the long-term quality of the KNDU and we feel that it is not being achieved through this Bill.

The KNDU would be serving non-military students and therefore, it must be regulated by the UGC. Sri Lanka has been facing lack of opportunities for higher education for a long time. I am happy to see that the SLPP is thinking of liberalizing this space across the barriers in Parliament; whether we are in the Government or in the Opposition, this is something we must get together and do. We must not do what we did to SAITM. I feel sorry when I think about the late Dr. Neville Fernando, who proposed it. The Members of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party brought that Bill, we supported it and they encouraged it.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. Please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I am going to wind up, Madam.

Ultimately, when they went to the Opposition, they actually destroyed that opportunity. So, there are many suppliers: government, non-government and non-profit suppliers. Some of the world's most reputed universities are non-profit and non-government universities. A model needs to be considered. I hope the Government will create the space for that by bringing in a Bill. Alternative models of education must not ignore social justice. If somebody is going to study somewhere, irrespective of whether it is a government or a non-government university, those students, based on their affordability, must be given grants and loans. That is the way forward for Sri Lanka.

In conclusion, I must say that the SJB is not opposed to the Defence University, but we are opposed to the Bill in its current form and we will move amendments to make the University more accountable to the UGC. Thank you, Madam, for the time given.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , .

() .. ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Madam, I might take four more minutes. , . , . . , , . . , . , , . , . , .

It is a delicate balance. Like in most things in life, one has to strike a balance.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) What about SAITM?

() .. ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) No, there is a history to that. That is very complicated. We should not let this institution go the same way.

So, let us bear in mind the distinct and separate objectives of the General Sir John Kotelawala National Defence University. Those who have served the military with distinction in this country, like the Hon. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, I am sure will agree that the identity of that University needs to be preserved. It should not be diluted. It cannot be conceived of and implemented in the same mould as a traditional university. In that case,

it would become superfluous and redundant. If it is to enrich the university system of this country and to make a worthwhile contribution, then it must maintain its separate identity. That does not mean that it can act in an arbitrary or capricious manner. It must function at all times subject to the supervision, the control of the University Grants Commission, which is responsible for the maintenance of proper standards in all institutions of higher learning in this country.

It is my respectful submission that a certain degree of control and supervision is already provided for in the provisions of the Bill that was presented to this House by my distinguished Colleague, the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa. But if the House believes that that degree of control is inadequate and it needs to be buttressed and reinforced, not only the Opposition but the Government will also be introducing a series of amendments.

Therefore, Madam Presiding Member, I would suggest that we continue this Debate on a subsequent occasion. Let us give our minds to the contents of the amendments that will be placed before the House both by the Government and by the Opposition and then make an informed and considered judgement whether the right balance has been struck in relation to the objectives of the General Sir John Kotelawala National Defence University .

Commission and a representative of the General Treasury nominated by the Secretary to the General Treasury.

I think the Hon. Minister mentioned something about a purview of the Treasury. I think there is only one person to observe this. But the interesting part is that the quorum for a meeting of the Board of Governors is five. So, naturally, these meetings could be held without any of these nominees from the Treasury or the University Grants Commission because the quorum is only five.

Instead of coming up with these Defence Universities and all sorts of things to give your friends PhDs, what you all should do is to adopt a mechanism where more people can have access to education. Look at countries like Australia. There, there is a loan system called, HECS from which students can get loans for their studies. So, that way, we can improve our university system. Those who earn above a certain income will have to repay the amount that cost for their education. The others do not have to pay. So, we have to look at more progressive ideas like this rather than coming up with silly ideas to bring the higher education system also under the Ministry of Defence.

[3.41 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, whilst listening to the speeches made by the Hon. Members of the Government and also the Hon. Members from the Opposition, I could not help wondering whether the Government Benches have the same Bill as that of the Opposition because there is a total disconnect with regard to the arguments that they are putting forward.

Sir, my understanding of a university is, one of freethinking. You must encourage freethinking, freedom of thought, freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. The fact that you can almost push for the limits to explore ideas is what is crucial in bringing about change, and it is through change that you progress. I think that is the ideal university. People's thoughts that I might not respect must have a place; their arguments must also be gone into and eventually, it is the society that must decide which avenue it wants to pursue.

1861 1862

But, can that sort of culture, in fact, be incorporated into a university, an academy or any higher institution of learning that is specifically targeting the military? We all know that the military's training, their thought processes are completely different. Normal universities, in fact, do not have military-related studies. Those are kept aside for very specialized institutions and those institutions that cater to the military have a certain conduct which does not permit the sort of freethinking that is encouraged normally in universities. I do not think, in Sri Lanka, you have any university that encourages that sort of freethinking, but certainly, you cannot expect that sort of freethinking within the military because the whole purpose of the military and its whole culture are the complete opposite to what we want to see in a fairly good, progressive university culture. So, it is for that purpose that military universities or academies are created as special-purpose institutions.

The General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University, under this Bill that is being contemplated, is, in fact, going to expand its purpose to bring in ordinary citizens and students who do not even want a job in the military, who are not even going to pursue a career in the military within that ethos of a military institution. That, Sir, is militarization of society; there is no other word for it. You want to bring ordinary members of the society who want to pursue ordinary jobs into an institution that is essentially military in thinking and outlook so that you could indoctrinate them into a particular purpose and let them out in to the society in order that the society itself ceases to be vibrant and, in fact, does the complete opposite and becomes subservient to a dictatorship. That can be the only justification for wanting to expand the scope of what is essentially a military institution to incorporate civilians and civilian learnings.

This is not something that is surprising, Sir. I, in fact, want to dedicate the rest of my comments to a phrase that I actually used during the Committee Stage Discussion of the last Budget on the Votes of the Ministry of Defence. I said that what is happening in this country is what happened to the Tamils yesterday and what is happening to the Muslims today will happen to the Sinhalese tomorrow. I made that comment knowing fully well that this Government is, in fact, going to militarize the society; that is why I made those comments on the Votes of the Ministry of Defence.

If you take the North and the East, Sir, we have a situation where, as you know, after the end of the war, the economy of the people of the North and the East was completely smashed. People could not make ends meet; they had lost everything. The Government did not choose to protect the very vulnerable economies of the people, but instead, they just basically opened up the North and the East to the rest of the country to come and compete and people just could not compete. They were forced to take loans that they could not repay because they did not have the expertise to compete with the rest of the country. At the same time, what the Government did was, they opened up the Civil Security Department - CSD - established on the 13th of September, 2006 to essentially former LTTE cadres and the highly vulnerable members

of the civilian population of the North and the East, incorporating them into that Department to serve in military-run farms and to serve as preschool teachers. Those ordinary people, who just could not afford a living, had no choice. So, you pauperize them on the one hand, and then on the other, you offer them military-run institutions, giving pays up to Rs. 30,000 a month, which is almost five times a preschool teacher in the North and the East can possibly afford to earn. Therefore, you pauperize the most vulnerable sections of the society and then the military itself runs farms and employs preschool teachers for five times the salary that is available outside or even in private institutions and you co-opt them into the military. All these personnel are forced to take military training, and it becomes a militarized society, a society that becomes subservient to what is essentially an expanded intelligence community. It stifles debate, it stifles political activities and so on and so forth.

Now, if you look at what is happening in the University of Jaffna, it is the same thing. There was a legal academic, one of the brightest young legal academics who have come into being certainly from the University of Jaffna and arguably one of the best from among those that any other university of this country has produced. That academic was also a practising lawyer. He challenged the society, he challenged the system at various turns. He filed cases; he looked out for human rights violations. And what does the military do? They put pressure on the UGC and then, through the UGC, to the Council of the University of Jaffna to essentially tell that legal academic that he cannot practise if he wants to continue as the Dean of Law. That young academic, to his credit, did not submit. Instead, he chose to leave the University. So, already, you have the military in even in the case of universities. When the appointing authority of a Vice-Chancellor is the President, he, being the Commander-in-Chief, is already taking the militarys advice even before he makes the appointment of the most important person in a university. Okay, let us say that that is permitted, but to have the military dictate terms to the UGC in that way and stifle, probably, one of the most potentially greatest legal minds that this country can produce and then, eventually, finding out that that action they took was quite convenient, extending it to all the other universities where no one in the legal field can practise, I think, just demonstrates how the militarization within the North and the East since the end of the war was used as a test case to see how far they can push it even in the rest of the country.

I am probably the greatest critic of Sri Lankas current military. There can be no doubt that the country needs a military and also that the military must be a highly specialized institution, but to make that institution permeate into the society at large will only make the society impotent because then, it would be a society that cannot think, a society that falls into a straitjacket and a society that accepts a dictatorship willingly. That is what is at stake, Sir. Therefore, I say it again: yesterday, it was the Tamils; today, it is the Muslims and tomorrow, it will be the Sinhalese themselves because that is the direction this path can only lead to.

I thank you, Sir.

. - - , . , , . . , , . . , . Particularly, in that regard, I must say, Sir, that we introduced an Act to establish the Quality Assurance and Accreditation Commission for this country. We do not know what is happening to that. That was a well-considered legislation and something which was discussed with the entire university community in this country and to be carried out with World Bank assistance. Also several discussions were held with the Attorney-Generals Department and everybody concerned. The Bill was brought in and presented, but it is still not implemented. Without the implementation of that Bill, the quality assurance in our universities is going to be a serious problem. In the meantime, the UGC has become a bank distributing funds. It cannot function in that manner. The UGC cannot be involved in quality assurance directly; it has to be handled by an independent institution. So, those two functions cannot be done by the same institution. Therefore, with the very name the University Grants Commission" - " " - .

He provided teaching staff from the Moratuwa University to bail us out from that very difficult situation because there were some racist elements trying to deprive that University of the Engineering Faculty and take it away from there. But, it was the help that was rendered by the present Secretary to the Ministry of Education when he was the Vice Chancellor of the Moratuwa University that helped us. So, while he is there as the Secretary, I hope some of these important changes would be brought about because he is quite aware of what needs

1871 1872

to be done. But, the question is whether he has that necessary leverage to implement these things, particularly with regard to the anomalous situation that this Bill has brought about. Unnecessary protests are now beginning. See how these protestors had been handled today. In inhumane handling of legitimate protests, Mr. Stalin, the General Secretary of the Ceylon Teachers Union and various others had been bundled in; old women had very mercilessly been handled today.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) So, when the Government is finding it difficult to face the situation, they are using very dictatorial and unnecessary attempts to try and contain that situation. But, every day, the situation is going from bad to worse. Since this Bill will be taken up on a further day, more matters could further be discussed. But, I am sure this particular attempt to try and use various subterfuges to introduce virtual privatization into the university system will have to be looked at with a better understanding of the ground situation and certain changes may have to be made in order to make this a reality. Thank you.
