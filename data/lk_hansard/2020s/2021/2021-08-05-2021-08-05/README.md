[1.42 p.m.]

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal - State Minister of Money and Capital Market and State Enterprise Reforms) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, it is a pleasure to speak on the Orders issued under the Strategic Development Projects Act, which indicate that there is interest in the country for additional investments. Therefore, I am glad that it is a forerunner to the other new investments as well and also believe that we should encourage these types of activities in the country because that will bring in more prosperity to our nation. I am also particularly glad that two of these Gazettes are for extension of time for two projects and the other is for the establishment of a pharmaceutical zone, which, I believe, is another a very important milestone in the investment horizon of our country.

Let me just make a few points with regard to the pharmaceutical industry we are envisaging, Sir. The pharmaceutical industry has been identified as one of the most potential industries that could bring Sri Lanka enormous economic benefits. It could attract FDIs, earn foreign exchange through exports and save foreign exchange by way of import substitution as well. The medical and pharmaceutical expenditure of the country during the year 2020 was recorded at US Dollars 599 million and by 2022, the market is expected to reach a value of US Dollars 750 million and that would be posting a five-year Compound Annual Growth Rate of around 4.1 per cent. In 2019, the import of medical and pharmaceutical products had reached a value of US Dollars 553 million, which accounts for about 2.8 per cent of the total imports of our country. So, you can see, Sir, that this is an industry which will provide enormous potential for our country to develop into something lot more exciting as far as the industrial revolution that we are putting into place is concerned.

As you already know, we have identified non-debt inflows as being a thrust form of development in our country. For too long have we been dependent upon the debt inflows to sustain our economy. Now, we have consciously decided that we should encourage more and more investment, particularly from foreign sources, which would provide us with the impetus for future development. That, of course, is a challenge. We have to compete with the rest of the world; we have to make our country efficient; we have to make it effective and we have to ensure that people will choose Sri Lanka as a preferred destination over other destinations when it comes to investment and that is not easy. Not only should we concentrate on our Doing Business Indicators, but on the other socio-economic factors as well. We have to see that there are good health services, good educational services and good leisure services. All those are important factors if we are to ensure that people who come from abroad as well as those who are in Sri Lanka itself would

find Sri Lanka as a preferred destination where they could do their businesses in an effective manner. We have identified one of the key vulnerables in our economy to be the massive increase in the issuance of International Sovereign Bonds, which took place during the last Government. As you know, the International Sovereign Bonds that we had issued right up to 2014, during the time when I was the Governor of the Central Bank, were only US Dollars 5 billion, only a percentage of 6.25 per cent of GDP of our country, which was around US Dollars 80 billion at that time. However, during the five years of the Y ahapalana Government, we found that all the International Sovereign Bonds had been issued with great frequency and that meant that by the end of 2019, we had about US Dollars 15 billion of International Sovereign Bonds on our GDP, which had only grown to US Dollars 84 billion. That was a massive percentage of around 18 per cent of Sri Lankas GDP, which had to be sustained by foreign inflows. So, that would have meant quite a strain on our economy.

That is why we took the decision to shrink that, to shrink the amount of exposure that Sri Lanka has to have for its International Sovereign Bonds. We have also taken a conscious decision that we would settle these International Sovereign Bonds with other inflows that would come from other sources so that the equilibrium of our economy will be thus maintained. So, what we envisage is that by 2021, by the end of this year, the ISBs outstanding will be just US Dollars 13 billion down from US Dollars 15 billion and the percentage on a GDP which would be around US Dollars 83 billion would come down to 15.6 per cent. Next year, it will shrink further. That means by 2022, it would be around 13 per cent because we would be repaying a further US Dollars 1.5 billion. With regard to the US Dollars 1.5 billion to be settled next year, Sir, we would be ensuring that we have other inflows that would take care of that repayment so that we do not burden our economy with further debt, particularly the high interest rate debts that the previous Government had incurred in the process. So, by 2023, we will bring it down to a manageable number of around 11 per cent and that, I think, would be an important reform that our Government will be achieving in the next two to three years. We are consciously and scientifically approaching this so that we would be able to replace our debt capital that has been ballooning with non-debt inflows we are promoting through these new Strategic Development Projects Act as well as the Colombo Port City Economic Commission Act, which would ensure more and more investment flows into the country. So, what we have in mind, Sir, is that by 2022, to have at least US Dollars 2.6 billion as inflows coming in from FDI, to which should be added the Colombo Port City Economic Commission FDI we are envisaging, which is around US Dollars 1.5 billion. So, at least US Dollars 4 billion or US Dollars 4.1 billion would come into the country next year and the year after, we are expecting US Dollars 3 billion to come from other sources into the country as FDI and for the Port City to have a further US Dollars 2 billion, which would mean that we would have about US Dollars 5 billion as inflows only from FDIs. We are now setting up in a very efficient manner to ensure that these numbers will be targeted and delivered.

2021 05

Our Finance Minister, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, is spearheading a committee which is looking into all the difficulties that investors are presently undergoing with the aim of ensuring that they are facilitated so that they would be able to enjoy the freedom of investing freely without having to be constrained by the various difficulties they have hitherto been subjected to. So, we invite investors to come to Sri Lanka and benefit by these new conditions as well as this new facilitation we are providing for them. Our invitation is to investors from all over the world, not only to those from one or two particular countries like some others have been thinking that we should; we are inviting all to come in and invest in Sri Lanka. When they enjoy their benefits as well as gain profitability, it would mean that thousands and thousands of jobs would be created in our country and we would see the economy growing. That would also mean that we would be able put aside the vulnerabilities that have been thrust upon our country by the actions of the previous regime as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been quite a big challenge for us, and go forward.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, finally I wish to assure this House as well as all investors who have had faith in Sri Lanka that we would be delivering on our promises, we would be delivering greater facilities for all investors who come to our country and through that, we would be able to enjoy greater economic prosperity, and that is what the vision of our President is all about.

Thank you very much.

Sir, I have just a small matter to raise about what he said. I think the teachers of this country are not asking for these pay rises to take place immediately. The then Government in January, 2001 set up the Subodhini Commission. So, they want a guarantee from the Government that, at some point, you will commit to the

399 400

recommendations of that Commission. You can give those guarantees straightaway and this matter would be resolved. That is the only matter that I just wanted to raise. I think you yourself will agree that the requests they have made might seem unreasonable because of the economic situation the country faces due to the COVID-19 pandemic and matters like that. But, they also realize that and they are not insisting that these recommendations be implemented immediately. So, they are only asking for a commitment from the Government that those recommendations are, in fact, fair and that the Government will be bound by those recommendations at some future date. That is all that is required. I think the Government must be reasonable in making that commitment.

Sir, since I have very little time, I just want to bring to the notice of this House something quite alarming, which is taking place in the northern waters. Over the last several days, since the 22nd of July, Indian fishermen have been encroaching into Sri Lankan waters. These fishermen are coming in large trawlers and they have literally been destroying the fishing assets of the fishermen of the Northern Province, particularly from Mannar up to Jaffna and Mullaitivu. Just to give an example, Sir, on 22nd July, there were 27 individuals from the area of Munai Fisheries Co-operative Society whose properties and assets - a total of 277 fishing nets amounting to almost Rs. 4 million - were destroyed. So, to fishermen from that very small localized area alone, the damage done is almost Rs. 4 million, to be exact, Rs. 3,990,000. Those fishermen who came from India had caused damage to assets of fishermen fishing from Thumpalai East to Kottadi on that same day and on that very day, the total amount of damage caused is estimated to be over Rs. 15 million. Sir, this is happening on a daily basis. One must then ask what on earth is going on. You have Navy camps right across the North-East coastal areas, you have confiscated people's own private land setting up massive naval bases, but your Navy is sleeping. They are doing nothing to prevent these Indian fishermen from coming in, encroaching and destroying the assets of the local fishermen of the Northern Province and also from parts of the East. So, what is going on? One has to ask the question whether this Government is deliberately allowing such things to happen. If the Navy actually performs its duty and prevents these fishermen from entering Sri Lankan waters, there would not be any of these troubles. On the one hand, you have taken a vast area that belongs to the local people, you have confiscated their own private land in setting up naval camps and on the other, you are allowing those very same people to get pauperized by their assets being destroyed. So, there is something radically wrong, Sir.

Not only that, recently, there have been sea cucumber farms being set up in the North. At the scale these sea cucumber farms are being set up or authorization given for those, the entire seabed is going to get destroyed and thereby, the future catch is going to be severely harmed. Those fishermen are doubly scared because on the one hand, you are allowing foreign fishermen to encroach and destroy their assets when they are trying to get up on their

own feet after almost 32 years of war without being able to fish and on the other, in the name of development, you are allowing sea cucumber farms to be set up in scales, which will destroy local fishermens catch. Therefore, in the Northern Province, particularly in a place like Jaffna where almost half of the economy runs on fishing, allowing this sort of things raises the question whether the Government wants to pauperize that population so that they leave the coast, leave their land, leave their toil and the Government can thereby proceed to colonize. That is a grave concern, Sir. I hope the Members of the Government take heed of that, intervene immediately and ask the Navy to perform their duty if they are going to remain in the North-East or otherwise, get out. The people themselves can, in some way, defend their own waters and prevent these people from encroaching if the Navy does not butt in. So, either the Navy performs its duty and prevents these people from entering and destroying the local fishermens assets or it leaves and allows the people themselves to protect their own assets.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . .
