Since there are no provincial councils now, there are no elected members, but still for all, when the elections are held, all provincial council members led by the Chief Ministers become elected leaders. Then, of course, at the local government level, all those members are elected leaders.

Whereupon THE HON. HARSHANA RAJAKARUNA left the Chair and THE HON. WEERASUMANA WEERASINGHE took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please commence your speech.

[3.19 p.m.]

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, first, I wish to quote Article 6 of the Rome Statue:

"For the purpose of this Statute, 'genocide' means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:

(a) Killing members of the group;

(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;

(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;

(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;

(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group."

Sir, that is Article 6 of the Rome Statue which defines the crime of "genocide". The Rome Statue is an international instrument that Sri Lanka consistently refuses to ratify, obviously for reasons well known today.

When the Budget, 2021 was presented last year, speaking on the Votes of the Ministry of Defence, I brought to the notice of this House that when the war was at its height, towards the latter part of it, I was involved in trying to broker a ceasefire on the 16th of May, 2009, where the LTTE had very openly agreed to lay down their arms so that nearly 100,000 to 150,000 civilians who were within the LTTE-controlled areas could be brought over safely. I got involved in this process by talking to the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, the current Minister of Finance - at that time he was a very senior and powerful Member of Parliament - and we had discussions on the 16th of May, 2009 from about 4.00 o clock in the afternoon till about 8.00 o clock in the night, where eventually, in principle, the Government agreed to accept the LTTEs laying down of arms in order to save those lives. That process of saving those lives and bringing those civilians across safely was to take place after the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa returned to Sri Lanka from the Non-Aligned Movement Meeting, which was taking place in Jordan. He was supposed to arrive in Sri Lanka on the 17th and the agreement that was reached was to bring those 100,000 to 150,000 civilians safely across thereafter. But, unfortunately, that did not happen. In fact, after we, in principle, agreed to it at 8.00 o clock in the night on the 16th, around 10.00 p.m. or 10.30 p.m., I got frantic calls - because I had notified the LTTE that that process will take place on the following day, on the 17th - saying that despite the fact that I am supposed to have come to that agreement, heavy artillery was being used arbitrarily, in a manner to maximize the loss of lives.

I got in touch with the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa again at about 10.00 or 10.30 in the night and I asked him, Honourable Sir, why are you doing this? Why is the Ministry of Defence doing this? We have already conveyed to you that tomorrow, if your Government accepts, you can save nearly 100,000 to 150,000 civilians, something that you say you are all about. So, why are you going on attacking those civilians with heavy artillery? When the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa was told this, he said that he would speak to the Ministry of Defence and get back to me and when he got back to me, he said, The Ministry of Defences position is that until the Security Council meets on the 17th, they cannot, in any way, change their strategy for attack.

So, what I am trying to express here, Sir, is the gravity of what happened. You might not agree, you might not want to believe this, but I am a witness to it and it is my duty to place on record the gravity of what happened on the 16th of May, 2009. By 4.00 o clock in the afternoon on the 16th of May, 2009, the LTTE had made it very clear through me that they were willing to lay down arms in order to save 100,000 to 150,000 people, but the

1689 1690

2021 03

Ministry of Defence refused to accept that position; they went on to use heavy artillery. The Hon. Sarath Fonseka, during the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Defence last year, owned up to the fact that till the very end, heavy artillery was being used and attack formations were being maintained. So, when you had very clearly got proof or you had, at the very least, been conveyed the fact that the LTTE was willing to lay down arms, your refusing to accept that, using heavy artillery means only one thing, to maximize the loss of lives so that you could destroy in whole or in part. That is the crime of genocide, Sir, and that is the crime to which the Ministry of Defence, the Army, the Navy and the Air Force are accused of. That is not an ordinary crime; it is the most heinous crime that you can ever come across!

So, is it not the duty, when you say today that we must think in terms of Sri Lankans, to allow an international investigation to find out whether, in fact, that crime took place or not? Whenever we make this accusation, you stand up and say that you had never committed any crime. If you had not committed any crime, what are you afraid of? Do you not realize that until accountability takes place, until victims feel that they can be safe, you will never have peace? Do you not realize that? You can never build a cohesive country. Why are you, even now - 12 or 13 years after the war - so afraid, if, in fact, genocide did not take place? The crime of genocide is not only killing. I said last year that when there were nearly about 450,000 civilians in the LTTE-controlled areas before the war took place in a very aggressive way, the Governments position was that there were only 70,000 civilians. They were sending medicine and food for only 70,000 civilians. Till the very end, that was all they were sending. What does that mean? You were starving people, you were creating conditions to make sure that life, in whole or in part, is lost.

( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera)

. . rose.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Please do not disturb me, Hon. Minister. You are due to speak last. Kindly speak at the end. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera. ( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera) Hon. Member, please do not misinform the House. We had rescued 295,000 people during the war. Do not say unthruths. Please do not misinform this august Assembly. Where were you at that time? At that time, you were living in luxury in Colombo when these people were

suffering. - [Interruption.] We rescued those people. That was the largest rescue operation in the world! -[Interruption.] You must know that. Therefore, do not say untruths and misinform this House.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Ponnambalam, you carry on. .. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, he has 20 minutes to speak at the end. He can speak and say whatever he wants without disturbing me. But the problem is, you cannot take it. -[Interruption.] If I am saying untruth, why do you not sign the Rome Statute? Why do you not go before the ICC and give evidence?

You will also be an accused party. - [Interruption.] Why do you not go and give evidence? Why are you so frightened? Why are you even trying to prevent us from saying whatever we want in this House? - [Interruption.] Why are you frightened even to allow us to say whatever we want in this House? This is the reality, Sir, that we, the Tamil Members, face in this country.

Today, 13 years after the war, your military, your armed forces maintain a ratio of 1:10 in the North-East. A ratio of 1:10! Why? In Vanni, it is 1:5! Why? What is the ratio in the South? You are terrorizing the people in the North-East even today. Why are you afraid? Even 12 to 13 years after the war, you are afraid that evidence will go out. You are afraid of the fact that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, in her last address to the High Commission, had said that there are 120,000 files against Sri Lankas military. That is what you are afraid of; you are afraid of the truth. So, for as long as you run away from the truth, as long as you safeguard genociders and as long as you think of genocide as a crime you can get away with, you will never create peace, you will always be insecure and you will always need to find partners who will, in some way regardless of what is right and wrong, support you in making sure that justice for genocide does not happen.

And, in the course of doing that, what you are doing is selling your country. You have sold the soul of this country day by day. That is what you are left with to do. In South Asia, Sri Lanka is asking for help from Bangladesh! Are you not ashamed? You are asking for help from Bangladesh! This is what you have achieved 13 years after the war! If you do not realize that being Sri Lankan requires all its people to be loyal to that identity and for that to happen, if you do not realize that all sections, all nations within this country must be secure and safe, you will never create the Sri Lanka that you claim you stand for. On the contrary, you will make sure that you go down the path of racism, as you are doing now, to, in some way, divide the population as much as you can, create racist sentiments and polarization so that through that polarization, you somehow maintain your vote bank. That is what is happening.

1691 1692

But, today, because of the severe situation that the general public is facing, for the first time, the ordinary Sinhalese people are beginning to question what their leaders are saying; for the first time, the ordinary Sinhalese people who, maybe, a few years ago, would have dismissed what I say as racism, what my Colleagues here say as racism are willing to listen; for the first time, they are willing to question the lies that have been told to them time and again about what the Tamils want. You cannot sustain this path. If you sustain this path, what you are worried about most, a division, would not be brought by the Tamils, but by yourselves because it is the Sinhalese who would stand up one day and say, We are persons who venerate the Buddha, a person who had been so righteous and who preached non-violence, but if these are the crimes that had taken place in our name, then those people deserve the safety they have been yearning for". That situation will arise if you do not change your path. For Gods sake, think when you have Ministers who do not know what their role is. The Hon. - I should not say Honourable - (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera is a Minister who does not know what separation of powers is. It is a downright disgrace!

He thinks that as the Minister in charge of policing, he can tell the Police what to do. When my Colleague, the Hon. Selvarajah Kajendren, went to Colonel Thileepans resting place to commemorate him, he wanted him arrested for it. The Minister does not realize the countrys law. He is the man who is supposed to be in charge of policing. What a disgrace! All he can do is try and be big in this House by disturbing me during the time when I speak. - [Interruption.] That is the very sad situation this country finds itself in, where you have a person so intellectually challenged placed as the Minister in charge of policing

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

and where he shows repeatedly in this House the nature of his racism, which only helps us show internationally what sort of a mindset with which he would have worked when he was in the Navy.

Sir, once again, I am saying that the Tamil people are not enemies. But, the Tamil people want their rights; they deserve their rights. They have been fighting for the last 70 odd years for those rights.- [Interruption.] Those rights will have to be met.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is up. Please wind up now. .. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, if Sri Lanka is to be stable, if Sri Lanka is to be a country that can live up to its potential, you cannot go down the path you have been going down in the last 74 years. As long as the Tamil peoples nationhood is not

recognized and as long as Sri Lanka does not recognize that it is a plurinational country, you will destroy this country, not just us, but yourselves as well. I am repeating every time, you will destroy yourselves as well!

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. Kanchana Wijesekera. You have ten minutes.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, I call for a Division. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) We have a pre-agreement that if you want to ask for a Division, it has to be informed 24 hours before. So, it has not been done. But, we will record your objection. - [Interruption.] The Party Leaders have agreed to it.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Yes, Hon. Sumanthiran? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, it is true that it is customary that we decide at the Party Leaders Meetings that, if there is going to be a Division, you should inform about it early. But even if such information is not given early, a single Member can call for a Division and if a Division is called for, it must

* . * . * Not tendered.

be given. That is the rule. Even if you do not abide by what had been agreed at the Party Leaders' Meeting, if a Division is called for in the House, that Division must be given. That is the rule. So, I raise it as a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) If both parties agree, I have no objection to that. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, all of us are Members of the Parliamentary Business Committee including the Hon. Sumanthiran and the Hon. Ponnambalam. This decision was reached after a long discussion on how to conduct Business till the end of the Budget Debate. Now, suddenly, they rise up today and say that they want a Division. - [Interruption.] All what you can do, Sir, is to record that they have opposed; that is the only thing which can be done at this moment. There is no possibility of going back on that decision. The entire Business must be based on the agreements reached and today, you cannot say, "No, I have a different agenda". No, you cannot.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Hon. Leader of the House knows that even when we make that decision, we record the fact that although we have that understanding, if any Member rises and calls for a Division, that Division must be given.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) But, unfortunately, Hon. Sumanthiran, I am not in a position to deviate from the decision we had taken at the Party Leaders Meeting. That is the decision and that has to be followed. Your opposition will be noted down.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Yes, Hon. Ponnambalam?

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, I called for a Division because, I am telling you with responsibility, the Office of the Leader of the Opposition was informed.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) No.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) My Privileges as a Member of Parliament is being completely violated. It is just because, as a matter of convenience, you come to some sort of understanding at the Party Leaders Meeting that sufficient notice has to be given. I gave sufficient notice and that it was not informed is not my problem.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) The Secretary to the Chief Government Whip has to be informed according to the Minutes. So, he has not been properly informed. I am very sorry, I cannot deviate from the decision that had been taken at the Party Leaders Meeting. But, your objection will be recorded. - [Interruption.]
