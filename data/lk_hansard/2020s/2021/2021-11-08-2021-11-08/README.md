( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Hon. Presiding Member, with your permission, I just want to raise one question about the three cricketers who were suspended. If you followed cricket, you would have noticed that even in the T20 World Cup tournament, the openers faired very badly; we hardly got a good start. I think the Hon. Minister will agree with me that we hardly got a good start. One of the openers were out in the first two, three overs. The three players who were suspended are very good players. So, I think you should consider them because we will be playing the World Cup again in 2022. So, kindly consider them because they have been ordered to pay a big fine.

( ) (The Hon. Namal Rajapaksa) Hon. Member, you do understand that discipline is number one. You know what happened to your Party because you all could not maintain discipline. I do not want that to happen to my National Team, Hon. Member. So, we have taken disciplinary action against those players. The Sri Lanka Cricket appointed a committee, they had given a statement on that and also the judgment was delivered. So, those boys can start playing domestic cricket once their term is over. They can also play in the LPL, starting their domestic career. After one year, they can play international cricket, but I must reiterate that discipline is the key and we will not compromise on discipline whether you are a player or you are in the management.
