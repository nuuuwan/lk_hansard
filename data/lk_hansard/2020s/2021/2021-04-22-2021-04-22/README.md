( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Speaker, I wish to make a point with regard to what happened at the Party Leaders' Meeting. I disagree with the Hon. Chief Opposition Whip that the Opposition should move the Adjournment Motion today. The Opposition did ask to more and we had a long discussion on that and eventually, I conceded on my behalf, not on behalf of the other parties. But after I conceded, there was no agitation on behalf of either the Samagi Jana Balawegaya or the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna. Therefore, I think the decision, which you have rightly pointed out, is that the Government will move the Adjournment Motion today.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, I rise to apoint of Order. He mentioned my name. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Not by name, by the office. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) The Opposition asked for the Debate. Then, the Hon. Sumanthiran said that he would not mind allowing the Government to start the Debate.We were silent because we held the earlier position. But, we did not agree. We were silent because we had stated our position early, that we wanted to start the Debate. So, there was no reason to reiterate that. The Hon. Sumanthiran is from a different party. So, that was the view of that party. I am not annoyed with him. But he said, Allow the Government and we said, Let us start the Debate.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member, you know that the matter has now fallen into - [Interruption.]

[1.30 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for the opportunity to speak on this Adjournment Debate on the Report that has been presented by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Political Victimization.

Right at the outset, I must say that when appointing members to commissions such as this, customarily, the President of the Republic states - I am reading from the Gazette Notification dated 09th January, 2020 by which these three Commissioners were appointed - I quote:

"Now therefore, I Gotabaya Rajapaksa, President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka reposing great trust and confidence in your prudence, ability and fidelity, do, in pursuance of the provisions of Section 2 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act (Chapter 393) as amended, by these presents appoint you,...."

So, he has confidence in their prudence, ability and fidelity.

Then, when you look at the names of the three persons so appointed, you wonder why he chose those persons. One is a disgraced member of the Judiciary who was interdicted for misconduct and sent on compulsory transfer - I do not want to say anything more than what is in the public realm - about whom books have been written and published. The famous book titled An Unfinished Struggle by Victor Ivan, of which four editions have come out and which also have been in circulation for almost one and a half decades without anybody being able to refute the facts in that book, states much about the Chairman of this Commission. I do not usually say anything about anyone who is not able to reply, but these are matters in the public realm. One of the other members have had fines imposed on by the Supreme Court before he retired, the former IGP Chandra Fernando; he was found guilty by the Supreme Court. So, those are the persons whom the President appointed. When one looks at the Report and the way in which the Commissioners have functioned, one understands why such persons were handpicked by the President to do this hatchet job, and they have done the job that was given to them very well.

Firstly, they were given the task of receiving complaints from public officers, employees of public corporations, members of armed forces and the police service. What did they do? Over and above such complaints, they had entertained complaints from various other persons who did not belong to any of those categories. I will deal with one or two examples.

This appointment, the original mandate, was later expanded to include the Criminal Investigation Department also, seriously undermining the criminal justice system that we have in our country which goes back for over 100 years. There is a particular system by which the criminal justice system works. The Attorney-General, as the Chief Law Officer of the State, is given a particular recognition both in the Criminal Procedure Code and now, in the Constitution as well by virtue of the appointment which seeks to make him independent by various judgments of the Superior Courts, including the Privy Council, that recognize the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney-General of the Republic. It is the Attorney-General and the Attorney-General alone who exercises that independent function and who has been reposed with a prosecutorial discretion. Of course, he may present an indictment to court and in our system, the accused person is presumed innocent and afforded all the rights, even the right to remain silent or make a dock statement and avoid being cross-examined. He is given the right to choose or to refuse a jury; three times, he can say, I do not want this panel of jury without assigning reasons. The whole system is there to ensure that even if hundred accused persons, hundred criminals go free, an innocent person should not be found guilty. That is the system and that system functions in that way because the Judiciary functions. So, beyond the fact that the Attorney-General, an independent officer, decides to indict somebody, it goes before the Magistrate's Court or the

1973 1974

2021 22

High Court. Then, you are afforded the opportunity of two appeals; ordinarily, there are two appeals. If it was at Trial-at-Bar, only one appeal, but one appeal before five Judges of the Supreme Court.

We heard the Hon. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka referring to two of those cases. So, I do not want to refer to that but mention that all of those accused persons have had the opportunity of being defended before the trial court and also the opportunity of appealing against their conviction and sentence. When such is the system that we have, we have this Commission interfering in this hallowed procedural safeguard that we have. In fact, there is a statute in our statute books called Intermeddlers with Suitors and if anybody interferes in the due administration of justice, that person can be brought before court, indicted, found guilty and being sentenced. And, these three Commissioners, to the extent that they have exceeded the mandate given by the very warrant that appointed them, have blatantly intermeddled with suits in this country and have interfered with what the Attorney-General does in this country.

The Commissions of Inquiry Act has been abused in this country repeatedly, most famously in the case of former Prime Minister Madam Sirimavo Dias Bandaranaike, the first woman Prime Minister of the world, who was found guilty by a Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry appointed by President Jayewardene and then deprived of her civic rights. How that happened is worthy of mention in this because of some of the recommendations that have been made by this Commission and, mind you, this is a Commission of Inquiry, not a Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry. This Commission does not have the right to recommend the deprivation of civic rights of anybody. That Act does not give them that right, but they make that recommendation.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage - Minister of Agriculture) Why are you scared? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am not scared at all.

So, they make that recommendation.

( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) Why are you scared? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You were scared. So, you all went and appointed this Commission because you were accused before a court and you wanted to get out of that indictment.

When Madam Bandaranaike was deprived of her civic rights, all of these people who are seated on that side -

( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, what is your point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) . . , , . . , , .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is not a point of Order, Sir . ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, that is not a point of Order. Hon. Member, please continue.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Not only is it not a point of Order, but the person raising it does not deserve any reply.

Madam Bandaranaike was charged with allegations of abuse and misuse of power and corruption. Then, the Court of Appeal granted a writ of prohibition against that Commission and retrospectively, an Amendment was brought to the Act so that the Special Presidential Commission could find her guilty. Thereafter, a Bill was brought before Parliament; she was found guilty and expelled from Parliament in 1980. The day after her expulsion, two sudden Amendments were brought to the Parliamentary Elections Act which said that "any person who is disqualified by a Resolution from, in any way, participating during the period of disability at a Parliamentary or a Presidential Election..." Such was the witch-hunt against Madam Bandaranaike and how these Acts were used. So, those in the front rows of the Government today know very well what a draconian law this is and how that was used against their own Party Leader.

And, they have now chosen to do it in a much worse manner than what even President Jayewardene did because here is an ordinary Commission of Inquiry, not a Special Presidential Commission consisting of members with dubious distinction making recommendations to

1975 1976

deprive civic liberties of Opposition Members of Parliament. If you look at the Act, the Act does not empower the making of recommendations against Members of Parliament. It is only against public officers and by an Amendment later, public institutions, local councils et cetera. So, very clearly they have gone out of their mandate and have given this Report.

Because of lack of time, I will quickly refer to some examples. But before I do that, I will make a disclosure under Item 19 of the Code of Conduct for Members of Parliament because I am personally interested in the matter. I know Members of Parliament speak about all their personal matters without making this disclosure, but knowing that this is the rule, I will properly make a disclosure of my interest in the matter that I am going to speak about.

There is a person called Sivanesathurai Santhirakanthan, now an Hon. Member of this House. He is called Pillayan. There is a complaint that Pillayan had made to this Commission saying that he was wrongfully arrested, detained, some evidence was fabricated against him and two other co-accused made confessions against him and therefore, he was deprived of his liberty for five years. In that case, that confession was made before a Magistrate, not to a police officer like what you normally do in a PTA case: torture a person, extract a confession and an ASP signs below saying, "This was voluntarily made before me". No, this was made in the Magistrates Chambers. It was admitted as valid evidence before the High Court, at the trial, and the accused person, Pillayan, appealed to the Court of Appeal and the Court of Appeal held that that confession was not validly received. So, he had his right. Right or wrong, the Court of Appeal threw out the confession. Thereafter, the Attorney-General felt that without that confession, there was not enough material to continue with the prosecution. So, the Attorney-General entered what we call nolle prosequi and released Pillayan. That happened in the ordinary course of the judicial proceedings. Wright or wrong, he was able to be released in the ordinary way.

But, what happened before this Commission? To this Commission, he had made complaints against four persons: the first is myself - , .. - and against three other police officers.

( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) Ah! That is why you referred to that. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, that is why I made the disclosure.

But, when you read the Report on this, there is nothing about me at all, absolutely nothing. Even against the police officers, what is stated is that they actually took him to the Magistrate. The confession was made before

the Magistrate. But, there is a recommendation that you must prosecute those police officers and myself for fabricating evidence.

I have no knowledge of any of these matters. Neither does the Report say that I had anything to do with this; the Report does not say that I had anything to do with this. Merely because Pillayan had mentioned me as a person against whom he was making a complaint, there is a recommendation that I be prosecuted for fabricating evidence. I had nothing to do with this. In saying that, very serious allegations are made against the Magistrate; demeaning things have been said about the Magistrate. That Magistrate is now a functioning High Court Judge. How dare this Commission - as I said, one is a disgraced judicial officer about whom the whole country knows - make such statements against a functioning judge! Who gave him the right to do that? Not even the warrant by which he was appointed gave him that right to make pronouncements against judges like this. Judges are not public officers, as defined in the Constitution; Members of Parliament are not public officers, as defined in the Constitution. You can only make recommendations with regard to public officers. Clearly outside the remit that had been given to this Commission, they have gone and made these recommendations. Very funnily, the recommendation is that the Attorney- General must discontinue the prosecution. At one point, it says that. Then, at the end, it says that the President must grant him a pardon. So, they have covered all sides. Just in case the Attorney-General does not withdraw it and he is found guilty, grant him a pardon.

Now, this is only one example of the way in which this Commission has gone about doing what they have been told to do.

Then, in respect of civic rights, since they do not have the authority to make that recommendation, they make a recommendation that the President must appoint a Special Presidential Commission which must make the recommendation that they would have liked to make. This is hell of a how do you do! Pardon my language, but it is a hell of a how do you do! That you do not have the authority to do it, you are telling the President, Because we do not have a right to do it, appoint another commission, a puppet commission, just to do what we would have liked to do and the President goes ahead and appoints a commission such as that.

There are issues here with regard to another matter in which some police officers were found guilty of torture and murder in the Chunnakam Police Station. There were two appeals against that. There was a finding of guilt in the High Court, an appeal in the Court of Appeal and an appeal in the Supreme Court. Both appeals were dismissed and those three police officers were found guilty of torture and murder. They were prosecuted under the Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment Act. Now, here, there is a recommendation that those persons must be released.

What does this Commission think it is? There is a functioning Judiciary. The Attorney-General wrote to this

1977 1978

[ .. ]

2021 22

Commission and said, Do not interfere in my functions. Do not summon members of the Attorney-Generals Department before this Commission. You have no right to do that. When two senior officers went before this Commission and wanted to support the letter sent by the Hon. Attorney-General, they were refused permission. This is worse than any kangaroo court that you can imagine.

The Government, absolutely without any shame, is presenting this Report to this House and is even moving an Adjournment Motion wanting to implement its recommendations. Absolutely without shame! That is why when they wanted to move the Resolution, I said, Let them move it. How do you justify this? The Seconder of the Motion, who spoke for almost an hour today, complained about another Commission in which he was not afforded the right to cross-examine witnesses. In this Commission, not only was the right to cross-examine not given, but we had not even been noticed. With regard to Pillayans complaint that I talked about, I was not even noticed. I was noticed of about four or five matters in which, I was told, I am a respondent. I went before this Commission and said, If you have named me as a respondent, give me the material on which you decided that I must be termed a 'respondent' . The Chairman of the Commission said, Yes, yes. You have all the right. We will give it to you. I said, Give it to me in the language that I understand. Then he said, Yes, yes. You are entitled to a translation. We will give it to you. I did not get anything. I raised a Question of Privilege here because on a day I attended Parliament, when I went back home, I had a notice handed over to my house asking me to come before the Commission at 2.00 p.m. that day. I saw that at 5.00 p.m. I immediately wrote to the Commission. To every summons, I had responded. I had sent it by fax; I had intimated to the Commission why I was unable to attend. Twice, I had attended it. I intimated to the Commission that I was attending Parliament that day and that I got the notice only at 5.00 p.m. on that day. Despite that, after having got my letter and four days after getting my letter, the Chairman of the Commission made a statement to the press stating that these Members of Parliament are evading the Commission. On that, I have raised a Question of Privilege and the Hon. Speaker has referred it to the Committee on Ethics and Privileges.

I hope that Committee would make the right decision in this regard. So, this is what the Chairman of that Commission told the press: "Former MPs Mangala Samaraweera, Patali Champika Ranawaka and several others were named as persons evading the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) appointed to probe political victimization. Chairman of the PCoI, retired Supreme Court Judge, Justice Upali Abeyratne instructed to name those individuals, together with MPs Rauff Hakeem, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, Presidents Counsel M.A. Sumanthiran, R. Sampanthan, Anura Kumara Dissanayake and former MP Malik Samarawickrama, for failing to comply with the notice issued to appear before the PCoI

Then, with regard to this Anti-corruption Committee or whatever that this Commission refers to, I had no knowledge of any such Committee. We were never

members of any such committee; we were never notified either by the Cabinet or anyone that we were appointed to any such committee and we did not attend any meetings of any such committee. But even otherwise, how does that become a matter on which these recommendations can be made? Now, there is a Task Force on COVID-19 appointed by the President. Previously, after the tsunami, there was a Task Force appointed. Various Task Forces are appointed by Executive fiat.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up now. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am winding up, Sir.

Can somebody say because the Constitution does not refer to such committees, that it was unconstitutional? If that is the case, the Committee now headed by General Shavendra Silva is unconstitutional and he must be deprived of his civic rights and so does those of the President who appointed him to that.

So, when one reads through this Report, one cannot give it any credibility. More than the fact that it has exceeded its mandate even where it purports to act within its mandate, it has gone against the Judiciary of this country, the rule of law and has sought to make a mockery of the system of justice in this country.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. Shehan Semasinghe.

Order, please! Before he starts, will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya to the Chair?

[3.25 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Presiding Member, the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on Political Victimization was appointed in January, 2020 and its Report was given to the President in December, 2020. Then, after Cabinet approval was obtained, another Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry has been appointed.

Further, we saw a Resolution appearing in the Addendum issued on the 09th of April, 2021 seeking approval of Parliament to implement the recommendations in Item Nos. 09 and 10, omitting Item No. 08, in the Final Report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry, once the Resolution is passed. That Resolution seeks approval of Parliament to initiate criminal prosecution against public officers, lawyers, officers of the Attorney-Generals Department, witnesses and others involved in the cases. It also seeks approval for the dismissal of several cases currently pending in court, undermining the independence of the Judiciary. Actually, this Resolution was basically attacking the separation of powers set out in Article 4 of the Constitution. This is the first time that we have seen such a Resolution being brought to Parliament. We know that it is only the judicial bodies that can discharge or acquit those who are accused, and nobody else. This Resolution is positively against the separation of powers. Over the past 30 to 40 years, never has such a Resolution been brought before Parliament and it should have been correctly ordered out of the Order Book by the Hon. Speaker. I am afraid, the Secretary-General of Parliament and the Secretariat should have advised the Hon. Speaker not to even allow it to be tabled.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Order, please! Will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam to the Chair?

( ) (The Hon. Thushara Indunil Amarasena) Sir, I propose that the Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam do now take the Chair.

Whereupon THE HON. PREMNATH C. DOLAWATTE left the Chair, and THE HON. SHANAKIYAN RAJAPUTHIRAN RASAMANICKAM took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Please continue, Hon. Member.

2007 2008

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Sir, but the Resolution was not overruled by the Speaker.

Moreover, some of these cases that have been brought up in the Commission have already been challenged in the Appellate Court by those directly affected by the findings and those are ongoing. Above all, this Resolution cannot be implemented in any way except by the courts of law. Moreover, it tends to interfere with the jurisdiction of the Attorney-Generals Department and those judges presiding over the established courts alone can decide on the merits and demerits of these court cases. Also, what are we doing with the Attorney-Generals Department? We are questioning its professionalism; we are questioning its integrity and we are basically causing the Attorney-Generals Department also to face a huge problem by the way in which this Government is pushing for this.

The independence of the Judiciary is critical. We had a Presidential Commission of Inquiry; we have a Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry and now, we have a Resolution and it faultly suggests that the Judiciary did not arrive at its findings in an independent and impartial manner. That is what it is suggesting. For example, there are about 90 cases here which were instituted by the Attorney-General and the Attorney-Generals Department during that period and at that time, the Attorney-General was His Lordship Jayantha Jayasuriya, the Chief Justice of the country presently. What are we actually saying by acting in a such way? We are indirectly moving a Vote of No-Confidence against the current Chief Justice of the country. That is what this Government is doing by tabling such Resolutions. They should not be tabling such Resolutions because those cases were instituted by the Attorney-General at that time, who happens to be His Lordship the Chief Justice of the country presently. I think this Government has not really thought through this.

, . 90 , . . , . . . .

The conduct of the CoI into Political Victimization challenges the independent functioning of the courts and tribunals as well as questions the public trust in the legal system. This is an unprecedented step which violates the sovereignty of the people, whose judicial power shall be exercised through the courts.

. . There are complaints against the criminal investigations into several cases such as the alleged abductions involving Admiral of the Fleet Wasantha Karannagoda and others. Sir, I might

say this. There was a war in this country. Admiral of the Fleet Wasantha Karannagoda gave leadership to the Navy; Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka gave leadership to the Army and Marshal of the Air Force Roshan Goonetileke gave leadership to the Air Force. Generally, when there is an armed conflict, the generals who succeed in defeating it are held in high esteem and I do not wish to take away the esteem that they are held in.

But, however, I might say this. As the Army Commander who led the Army during that period, the Hon. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, naming a few cases of some individuals of the armed forces, said today that those violations of the law are unacceptable and those must go before the courts and tribunals of the country. It is significant for the person who has the honour of leading the armed forces of this country to actually stand up and say today in this Assembly that the cases where there had been crimes committed must go before the Judiciary and therefore, I applaud him for saying that.

Then, the assassination of former MP Nadarajah Raviraj, the death of Wasim Thajudeen, the assassination of former MP Joseph Pararajasingham, the Welikada Prison massacre, the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda and the abduction of Keith Noyahr are mentioned in the Report. In addition to that, complaints against the investigations into the alleged financial irregularities and misappropriation of public funds in the Divi Neguma Department, the Tourism Development Authority, Co-operative Wholesale Establishment, the Sri Lankan Embassy in the United States and various other cases, which I will not be able to refer to, are mentioned in it.

Yesterday, I went to see Ranjan Ramanayake in prison and I want to say this. He was serving his 100th day in prison and he has 1,362 more days to serve. The sentence that was meted out to him does not commensurate with the wrongdoing he has committed. If you look at the USA, England or India, for contempt of court, more commensurate punishments would be given. But, we have caused the courts to face a problem by not having a relevant Act passed by Parliament. So, I call upon Parliament to pass a Bill on contempt of court, giving a commensurate punishment for contempt of court because we cannot leave it to the judges to decide. It is embarrassing for them because they are being wronged in deciding on what the punishment should be. Therefore, we should do that.

Sir, I would like to say that politicization of this process would result in a climate of fear and paralysis among investigators and prosecutors, stifling the current and future investigations. If we look at people like Shani Abeysekara, he could have gone abroad, but he did not leave this country because he has a conscience and his conscience is clear. That is why he is fighting for his independence and his rights. Similarly, we have people like Saman Ekanayake, a Secretary and lawyer Weliamuna. Investigators, professionals, police officers and even people in the Attorney-Generals Department will be cautious in future about going into investigations because of this political process.

() ( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Suren Raghavan) Sir, I do not like to disturb my Hon. Friend. But, since he referred to another Hon. Member by name - to the Hon. Harin Fernando - I think we must have a complete idea about this whole discourse that is happening in Parliament because that particular Hon. Member has disgraced all of us.

Sir, I am sorry to say that one of the State Ministers of this Government addressed a public meeting using unparliamentary words under the influence of liquor. We thank you for giving Rs. 1,000 for the estate workers. But, an immature Parliamentarian, who is also a State Minister, addressed the public at Kotagala using unparliamentary words under the influence of liquor. In those days, we can remember, we could not speak to some up-country leaders after 6 oclock in the evening. Now, the situation is very bad. I am very sorry to say that now, even in the morning, after 10 oclock, we cannot speak to them.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Vadivel Suresh) Sir, very unparliamentary words were used by that particular State Minister. I think it is my duty to bring it to

the notice of Parliament and the Government to do the needful. So, at this juncture, I must inform this House of it.
