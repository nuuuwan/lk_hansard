.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Speaker, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Ponnambalam? .. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Thank you, Sir. Whilst I would like to welcome the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa's comments today, as a matter of point of Order, may I ask under what Standing Order he made those comments?

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) He made a Statement.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) But, I am asking you, Sir, under what Standing Order he made those comments.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Any Minister can make his own Statement in this House. He is the Minister of Youth and Sports .

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) But, there is a certain procedure to be followed. Why I am asking this, Sir, is that if the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa is allowed to make those comments, then, I think, everyone here must also be allowed to make such comments in the way that he was allowed to. So, on that basis, I would like to say that I would like to endorse the Hon. Rauff Hakeem's comments.

There is a systemic problem here, Sir. The Tamil political prisoners' issue is not an issue that a government should be allowed to decide on their whims and fancies. In the background of the Geneva Summer Sessions starting yesterday and with the GSP Plus under question, a Government Minister or any responsible subject Minister should not be allowed to stand up and say whether these prisoners should be allowed to be freed or not. The systemic problem here is the PTA. It is the PTA that allows room for arbitrary decisions to be made. Therefore, unless you repeal the PTA and make sure that you do not bring in any other law that even resembles the PTA, this systematic arbitrary action and injustice will continue. Today, there is not only the PTA, but also the ICCPR Act, which, in order for the Government to try and keep the GSP Plus, was brought in way back under the previous Mahinda Rajapaksa regime. The ICCPR Act, like the PTA, is a cause of injustice. The ICCPR Act, today, is being used for the complete opposite purpose, to victimize innocent people just because they are opposed to the Government's agenda. So, Sir, there is a systemic problem here and I certainly welcome the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa's comments, which comments, I think, had been made by the Tamil Parliamentarians, not only in this Parliament but even previously, and even by the JVP with regard to the PTA and the severe injustice that has been committed. When a Minister stands up and makes those very same comments that we have been making for quite some time, it is welcome, but when we made those comments, we were told that all of us were "kotiyas". When we raise it, we are being told that we are terrorists or terrorist supporters. So, what we are asking the Government is to identify the actual problem, which is the PTA and which is what is creating this systemic injustice, and to make sure that no such law similar to the PTA is brought into law.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Minister? ( ) (The Hon. Namal Rajapaksa) Hon. Speaker, I must first clarify about my Statement. I made it as the Minister of Youth and Sports because I

believe that this is something that concerns the youth. So, it is my duty to bring it to the notice of Parliament.

Also, Sir, we must decide what we want to do with this, whether we want to make it a political issue and debate it in Parliament or whether we want to end this issue now.

What had happened in the past is we have always made it a political issue. Every time you spoke in Parliament, you tried to make it political, but no Government wanted to give an answer. But, we are willing to take a serious note of it and find a solution for that. But, that does not mean - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Those who have been arrested - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Namal Rajapaksa) Listen to me, Hon. Member. There is a law in the country. We have to understand that. What I am trying to say is that these people have been in remand for more than my lifetime. - [Interruption.] So, Sir, you cannot compare them with someone who has been remanded yesterday.

( ) (An Hon. Member) It is a totally different issue. ( ) (The Hon. Namal Rajapaksa) ? . . [ .

So, now, we are trying to do something for those people. Please understand. - [Interruption.] Let us do politics when the elections come.

( ) (An Hon. Member) Exactly! - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Namal Rajapaksa) Hon. Member, you can do politics when the elections come, but for now, let us get together and find a solution for this. - [Interruption.]

On behalf of the Tamil National Alliance, I want to put it on record that we welcome the Statements made by both the Minister of Youth and Sports and the Minister of Justice today in this House with responsibility. We welcome those. I want to put that on record because I do not want the others to say that we somehow made it a political issue. No, we do not; we welcome that move. All that we have asked is to go beyond that and look at this law which all have described as draconian. You must repeal this Prevention of Terrorism Act in toto.

My Colleague, the Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam raised another question with regard to the recent arrests being made under the PTA for social media posts et cetera. That is not warranted. So, we are only adding to certain issues that we have already announced. That does, in no way, take away the good deed that you have announced in this House today.

ADJOURNMENT QUESTIONS

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Sir, I would like to forward this Question to the Hon. Minister of Defence.

Is the Minister of Defence aware of the Resolution adopted by the EU Parliament on 10th June, 2021, which is a scathing indictment of the deteriorating human rights situation in Sri Lanka with specific reference to the continued use of the Prevention of Terrorism Act?

Is the Minister aware that the possibility of losing the GSP Plus concession will severely impact on Sri Lankas already battered economy? These concessions have a direct bearing on industries that provide approximately 275,000 jobs and which contribute up to 40 per cent of the countrys total exports.

Will the Minister take prompt action to review the use of the PTA, a law that undermines the most basic due process safeguards and that has, for decades, been used disproportionately to target minorities? For decades, calls have been made to repeal the PTA, but instead, the Government not only continues to use the PTA, but even issued Regulations under the PTA in March this year which provide more powers to arbitrarily target individuals, including detaining them up to two years without trial.

Hon. Minister, this matter was raised this morning also. I was not aware that this matter would be raised this morning, but by that time, I had already handed this over. We welcome the fact that releasing the people who have been arrested under the PTA would be looked into. However, I would request you to include the people who had been arrested under the Prevention of Terrorism Act last year also in that. Nearly 100 people have been arrested over various silly allegations, I would say, such as posting photos on Facebook. Even most recently there had been a case - I think the EU Parliament has also taken it up seriously - regarding a boy from Mannar who had posted a poem on Facebook - that was posted against terrorism - and who is still under custody. So, Hon. Minister, my request is to include these people also in your effort; when you consider releasing these people, consider this boy as well. Then, there had been a most recent case where a boy had been arrested for posting a photo on Facebook. That boy does not have a limb and a donor from overseas had sent him money to get a prosthetic leg. Now, the charge against him is that the money which had been sent to put that prosthetic leg had been remitted into his account. So, this allegation is really childish. Therefore, my humble request is - we do understand the importance of the GSP Plus and I do not want to connect the two things together - that you consider including these people as well.

, . . . . , . , . , ; , , , , , . , , . , . . .

... ( ... - ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry - Minister of Justice) First of all, I must thank the Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam for raising this issue. Sir, on behalf of the Hon. Minister of Defence, I would like to say that the position of the Government was clearly articulated by the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa in the morning, about how we feel regarding this issue.

The Prevention of Terrorism Act - PTA - had been enacted in Sri Lanka in 1979 as a response to a developing terrorism threat. Taking cognizance of the concerns related to several provisions of the PTA, successive Governments have attempted to amend the provisions or repeal the PTA and to introduce a comprehensive legislation with regard to counter terrorism law in line with the international standards. While the previous Government too attempted to repeal the PTA and introduce a new Counter Terrorism Act, it had not been completed for over four years due to the sensitive nature of the topic and the resistance of the trade unions, students, religious groups and others, based on its impact on freedom. Although the PTA had been placed in abeyance by the previous Government, with the Easter Sunday attacks in April, 2019, the PTA became instrumental in the arrests that followed to stop a second wave of attacks.

The present Government is in the process of revisiting the provisions of the PTA. Towards this endeavour, the existing Legislation is being studied to propose necessary amendments and will also draw on International Best Practices adopted by other jurisdictions.

The Government is seriously working towards the early release of the long-term detainees held under the PTA. In this regard, the Attorney-General is also reviewing the cases filed under the PTA and pending

1219 1220

before the High Court with a view to ensure expeditious disposal of cases involving LTTE cadres in order to bring a meaningful end to the said cases.

Much misunderstanding had been caused by the Regulations that had been published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 2218/68 of 12th March, 2021 for the rehabilitation of those who maybe arrested as a result of the ongoing investigations into the Easter Sunday bombings. The purpose and the objective of the Regulations were to prevent long-standing litigation, as it is happening now, and to send them for rehabilitation and back to the society, not to just take anybody in because if you want to do that, under the PTA, you could do it. Therefore, the objective was to send them for rehabilitation, rehabilitate them and put them back to the society, as we did in 2009.

It is recalled that in the aftermath of the three-decade conflict against terrorism in May, 2009, the Sri Lankan Government decided on the more humane path of rehabilitating and releasing the thousands of former LTTE cadres, instead of prosecuting them. They were about 12,784 in number. Due to the Governments progress and the true commitment to the rehabilitation of the child soldiers and the former child soldiers of the LTTE and considering Sri Lankas successful completion of the Security Council-mandated programmes to end the recruitment and use of children in armed conflicts, Sri Lanka was delisted from the SGs list of shame - Annex II of the UN Security Council Resolution 1612 on Children and Armed Conflict - in June, 2012. The purpose of the Regulations issued under Gazette Extraordinary No. 2218/68 on 12th March, 2021 is to similarly rehabilitate the suspects who are being arrested in the latest investigations into terrorism, instead of prosecuting them.

Further, on 21st June, 2021, yesterday, the Cabinet of Ministers met and decided to appoint a Cabinet Subcommittee and an Officials' Committee to assist the Cabinet Subcommittee to review the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, No 48 of 1979 and to submit a report to the Cabinet within three months. Given the above, the Government categorically rejects the claim that the PTA had been used unfairly.

The Government of Sri Lanka expressed its regret over the adoption of a Resolution on Sri Lanka in the European Parliament on 10th of June 2021 in spite of the significant progress made by Sri Lanka in the promotion and protection of human rights, reconciliation and development and the close and cordial engagement maintained with the EU. The Government of Sri Lanka maintains a regular cordial and multifaceted dialogue with the EU. All aspects of the bilateral relationship came under review at the 23rd Session of the EU-Sri Lanka Joint Commission held on 25th of January, 2021 on a virtual platform.

Sri Lanka maintains an ongoing discussion with the European Commission on the review of Sri Lankas EU GSP Plus compliance with 27 core International

Conventions. The Government of Sri Lanka is cognizant of the significance of the EU market to Sri Lankan exports. The EU is the second largest export market for Sri Lanka, absorbing over one-third of the countrys total exports. The Government of Sri Lanka is fully committed to safeguarding the GSP Plus for Sri Lanka and will continue to maintain a close dialogue with regard to the commitments, while demonstrating the countrys progress in reconciliation and development.

Our attempt to review the PTA and the cases of the people who have been held under the PTA is not because of the GSP Plus or due to any other compulsion, but because, as a Government, we believe that the Criminal Procedure Code and the criminal justice system should continue to evolve and they should be on par with that of the world. So, therefore, we continue to make progress in that direction and we are giving the assurance here that wherever possible, whoever who could be released, we would release. We will expedite the cases and will also work on reviewing the PTA.

Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member.
