Hon. Speaker, they brought Resolutions against Sri Lanka in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Let us not forget that. The Human Rights Commission brought Resolutions orchestrated by various interested countries, especially from the West, against Sri Lanka. Those were passed and adopted without considering Sri Lankas contribution to the UN System and having trust and confidence in Sri Lankas progress in most difficult areas by demining at the fastest rate, return of land and getting 300,000 people to cross from Prabhakarans clutches to the peaceful areas controlled by the Government. Our heroic soldiers carried people who were entrenched and forcibly kept by the LTTE on their shoulders when they wanted to escape across the waters. Let us not forget those instances. Our soldiers performed a heroic duty to protect the Motherland. Our soldiers as well as those who supported this peaceful ending to the conflict were able to bring most of those LTTE cadres back to normal life after their surrender. Over 12,000 LTTE cadres, those who admitted they were LTTE cadres, who had crossed over were trained in various vocations and released to carry on their livelihoods in the country.

Sir, there are some key areas that I want to mention. The housing programmes started by the then Government headed by President Mahinda Rajapaksa and even by the previous Government have been completed today. There are only a few thousand houses left to be built, which the Hon. Prime Minister has taken a decision to complete and budgetary allocations have been made. We have brought everyone back to their places of origin. Sir, all of us know that today, we have got a bumper crop in paddy harvesting areas in the North. Why? Because their life is back to normal. They are being supported by the Government. His Excellency President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, after his victory, gave all the assistance to all districts to get back to normal life.

That was the Order given. The supreme Order that was delivered by the Supreme Court was, "Until you amend or repeal and enact a relevant legislation, an election cannot be held in relation to the provincial councils right across the country". Perhaps, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights does not know or whoever who had written to her had not mentioned the truth. We, as the Government of Sri Lanka, explained to her. We have submitted all the relevant documents to show that the law has to be amended to hold elections for the provincial councils, but still, the High Commissioners report states, "Hold provincial councils elections. If not, the Government is scuttling the provincial councils election".

We came to power. His Excellency President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was elected as the President of the country in November, 2019 and he addressed Parliament and gave an assurance on the conduct of Parliamentary democracy and his full support for the functioning of

Parliament. What happened on 20th of February, 2020? We brought a Resolution before the House seeking supplementary budgetary allocations to pay the unpaid billions of rupees in the accounts of the previous Government. The Opposition wanted to defeat us that day because they were in majority and we were not. That was avoided somehow on that day peacefully. And the President had to dissolve Parliament at the earliest opportunity under the Constitution, which fell on the 2nd of March, 2020.

I attended the Geneva Sessions where, with the mandate of the President, I informed that we would withdraw from the co-sponsorship of the previous Resolutions. Even yesterday, this question was posed. Co-sponsorship of those Resolutions was unconstitutional, which would have deliberately led us on a path allowing our sovereignty to be suppressed by many other countries together. Co-sponsorship of the Resolutions was intended very clearly to take our heroic forces before international tribunals and to punish them. Constitutionally, no foreign judges can serve in our judicial system, but the co-sponsored Resolutions agreed to all that. That was a great betrayal, I am sorry to say. The very next day, I remember, the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa and our Members in the Opposition raised that and a debate was given. The Government was already divided soon after the adoption of it in September.

Let us be clear. We informed the United Nations Human Rights Council as well as the Commissioner for Human Rights that the supreme judicial authority of Sri Lanka is the Supreme Court and that a Supreme Court Judge has been appointed as the head of this Presidential Commission of Inquiry; . .

Sir, the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva adopted by a Vote the Draft Resolution titled Promoting Reconciliation, Accountability and Human Rights in Sri Lanka tabled by a core group of countries on 23rd March, 2021 during its 46th Session. Out of the 47 Members of the Council, 22 countries voted in favour, 11 voted against and 14 abstained by not voting in favour. It is implicit from the voting results that the majority of the Council members did not support this Resolution. At this Meeting, Sri Lanka, as the country concerned, reiterated its position on that Resolution against the country and the politically motivated process behind it, as has been briefed to the Human Rights Council before, including through my Statement at the High-Level Segment of 43rd Session in February last year. Sri Lanka rejected the Resolution, which had no consensus, and requested the Members of the Human Rights Council to reject it by a vote. I have provided a briefing on this matter to the Cabinet of Ministers itself.

Sir, I am tabling* the Draft Resolution of the United Nations Human Rights Council and the Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on Sri Lanka.

Sir, Sri Lanka considers the Draft Resolution to be unwarranted, unjustified and in violation of the relevant Articles of the United Nations Charter, in particular Article 2 (7), and relevant Sections of the United Nations Resolution 60/251 which provides for the mandate of the Human Rights Council. For the above reasons, this Resolution against Sri Lanka is illegal.

The very first sentence of the Resolution states, Guided by the purpose and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, ... Having said so, the Resolution goes on to violate Article 2 (7) of the Charter which states, Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state.

We are a sovereign State which have been cooperating with the United Nations. We will protect our sovereignty; we are a democracy. We are the oldest Parliamentary democracy in Asia. We have enjoyed universal suffrage for 90 years, Sir. Today, we are being told that elections are not being held. We have held all the elections that could be held when the Election Commission decided. If the Election Commission cannot decide to hold elections because the previous Government had passed legislations to scuttle the election process, we have to correct it in order to hold elections. That is the position the Government has taken and that is the reality all of us face.

This intervention denies a State the right enshrined in the Charter and other UN instruments in respect of the right of its peoples to choose its system of governance, developing the institutions to govern itself and developing arrangements to meet national challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic in keeping with its civilizational values within the provisions of the Constitution.

Acting beyond the mandate granted to the UNHRC by UN Resolution 60/251 and recognize the importance of preserving evidence. Instead, to promote and protect human rights; to make recommendations relating to human rights violations; and be guided by universality, impartiality, objectivity, and non-selectivity.

To address accountability through a domestic mechanism and address violations of International Humanitarian Law and derogated International Human Rights Laws within the context of International Laws acceptable to the community of nations.

That is what we are involved in by appointing these committees, commissions and what we are doing on the ground, Sir.

This Resolution against Sri Lanka is pushed forward at the behest of a few countries representing one part of the world without the consent of Sri Lanka. It is, therefore, unhelpful and divisive. There is no moral right to interfere with the affairs of a sovereign country in this manner.

No country has a greater interest in bringing about reconciliation among its peoples than Sri Lanka, a point that has repeatedly been emphasized during the proceedings of the Human Rights Council.

The list of co-sponsors of the Resolution amply demonstrates the divisive manner of such country-

specific initiatives and it is clear from the result of the Vote on 23rd of March that there is no consensus within the Council on this Resolution.

The Resolution adopted on the 23rd of March is intrusive of the sovereignty of the people of Sri Lanka and the core values of the UN Charter. It will have an adverse effect on the ongoing efforts to maintain peace and reconciliation and on economic development in Sri Lanka as well as be a precedent to other countries. It will lead to polarization of our societies.

Sri Lanka categorically rejects the unprecedented proposal in this Resolution to expand the role of the OHCHR. This sets a dangerous precedent and will have wide-ranging implications for all other countries. The Council cannot assume tasks not assigned to it by the UN General Assembly by Resolution 60/251 or subsequent Resolutions.

This Resolution is based on the rejected Report by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on Sri Lanka presented at the 46th Session of the HRC, which violates the principles of sovereign equality of all States and non-interference in internal affairs. The Government of Sri Lanka has rejected that Report, pointing out that, among other things, it is one-sided and exceeds the Mandate of the UN Human Rights Council. It contains sweeping recommendations, unsubstantiated and unwarranted comments essentially of political nature, which no self-respecting, sovereign country can accept. It has been complied within months after the formation of a new Government in Sri Lanka without any field visit, while the whole world was grappling with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

. . , . , . .

A well-orchestrated propaganda campaign was launched against Sri Lanka ahead of the 46th Session of the Human Rights Council. This campaign was carried out with extensive focus on Sri Lanka while reports pertaining to the situation in over ten other countries were presented at the 46th Session of the HRC. The synchronized content of the propaganda against Sri Lanka and the exploitation of the OHCHR mechanisms in doing so demonstrated a clear case of a premeditated endeavour.

Sir, I wish to recall that last year, I had briefed the House of the reasons which led to the withdrawal from the co-sponsorship of the HRC Resolution 40/1 and its preceding Resolutions 34/1 and 30/1, which was announced at the 43rd Session

of the UN Human Rights Council in February last year. It is unfortunate that the unconstitutional action of co-sponsorship of a Resolution against Sri Lanka by the previous Government brought to a halt the comprehensive post-conflict development process which included a domestic reconciliatory process.

This new Resolution, in an unwarranted manner, seeks to interfere in all matters that are domestic affairs of a sovereign country.

We questioned the Members of the UNHRC whether Sri Lanka represents a case warranting the immediate attention of the Human Rights Council. Sri Lanka has only defeated a secessionist terrorist campaign and acted within its legal rights to defend its territorial integrity also in accordance with the UN Mandate after 9/11.

Sri Lanka regrets that this Resolution seeks to create a perception of discrimination and marginalization of its people, which is far from the truth. Issues affecting the people of Sri Lanka are common to all people irrespective of their ethnicity or religion. The Government is determined to achieve its main targets to improve the lives of the people despite these distractions. No sovereign government is bound to work according to the external prescriptions, but be guided by the democratic aspirations of its own people. Sri Lanka has a well-established, time-honoured legal system which is capable of ensuring dispensation of justice according to the Constitution of Sri Lanka.

Sir, I would like to refer to to the headlines of an article in the "The Island" of Saturday, 20th March. It states, I quote:

UK suppressed wartime HC dispatches unfavorable to Western strategy at UNHRC"

" 20-year UN ban on examination of accusations...

643 644

The newspaper reports an exclusive interview given by the former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva. He has referred to the submissions of Lord Naseby in the House of Lords, requesting the British Government to release all the confidential papers that have to be released at least to the Human Rights Commission. We are aware that the British officials who were reporting on security matters had reported that all these allegations are false, that the figures are false and unsubstantiated, which were given by various individuals to bring Sri Lanka to disrepute. Let us face this issue. Any Member of the Opposition or my good Friend from the TNA could show those documents to the world or to the Human Rights Commission, if they have access to these documents. But, Lord Naseby has access to those documents because they have been made public after a long battle with Lord Naseby, and he has published a book. He has the reports and he is openly calling upon the British Government to submit those confidential dispatches. So, Sir, the British initiative to lead the core group while suppressing information that is available with them is unwarranted.

Sir, I would like to say that the Government remains committed to protect those who have made immeasurable sacrifices to neutralize terrorism, protect the territorial integrity of the country and to regain for all people in Sri Lanka the most cherished of all rights, the right to life. It is regrettable that the proponents of the Resolution seek to create ambiguous mechanisms with funds of millions of US dollars at a time of severe financial constraints faced by the UN. We call upon the proponents of this Resolution to divest the money allocated for the implementation of this unprecedented proposal to improve the lives of the people affected by the conflict. This huge amount of funds is sufficient to build thousands of houses for the people in the Jaffna Peninsula. If these funds are directed that way, to a more positive cause, it would be more valuable at this juncture. They can make use of this money to help those affected by the conflict and to vaccinate the population of the entire Jaffna Peninsula and in other areas in the country against COVID-19, without spending these funds for other purposes like just to keep the officials visiting and inquiring against countries.

I must deviate to mention this also. Sir, even today, over 100 countries in the world are voicing their need for the vaccination. But, not a single vaccine has been available to those 100 odd countries. So, is this the time that we should deprive all these countries of the vaccines, endangering human lives and engage in an unnecessary inquiry?

Sri Lanka has set up a mechanism domestically, which can provide justice to all those who have been affected, if they say so, and bring to book those who have allegations, if they say so. In addition to the LLRC, the Paranagama and other Commissions of Inquiry, this Commission will function to the end.

As I mentioned earlier, I made the position of the Government on this politically motivated process against

the country clear and undertook deliverable commitments in keeping with Sri Lankas domestic and international obligations at the 43rd Session of the UN Human Rights Council. The Council has been well briefed on all measures taken and the progress made under the challenging circumstances amidst a global pandemic within the relative short period of time by the country headed by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Reasons for this political campaign against Sri Lanka may vary from their domestic electoral compulsions to geopolitical interests. It is regrettable that countries with vested interests seek to achieve their political and strategic ambitions either through political destabilization or economic deprivation of the less influential countries of the global South, using the Human Rights Council as a tool. We are aware that some of the countries which stood by Sri Lanka at this Vote withstood immense pressure on them in doing so. We thank all the countries who braved such adversity to reject the Resolution.

Sir, I would like to table* the list of countries which voted with Sri Lanka and the list of countries which did not favour the Resolution brought by the Core Group of countries.

We are also mindful that some of Sri Lankas sincere friends were constrained to abstain. We thank them also for sharing with us their principled stands. In this context, Sri Lanka is of the view that this Vote provided an opportunity for the member countries of the United Nations to reassess whether the Human Rights Council is keeping with its guiding principles or not.

Finally, Sir, I would like to say that despite the Vote on this Resolution against Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka will pursue its domestic mechanisms aimed at bringing about reconciliation and lasting peace, as pledged and briefed earlier before the UN agencies. Sri Lanka will continue to engage constructively with the UN and its agencies in the same spirit of cooperation shown for over six decades for the betterment of the people, including through the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals in keeping with domestic priorities and policies as well as international obligations and undertakings.

, . The oral update will again come up at the 48th Session, the written updates at the 49th Session and comprehensive reporting at the 51st Session. So, there is a long way to go.

[12.27 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara - Minister of Water Supply) Sir, it is very difficult to answer the comments made by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition in ten minutes. But, I must say one thing, that we have a Supreme Court that goes into human rights violations. Therefore, we do not need a Council in Geneva to declare that we have violated human rights. I do not see why the Hon. Leader of the Opposition should go along with those elements who have been campaigning against us regarding human rights violations, while they themselves have domestically violated human rights in their own countries in a worse manner. But, they are your friends. Therefore, you have to keep a blind eye on that.

To the terrorists, I would say this. , . . , , , . Those terrorists must remember this: we will identify you; we will detect you; we will dismantle you and we will destroy your ideological camps and yourselves, if you are committed to terrorism in this country.

To the Islamic community, I say this. , , , . , . 21 .

Sir, to the Catholic and Christian Church and to the most Venerable Cardinal, I have to say this: I urge you to collectively show those terrorists what true forgiveness is, which is the central teaching of Jesus and his gospel. If you really believe that God forgive you, then you ought

to forgive the aggression against you as well. Do not ever forget the central teaching of Jesus written in Matthew 5:38, which states, I quote:

You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.

But, I will tell you the new rule. "Whoever slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek also to him", Jesus said. I believe this should be the best punishment the Christian Church can give to the terrorist.

Presiding Member, I thank you for allocating some time for me to speak on this Adjournment Motion. Many Hon. Members have been saying various things with regard to the Easter bombings, the Presidential Commission on the Easter Attacks and the way in which the Commission was conducted. But, many people do not talk about the culture that has begun to emanate from those Easter bombings and even prior to that. If we fail to look at the background in which these incidents took place, I think this Report becomes meaningless; even if the Report is credible, it becomes meaningless.

The Hon. Member who spoke before me and also the Hon. Prasanna Ranatunga, Minister of Tourism, mentioned that the Muslim community had worked very closely with the Sri Lankan defence establishment when it comes to intelligence gathering during the LTTESri Lankan State armed struggle, and they are right. Not only that, if you take the Muslim political leadership, it has been, to a great extent, if not almost always,

703 704

supportive of the Sri Lankan State to the point that the Tamil people were quite annoyed and were quite upset with the fact that fellow Tamil-speaking brethren chose to take the side of the State when they fully knew that the Tamil people were being marginalized and systematically discriminated against. So, that is how loyal the Muslim political leadership has been towards the Sri Lankan State and also how loyal many members of the community have been working in the intelligence services.

But, Hon. Presiding Member, once the war was brought to an end, it is the Muslim community unlike any other, not even the Tamils, that has been targeted, discriminated against and that virulent anti-Islamic propaganda was being meted out. Nobody can deny it. This culture of Islamophobia that has been propagated in this country, particularly since after the war, has reached to such heights that it is radicalizing the Muslim community themselves because they feel like victims. That is the fact; that is the reality. When you begin to target a community that has been loyal to you, to the State, and when you begin to bring out the sort of virulent, almost fascist dialogues against them and portray them as someone who is not wanted and someone who is pestilent, naturally, you are bound to radicalize that community. There is absolutely no doubt certainly in my mind, Hon. Presiding Member, that this country is going downhill. It is going downhill not because of Sinhala Buddhist nationalism - I have no problems with nationalisms - but because that Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism is being usurped into racism. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) It is being usurped into racism and that racism is being deliberately targeted towards non-Sinhala Buddhists. If you want to pursue your own interests, if you want to, in some way, build up your own identity and safeguard your own people, by all means, do it. You are more than entitled to do so. Sinhala Buddhists only exist in this country. We believe that; we know that. So, that identity has to be protected. We have no problems with that. But, if, for that reason, you choose to target all other communities and choose to create a narrative that makes this country mutually exclusive, then you are bound to radicalize.

I have been making the charge, very unfortunately, that Sri Lanka is becoming a racist State. It has been becoming an ethnocracy, but it is now becoming a racist State and the proof that I have for that is the way in which the Muslims are being treated post-war. And, Hon. Presiding Member, I will conclude by just saying this. You see, this racism coupled with the sort of militarization - the North-East has been militarized for well over 40 years - that is taking place in the South is not

something that can be ignored. There are very senior Hon. Members here who know that when you have a tendency of being racist plus with that militarization and the fact that you think that the military can get involved in almost anything including civil administration, those are the cornerstones, the foundations for fascism. I warn the Hon. Members of this House - there are senior Hon. Members in this House today - that what is happening today is the very first, fundamental step, a very clear direction towards fascism.

I thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 11 . [.. 3.14] ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) , . , . .. , . . . , , , . . . .

, ' ' . . , . , , . . . . ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , , 6 . [3.47 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) Hon. Presiding Member, it is with a heavy heart that I speak today on the Adjournment Motion relating to the Final Report of the Easter Sunday attack. I sympathize with all the families that were affected by this ghastly attack and everyone who has lost a loved one due to terrorism and assassinations since I too have lost my father due to dastardly, cowardly acts of terrorism.

Hon. Presiding Member, today, the whole country is looking for answers. Who is the mastermind behind this terrorist attack? Who made the plans? Who trained them? Who brainwashed them? Was there a conspiracy?

? If so, who are the conspirators? The whole country is asking those questions and they also want justice. Who funded this? ? , ? Are they still at large? If so, where are they now? Are they overseas? In short, who is the Osama Bin Laden behind the Easter Sunday attacks in Sri Lanka? Was there international support? Why did certain Cabinet Ministers say that Zahran was paid before 2015? Who paid him? These are the questions that the whole country is asking, Sir.

Look at Nalaka de Silvas statement. , ; the truth will surface. We must ask these questions as leaders and politicians of this country. What happened to Nalaka Kumara? Why was the investigation against him stopped or dropped? I wish to remind this august Assembly that there was a Government of the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa for 52 days in 2018. Till December, that Government continued. He was in power; there was a new Cabinet; new appointments were made; police transfers were made and intelligent officers were also transferred out. Serious allegations are levelled against this Government and no answers are forthcoming, Sir.

, , , , . , . ? Who held the Ministry of Defence? Who held the Ministry of Law and Order? We must ask these questions, Sir. Those were held by the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa and his Government for that short period of time.

Sir, politicians must be humane; they must be honest. During a national crisis, the country must unite and the political leadership of this country must unite the country. , . , . He promised justice for all those who have been affected in three months. It has been one and a half years since that promise was made. They campaigned for a two-thirds majority saying that they will solve all the problems in this country. They said that a system change would be made. Hon. Presiding Member why do we buy brands?

DSI "" ? Because we believe in those brands. . . They thought that they could trust him and he would do the system change that he promised. But, unfortunately, Sir, it is the same old same old. So, what has happened now? What has happened to that system change? Sir, where are

711 712

we heading this way? , . , , " " . " " , . When we look for answers, people in this country are saying that the Government has failed. They have failed them.

What happened in Geneva? . , , . . .

. , . He used to tell us a famous quote of Abraham Lincoln: You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time. . I took this quote from Abraham Lincoln and my father used to tell me this quote when I was young.

Thank you, Sir, for the time given. , . . ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , .
