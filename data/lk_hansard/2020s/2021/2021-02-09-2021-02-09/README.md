[2.36 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Presiding Member, todays Regulations under the Employees' Provident Fund Act which deal with wages are important particularly for the estate sector workers who have been agitating for a salary increase of Rs. 1,000 for quite some time and with the increase in the cost of living during that period of time, it should have now become Rs. 2,000 at least. Nevertheless, even that Rs. 1,000 is not being given to them.

In the last few days, in the last week, we had a protest march from Pottuvil to Polikandy with ten demands placed before the Government and this was one of those. I would like to, for the purpose of record, read out those ten demands because it is important that the record is straight and miscommunication, misinterpretation, misinformation be avoided. The ten demands are as follows:

1029 1030

[ ( ) ]

2021 29

1. Continuing land grab in Tamil areas and converting our traditional and historical places into Sinhalese areas by establishing Buddhist temples after destroying Hindu temples. The Government is also targeting around 200 temples for this purpose.

2. Since the war ended ten years ago, the militarization of Tamil areas is continuing and Tamils' historical identity is destroyed with the aim to change demography in favour of Sinhalese, using different Government departments, especially the Archaeological Department. Also, the Government-sponsored Sinhalese settlements are continuing.

3. Disturbingly, the Government is targeting journalists who bring to light human rights abuses and civil society activists who protest human rights abuses.

4. Tamil cattle owners are facing numerous problems, where their grazing areas are being occupied by Sinhalese and their cows are killed.

5. Tamils have been denied the right to remember their war dead, as demonstrated by denying remembrance events, destruction of cemeteries of the war dead and demolition of memorials.

6. Muslims who died due to COVID are cremated against the wishes of the families and against Islamic teachings.

7. PTA, which has been used to imprison Tamil youths without charge or trial for over 40 years, is now being used against Muslims.

8. Tamil political prisoners have been imprisoned for years without trial. The Government pardoned Sinhalese on a regular basis, but none of the Tamil political prisoners were pardoned.

9. Families of the enforced disappeared have been protesting to find their loved ones, but the Government refuses to give them an answer.

10. Tamils in the upcountry are urging for a pay raise of 1,000 rupees, but the Government is not responding to their demands.

Those were the ten matters that were put forward by the North East Civil Society Forum and I read off their letter dated 01st February, 2021. This protest that was organized by the civil societies was supported by our party too based on these demands and these are all justifiable demands. These are matters of justice and we had a right to democratically express our protest and the march was peaceful and was a huge success. People turned up in their numbers to support these demands and I urge the Government to take this to heart and to respond to these democratic wishes of the people of the North and the East.

But, soon after the conclusion of this event, as you have seen in the media, my special security was withdrawn. I also want to make it clear that I never made a complaint to anybody that I needed special security or that there was ever any threat to my life. All of these

matters were matters that the Government put forward. There is a case in the High Court of Colombo - HC 242/2018 - where four persons have been indicted for attempting on my life. There are other cases, I have a bundle here of all the cases, which the police have filed against various persons. I did not know any of these existed until the police arrested and detained over 30 persons including 15 from the South, Sinhalese persons, who belonged to the underworld here. One of those cases here is B6284/2019 in the Chief Magistrates Court. So, if the position of the Government is, as they have detained so many persons without my knowledge or my complaint, that there is a threat to my life, why would they withdraw the special security accorded to me for this particular reason?

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am concluding, Sir.

Either it must be that this is true, but the Government has withdrawn my security because they are annoyed with me for participating in this protest or this is not true and they have detained, unnecessarily, innocent persons. Or the third, which is the most sinister, is that by withdrawing my security, they have given signals to those who would now act and if anything should happen, the Government must take the responsibility for that.

Thank you.

[3.52 p.m.]

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, I am fully aware that a number of speeches I made in this House did not go down quite well, particularly with the Members of the Government side. But, I work on the basis that my views and the views of my constituency must be accurately voiced. That is important because the Hon. Members opposite and the Hon. Members on this side must know the true meaning of what our constituency says and just because it might be unpopular or just because it might come up against some resistance, we must not try and edit what was actually said or done.

In that respect, I wish to point out that the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran, in making his comments today with regard to the protest march that took place from Pottuvil to Polikandy over the last five days which ended on the 07th, claimed that that march was based on ten demands. Those demands were indeed made; there can be no doubt about that. But, those ten demands were not the only demands that were made. In fact, there were four core demands that were made and those four core demands were enunciated or voiced by His Worship Valan Swamigal at the end of the march in Polikandy. The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran did

not wait till the conclusion of the march; he left early in a hurry. I wish to place this on record because it is important to know that thousands of people, over 60,000 people, marched from Pottuvil to Polikandy not purely to make certain demands with regard to the Government.

They put forward core demands that were essentially political in character and this House must be informed of those four core demands. The first is, the recognition of the North-East as the Tamil-speaking Tamil and Muslim peoples homeland. The second is, the recognition of the Tamils as a distinct nation. The third is, the right to self-determination of the Tamil nation. The fourth, which is important, is the referral of Sri Lanka to the ICC and other international accountability mechanisms to look into and investigate the crime of genocide that happened and is continuing to happen, which is being committed by the State. With regard to the Hon. Members sitting opposite, that might be controversial, but that is a fact and those facts must not be hidden. It is on that basis that I wish to make a small correction to the Hon. Sumanthirans comments earlier this morning.

Sir, we are talking about employees. I also wish to - () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

Sir, the Hon. Member made a reference to genocide and said, "It is happening now". I would like him to clarify whether he meant now or what he really means by "genocide", Sir. Thank you.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) The Hon. Member knows genocide is not only loss of life. When you target a particular national group in order to get rid of their identity as a nationality, that amounts to genocide. Whilst targeting of lives happened right up to 2009, the complaint that the Hon. Sumanthiran was making about those ten demands was with regard to the systematic dismantling of the existence of the Tamils as a nation within the North-East. Colonization is taking place through the Archaeological Department and various activities with sinister motives are also taking place. So, it is with regard to the continuing process of dismantling the identity of the Tamils that we say genocide is continuing.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Hon. Member -

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I have only seven minutes. If your party will give me the rest of the time needed, I am quite happy to answer your questions. - [Interruption.] Okay.

1055 1056

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) What we understand by the word genocide, Hon. Member, is the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular group.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) If you read Article 5 of the Rome Statute, it will make it very clear, Hon. Member.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . .

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Member, I have very little time and I just want to make this point also. - [Interruption.]

Sir, with regard to employees, I wish to make this point.

( ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal) Hon. Member, can I have just a minute?

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I want five minutes because five minutes of my time has been taken by others. - [Interruption.] I am quite happy to answer, but give me some time.

( ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal) For the benefit of my learned Hon. Member, I also want to say that the word "genocide" means the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or an ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group. Your assessment of the word genocide is used in a completely wrongful manner. So, just make sure that that is corrected. I think my Friend, the Hon (Dr.) Harsha de Silva also made the same point. So, I hope we made it clear to you.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) It is a matter I am quite happy to - ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . .

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, I want four minutes. Both sides of the House have to give me four minutes. I am quite happy to accommodate them. But, they must not take my time.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . .

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) The relevant Minister is here. I also want to bring up certain issues relating to the Hon. Minister who sits next to him, the Minister of Higher Education.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) (.32 . .

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) The definition of "genocide" is not what you say. That is a very non-legal definition. Kindly look at Article 5 of the Rome Statue.- [Interruption.] Now, can I continue with my speech? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) ( ) .

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Hon Member, you cannot use the word genocide loosely.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I am not using it loosely. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) They may be in the Government; I am in the Opposition.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . .

1057 1058

2021 29

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva, with all due respect to you - I am a qualified lawyer - I am very careful with the words I use. I think you, of all people, know that I will not make baseless allegations. I was also a witness to what happened. It is on that basis that I am telling you that genocide took place and it is the duty of the Tamil people to ask for justice for that genocide, and it is continuing - [Interruption.] When you dismantle the identity of a nation, as you yourself read, it is destroying, in whole or in part, of that identity and that is the crime of genocide. Genocide does not only include the absolute loss of life.

( ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal) It is not a legal term; it is a simple English word. The meaning of that English word is what we should be conscious of and it should not be used in a loose manner. As my Friend, the Hon.(Dr.) Harsha de Silva also mentioned, it must be used in the correct context, with the correct meaning. If that is not done, I think it is unfair.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal, I think I am more qualified to talk about the context in which the term is being used because it is a legal term.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) It is a legal term; it is not a colloquial term. You all are giving colloquial interpretations to it, but it is a legal term and it is on the basis of that legal term that I am talking. Please look at Article 5 of the Rome Statute and then, we can have a debate on this. Why do you not ask your honourable Frontbenchers to organize a debate on this? Ask your President also to come and take part; he has a seat here. That would be a good idea and there is nothing to hide.

It is even better to sign the Rome Statute. Why does the Government not sign the Rome Statute so that we can check? We can go to the ICC and actually find out whether genocide took place or not. Why are you running away from that, Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal? Tell me that, without disturbing me. The point I want to make is, with regard to recruitment, -

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . .

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) No, I will take two minutes more, Sir.

The Jaffna University is recruiting people from the Ministry of Education. This is with regard to employment of non-academic staff and it is a matter of urgency. When His Excellency the President took office, he made a statement quite correctly - probably, the only correct thing that he did - to say that no political appointments must be made, that it has ruined the country and no political appointments must be made. In doing so, the UGC has suspended Circular No. 876 which essentially allows the Ministry of Education to come up with a list to appoint non-academic staff members. There is no transparency; there is no accountability. Nobody knows how people get on that list. The earlier system was that you used to advertise for vacancies, people would apply and the qualified people would get the jobs. Here, despite the President suspending Circular No. 876, the Jaffna University has been sent a list from the Ministry to recruit staff. We all know that it is the Hon. Douglas Devananda and the Hon. Angajan Ramanathan who have filled that list. So, is this cronyism going to continue? Despite the President openly saying and making it a policy - in fact, he made it a policy in his Policy Statement- is this going to continue? Either the President is not being told the truth -

( ) (The Hon. Premitha Bandara Tennakoon) Hon. Presiding Member, I think I must respond to the Hon. Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam who is a popular LTTE sympathizer.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, what is the point of Order?

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, all I am saying is, if the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva and the Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal can convince their respective leaders, we can have a debate. Why should we run away from that?

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .

( ) (The Hon. Premitha Bandara Tennakoon) Hon. Presiding Member, I must respond to the Hon. Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam who is a popular LTTE sympathizer who has tried and who is still trying to portray the LTTE as a freedom movement. Sir, the Hon. Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam is trying to portray Prabhakaran as a hero. I must remind him that Prabhakaran was no hero, he was no Mandela, he was certainly, no Mahatma Gandhi and he was no Martin Luther King. In plain simple English - you do not need a dictionary to understand this - he was a terrorist, he was a murderer, he was a hooligan, he was a thug! That is what he was. So, I tell you, Hon. Member, this country has fought enough, bled enough and the same divide, you seek today here in this House. I tell you, enough is enough. We must look forward and build a better world for our future generations. I urge in this House, this peoples House, that we must stand against this kind of speeches made by the Hon. Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam here in this House. - [Interruption.]

. . . Sir, the LTTE took 6,000 child soldiers from their parents and used them in the war. - [Interruption.] Hon. Member, I am sorry, this is my time. I did not disturb you. Now, it is time for you to listen to my words. Hon. Member, please listen to me.
