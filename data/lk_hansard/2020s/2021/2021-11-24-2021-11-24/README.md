[ ] ! ; " " [ ] , , [ ] ? [ ] ,- [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] ? , ? , - , ; , , , , [ ] , , The moves we see today are direct attempts to silence the democratic nature and the independence of the Public Service. Those can have severe consequences for the country that we all want to serve. I will use an example from the Nazi Germany. Adolph Eichmann was a Nazi operative responsible for organizing the transportation of millions of Jews and others to various concentration camps in their attempt for the Final Solution. But, Hannah Arendt, a political theorist, coined the term the banality of evil after watching his 1961 trial. Arendt found Eichmann an ordinary, rather bland bureaucrat who, in her words, was "neither perverted no sadistic" but "terrifyingly normal". He acted without any motive other than to diligently advance his position in the Nazi bureaucracy. Eichmann was not an amoral monster, she concluded in her study of the case. Instead, he performed his deeds without evil intentions because of his own disengagement from the reality of his evil acts. Therefore, Arendt argues that evil acts are not necessarily perpetrated by evil people, but they can simply be the result of bureaucrats dutifully doing and obeying political orders.

The question that I am asking today is, are we just following orders dutifully or are we upholding the rule of law and the Constitution, which all of us, the public

servants, have sworn to protect? You all were recruited to the Public Service because you demonstrated extreme talent, a burning desire to serve this country and to make it a better place for our families so that they do not have to join the passport queue. You are the arms of the Government and democracy. So, let us make sure that that desire is not stamped out.

Democracy is not following the orders of elected politicians; democracy is not following those orders at the expense of ethics and the subversion of the law. , , , O/L ; A/L ; "Z" ; ; Class , , , , " " , ?

I would like to quote from an original text that has been published by the Cornell University of New York, the digital library collection on The Making of America in their 75th independence. The title of the document is English in Ceylon in the journal of the United States Magazine of the Democratic Review in May, 1851. I would like to take a few moments to quote an important section from this - "English in Ceylon" May, 1851. In this, it goes on to explain in detail the era of Torrington horrors and how he dealt with the Maha Sangha and the innocent people of this country, introducing four obnoxious taxes including one on taxing puppies and murdering them, if payments were not made.

( ) (The Hon. Yadamini Gunawardena) I am concluding. Please allow me to wind up, and give me two minutes. I just want to quote one more section.

Torrington in a dispatch to Earl Grey -

An influential priest who was convicted of administering treasonable oaths, was shot at Kandy in full robes. This priests trial took place at Kandy, and he was arraigned -

First, apprehension of a proclaimed rebel, Kudahapola Unanse, on or about 17th August, 1848. Second, for a treasonable oath to one Kerri Bande, on or about the 17th August, 1848.

More, Earl Grey, in answer to Torringtons dispatch announcing the execution, pronounced the death of the Buddhist priest to be highly satisfactory!

In the name of the Queen, complimented Torrington, and declared his complete approval of his decision, and judgment.

Thus sustained by the Home Government, Torrington must feel proud and happy! After all the massacres, burnings and confiscations after he had made.

Why I am bringing this up is that in the same period -

Hon. Presiding Member, this is a Parliament that has several opinions. Those opinions might not be acceptable to quite a few. We represent various constituencies and when a Member stands up and speaks on behalf of his

279 280

constituency, that voice must be heard. Just because a majority of the Members here might not like a particular opinion being voiced, that does not permit anybody to silence that voice. So, kindly make sure that the Hon. Speaker also understands that perspective because he himself, on several occasions, did not seem to have understood that.
