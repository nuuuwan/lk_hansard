PRIVILEGE: NOTIFICATION OF AN ARREST OF A

MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, please allow me to raise my matter of Privilege. After that you all can move on to the main Debate. I have no problem.

Sir, I must thank you for giving me the time. I am raising a Question on the Powers and Privileges concerning this House. As I told you, the failure to notify the House of an arrest of an Hon. Member and the failure to notify the House on the need to question an MP who has already appeared before a Presidential Commission of Inquiry are violations of Privileges of this House, not only of the Members.

The Hon. Harin Fernando is a very vocal critic of the Government in this House. The police attempted to interrogate him on a statement made by his father, which was already examined by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry, and thereafter take him into custody. This was prevented by an Order of the Supreme Court. A similar issue has come up in connection with the Hon. Hon. Rishad Bathiudeen - a violation of the need for notification.

Hon. Speaker, powers of this House is unique.

Article 3 and Article 4 of the Constitution give the legislative power of the people to us and according to Article 62(1) of the Constitution, the Parliament that consists of 225 Members elected by the people is the body that is in charge with the grave duty of legislating and supervising the Government. Therefore, if Parliament is to function, the Members cannot be subject to any pressure or intimidation. This is a principle which came from 1642 when the Speaker Lenthall told King Charles the First, I quote:

May it please your majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as this house is pleased to direct me whose servant I am here;

This led to a civil war where the Parliament won and the King was executed. That is how this was brought in.

Then, we also have Powers and Privileges of Parliament under Article 67 of the Constitution and we can also act according to Section 7 of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act which states, I quote:

Parliament and the members thereof shall hold, enjoy and exercise, in addition to the privileges, immunities and powers conferred by this Act, such and the like immunities as are for the time being held, enjoyed and exercised by the Commons House of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and by the members thereof.

1971 1972

2021

Therefore, this Parliament can exercise the same immunities as the House of Commons of the United Kingdom which can be enforced under Article 4(c) of the Constitution to safeguard the ability of this House to function free of executive pressure on its Members in the exercise of the legislative power of the people.

So, first, let me deal with the question of the Hon. Harin Fernando.

The facts are: he rang me on the day of the explosion and told me that his sister had told him that morning that the previous night his father had said not to go to church and to be careful as there could be a trouble. Now what are we talking? Let us presume that the Hon. Harin Fernandos father gave the information. If the police did not act on the information given by the Indian intelligence services, do you think that they were going to act on what was said by the Hon. Harin Fernandos father? All the information was there. The next morning, the Indians gave the information. So, when all that information was there and they did not act on it, do you think the police was going to act -

() ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera - Minister of Public Security) You were the Prime Minister at that time. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I know that. I am telling you the facts. So, let me finish.

Do you think the police was going to act on what Hon. Fernando was going to say, which he would have found out from some police officer? So, if you now come to question him on a matter which is not relevant, which has been dealt by a Presidential Commission of Inquiry, there is only one conclusion: they want to intimidate him.

Erskine May has said that attempts to influence Members in their conduct by threat is a breach of Parliamentary Privilege. So, this is an intimidation of a Member which violates the Privileges of the House. It also means that it is a failure to provide correct information to the Speaker. They said, We want to question him on these issues, but the fact is that it has already been done and finished and the inquiry was why the police did not act. So, they gave the Speaker and the House false information.

Then, I want to come to the next issue, which is the arrest of MPs who are part of the House of Commons, their Privileges and Immunities. Firstly, the Speaker of the House of Commons gave a Ruling on the 03rd of March, 1959. Column 226 of Volume 601of the Official Report states, I quote:

The origin of the doctrine of freedom from arrest which attaches to all Members of Parliament during a Session of Parliament lies in the fact that this House is entitled to have a first claim upon their services and that any person who, by an action of arrest or hindrance, prevents a Member from attending in his place to do his duty is guilty of contempt of the whole House.

I would also like to quote what Sir William Blackstone said at that time:

'The chief, if not the only, privilege of Parliament, in such cases, seems to be the right of receiving immediate information of the imprisonment or the detention of any Member, with the reason for which he is detained.'"

So, that, basically, is a very old right which has been exercised by Members in the House. I am only asking that this be followed.

Then, I would like to deal a little bit further, if the House permits me, on the requirement of Privilege. I think it is there in the article I gave you, Hon. Speaker, but I am reading it for the information of the House. It states, I quote:

Erskine May states that in all cases in which Members of either House are arrested on criminal charges, the House must be informed of the cause for which they are detained from their service in Parliament.

It comes from there.

Before Erskine May, Parliamentary Privileges were referred to by Mr. John Hatsell. He says, I quote:

..it is highly expedient, that, whenever the public necessity appears to the Ministers of the Crown to justify any breach of this privilege, they should as soon as possible acquaint the House with the steps they have taken and the grounds and the reasons ....

Furthermore, Erskine May says, I quote:

Thus, the house will not allow even the sanctuary of its walls to protect a Member from the process of criminal law..."

We accept that.

"..But in all cases in which Members are arrested on criminal charges, the House must be informed of the cause for which they are detained from their service in Parliament.

"The House therefore continued to insist on notification even while it made no attempt to claim immunity for its Members from the due process of the criminal law. For instance, the Protection of Person and Property Bill of 1881 - a controversial legislative proposal which provided for a form of detention without trial for the purpose of maintaining public order in Ireland - was amended on its passage through the House to make express provision for notification of the House in the event of the arrest of any Member under its provisions..

Then, I must quote again what the Erskine May says:

"The principle upon which the privilege of freedom from arrest is based is the absolute priority of attendance by Members of both Houses. However, it has never been allowed to interfere with the administration of criminal justice or emergency legislation. The privilege is now of extremely limited application .

So, that is how it is done. We do not ask exemption from attest, what we say is that it should be informed to the House.

Then, I would like to refer to an emergency case happened during the World War II. The British Parliament passed the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act ,1939 and Regulations were made to detain people

1973 1974

who were a serious threat to the country. One Member of Parliament called Captain Ramsay who also belonged to a club called the Right Club which had lots of people sympathetic to Germany, was arrested by the Orders of the then Prime Minister Winston Churchill. After he was arrested and detained I would like to read out to you how the House proceeded. I would read out from the House of Commons Debate on 30th July, 1940. Columns 1165-66 of Volume 363 of the Official Report states, I quote:

Captain Show (by Private Notice) asked the Prime Minister whether he has considered the Motion standing on the Order Paper relating to the detention of the hon. and gallant Member for Peebles and Southern (Captain Ramsay), and whether the Government will refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges?

The Prime Minister Yes, Sir. The Government are prepared to move to refer the question of the arrest and detention of the hon. and gallant Member for Peebles and Southern, to the Committee of Privileges for examination in relation to the Privileges of this House. The necessary Motion will be tabled tomorrow.

Then, the next day, a Motion was tabled. Volume 363 of Hansard dated 01st August, 1940 states, I quote:

That the Committee of Privileges do consider and report whether the detention of Captain Ramsay under Regulation 18B of the Defence (General) Regulations, 1939, constitutes a breach of the Privileges of this House.

And, it was moved by the Deputy Prime Minister Mr. Clement Attlee. So, that is how they have gone into it in England. Even if a Member is taken in, it has to be inquired into. And, I must tell you Hon. Speaker, the Committee went into it and found that one of the supporters of Captain Ramsay who worked in the American Embassy had taken secret correspondence between Prime Minister Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt and gave it to Captain Ramsay who was about to pass it on to the German Embassy in Dublin. So, the House said his detention was justified.That is the way in which the House acts, and when a Member is detained, it goes in and looks into the matter.

Thereafter, all these were codified by the Standing Orders of the House of Commons in 2016, but it was all brought into the Standing Orders of the House of Commons Public Business in 2019 and there, at the very end, you find the new Rule which applies here and which comes under the Appendix, "Notification of the arrest of Members," They say there, I quote:

.... That Members of the House shall be under no undue restraint from being able to attend the House, and that this principle has been, and continues to be, encompassed in the privileges of the House claimed at the beginning of each Parliament;

Ordered, that this House accordingly:

(1) endorses the Second Report of the Procedure Committee,

Session 2015-16, Notification of the arrest of Members, HC 649;

(2) directs the Clerk of the House and the Speaker to follow the

protocol on notification of arrest of Members set out in Annex 2 to the Report;"

I have given you a copy of this, but for the benefit of the Members, I will read the first item on Annex 2: Protocol on the handling of notification of arrests because that is the most important part which should be brought in here. It states, I quote:

1) Police forces in the UK should as soon as possible and in any event within 24 hours of an arrest notify the Chief Superintendent at Parliament of any case in which a Member has been arrested or similarly detained, showing when and where the arrest took place, where and for how long the Member was detained, when and on what basis released, and the offence cited."

They have to be informed of what the offence is. So, these immunities apply to us as well.

These are exemptions for the normal arrest rules under Section 7 of the Privileges Act. So, we have the case of Hon. Rishad Bathiudeen. So far no reason has been given as to why he is under detention. So, the right of the Parliament to know why he is being detained has been violated. Under Section 9 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, a Detention Order has to be made. - [Interruption.] . .

This is the way that you all learn about Standing Orders of the House. Learn that, you study and if you want, another day you certainly come and reply. I like you all to further process. - It is bad for the House. They have talked of unlawful activity. That is defined in Section 39 of the PTA, which was again amended in 1988. There is unlawful activity referred to there or in any other law. So, if you look at unlawful activity in relation to the Prevention on Terrorism Act, it says, I quote:

2. (1) Any person who-

(a) causes the death of any specified person, or kidnaps.

So, there has been no specified person that we are aware of.

(b) causes the death of any person who is a witness to any offence ..

(c) commits criminal intimidation of any special person ..

(d) commits the offence of robbery of the property of the Government, any department, ..

(e) commits the offence of mischief to the property of the Government, any department..

(f) without lawful authority imports, manufactures or collects any firearms, ..

(g) possesses without lawful authority, within any security area, any firearms..

(h) by words either spoken or intended to be read or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise causes or intends to cause commission of acts of violence or religious, racial or communal disharmony ..

(i) without lawful authority erases, mutilates, defaces or otherwise interferes with any words

(j) harbours, conceals or in any other manner prevents, hinders or interferes with the apprehension of, a proclaimed person

1975 1976

[ ]

2021

I do not think he has interfered with any specified person; there is no specified person, to begin with. I do not know what exactly this offence is. You must read the Preamble. The Preamble says, I quote:

AND WHEREAS public order in Sri Lanka continues to be endangered by elements or groups of persons or associations that advocate the use of force or the commission of crime as a means of, or as an aid in, accomplishing governmental change within Sri Lanka,..

I cannot think of him trying to use force to change the Government in which he is a Minister. I mean, basically that does not apply. So, what has happened here is that the Member has been detained without the reasons being given and therefore it is a violation of the rights of this House. And then, it is a detention to which the exemptions of Members being arrested and the charges are notified does not apply. Tomorrow he can walk out free. There is very little anyone can do if you go to courts. Since this does not come even under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, he is not under the exemption where you have waived the right not to arrest. Because that is a very narrow one, it has the Rights and then the Notifications, how it should be done to the House. It is a Privilege of the House. So, in that case, I think the rights of the House and of the Member, both, had been violated and the Notification Rules of UK which is in their Standing Orders, Hon. Speaker, should apply to this House. We only go on Criminal Proceedings. But this is outside Criminal Proceedings.

Another question is, can a Member be detained under PTA? If you look into Article 3, Article 4, Article 69; can Section 9 of the PTA apply there because the PTA was passed after the Constitution. So PTA has not overriden the Constitution. PTA must work in accordance with the rights there. Then, I do not know we who are the representatives of the people can be taken in this way. In the world, the PTA has never been used to detain any Members. So, I think it has to be exercised. Even the Public Security Ordinance, where under Emergency legislation, people can be detained. In relation to a Member of Parliament it has to be exercised under Article 3, Article 4, Article 67 and Article 69.

So, I have raised this issue because if we are to safeguard Parliament, we must safeguard its rights; we must safeguard its Members, and also we must safeguard the powers of the Cabinet because the Cabinet is ultimately responsible to Parliament.

So, I would like you to go into this and give a Ruling on it at whatever time you think is appropriate, but I would also like to request that you do take this matter up and we also can refer this to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and to the International Parliamentary Union.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) All I am saying is, I have presented to you all the relevant material. If there are counter-material, that can be presented. I have nothing against that. I am not saying to do it today. You can certainly bring that in.

Secondly, I like the Hon. Members to go study this and come back because this is an opportunity for all the new Members to learn. If they can find new material to refute me, all the better. But, I do not think that getting up here and shouting would work. This House must conduct itself in a way that we gain the trust of the public. The Hon. Members of the Government may agree with me, they may not agree with me. - [Interruption.] They need to know that all this time this House, whether they agree with me or not, was able to sit down and listen.

I think the Proposer is the Hon. Marikkar, but he did not read the No-Confidence Motion. He must say, "I propose.". I guess the Hon.

Vote of No Confidence in the Hon. Udaya Gammanpila, Minister of Energy,-

Whereas the Hon. Udaya Gammanpila, Minister of Energy, has taken action to raise fuel prices without the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers as stated in writing by the General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, which is the main party representing the Government, although the Cabinet of Ministers is collectively responsible and answerable to Parliament in terms of Article 43 (1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka;

And whereas has derogated from the principles guiding the state policy in contravention of Article 27 (1) of the Constitution and shirked the fundamental duties in contravention of Article 28 of the Constitution, thereby breaking the oath taken in terms of Article 53 of the Constitution;

And whereas has not informed Parliament and people of this country of the profit which the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and the Government earned by not reducing prices of petroleum fuels but keeping the prices at a high level since January 2020, when petroleum prices fell excessively in the world market, up until now;

And whereas has not fulfilled the pledge given to people that the advantage of the falling prices of petroleum fuels in the world market will be given to people by reducing the prices of essential goods;

And whereas has not kept to the pledge given not to raise fuel prices within two years based on such price advantage;

And whereas has failed to inform this Parliament and people what happened to the Fuel Price Stabilization Fund, claimed to have been established by the Government to use the advantage of falling prices when oil prices rise;

And whereas has not fulfilled the pledge given to use the profit earned by the Government when prices were falling to rescue the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation from its indebtedness to state banks;

And whereas has through the raising of fuel prices, led to the rise of production cost in all consumer goods parallel to it and the accompanying escalation of inflation, thereby placing people affected by the COVID-19 Pandemic in further suffering economically;

And whereas has led to the possible adverse effects on exports and the overall economy due to the escalation of production cost;

And whereas has failed to fulfill promises given from time to time by directly and indirectly contravening the peoples agenda given in being elected to the Government, the policies of the Government and the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka;

That this Parliament resolves that it has no confidence in the competence of Hon. Udaya Gammanpila, Minister of Energy to function as a Cabinet Minister any longer."

I would also like to use this opportunity, Hon. Deputy Speaker, just to bring to your attention that it was only for a very limited period that the international crude oil prices came down to US Dollars 21 per barrel during the month of April last year. Thereafter it was in an upward trend. Now, it has already gone up to about US Dollars 80 per barrel. By the time the decision was taken to increase the oil prices, it was already about US Dollars 68 per barrel and now it has gone up to about US Dollars 81per barrel. So, there is no option other than that.

As a Colleague, I must say that I am very proud of the Hon. Minister because in the Cabinet I know that he had, on many occasions, looked at everything, had a holistic view to develop our energy sector and petroleum sector for which I am grateful to him.

In view of that, I would like to mention a few of his achievements so far and his proposals. For example, he is developing a new storage tank farm in Trincomalee and he is also developing a new storage tank farm in Hambantota. His achievements also include developing and upgrading of aviation refueling terminal and existing fuel hydrant system and installation of a fuel hydrant system of CPC at new Apron-E in par with Phase II, Stage 2 Development Project of Bandaranaike International Airport, Katunayake. And also, there are a number of other projects he has started. For example, construction of Jet A-1 Transfer Pipeline from Muthurajawela to BIA and construction of Jet A-1 storage tanks and associated Facilities at Muthurajawela, a storage tank construction at CPSTL and procurement, construction and commissioning of several tanks at Kolonnawa installation.

So, one thing I would like to say is that he has looked at the whole thing holistically, and is looking at how to empower the Sri Lankan energy sector at different levels. But there were some misinformation given to this House regarding the proposed Act on petroleum. It is not an Act to sell the petroleum resources of this country, it is to permit investments to this country. He is looking at this

most vital aspect rather than bringing somebody else everyday to this country, and is giving more instructions on refueling and modernizing of oil refinery.

That Act is totally misquoted. The Act is for the betterment of the country. Now, investments are being welcomed by everybody. For example, one of the world's biggest companies, Saudi Aramco, is now listed in the US and about 30, 40 per cent of the shares are being held by the public all over the world. So, investment is not bad as long as you have control over your resources. So, what the Hon. Minister proposes is to have control over the resources inviting modern technology, inviting investors to come and invest on that so that the country would benefit from it in the long run. It is for the first time that he had renewed interest in oil exploration which had never been a priority of the previous Government. So, he is working hard on oil exploration and he is also working hard on refinery.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Yes, Hon. Member. ( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) I want to inform the Hon. Minister that there was a firm agreement with the HIPG where the Sri Lanka Ports Authority had a 15 per cent stake and the bunkering licence was given to them exclusively under the agreement. Therefore, it cannot be changed, and it loses the country's right. Therefore, it is very serious. We would like to seek a full reply later.

Hon. Presiding Member, we brought this Motion of No Confidence for the sake of the people. We often talk of Singapore, especially with the COVID-19 scenario. I must inform this House that Singapore has rebuilt their economy and their economy today is over US Dollars 2 billion in reserves. Even with the COVID-19 pandemic, countries such as Singapore have been able to develop their economies and face the COVID-19 pandemic head on. So, why can we not develop ours? ? This issue is twofold. One is the cash flow scenario; the other is the insolvency issue - - with corruption and incompetence which lead to mismanagement of the country and the economy. We can always point fingers at others and say, " ". But now, what are we looking at in terms of the economy? Sir, we are looking at selling of our assets. So, it is a very dangerous scenario to be in, economically. Remember, you all came to power promising that not one inch of this country would be sold. Now, the situation is completely different. Part of the loss of the CPC is Rs. 12 billion. That is due to the cancellation of the fuel price formula.

Sir, local companies have proved that if they manage their businesses properly, they can show profits. For example, Hayleys (Pvt.) Limited Company has showed profits. profits . profits profits profits profits . . But, Sir, the Government of Sri Lanka has failed in its task.

What is next for us? Since time is limited, I will cut my speech short. We are going to witness a skyrocketing cost of living. People will not be able to live; people will not be able to eat; we will have no dollars to pay our debts. Again, we will see this country travelling towards the 1970s where people could not actually afford to live.

Sir, His Excellency Gotabaya Rajapaksa promised that he would bring in an investment of US Dollars 36 billion for this country. One-and-a-half to two years have elapsed and we have not seen that kind of investment coming in yet. So, where are we heading? We need to ask that question. Simply put, if we are going to head for an international crisis, for the first time in the history of this country, Sri Lanka will not be able to service our international debts.

Mr. Presiding Member, a national newspaper recently carried an article on harnessing oil and gas deposits under the heading, "Solution to wiping out Sri Lanka's foreign debt". It further reported that Sri Lanka has identified oil and gas deposits valued at US Dollars 240 billion. Sri Lankas total foreign debt is around US Dollars 45 billion. Therefore, this is the best solution to eradicate our staggering national debt.

We need capable hands when harnessing such national treasures to gain the utmost productivity and minimize corruption. Such huge projects, including the ones I mentioned earlier, are the reasons to envy the Hon. Udaya Gammanpilas Cabinet portfolio.
