THREATS MADE TO SEVERAL TAMIL PRISONERS IN

ANURADHAPURA PRISON

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Speaker, on the 12th of September, 2021, late in the evening, at or about 6.00 p.m., the then State Minister of Prison Management and Prisoners Rehabilitation had entered the Anuradhapura Prison Complex using the fact that he was the subject Minister concerned and had insisted that the Tamil political prisoners detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act be brought before him.

The prison authorities had gone onto produce ten Tamil PTA prisoners: nine PTA suspects who have legal action pending and one individual convicted under the PTA. The said individual had then ordered all ten Tamil prisoners to degradingly kneel before him and whilst brandishing a firearm, presumably his personal firearm meant for his personal protection, had loudly announced that when he was appointed to the said portfolio, he obtained the power to shoot or free the prisoners. He had threatened them saying that such was the power he had.

In the course of these events, the said individual had become uncontrollably agitated and had gone on to place his firearm repeatedly to the head and bodies of two prisoners and had abusively stated that he can shoot them

all dead on the spot. The said individuals state of agitation was such that the prison authorities and his own security detail, who, till then, chose to be bystanders, had attempted to pacify the now uncontrollable and hysterical man, fearing the worst. One can just imagine the severe state of trauma the prisoners were in. It was after much effort that the individual was eventually removed from the prison premises.

After confirming from several first-hand sources, I chose to tweet from my personal Twitter handle, confirming the above-stated events on the night of the 14th of September, 2021 and I subsequently followed the tweet with a press conference on the 15th of September, 2021 and by a visit to the Anuradhapura Prison on the 16th of September, 2021 along with my Colleague, the Hon. Selvarajah Kajendren, by which we were able to further confirm the stated events.

A couple of hours after I held the press conference confirming the said individuals illegal and criminal actions, none other than the Presidents Media Division issued a press release at 1.50 p.m. on the 15th of September, 2021, stating that Lohan Rathwaththe, State Minister of Prison Management and Prisoners Rehabilitation had tendered his resignation, acknowledging his responsibility for the incidents and that the President had gone onto accept his resignation.

Sir, Sri Lanka is a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights - ICCPR - and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, all of which clearly protect the rights of prisoners. The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, better known as The Nelson Mandala Rules, along with the other instruments that I have already mentioned make the individuals actions not only illegal, but also call for immediate legal action against perpetrators like him. The Rules also call for prisoners to be allocated to prisons closest to their homes.

Under these circumstances, I would like to ask the Hon. Prime Minister and the Hon. Minister of Justice the following:

1. Given the nature of the criminal conduct of the individual concerned, not only can he no longer be the subject Minister in charge of prisons and prisoners rehabilitation, but, in fact, he should not be holding any portfolio in Government and be a Member of Parliament itself. Accordingly, will the Government ensure that he would no longer be holding any portfolios and take steps to remove him from Parliament?

2. Will the Government ensure that the Attorney-General is unhindered in taking whatever steps that he deems fit, including the arrest of the individual concerned and prosecution under all relevant laws which have been breached?

2021 00

3. Given the severe breach of security and safety of the Tamil political prisoners being held under the PTA in the Anuradhapura Prison, where the prison authorities failed to prevent the illegal acts, will the Hon. Minister of Justic transfer the said Tamil political prisoners to the Jaffna and Vavuniya Prisons in keeping with the SMR - Nelson Mandela Rules - as a matter of urgency?

4. Given that the present Government, like its predecessor, has accepted the draconian nature of the PTA and given that none of the Tamil political prisoners would have been under custody had the said PTA been in accordance with the accepted international human rights standards and good practices, will the Government, at least now, release the PTA detainees immediately?

Thank you, Sir. ... ( ) ( ... - ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry - Minister of Justice) Hon. Speaker, at the outset, let me unequivocally and unconditionally condemn the incident which had taken place. It should have never happened and it was a disgrace. As the Minister of Justice, I condemn that and say that it should not have ever taken place. Having said so, let me also tender my apology to the victims and their family members for whatever difficulties they had to undergo. At the same time, I must reiterate, Sir, that we must not give a political, ethnic or a racial flavour to that because it was not so motivated. We must understand that.

Having said so, I must also say that the law enforcement authorities have already commenced investigations. The CID has commenced its investigations; the Human Rights Commission, independently, has commenced its investigations and they had gone to the scene and recorded statements. Similarly, the National Authority for the Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses, which comes under my Ministry, has already written to them to ensure the safety, security and dignity of those prisoners and detainees because they are under the custody of the Government and it is the responsibility of the Government to take care of and ensure their safety. We do agree on that. It is in that sense that we also, yesterday, at the Cabinet, decided to appoint a retired High Court Judge to inquire into this independently and report to us and thereafter, to take further action. So, in line with that, let me reiterate once again that this is an incident which should not have taken place, but it was not racially or ethnically motivated, definitely not.

Now, Sir, let me answer the Question which the Hon. Ponnambalam raised.

1. As we know, he has already stepped down as the State Minister concerned. Therefore, there is no interference into the investigations which are being carried on. As I said earlier, the CID and the HRC have already started inquiries and they will

continue with those. Thereafter, the retired High Court Judge to be appointed will also tender his or her report and based on that, the political authorities, the hierarchy of our Party and the Government, will take appropriate action. That is all I can say. But, just like anyone else, even though this incident should be condemned and should not have taken place, in terms of Article 13 (5) of the Constitution, the former State Minister is also entitled to the presumption of innocence, whether we like it or not. So, first, let these inquiries take place and thereafter, appropriate action will be taken.

2. We all know how law enforcement takes place in this country. Investigations are carried out by the police and the law enforcement authorities. If necessary, the Attorney-General can supervise those and give directions and thereafter, matters have to be reported to court. As far as criminal sanctions are concerned, the Government cannot impose criminal sanctions on anyone. So, that process has commenced and on the outcome of that process, the Attorney-General is absolutely free - as a matter of fact, we have never interfered and will never interfere in individual cases, as to what and what not to be done, other than issuing policy directions and having discussions to enhance their capability - to do the needful. Therefore, I can assure, Hon. Ponnambalam, that the Attorney-General is free to do whatever he likes in terms of the law.

3. With regard to whether those prisoners could be transferred to another prison, I would like to say that, as at now, the LTTE prisoners and detainees concerned continue to stay at the Anuradhapura Prison. We have given special directions in that regard. I am in the process of writing in that regard, but I have already given instructions and the National Authority for the Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses has already written to them asking to give the prisoners maximum security. So, as at now, they are basically safe and we will continue to monitor the situation. Their cases are basically heard in Vavuniya, which is in close proximity to this Prison. We are not adamant that we will not transfer them, but if the situation requires and if necessary, after evaluation - I cannot say that they will be transferred to the Jaffna Prison - they will be transferred to a more secure place. Therefore, as at now, their security has been briefed; additional security has been given and their safety is being monitored. The prisoners can be accessed. The Hon. Members of Parliament, mainly from the Opposition, went there and spoke to them; the HRC went there; the CID went there. So, there is unhindered access to them. They are continuously monitored because that is our duty; we concede that. So, that is how it is.

Sir, there is a cardinal rule that both parties should be heard, and both parties could be heard only in a civil

511 512

court case where the defence cannot put forward the prosecution's case and the prosecution cannot put forward the defence's case. They will put each others case and there has to be somebody to decide on that. We agree on that. The PTA is an exception. An exception was required because of the unconventional methods used by the terrorists in the past to wage a war in the country. So, we need to protect national security and national interests.

When national security is secured, everyone is secure. We all know that during the LTTE war, all of us, Sri Lankans, suffered, but mostly Tamils had to undergo difficulties. Similarly, due to the dastardly terrorist attacks carried out by Zahran and his clan, the PTA had to be used again. Unfortunately, there are some victims of that. So, it is in that context that this exceptional law has to be used. In that context, now we have understood that there has to be a balance in national security. We cannot let our guard down because that will bring about greater difficulties for the country. But, at the same time, the liberty and freedom of the subjects and all citizens of this country have to be respected. We understand that; as a Government, we have acknowledged that. His Excellency the President, when he had discussions with the UN Secretary-General at the UN, expressed that and both the previous Foreign Minister, who is the current Minister of Education, and the current Foreign Minister have repeatedly said so. So, it is in that context that we have appointed a Committee to look into the several provisions of the PTA, in order to strike a fine balance between national security and the liberty and freedom of the subjects. Therefore, we will continue to do that, but let me also say this.

In 1979, the PTA was enacted. There is provision in the PTA to appoint an Advisory Board in order to advise the Defence Minister whether somebody who had been detained under the PTA should continue to be detained under that. But, no Government for the last 40 years had appointed that Advisory Board. Three weeks ago, His Excellency the President, as the Minister of Defence, appointed a respectable, independent panel of advisers led by Asoka de Silva, a retired Chief Justice of this country, respected former Solicitor General Suhada Gamlath and retired High Court Judge Heiyanthuduwa to look into those cases. So, Hon. Member, if you feel that someone who should not have been taken into custody had been taken into custody, you can make an application to that Advisory Board. They will call the necessary parties, go into it and advise the President accordingly. So, everything is possible within a short span of time. We want peace in this country; we want to have unity among people. As the Cabinet Minister in charge of prisons, I will ensure the safety of all prisoners who are under the custody of our Government, irrespective of their race, ethnicity and religion as it is our responsibility to do so. I know that we let them down on the last occasion, but it will not happen again.

Thank you very much.

Minister because he was bold enough to come out openly and acknowledge the incident and the individuals concerned. I do not want to get into a debate. I just want to say this. My concern in raising the third question was that the prison authorities in the Anuradhapura Prison are witnesses; The prisoners are also witnesses. So, it is not a matter of only providing security, but keeping in mind that they are also witnesses in the case. It is in that backdrop that I ask you to consider transferring those relevant prisoners to the prisons in Jaffna or Vavuniya.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Speaker, before the Hon. Minister responds, may I ask one question?

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Sumanthiran? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir.

There is only one question. There is a controversy, Hon. Minister, with regard to CCTV footages. The Minister concerned, who resigned, had publicly stated that the CCTV footages in the prisons cannot be erased. After he said that, there are some authorities who are saying that Welikada and Anuradhapura Prisons do not have CCTV footages. So, the Ministers statement is being contradicted now. Therefore, we want an assurance that no CCTV footage would be erased. It is strange that people are saying that there are no CCTV cameras in Welikada Prison. That is very strange.

The other request is to the Hon. Speaker. It is a matter with regard to the personal firearm that has been issued to this particular Member of Parliament, who is still a State Minister and the manner in which he is supposed to have used it. I am asking the Hon. Speaker, with utmost respect, to make a direction that that personal firearm be taken away from him.

Thank you.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) Hon. Speaker, as far as the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalams request is concerned, we are closely monitoring it and the National Authority for the Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses has given instructions as to what should be done. They have several powers. I will have a discussion with them in order to secure the security of the prisoners and their ability to testify without any pressure. But, as at now, I do not think it is required to transfer them. As I told you earlier, we will not hesitate to do so. If necessary, we will do the transferring, I do not think to the Jaffna Prison, but to any other prison where they would be safe.

Then, there are various versions. Unfortunately, I have not visited the Welikada or the Anuradhapura Prisons yet. I intend to do that soon. So, I do not want to speculate. Let the investigations which are being carried out by multiple agencies including the HRC, the Retired High Court Judge as well as the CID elicit the truth. We have nothing to hide.

Thank you very much.

[2.41 p.m.]

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, I wish to place on record a few observations with regard to His Excellency the President's comments to the Secretary-General of the United Nations when he had met the Secretary-General in New York on Sunday, the 19th. The Presidential Secretariat has issued a formal statement with regard to

595 596

that meeting. According to that statement, His Excellency the President is supposed to have stated, I quote:

"The President said that the internal issues of Sri Lanka should be resolved through an internal mechanism of the country and said the Tamil Diaspora would be invited for discussions in this regard."

Hon. Presiding Member, I find that quite amusing, that His Excellency could go to New York and make such a statement because it is this very same Government, within days of coming to power, which chose to list a number of organizations representing the Tamil diaspora as illegal organizations or banned organizations and even went on to include a number of individuals who hold a lot of respect amongst the diaspora and who potentially could have, in fact, been interlocutors in it. So, by listing them, you made sure that no such meaningful dialogue could, in fact, take place and that makes this statement sound extremely hollow. That is, for you to go to the United Nations after doing that, after taking those steps within days of coming to power, and make this sort of claim.

Not only that. The President has not stopped at that, but has gone on to say with regard to the missing persons, that death certificates would be released and action would be taken, that he would expedite action. What is that action? Once again, before he left, he had the audacity to tell the families of missing persons and some of those organizations, Forget about the past. Do not bother looking for your loved ones. So, what is the action that he is going to expedite? Purely, issuing death certificates without even bothering to look at the circumstances under which those individuals were murdered by the security forces. That is the impunity that His Excellency the President is choosing to get a rubber stamp for, from the United Nations. If the United Nations chooses to back this sort of steps, we will condemn those steps unreservedly because they go counter to every single principle that the United Nations claims that it stands for and that, I think, must be placed on record.

Then, he has also gone on to say with regard to the political prisoners that he had released quite a few soon after he came to power. Those prisoners were going to be released anyway within a year; he did not do anything extraordinary. He wanted to release a convicted prisoner, convicted in the sense that the matter went up to the Supreme Court - one of his "golayas" went up to the Supreme Court - and he wanted to pardon that gentleman, and in the process, to make it out as if he was being quite magnanimous, he chose to include the names of a few Tamil prisoners who were anyway going to come out within a year. That is the truth. So, these statements that he is claimed to have used in the international fora to somehow gain some credibility, I think, ring extremely hollow, Hon. Presiding Member and that must be stated.

Then, to match His Excellency the President or to compete with him, we have a Foreign Minister - actually, I used to venerate him when I was a law student, study his books and think that he was some sort of a god, but, unfortunately, once he came into politics, all of that has

gone out of the window - who also had made another statement. It is shocking what he had said! Foreign Minister Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, at the Ministerial Sessions on Foreign Policy and Religion at the G20 Interfaith Forum, Bologna, Italy, had said this, I quote:

Then, the final point I want to make is this, that we have to look at ethnic or religious political parties. That is also a critical problem with regard to the formulation of foreign policy and in many of our countries, we have political parties that profess overtly to be ethnic in character and complexion. We represent this ethnic group. We represent this religion. I don't think that's a good idea. It does a great deal of damage. In my own country, Muslims, Tamils, members of minority communities, have reached the pinnacle of political power and authority as members of the national political parties.

"National political parties"? When the vast majority of Tamils and Muslims chooses to vote for their own parties, parties representing their own communities because they have no faith in these national political parties, you have one or two such individuals as members of national political parties, whom the Hon. Foreign Minister points out to say that, in fact, the Tamil and Muslim people are fully with the Government and not with the other parties representing the Tamils and Muslims. So, that is another dishonest statement. For an intellectual like the Professor to be making such statements only shows his intellectual dishonesty and that is unfortunate, given his past where he was held in very high regard.

Not only that, he has chosen deliberately to hide the fact that the party to which he belonged earlier, the SLFP, was instrumental in making sure that Sri Lanka became so polarized by stating that Sri Lanka is only for the Sinhalese. And you have a President who boasts today that it is only the Sinhalese people who voted him into power. So, when you have sectarian words coming out from the President and the Foreign Minister themselves in that way, for them to go to international fora of this nature and mislead those fora, I think, is something that must be condemned. I think it is important that this sort of actions be brought to the attention of the Hon. Members of the House.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) ( ) , . 9 .

[5.09 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, for the time allotted for me to speak a few words on this Adjournment Motion.

647 648

Madam, the problem with the Government seems to be its doublespeak. I have here with me a tweet by His Excellency the President made on the 21st of July this year, where he says, I quote:

We are committed to work with the UN to ensure accountability and human development...."

He says ....to work with the UN to ensure accountability".

"...........to achieve lasting peace and reconciliation.

Then, he says, I quote:

We are dedicated to resolving the issues to ensure justice and reconciliation by implementing necessary institutional reforms.

We welcomed it immediately. Whenever there has been a progressive move by the Government, we have publicly welcomed it. We tweeted the Presidents tweet saying, We welcome and assure our support to the Presidents commitment to work with the UN on accountability and also said, awaiting further moves of the Government in this regard because we know that you can await and await and await and nothing comes about. We say that because it was on the 26th of May, 2009 that His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa made a Joint Statement with the visiting Secretary-General of the UN, Ban-Ki-Moon, in Kandy assuring him of certain inquiries that would be made. Twelve years hence, his brother, His Excellency Gotabaya Rajapaksa, says the same thing and then, the Foreign Ministry says, No, we will not agree to any external mechanisms. The President says one thing - perhaps the Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya is going to reply to that - but your Minister, rejecting the oral update, says, "We cannot agree to any agreement with the UN on this". That is a doublespeak.

Similarly, the call by the President to talk to the Tamil Diaspora, we have welcomed.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have two more minutes. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Madam, I will just make one point and conclude.

But, on the 16th of July this year, the President invited the TNA to come to talk with him and at the last minute, he put it off - maybe, there was some issue - and then, sent two letters to us saying, Very soon, we will talk. We will fix a date. Two months hence, we are still waiting, but he goes to New York and wants to talk to the Tamil Diaspora. We have welcomed it, too. All the very best to him! But, first he must talk to us, the Representatives of the Tamil people here and settle this issue.

Thank you.

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Diana Gamage) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, for giving me the opportunity to speak a few words on this Adjournment Motion.

There has been so much of criticism and speculation about His Excellency the President trying to meet the Tamil diaspora and the invitation he has extended to them for discussions. I would like to remind the Opposition that when they were in power, during the previous Government, their Foreign Minister, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, also met with the Tamil diaspora and had discussions. What I would like to know is this. Do we not really need to fix this ethnic issue? Has it really not gone too far? Do we not ever want to fix the ethnic problem in this country? Do we not want to settle this issue with the international community? Are we going to carry it on and on with every government that comes into power? This country has been in the limelight with all sorts of accusations regarding human rights violations. Do not anybody in this country, as Sri Lankans, want to end this conflict or issue? I urge everyone to speak up as a Sri Lankan at this moment when we are facing such issues before the international community. This has to stop. We are Sri Lankans; whether we are Sinhalese, Tamils or Muslims, we all are Sri Lankans. If anybody thinks that we can end this by arguing about it with each

653 654

[ ]

2021 00

other in this country and by showing the world that we are not united as Sri Lankans, how are we going to face the international community? So, this has to stop.

We have to accept that an injustice has been caused to the Tamil people of this country, not by us, but by our ancestors and that is where I stand. There has been an issue in this country. We have to treat those people equally because they also have all the human rights as everybody else does as citizens of this country. First, we have to correct it by learning to accept that there has been an issue. We need to address that issue by keeping extremism and racism out of our minds. We are never going to end this problem with racism in our minds. So, we have to come out of racism and fix this problem.

[5.32 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya - State Minister of Regional Co-operation) Hon. Presiding Member, at the outset, I want to thank the Hon. Manusha Nanayakkara for bringing this timely Adjournment Motion. However, I think I am a little bit confused because in his main argument, he says that this Government is following a policy of duplicity. For a moment, if we agree with the Hon. Member and if the present Government is carrying on certain policies which they all considered were good during their time, then, I fail to see what the issue is.

Hon. Presiding Member, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, presented an oral update on Sri Lanka to the 48th Session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva on 13th September, 2021. The oral update by the High Commissioner, among other things, has acknowledged some positive steps taken by the Government of Sri Lanka to resolve many issues of concern. For example, she noted with interest His Excellency the Presidents interaction with the civil society, acknowledged the release of 16 LTTE cadres convicted of serious crimes under the PTA, noted the Governments reaffirmation of its intention to revisit the PTA and also acknowledged the progress made by the domestic processes such as the Office for Reparations and the Office on Missing Persons.

Our Foreign Ministers statement to the Human Rights Council, as the country concerned, provided an update on the progress made on all issues of concern, in particular, the progress made since the 46th Session of the Human Rights Council. He stated that we have done so under challenging circumstances due to the prevalent global pandemic.

Prior to the Council, the Hon. Foreign Minister has personally briefed the Colombo-based Heads of Missions of HRC Member States about our efforts and the progress achieved. Sri Lankan Missions abroad have also briefed the HRC Members. Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva has also briefed the HRC Members and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. The Foreign Ministry has shared a detailed information document, giving an update on developments related to post-conflict reconciliation as well as the ongoing efforts to address the human rights issues.

Consistent with the position we have previously stated at the Council, Sri Lanka has reiterated that, while we will continue our cooperation with the United Nations on human rights matters, we categorically reject the external initiatives purportedly established by Resolution 46/1 while domestic processes are vigorously addressing the relevant matters of accountability, reconciliation and human rights. We have stated clearly that external initiatives embarked upon without the cooperation of the country concerned will be subject to politicization, will lead to further polarization of our society and therefore, cannot achieve their stated human rights and reconciliation goals.

The previous Government, by co-sponsoring Resolution 30/1 in 2015, moved away from a domestic mechanism and instead gave access to the international community. The people of Sri Lanka rejected this approach and the Government which was elected in November, 2019 started the domestic process to address residual issues of the conflict with the objective of achieving tangible and measurable results through that.

Madam, following the presentation of the oral update of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 15 countries have expressed their support and encouragement to the efforts taken by the Government of Sri Lanka to address issues related to human rights. This is a significant support extended to our principled position by a number of countries which highlighted in the Human Rights Council that country-specific resolutions implemented without the consent of the country concerned are unproductive, while emphasizing the need for supporting domestic initiatives.

Madam, His Excellency the President and the Hon. Foreign Minister are, at present, in New York to address the United Nations General Assembly. They are meeting with the highest levels of the international community including Heads of State as well as the UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres. At these meetings, His Excellency the President as well as the Hon. Foreign Minister have reiterated Sri Lankas commitment to bring peace, prosperity and reconciliation in the country as well as rejected any unsubstantiated allegations. At his meeting with the UN Secretary-General, President Rajapaksa outlined the challenges that Sri Lanka is facing in the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic and also said that even in the midst of these unprecedented circumstances, significant steps have been taken to address the issues that arose in the aftermath of defeating

terrorism. President Rajapaksa also explained the engagement with civil society organizations to bring about development and reconciliation in the country. He added that the internal issues of Sri Lanka should be resolved through an internal mechanism and also said that the Tamil Diaspora would be invited for discussions in this regard. The United Nations Secretary-General told President Rajapaksa that the United Nations will provide the full support to Sri Lanka in moving forward to promote unity among the different communities.

His Excellency the President will address the entire international community in his Address to the United Nations General Assembly today, 22nd September, where he will present Sri Lankas efforts to achieve peace and prosperity in the country as well as to reach the Sustainable Development Goals despite the severe challenges.

Before I conclude, I would like to remind this House that it was not this Government that co-sponsored a Resolution against its own people. It was not this Government that was willing to throw their own war veterans under the bus; it was not this Government that, on the false pretense of reconciliation, turned a blind eye to the ongoing concerns of this country, which led to the biggest massacre of civilian lives since the end of the war. It is laughable that an Opposition which applauded these decisions and voted in favour of them are today crying foul over issues faced by this Government in the international arena. From the very first day these issues arose, we have been clear that a united stand is the only way to face these challenges, but we have an opportunistic Opposition which prefers to play politics with the future of our citizens.

Madam, let me highlight that we have categorically rejected all unsubstantiated allegations about Sri Lanka in our interactions with the international community, here in Colombo, in Geneva, in New York as well as through all our diplomatic Missions. We have stated that we will continue to engage in constructive interactions with the United Nations and the international community in bringing peace and prosperity to Sri Lanka. We have reiterated that we are open in acknowledging our challenges and as a responsible and a democratic Government, we are committed to achieving tangible progress on the entire range of issues relating to accountability, reconciliation, human rights, peace and sustainable development.
