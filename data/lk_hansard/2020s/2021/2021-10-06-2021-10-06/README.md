REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC

ACCOUNTS

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana) Hon. Speaker, I present the Second Report of the Committee on Public Accounts - COPA - for the First Session of the Ninth Parliament.

Sir, with your permission, can I make a few comments?

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana) Firstly, I was shocked at the amount of misappropriation of public money that is taking place in the Department of Inland Revenue.

For instance, there are two systems by which tax is collected. Under the Legacy System, the amount owing as of 30th of June, 2020 was Rs. 107 billion and under the RAMIS System, it was Rs. 183 billion. So, urgent action needs to be taken to correct this.

Secondly, with regard to the Sri Lanka Customs and the Department of Motor Traffic, I think there is collusion which leads to the most peculiar things that is taking place in the import of vehicles. For instance, we discovered that a vehicle had been imported at a low duty on the basis that it was an ambulance, but when it came out, it turned out to be a Mercedes-Benz. So, I think serious action has to be taken on this matter.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , " " .

[3.48 p.m.] .. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam)

Hon. Presiding Member, I just wish to bring to the notice of this House certain incidents that took place which involves my Colleague, the Hon. Selvarajah Kajendren and also another member of our Party who happens to be an attorney-at-law. Hon. Presiding Member, you must be aware that on the 23rd of September, the Hon. Selvarajah Kajendren was arrested by the Jaffna Police. The OIC of the Jaffna Police was

1113 1114

physically present and, in fact, conducted the arrest. At the time of arrest, the Hon. Kajendren was informed that he cannot commemorate or remember the death of Mr. Thileepan who had undertaken a fast from the 15th of September till the 26th of September several years ago. Those days are generally observed by all the Tamils. The Hon. Selvarajah Kajendren had gone there alone. Despite that, the police came to that spot and when he tried to light a lamp, he was physically assaulted, physically handled, arrested and bundled into a vehicle and taken to the police station along with two other members of our Party. Also, two ladies who were supporters of our Party and who happened to be in that area because they were official journalists were physically manhandled and their phones were first captured and then eventually returned because Mr. Sugash, who was a lawyer and a member of our party, had objected to the arrest and assault of those two ladies. Initially, the police took the Hon. Selvarajah Kajendren to custody saying that he was being arrested because he was commemorating a member who belonged to a banned organization. The Government's policy is that you can commemorate even members of the LTTE, provided you do not commemorate the LTTE. So, when the Hon. Selvarajah Kajendren had repeatedly asked the Police OIC whether there was a court order and to produce it if, in fact, he was going to be arrested, the OIC said that he did not have it but there was a court order.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member you have two minutes more.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I will wind up, Sir.

He was taken to the police and subsequently, was released on bail saying that he had not been arrested under the PTA or under Section 106 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, but rather because he violated COVID rules. That is what was told.

What I want to bring to the notice of this House is that the Hon. Minister of Public Security, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera, despite the police saying that the Hon. Selvarajah Kajendran was not arrested for commemorating Mr. Thileepan, had come on record on a public media channel that the Hon. Member was arrested because he had, in fact, commemorated an LTTE Member and also had the audacity to say that the lawyer, who is a member of our party and who intervened on behalf of those two ladies who had been manhandled and assaulted by the police and whose phones initially were illegally confiscated, also has to be arrested because he acted illegally in trying to support the Hon. Kajendren who was commemorating a Member of a banned organization. Sir, the Hon. Minister of Public Security, we all know, is intellectually challenged. But, the fact that such a person is put in charge of such an important Ministry for him to be encouraging impunity in this way, encouraging the

police to act illegally in this way - to carry out illegal arrests and try to justify that to the public - is something that this House and certainly the Government must take note of and he must be asked to be accountable for his remarks. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. H.M.M. Harees. You have twelve minutes.
