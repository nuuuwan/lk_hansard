THE SUPREME COURT ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I wish to announce the Determination of the Supreme Court on the Bill titled Inland Revenue (Amendment), in respect of which petitions have been filed in the

Supreme Court in terms of Article 121(1) of the Constitution.

The Supreme Court has determined that exclusion of full-time employee of the taxpayer from the applicability of Section 126(5) of the principal enactment is inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

The Court further stated that the Bill and its provisions will cease to be inconsistent with the Constitution and can be passed by a simple majority in Parliament if Clauses 40 and 47 are amended as stated in the Determination of the Court.

I order that the Determination of the Supreme Court be printed in the Official Report of todays proceedings.

: PRIVILEGE: VIOLATION OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Hon. Speaker, I actually wanted to raise this as a Question of Privilege rather than just getting up and behaving like a hooligan in this House. So, Sir, let me raise my Question of Privilege now.

Sir, I hereby wish to bring to your attention that my Privilege in relation to freedom of speech was violated on the 08th of April, 2021 by the comments made by the Hon. Shehan Semasinghe in his speech, which I have attached to my Question of Privilege. I wish the culprit was here. He was here a little while ago, but now, he has left the Chamber.

The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe mentioned my name and the name of the political party I represent a few times in his speech on 08th April, 2021. The Hon. Member made references to the speech I made on the 07th of April, 2021 in the House and it violated my Privileges as a Member of Parliament. In his speech, he mentioned that I should be questioned by the Criminal Investigation Department regarding a matter that was referred to in my speech. I would like to state that as a Member of Parliament, it is well within my Privilege to express my thoughts in this House without fear.

I would like to urge the Hon. Speaker to take stern action against the Hon. Member of Parliament for violating my Privilege of speech. The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe has taken my Privileges as an MP quite lightly, and this matter should be dealt with utmost importance and I would like to urge the Hon. Speaker to take severe action against him, who should learn to respect parliamentary traditions, and this should not set a precedent for other Members. I would also like to request the Hon. Speaker to expunge his statement from Hansard and take stern action against the Member to ensure that we are truly committed to democratic values in this House under your leadership and guidance.

1531 1532

Sir, you know that our party has been registered since 1949. How dare he says that we represent different sentiments! He has the freedom to express his views. But, how dare he says that I should be taken to the Criminal Investigation Department! Sir, this is a bad precedent that is being set because they are trying to villainize Tamil Parliamentarians here. As soon as the Hon. Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam gets up to speak, they try to villainize him. We should have the Privilege to speak in this House under your leadership. If you think that we should not speak, please let us know. Then, we might as well give our time to somebody else, let somebody else speak. Because as soon as we speak, we are villainized, we are branded as people who represent a different ideology. I mean, that is what democracy is about. We should be allowed to come here and express ourselves without fear or oppression. Has this Hon. Member, by saying that, been playing to the gallery? Sir, I beg you to take stern action against him.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member, we will look into that matter. ( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Sir, he is not a first-time MP. I think this is the second or the third time that he has been in Parliament. So, he should be given a strong message so that nobody else in this House violates our Privilege of speech in this House.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Sivagnanam Shritharan)

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Sivagnanam Shritharan?

( ) (The Hon. Sivagnanam Shritharan) , . . , TID - - . ,

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) All right. Thank you. I will look into that.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Speaker, I am a Member of the Committee on Ethics and Privileges. In fact, in the Committee also we spoke about this issue. The conduct of Hon. Members of Parliament in the course of debates, when another fellow Hon. Member is on his feet, is, quite honestly, just appalling. When you are in the Chair, Sir, you, to some extent, make an effort to maintain the decorum of the House. But, Sir, to raise a point of Order just to prevent another Hon. Member from expressing an opinion is outrageous because it comes to a point where Parties such as ours, which only has about six or seven minutes to speak, cannot even make a point.

So, the Hon. Speaker must take a firm position on this and must intervene and ask the other Hon. Members who take the Chair to insist on an Hon. Member who wishes to raise a point of Order to cite the Standing Order under which it is being raised. If no such Standing Order is mentioned at the very outset, that Hon. Member must be asked to sit down. Otherwise, speakers cannot make a point.

Sir, the second matter is about the Jaffna Mayor who has been arrested by the TID. I am not a fan of the Jaffna Mayor; he was a former member of our Party. But, I can tell you that the attempt by the Government to try and

1533 1534

2021

portray him as trying to resurrect the LTTE police force is preposterous! Under the Municipal Councils in various parts of the country, including Colombo, there are various sections created for issuing parking tickets. Like that, various things are done. So, for a person who has created such a section under the Municipal Council and allowed those employees to wear a light blue or dark blue uniform to be accused that he is reviving the LTTE is preposterous, Sir. If this is not political victimization, I do not know what it is.

And I can tell you, Sir, that I am not a fan of the Mayor, I have no reason to defend him. What this Government is doing is, it is just going beyond the pale by any stretch of imagination of something of political victimization; quite the contrary, this is fascism, Hon. Speaker and I say it with responsibility. You are militarizing the country on one hand, you are creating racism on the other hand and now you are preventing any form of other opinion. This is nothing but fascism and you must stop this. A Senior Member such as the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena is here. My God! Look at the state of this country. You must stop this. This is just not on, Hon. Speaker.

Speaker, if I may just suggest that if a Member is raising a false point of Order, time must be taken off from that Side. The moment some sort of steps like that is taken, you will find even the Whip controlling his Members from conducting themselves in that way. At the moment, what is happening is that anyone can get up and disturb a Member on his feet and get away with it all. There is no penalty that such outrageous behaviour entails.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) - ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) . ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) We all have agreed to have a serious discussion on this matter. So, we will take up this matter later

( ) (The Hon. Johnston Fernando) Hon. Speaker, I will make a clarification on the matter that the Hon. Rasamanickam has raised now, after the Hon. Mujibur Rahuman makes his remark.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) - [ ]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Speaker. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Ponnambalam?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) The other point of Order that I want to raise is that I am a recognized Party Leader. When it comes to the Committee on Parliamentary Business, the relevant Standing Order specifies a specific number of Members that that particular Committee can accommodate. As a result, my Party, the Hon. C.V. Wigneswarans Party, the Hon. (Ven.) Athuraliye Rathana Theros Party and the future UNP cannot be accommodated in the Meetings of the Committee on Parliamentary Business at the moment. So, I think if the Government and the Opposition agree, the Standing Orders can be changed so that the number of Members in that Committee would reflect the actual composition of this Parliament. I am an independent Party Leader. We do not have any association with the TNA or any other Party that is represented in that Committee. So, if we are not made a member of that Committee-

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Alright. I will consider that matter and try to invite all of you.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Speaker, if I may answer, the number of Members was once increased. The Opposition got an increase as a result of that decision of yours to increase the number of Members in the Committee on Parliamentary Business. Surely, the first priority should have gone to a Party which is not represented. It is not our decision. It is a decision of the Opposition.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Yes, but- ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) But the Opposition nominated another SJB Member to the Committee. I do not object to that. But, the Opposition nominated another SJB Member. The only way out is to discuss and resolve this.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) That is right. So, we will have an open discussion on this matter and see what we could do.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Speaker, there are other Parties represented in the SJB also, because the reality today is that there are major coalitions that have come to Parliament. Within the SJB, there are several Parties. Even within the Government, there are so many coalition partners.

1539 1540

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I agree with you. We will get all the persons concerned into it.

That is, Noufer and two men.

"........ were allegedly members of a group of ISIS supporters that carried out terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka on Easter Day in 2019, killing 268 people"

- Department of Justice- . .

The Justice Department announced today that three Sri Lankan citizens......."

That is, including Noufer.

".......have been charged with terrorism offences, including conspiring to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization (ISIS). The men were part of a group of ISIS supporters which called itself ISIS in Sri Lanka. That group is responsible for the 2019 Easter attacks in the South Asian nation of Sri Lanka, which killed 268 people, including five US citizens, and injured over 500 others, according to a federal criminal complaint unsealed today. And the Assistant Attorney General for National Security in America states in this Report, I quote:

Today, we charge these defendants with bearing their share of the responsibility for these deaths. According to these charges, the defendants were committed supporters of ISIS, recruited others to ISISs violent cause, purchased materials for and made IEDs, helped to prepare and trained others who participated in the attacks, and murdered in the name of this deadly foreign terrorist organization. They are in custody in Sri Lanka. We fully support the Sri Lankan investigation and prosecution of these terrorists and will continue to work with the authorities there to pursue our shared goal of holding these defendants accountable for their crimes. It further states, I quote: The criminal case filed on December 11, 2020, in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles is the result of a nearly two-year investigation by the FBI, which assisted Sri Lankan authorities in the wake of the suicide bombings that targeted Christian churches and luxury hotels frequented by Westerners. The defendants named in the complaint,

along with other suspects linked to the attacks, currently are detained in Sri Lanka, where a criminal investigation is ongoing.
