(b) If not, why?

( ) (The Hon. Susil Premajayantha) Now, may I answer you Supplementary Question. The Hon. Member referred to certain schools, including some schools which I mentioned in my Answer. - [Interruption.] No, it is okay, but all those schools mentioned in my Answer are under the provincial administration. The allocation of money is done with the concurrence of the Finance Commission, not only in this particular year, but every year. - [Interruption.] Yes. Normally, there is an allocation made by the provincial Ministry of Finance in consultation with the provincial Finance Commission. That is the normal procedure. I know that because I was the Chief Minister of the Western Province for five years. So like that, the provincial schools are given an allocation out of their annual Budget. Apart from that, as you said, there are 1000 National Schools proposed in the Policy Statement

"Saubhagyaye Dekma" and we have already started that. Even if you say it is a political drama, to my knowledge, it is not a political drama.

There were two Circulars issued long ago, in January, 2020.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Sir, that is not what I asked.

( ) (The Hon. Susil Premajayantha) Wait. I know how to answer a question. -[Interruption.]

( , ) ( - ) (The Hon. Nimal Lanza - State Minister of Rural Roads and Other Infrastructure) He will give the answer. You wait.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) You mind your own business. I am talking about the National Schools. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . . [ . [

( ) (The Hon. Susil Premajayantha) I will answer that particular Supplementary Question.

When selecting National Schools, there is a criteria and it is the provincial administration which ultimately proposes certain schools to be converted to National Schools. All the National Schools are given funds by the Line Ministry and the allocations for schools under provincial administrations are made by the respective Provincial Councils. If you go through the draft Appropriation Bill for 2022, of course, you will find that it is proposed to increase the amount allocated for education in 2022. So, certainly, this will be taken into consideration and funds will be allocated through the provincial administration for 2022.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam. You have nine minutes.

[3.21 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, we are debating the mid-year fiscal position of the country with regard to 2021, which came out through this Report.

Sir, at this very time, we have a section of the country, the teachers community and the principals, protesting on the roads and they have been doing that for the last several months. They are a part of the society which aspires to create individuals who succeed in life far better than they have done. Their goal is to create better individuals with a status than their own in life. That is the almost venerated angle in which we look at teachers and principals because of the sort of attitude they have. The measure of success is, their student must go far beyond them and their status in society, achieving a much greater status.

That is the section of the society which is protesting today and they have been protesting because of a disastrous decision taken 24 years ago by the B.C. Perera Salaries Commission, which chose to keep the teachers out. It is a fault that every consecutive Government has accepted. Even this Government, as soon as it came to power, with credit to them, appointed the Subodhini Commission. They allowed that Commission to have a fairly comprehensive study. Eventually, when the Subodhini Commission came out with its Report, the teachers unions accepted that Report, but the Government has not implemented it. The unions have been asking that Report, which this Government itself called for, to be implemented and if that is done, they will give up the protests. The Government has said that for various reasons - because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic situation - they are unable to implement that Report.

The unions have come down even further, that recognizing the economic situation of the country, as an interim measure, they are prepared to consider the Ministerial Committee Report of 2018 - when the previous Government was in power, that Report came out with various suggestions - instead of the full implementation of the Subodhini Commission Report. Yet, the Government is not prepared to commit itself to that. Instead, what the Government says is that they will implement the 2018 Proposals in four stages, that they will divide it into four sections and implement it in four stages over four years. The Unions are saying, "Even that, you implement in one go and make the 2018 Proposals as part of the Subodhini Commission" and that they will give up the protests and go back to work. Surely, Sir, with that position taken up by the teachers and principals unions, you cannot possibly find a more reasonable one from a section of the society which has been victims for

over 24 years. And what is more, every single Government has acknowledged that a great injustice has been done to them. You are not prepared to look into the interests of a section of the society which is so fundamental to the countrys well-being, in creating individuals who can keep this country competitive in the global context. It is only if the teachers and the principals, our education sector, are looked after that we also can expect our children to be competitive. But, they are treated like outcasts today and for 24 years.

Sir, there was a commitment in 2012, where Rs. 3,000 million were allocated and the unions were told at that time, in 2012, that their issue would be settled. You ask the teachers unions what happened to that Rs. 3,000 million and they will say that they do not know. How pathetic the situation these people have been kept in! This must stop; this must stop if this Government really wants to look into the interests of the citizens. On your infrastructure projects, you spend billions, apart from the unofficial, corrupt black money that you all inherit. But, these teachers who slave-drive themselves to create better individuals than themselves in the society are being left in the lurch. This country will be cursed, Sir, if we go on in this way.

And in this context, the Government is announcing that schools which have less than 200 children will be reopened on the 21st of October, 2021. Why are you doing this? When the teachers are protesting, when you are not prepared to come to a compromise, an agreement with them, you are reopening the schools. What are you trying to do? You are trying to set the larger society against those teachers. We urge the members of the society not to fall into this trap, to what this Government is trying to do - they are lining their pockets, but they are not willing to address the grave injustice that has been done to the teachers for over 24 years - and not to join the Government in penalizing and victimizing those already desperate sections of the society.

Sir, I do not wish to take much more time. The Question raised under Standing Order 27(2) by the Hon. Anura Dissanayaka was replied by the Minister of Education, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena. There again, he was good enough to say that on the 12th of November, 2021 when the Budget will be presented, the concerns of the teachers unions will be addressed. But, how are you going to address it? You should have actually given those assurances today to this House. If you are saying that you will address it and you know that you are going to have it addressed in the Budget on the 12th of November, why can you not call the teachers right now, tell them that, give those assurances directly to them and come to an agreement with them? Why can you not be more specific when they have told you repeatedly that if you agree, as an interim measure, to make the 2018 Proposals as part of the Subodhini Commission measures, if you are prepared to implement the 2018 Proposals immediately in one go, they will get off the streets? So, when they have told you that, to be not specific in replying to that Question under Standing Order 27(2), to merely give a very vague Answer saying that by the 12th of November, 2021 this matter will be addressed, is once again utter humbug. Sir,

1409 1410

these people have suffered enough and because of their suffering, our children are suffering even worse. So, this must stop!

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. (Mrs.) Diana Gamage.
