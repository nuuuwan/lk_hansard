Sitting accordingly suspended till 1.30 p.m. and then resumed, DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. ANGAJAN RAMANATHAN] in the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The Hon. M. A. Sumanthiran, please. You have 18 minutes.

[1.30 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for this opportunity to speak at today's Debate.

As I commence, I must bring to the notice of the House that we are debating not just a Report, but an incident that happened almost two years ago which took away 270 odd lives and critically injured more than 500 people in a series of bomb attacks, suicide attacks, unprecedented not just in this country but, I would say, anywhere in the world with such coordinated attacks at different locations taking place within the space of a few hours and that too, on Easter Sunday. The target was clearly the Christian Church. We hear today and at other times people saying that the Catholic community was harmed and that is true. A large number of those who were killed and injured were from the two Catholic Churches that were attacked. But, one must not forget that the Zion Church in Batticaloa in the eastern coast was also attacked and a large proportion of those who died were children because they were standing there after their Sunday School before the church service began. There are those who died and were injured in some of the attacks on hotels as well.

223 224

So, primarily, it was an attack on the Christian Church, both Roman Catholic and Protestant Church, and the response of the Church to this great tragedy must not be forgotten. At Kotahena, the Parish Priest, soon after the carnage, said, "We forgive those who led this attack" in true Christian spirit. I remember, Pastor Roshan Mahesan from the Zion Church also, when he returned to the country, said the same thing. But, one must not be confused with the Christian principle of forgiveness and justice. Justice and mercy are two eyes; they are not contradictory to each other. We are now in the season of Lent. I myself being a Christian am deeply conscious of the suffering and death of Jesus Christ on Good Friday. But, the story did not end there. Three days later, he rose from the dead. He died to forgive us our sins and rose again victorious having conquered sin itself and it is in that spirit the Church responded. So, the crux of the Christian message is that the Church was willing to readily forgive. For if we do not forgive, how can we receive forgiveness?

But, justice is as crucial as forgiveness itself. The cycle is not complete without justice. That is why it is the States responsibility to mete out justice. Governments are in place given the task to commend those who do right and punish those who do evil. But, successive Governments have failed to mete out justice in this regard. I do not want to trade allegations, as has happened in the morning in this Chamber, because if we trade allegations against each other, we will be doing great injustice to those who died, those who suffered injuries and to those who lost their loved ones. That should not be the task of this Debate. The task of this Debate should be to find out who was the mastermind of the attacks. We have had several inquiries into this matter. Have we now got to the root of it? In the words of the Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, have we found the "mastermind" of this attack? No, we have not. I heard the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage say that Zahran was the mastermind. No, none of us accepts that; His Eminence also does not accept that. That is why after this Report came, he has asked the question, Who is the mastermind? repeatedly. That is why the Black Sunday protests have been started after this Report came out. There is no mastermind revealed in this Report. This Report, otherwise, is a good report. I must say that. They have gone into the matter at great depth.

I also have the other Report of the Parliamentary Select Committee and I commend the Hon. Members to read both. You might find them to be identical, actually. A lot of the findings in the Parliament Select Committee Report are here in this Report as well; a lot of the recommendations in the Parliamentary Select Committee Report are repeated in this Report as well. But, neither has been able to say who coordinated these attacks and whose agenda it was to carry out these attacks.

In page 3 of the Executive Summary of "The Report of the Parliament Select Committee to Look into and Report to Parliament on the Terrorist Attacks that Took Place in Different Places in Sri Lanka on 21st April,

2019", we had this to say, I quote:

The PSC makes a very serious finding in terms of the status of the state intelligence apparatus, where intelligence information known to a few was not shared with relevant parties. The PSC also observes that further investigations will be needed to understand whether those with vested interests did not act on intelligence so as to create chaos and instil fear and uncertainty in the country in the lead up to the Presidential Election to be held later in the year. Such a situation would then lead to the call for a change of regime to contain such acts of terrorism. Coincidently or not so coincidentally, the security situation and fear would be unleashed months away from the Presidential Election. The PSC also notes that this occurred in the context of changes in the leadership in the Sri Lankan Army and DMI in 2019. These are extremely serious observations that can impact the democratic governance, electoral processes and security of Sri Lanka and must require urgent attention.

"Who stood to benefit?" is one question that ought to be asked. "Who benefited?" is another question that must be asked. We all know the answer. And a further question that needs to be asked today is, "After the lapse of two years and two inquiries - a preliminary inquiry was headed by a Judge of the Supreme Court - if we say that we are still unable to name the mastermind, then, is there something that is being covered up?" These were attacks that had prior information; this is not an investigation into an attack that happened with no notice to anybody. No. This is an attack that happened after due notice with names of assailants. Almost a month before, at least three weeks before, written information was given to the authorities. So, you had prior information; you had detailed information; you had information even moments before the attack, a few minutes before the attack. So, several information came in. All that is there in both these Reports. In the Parliamentary Select Committee, we interviewed 55 persons. In the other Presidential Commission, 457 witnesses had given evidence. But after all of that and after prior information also being available, if we say, We do not know who the mastermind is, there is obviously something radically wrong.

The people who have suffered are not met with justice. That is the responsibility of the State. I do not want to blame this Government or that Government. Governments come and governments go, but the State has a responsibility to its citizens. Is Sri Lanka today telling its citizens, We do not know who the masterminds of these attacks are. We had prior information; we had names of those suicide bombers, five out of the six names were there. We did not do a thing and we did not share that information with anybody? How can the State ever tell its citizens that? This is a very serious issue, so serious that His Eminence has called for an international inquiry. Those who said, We must not allow an international inquiry. We can look after our own matters and these are all domestic issues are themselves calling for an international inquiry now. Why? Because the State has failed in its most awesome responsibility of accountability. The State is accountable to its citizens in delivering justice. That is the highest obligation of the State towards its citizens, and the State has failed in that. I am saying this today also in the context of the Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council going on, where repeatedly, for 11 years, the world has asked us about accountability. It started on the 26th of May, 2009 when

225 226

the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa, now Prime Minister, signed a Joint Communiqu with the then Secretary-General of the UN, Ban Ki-moon, in Kandy, undertaking to inquire into the allegations of violations at the last stages of the war, which was not done for 11 years. That is why the issue will not go away. It will not go away however much you shout from the rooftops here that it is a domestic matter and you will look after it. You have not looked after that; for 11 years, you have not done it. The Catholic Church has lost patience after two years; His Eminence has called for an international inquiry after two years. We have waited for 11 long years or longer than that. So, how can anybody blame us for asking for an international investigation - an international inquiry - into war crimes? That happens only when the State fails its citizens.

So, this is an opportune moment for me to say this to those Members from both sides of the House who have said that there need not be any international investigation. In respect of this matter, you are asking for an international investigation. Your religious leader is calling for that and with justification. I support that. If the State cannot do it, this kind of violation calls for international intervention. I support the Archbishop of Colombo, His Eminence, on his call for an international investigation because the State has failed. That can be called a fortiori, much more reason, to call for an international investigation and an international prosecution for the crimes that were committed during the war until 2009.

You know there are speeches of bravado saying, We will win. We will do this. We will do that. Nobody can take us here, there or everywhere. Those are foolhardy talk. We are an island physically. But, no country is an island. We are a responsible member of the United Nations; we are one of the first few members. We have obligations; we have responsibilities. We cannot only have privileges of being a member of the United Nations; we carry with it severe responsibility. If we say we are a sovereign nation, then that sovereignty which vests in the people must have some meaning. And the officials of the State are only those who must carry that obligation and make sovereignty a reality to the extent that they do not do that, to the extent that they fail to do that. Justice will cry out all over the world and that is something that Members from both sides of the House must realize.

Christian charity is to forgive, but it is a forgiveness based on justice and both, as I said, are of one whole. The world is looking at this country as a country that has failed to deliver justice to its citizens and has become a failed State today.
