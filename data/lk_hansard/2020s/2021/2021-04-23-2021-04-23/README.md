Sir, in Sri Lanka, it being a democratic country, there is an acceptable way of implementing the law. For example, if you want to lodge a complaint about someone, you go to police. Sometimes, you may make a complaint to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption or to some other authority, depending on the issue. Then, the matter will be investigated by the relevant authority. Even the CID might be called upon to assist depending on the complexity of the matter in hand. If the police or the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption decides to file a case, they go before the relevant courts. If someone tries to deviate from this standard process or tries to manipulate the system, then it is an attempt to violate the law.

Sir, from the time politics was allowed to enter the haloed precincts of our Public Service, vindictiveness and favouritism by one set of politicians in power have been alleged by the Opposition and when the Opposition politicians came to power subsequently, victimization of their supporters by the previous regime had been alleged. The Opposition, then in power, thereafter went on to favour those in the Public Service who supported them. We have forgotten that this pernicious practice is the outcome of the politicization of our Public Service.

Neither Parliament nor politicians should interfere with the Public Service. That would violate the principle of separation of powers enshrined in Article 4 of the Constitution. The Public Service is part of the Executive, no doubt. However, even the President and the Cabinet have only limited power in respect of the Public Service. The Constitution contains three Chapters dealing with the Executive: Chapter VII, VIII and IX. Chapter IX deals with the Public Service. The only power that the Cabinet has over the Public Service is at a policy level. Article 55 (4) of the Constitution states as follows, I quote:

"Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the Cabinet of Ministers shall provide for and determine all matters of policy relating to public officers, .....

The Constitution, in its wisdom, does not permit neither the President nor the Cabinet of Ministers to interfere with the workings of the Public Service. The Cabinet can only give policy guidance. In other words, the Cabinet cannot interfere with the decision of whom to prosecute. That decision is for the Attorney-General and the Attorney-General alone. It is probably for this reason that His Excellency the President has not sought to include the Attorney-General within the ambit of this Commission of Inquiry despite naming several other institutions. However, it is shocking to note that the Commission has decided to embark upon its own voyage and to persecute even the prosecutors. Yesterday, somebody was talking about one of the lawyers, a State Counsel, of the Attorney-Generals Department.

The Cabinet is responsible to Parliament in the discharge of its functions. If the Cabinet itself can only give policy direction to the Public Service, then what can Parliament do in its supervisory capacity? It can only question the Cabinet on its policy directives. Parliament can also pass legislation ensuring that specific safeguards are built into the system to prevent political victimization. But, it certainly cannot be involved in giving any directions to the Public Service at the individual level. That would be a grave transgression of the Constitution and violative of Articles 4 and 55.

The Hon. Jayantha Weerasinghe, Attorney-at-Law, who had appeared before me in several cases when I was High Court Judge, Colombo, yesterday gave a detailed description of what happened to his clients including Mr. Basil Rajapaksa during the Y ahapalana Government. It was very dramatic and descriptive, no doubt. But, if individuals or their Attorneys-at-Law felt that evidence has been manufactured against them or that they have been politically victimized, they have numerous avenues

open to them to vindicate their rights through the Judiciary. First, a person can raise objections in the criminal case itself. Then, they can invoke the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in terms of Article 126 of the Constitution for the violation of their fundamental rights. They also can invoke the writ jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal in terms of Article 140. on.

They can institute proceedings for malicious prosecution and seek damages. The powers of the Judiciary are so wide that injustice can be prevented and damages awarded. The Executive and the Legislature simply have no role to play at the individual level. Individuals must seek the assistance of the Judiciary.

The idea that political victimization by a previous regime should be looked into by special commissions and committees is anathema to the rule of law. It has no place in the context of Article 126 of the Constitution. Article 126(1) of the Constitution states, I quote:

The Supreme Court shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine any question relating to the infringement or imminent infringement by executive or administrative action of any fundamental right or language right declared and recognized by Chapter III or Chapter IV.

Therefore, it is my view that the entire idea of the appointment of a Presidential Commission of Inquiry to inquire into and obtain information pertaining to the alleged incidents of political victimization of public officers, employees of State corporations, members of the armed forces and the Police Service was misplaced. The Public Service must be allowed to do its duty objectively, not to please those in power politically.

If the appointment of the said Commission was a folly, the Commission itself, which was called by the Hon. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka yesterday as the pissu poosa Commission, has proceeded with visible glee into territories that angels fear to tread. It is clear that there are several cases presently pending in relation to the matters inquired into by the Commission. The Commission is not a body recognized by Article 105 of the Constitution as an institution for administration of justice. It simply has no business which has anything to do with matters pertaining to the Judiciary. All the actions by the Commission in respect of pending cases would constitute a clear interference with the Judiciary and as such, would be in violation of Article 111C, which states that any interference with the Judiciary would be an offence recognized in the Constitution itself.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) If this Debate seeks, in any manner, to implement the so-called recommendations of the Commission, this House too would be violating Article 111C. That is probably why, despite the ill-advised wording of the Motion, no directions are being sought from the House.

2121 2122

Having said that, I need to make my observations from a different standpoint. Though the recent events and activities seem to point to death knell for democracy, the rule of law and the independence of the Public Service and the Judiciary, from the point of view of the Tamils who have suffered at the hands of the successive Sri Lankan Governments by being denied justice so far, this action of appointing a Commission and accepting a Report of this nature by this Government is welcome to us Tamils in a perverse way.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Sir, please give me half a minute.

It is welcome because it highlights exactly what was recently said in Geneva. It gives a wonderful example of how the Government of Sri Lanka perverts the course of justice. It proves what is being said by the Tamils, that the Government of Sri Lanka cannot be trusted to allow justice to take its own course. This is why the Tamils, the human rights organizations and the UN are clamouring for the appointment of international tribunals. If those accused of corruption will not be allowed to face trial, what hope is there of getting war criminals tried? Those of you in the Government who blame the diaspora, the NGOs and the West for allegedly persecuting Sri Lanka should look hard at what you are doing right now. It is you who is letting the country down by such dubious methods.

I conclude by saying that none of us have the right to say that we alone love this country. If the majority in this country had acted humanely, prudently and with far sight, this country would not be in the dire straits it is in today. Our youth would not have taken up arms. I hope we change our ways and tread towards sanity, unity and prosperity.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you. Next, the Hon. Chinthaka Amal Mayadunna. You have ten minutes.

[3.39 p.m.]

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, I am particularly glad to speak when you, one of the fairest Chairs I have come across in this Parliament, are in the Chair.

Sir, my party and I have been victims of politically-motivated legal action. We took the course of fighting the case; we appeared before the court. We showed the court that the steps taken by the chief opposition to us in the North-East was politically motivated and that the complaints made against us were false. Those were the defences that we took in the course of the trial and eventually, I was personally acquitted. A case was filed against another member of our party, a leading member, which was subsequently withdrawn when that member decided to leave our party. So, that is the sort of victimization that we also have faced.

But, Sir, what is happening today is something different. The fact that you have a tragic culture in this country of Governments taking action against the previous Government and vice versa has somersaulted to a point, if you get to the crux of it, where today, you have a situation that the Government of the day has, by creating these Presidential Commissions of Inquiries and

this Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry, essentially confessed that it does not have faith in its own judicial system. That is what it amounts to. The Government of the day chooses not to go before the courts and not to use the numerous legal avenues that they have in order to prove that those were politically-motivated steps that the previous Government had taken, which is a good defence and which you can take up in the case itself. You can file fundamental rights cases; you can file prosecutions for malicious prosecution and there are so many avenues that are available. But instead of doing that, creating a Presidential Commission of Inquiry and a Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry whilst these processes are going on - some of the cases are before court and some are in the course of being investigated - shows that this Government has confessed to this country and to the world that it does not have faith in its own judicial system. That is the important lesson we need to draw from this. I say this because it is this Government, as far as the Tamils who have been asking for an international criminal investigation with regard to the crimes that took place during the conflict are concerned, that went to Geneva as soon as the President was elected and withdrew from the co-sponsorship of the Geneva Resolution saying that they have a sound judicial system and that they will, therefore, have an internal inquiry and look at this internally. Today, that very Government, by creating Presidential Commissions of Inquiry and trying to prevent those very same courts from deciding whether, in fact, these matters were fairly prosecuted or maliciously prosecuted, has convinced not just the citizens of this country but also the international community that this judicial system is not something that they trust and that this Governments system is so perverse that it cannot be trusted.

That is what you have done. That is what the Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran also, I think, referred to when he said that in a default sort of way, the Tamils will be happy with what is going on here because we believe that the judicial structure and the structures of governance over the last so many decades have been so perverted in the way they have handled things that you cannot expect justice, you cannot expect truth and you cannot expect proper accountability to come out of those.

This Government - I would say this with responsibility - is the strongest case for the Tamil people to show and prove to the international community that it is, in fact, an international criminal investigation that would be just for the victims of war. It is the Gotabaya Rajapaksa Government, unlike any other in the past, that is convincing the international community, in every step of the way, that this country is not able or willing to do justice for the most heinous crimes that are claimed to have been committed in the course of the war. So, Sir, that is the reality we face.

Then, I just want to point out a few consequences of the madate of this Commission of Inquiry, the fact that it violates the separation of powers and the rule of law, that if the recommendations are implemented, it will be a derogation of the due process and fair trial rights and that it undermines the independence of several institutions,

2155 2156

including the Judiciary and the Attorney-Generals Department. They are being prosecuted; members of that Department are being called and are going to be prosecuted. That is the state which you have created. No one will henceforth want to look into any politically-linked cases for fear of the precedent that you are setting today. Witnesses will be frightened to come and appear before future courts or tribunals. So, this sets a dangerous precedent to further entrench impunity in this country, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , .

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I am winding up before that, Sir.

So, it is on that basis that we, as the Tamil National Peoples Front, have been saying this for a long time. It is not because we want ill to happen to this country or this country to be disgraced. That is not the intention, but the reality is that every part of the governance structure of this State is politicized. That is a tragedy and if we do not wake up and realize it, this country will move towards a failed State. That is what is at stake. And, it is your own actions, being both on the side of the Government today and the side of the Opposition in the past, that are making sure that your slide towards a failed State is going to become inevitable.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) 2 . , 18 .

[3.59 p.m.] ( - ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya - State Minister of Regional Co-operation) At the outset, Hon. Presiding Member, let me thank you for giving me 10 minutes of the time of this House to express my views on the Report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Political Victimization, which is before us.

Sir, I was not in the House in the morning, but I did manage to listen to much of today's Debate through the radio and also to yesterdays Debate. One common denominator by the Members during the Debate, which I noticed, was that this political victimization seems to be a pattern which is repetitious and which seems to be coming up every five years and the Government in power, in its eagerness to correct the wrongdoings of the previous Government, somehow uses that opportunity for political victimization.

Sir, I think my Friend, the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam, also stated in this House that this Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Political Victimization goes to show the deficiencies in the normal legal system, which I do tend to agree. But, Commissions of Inquiry are not necessarily the reason for that. Commissions of Inquiry are appointed under the provisions of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, No. 17 of 1948, which has been amended several times. Usually, Presidential Commissions of Inquiry are appointed if unforeseeable circumstances that are controversial in nature arise, which necessitate a public inquiry like, for example, the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate, Inquire and Report on the Issuance of Treasury Bonds.

If we go back to what happened during the Yahapalana Government and before the Yahapalana Government came to power, it was seen that a series of lies and deceptions, particularly pertaining to the Rajapaksa family, were created by the United National Party: stories of Lamborghinis being possessed by the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa were created; if there was any 'Walawwa' type house in a rural area, it was said that that was BRs house and if there was any coconut estate or any other estate, it was said that that was GRs. Similarly, certain narratives were built by the Opposition at that time against the Rajapaksa Government. Once they came to power, particularly by using Facebook and other social media, they were compelled to show that there was corruption during the previous regime. I am not denying that there was corruption. I am sure and I would be humble enough to say that under every Government since 1948, there must have been corruption. But, the manner in which the Y ahapalana Government, in its eagerness to prosecute the Rajapaksas and the officials of the Rajapaksa Government, set forth to curb it, I think, is most despicable. We have already heard from the Hon. Jayantha Weerasinghe, PC, how particular courts were changed, particular judges were used and particular MPs were jailed. Furthermore, we saw from the video tapes of

former MP Ranjan Ramanayake how he liaised with certain judges.

Today, the Members of the Opposition do not talk about this part of the equation.

There are two parts of the equation. One part is, if evidence was fabricated, then should these cases be allowed to go on? I think not. If the evidence was fabricated, certainly those people should get redress. The major part of the Oppositions argument today was that in giving redress to those victims, there will be impunity. I want to categorically state that this Government is, in no way, looking for any impunity and I too want to express my view that if a certain misdemeanour has been committed, certainly those people should be prosecuted. But, if the evidence has been fabricated or made up, particularly in the Temple Trees, it is different. Now, the Leader of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna admitted that he went to the Temple Trees and attended three meetings and certain people were paid in order to prosecute the people of the former Government. If that was the procedure adopted, then there is something left for all of us to ponder.

Sir, there was also another accusation, that this Government is trying to take away the civic rights of the Opposition Members. I want to strongly deny that. I can categorically tell you that when we were at our Group Meeting, it was the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa who stated - I was pleasantly surprised to hear that - that he had been treated unfairly and jailed for no wrongdoing, but that we must not do the same thing to the Opposition. We feel that way and all of our Hon. Members agreed that it is not the business of the House to take away the civic rights of any Hon. Member who has been convicted and that it should be left for the courts. I say this particularly because when Madam Bandaranaikes civic rights were removed in 1979, the civic rights of my grandfather, the Hon. P.B. Balasuriya, too were removed as a Member of Parliament. So, I know what it is like. Most of the Hon. Members who spoke in the House today talked of their personal circumstances under which they have suffered due to political victimization. I saw yesterday the Hon. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka presenting similar views. Having said that, I would also say that we have to ensure that this does not mean that we allow impunity. If we forget about all these things, I think the corruption levels would probably increase in the future.

Sir, another argument which the Opposition has put forward was that the recommendations of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Political Victimization to withdraw certain cases are interfering with the Judiciary. I do not think that this is an interference with the Judiciary, if the evidence has been fabricated. If the evidence has been fabricated, it can be handed over to the Attorney-Generals Department - the Attorney-Generals Department has to report it to Parliament - and if there is any omission or error in filing of any case, then it is not an insult to the court. I think justice has to be served and this has to be looked at in a fair manner.

I also agree with the Hon. G.G Ponnambalam that if we have a high frequency of Commissions of Inquiry, it

2161 2162

goes to show the non-functionality of the Government. As much as we need to use the Commissions of Inquiry on an ad hoc basis if a certain matter arises, we also need to use it at a minimum number of instances. I must also say that I am not a great fan of Special Presidential Commissions of Inquiry. We know that this law came into being since 1978 during the J.R. Jayewardene Government. It is draconian in nature.

Today, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem also spoke of the same. So, I will tell this much to the Members of the Opposition: rest assured, we will not take the same steps or follow the same mechanism as you all did to put us behind bars; we will not have discussions at the Temple Trees to decide as to who is going to be jailed. I remember the arrogance of certain Members in the House at that time, particularly of the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senarathne who had the audacity to point fingers and say, This person will be jailed by this date. That was the level of your thinking during that time. But, we would not be doing the same thing in the future.

Sir, I also take this opportunity to talk about the matter of Mr. Basil Rajapaksa, former Member of Parliament. He was jailed for distributing some pipes during the Local Government Elections and when it was questioned whether there was any material gain to Mr. Rajapaksa, it was pointed out that there was no material gain that he received. Also when questioned whether there was any record as to where those pipes which were distributed were kept, it was revealed that all records were finalized and they were with the relevant Local Government Institutions. Nonetheless, that matter was used against him and he was jailed forthwith.

I would also like to take up the case of Mr. Duminda Silva. Certain Members in the Opposition raised the matter, stating that that case was put forward to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court convicted him. But, I ask you, in your heart of hearts, do you think it is fair for one judge out of the three judges going into that case to casually talk to a former Member of Parliament who was in the Government at that time and declare that justice would be done in the way that particular Member aspired, which was to jail Mr. Duminda Silva? In such circumstances, do you not feel that Mr. Dumunida Silva should be given another fair chance?

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , 2. ( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Sir, please give me one more minute.

On my way from Deraniyagla, I was listening to the speech of the Hon. Anura Dissanayake and I was dismayed to hear him say that his secretary, who was the Head of the last Commission of Inquiry appointed to go

into the abuse of power, asked what is wrong with that. I cannot fathom how a person like the Hon. Anura Dissanayake, who talks so virtuously about the righteousness, failed to see that there was a conflict of interest.

Sir, when we make laws and set patterns, they should be equal in nature to both sides. I think most Members of Parliament know that this is a vicious cycle. We need to move out of this vicious cycle, undoubtedly. Having said that, I would also like to say that we also need to punish those who had committed any wrongdoings. Also, if cases have been filed against people unfairly with fabricated evidence and if there is proof of evidence against such cases, those should be handed over to the Attorney-Generals Department so that those cases could be withdrawn.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .. 2 , 2 .
