.. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) I mentioned that to the Hon. Minister also. All those corrections would be of no use if, at the end of Debate, they are not going to proceed with those.

Sir, I will take a few minutes to quote from Nelson Mandelas beautiful book Dare Not Linger - The Presidential Years. I was impressed by his thinking, as to how one should lead. I will quote from page 65 of his book, where he says:

'One should never forget that the main aim in a debate, inside and outside the organization, in political rallies, in Parliament and other government structures, is that we should emerge from that

231 232

[ ...

2021 1

debate, however sharp our differences might have been, closer and more united and confident than ever before. The removal of differences and mutual suspicion within ones organization.should always be our guiding principle.

'This is comparatively easy when we try, to the best of our ability, never to question the integrity of another comrade or a member of another political organization who has a different point of view from ours.

'During my political career, I have discovered that in all communities, African, coloured, Indian and white, and in all political organizations without exception, there are good men and women who fervently wish to go on with their lives, who yearn for peace and stability, who want a decent income, good houses and to send their children to the best schools, who respect and want to maintain the social fabric of society.

'Good leaders fully appreciate that the removal of tensions in society, of whatever nature, puts creative thinkers on centre stage by creating an ideal environment for men and women of vision to influence society. Extremists, on the other hand, thrive on tension and mutual suspicion. Clear thinking and good planning was never their weapon.'

So, therefore, it is very important that we understand that, even 73 years after Independence, we are not enemies. Merely because we speak different languages, merely because we come from different sides and merely because we have different opinions on a question, we are not enemies of each other. Therefore, it is time that we start talking to each other, resolve our differences and come up with a new Constitution which is inclusive and which could be a foundation for a great Sri Lanka where each one of us could thrive. That is the task we have to carry out and I am confident that we have appointed a very skillful committee to look into the preliminary drafting of our new Constitution. They are working hard; they are speaking to so many people. Probably, I will have a working meeting with them next week or so. So, I hope in years to come, we should be able to forget about the past, admit that we, all communities and all sides, have made mistakes and move on and learn from South Africa. There is a lot to learn from them. When I read this book by Nelson Mandela, I remember that in one place he says, I want to liberate the oppressor and the oppressed, both". That is what he says. Therefore, there is no point in our trying to hurl insults at each other. It is time that we move on and build this country to its real potential.

The Attorney-General strongly emphasized, a Commission of Inquiry is not a judicial tribunal and it is a fact-finding body functioning under the authority of the Executive.

In the circumstances, any attempt by the CoI to directly or indirectly inquire into or investigate matters pertaining to the role of the Attorney-General in prosecuting cases pending before the relevant judicial fora would be tantamount to an interference with the judiciary, said the Attorney-General.

. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. You have ten minutes.

[2.05 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for this opportunity to speak today.

I wish to right away commend the Hon. Minister of Justice for the statesmanlike speech he delivered when he introduced these Bills about an inclusive country, a country in which all citizens, from whatever background they come, feel and know that they are equals in this country. And to that end, to all efforts that he makes as a responsible Minister, as the Minister of Justice of the country, we would like to extend our fullest cooperation and our wishes that he succeeds in that endeavour.

Now, I would now like to quote from what the visiting Indian Minister of External Affairs, Dr. Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, who is in the country today said a little while ago at the Joint Press Conference held in Colombo.

Our support for the reconciliation process in Sri Lanka is longstanding, as indeed for an inclusive political outlook that encourages ethnic harmony. It is in Sri Lankas own interest that the expectations of the Tamil people for equality, justice, peace and dignity within a united Sri Lanka are fulfilled. That applies equally to the commitments made by the Sri Lankan Government on meaningful devolution, including the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. The progress and prosperity of Sri Lanka will surely be advanced as a consequence.

I wish to thank the visiting Minister of External Affairs of India, on behalf of the Tamil National Alliance, for those comments and I also wish to thank the President who had, reportedly, given that assurance to the visiting Minister. Also I quote what our Minister of Foreign stated: "The President firmly stated his commitment to the well-being, progress and opportunities to all our citizens - Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim and all." And if that indeed be the vision of the Government, our support for all your processes to achieve that end will continue to remain.

Sir, we have, before us, some Bills. Hon. Minister, you have sought to amend the Evidence Ordinance and the Penal Code to change the archaic language and to bring them in line with the affairs that are presently prevailing. These were laws that were enacted during the British Regime and naturally, the King or the Queen, the Governor et cetera still remain in our statute books and you have thought it fit to change it. But, Hon. Minister, you must be well aware that these are not the only pieces of legislation that have all these archaic language; there are a plenty more.

I also wish to put on record another fact which, perhaps, a lot of people are not conscious of. That is, a lot of the body of law of our country still remains English Common Law; we do not have Statute Law. For instance, in relation to the entire Administrative Law of our country where courts exercise writ jurisdiction, there are no statutes and there is nothing written. Everything is English Common Law even to this day. Laws on a lot of commercial matters like insurance, bills of lading et cetera are all English Common Law. The law for the time being in England is the law here and that is what the Civil Law Ordinance states. That is not a bad thing, but we must be conscious that that is the case.

Another one is the contempt of court. We do not have substantive law as statute on contempt of law. It is the law for the time being in England that applies to contempt, and scandalizing the court is no more an offence of contempt of court in England; that has been abolished. So, we keep in line with the developments in England as regards the law; we keep in line with the development of the law as it prevails today in South Africa because our common law is Roman-Dutch Law and the judgments of the South African courts are also relevant to that extent and with regard to the Penal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Civil Procedure Code and the Evidence Ordinance, we keep in touch with the developments in India because those laws in India are almost identical to the statutes that we have. Therefore, this fact that we are connected to the region and we are connected to our colonial masters even though we say that we have become a Republic and discontinued that legal connection, the colonial tradition is not true. The body of law, most of it, in our country is still the English law and the Roman-Dutch Law. I think that needs to be emphasized and attempts like this, although they are salutary, do not actually remove us from the fact that we are a common law country with a British legal tradition and the Roman-Dutch Law as our common law.

239 240

I also want to, before my time runs out, refer to the other Bill. That is, the Bail (Amendment) Bill. We welcome the fact that you are increasing the fines in those Schedules. But with regard to bail, I wish to support the Hon. Member who preceded me and who referred to certain statutes which deny bail and which state that if there is a prosecution under those, there is no bail, particularly the Antiquities Ordinance. He mentioned that and I know, as a matter of fact, that in several areas, even if accidentally some stone is damaged, the persons are brought before court and they have absolutely no chance of defending themselves. If they want to defend themselves, they have to be in remand.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, you have two more minutes. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir.

So, therefore, together with my Hon. Friend, I wish to urge you to look at some of these statutes where bail is denied and to make it the norm to grant bail and the judicial discretion to be retained.

Since time is running out, I want to refer to the Tamil political prisoners' issue. I want to cite just one example of a person called Edward Sam Sivalingam who was arrested on 4th August, 2006. He was my client; I appeared for him in a Fundamental Rights case in the Supreme Court, which was dismissed because he possessed a travel identity card issued by the LTTE. In those days, if you were in the LTTE-controlled areas and you had to travel out, you had to have that card. Otherwise, they would not let you travel out. Because of that, he was identified as an LTTEer, which is wrong.

Sir, there is this book called The Judicial Mind in Sri Lanka. For lack of time, I table* the cover page and page 242 of that book.

Jayantha de Almeida Gunerate, Kishali Pinto-Jayawardena and Gehan Gunatilleke wrote this book in 2014 and they have referred to this case. It appears in page 242, which I tabled. That person, after ten years of detention under the PTA, was indicted in 2016, but the case is still going on. Nothing has happened in the case because the two police officers who were involved in recording the so-called confession are dead. I remember the time when if the police officer was dead, they were released. If that was the only evidence, the persons were released.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am winding up. Thank you.

So, that is one case that I know of. I am sure there are several other cases like that. As a father of three children, he was a church worker who was supposed to have introduced one person to another person who was supposed to be a driver who transported some explosives and there is no evidence against him. The confession cannot be proved, but he is still languishing in prison. So, this is the fate of the majority of those whom we call Tamil political prisoners. You have been releasing many people. - [Interruption.] Please give me one moment, Sir, and I will conclude.

I wish to commend the Hon. Lohan Rathwaththe seated next to you, Hon. Minister. He told me that about 10,000 persons have been released from prison. I applaud you, Hon. State Minister, for that. But, look at the plight of these people who have been there for 15, 16, 20 and 25 years without a trial and with no evidence. I urge the Hon. Minister to please look into this. Your time in the Government might be short-lived. So, while you are there, please look at this and grant us also relief.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. Jayantha Weerasinghe, PC. You have 12 minutes.

[2.16 p.m.]

( ( ) ) (The Hon. Jayantha Weerasinghe, PC) First of all, thank you, Hon. Sumanthiran, for complimenting the Hon. Minister of Justice because that is exactly how I am going to start my speech, but, of course, in a different language. , . , . . , . .

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran. You have three minutes.

[2.27 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Sir, in my suggestions yesterday at the Ministerial Consultative Committee Meeting, I had occasion to refer to the 1972 Constitution, the Administration of Justice Law and the current 1978 Constitution. As a law lecturer, I had thought that the matters referred to in these Amendment Bills may have already been dealt with. I was able to find a lot of important matters to be considered by the Hon. Members of this august Assembly before we pass these Bills.

With regard to these Bills, Sir, the crux of the Amendments contemplated are to change the reference to British institutions including references to proctors and advocates which were inserted into our statutes - the Penal Code and the Evidence Ordinance - during the British times and enhancement of fines as per the Bail Act.

Sir, let me deal with the Penal Code and the Evidence Ordinance first. I find the Amendments contemplated by this Government with regard to lawyers have already been dealt with in the 1972 Constitution, the Administration of Justice Law and in the current 1978 Constitution. Section 36(3) of the Administration of Justice Law states, I quote:

Every reference in any other existing written law to an advocate or proctor shall be read and construed as a reference to an attorney-at-law.

So, you would see that it has already been taken into consideration.

Then, Article 168(1) of the current 1978 Constitution states, I quote:

Unless Parliament otherwise provides, all laws, written laws and unwritten laws, in force immediately before the commencement of the Constitution, shall, mutatis mutandis and except as otherwise expressly provided in the Constitution, continue in force.

Then, the next Article, 169, states, I quote:

Unless Parliament otherwise provides - (1) any provisions of the Administration of Justice Law, No. 44 of 1973, which are inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution, shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be deemed to be repealed;

That means, there are Sections of the Administration of Justice Law still in force and that is what I meant earlier. Thus, it would be seen that the provisions of the Administration of Justice Law do still stand and are valid. So, under the circumstances, the Amendments in respect of attorneys-at-law seem redundant, not only redundant, but they also could create confusion.

As regards the reference to British institutions including the Queen, it had been dealt with through Articles 12 to 15 of the 1972 Constitution. Article 12(1) states, I quote:

Unless the National State Assembly otherwise provides, all laws, written and unwritten, in force immediately before the commencement of the Constitution, except such as are specified in Schedule A shall, mutatis mutandis, and except as otherwise expressly provided in the Constitution, continue in force. The laws so continuing in force are referred to in the Constitution as existing law.

Therefore, it appears that matters relating to British institutions have already been taken care of. Thus, these Amendment Bills may not be necessary.

As for the Bail (Amendment) Bill, it would be prudent to add a clause which specifies that the increased fines would be applicable to offences committed after its enactment. In this connection, it is necessary to read Article 13(6) of the Constitution. I am not going to read that out. Hence, subject to the addition necessary to protect the rights of prisoners under the Bail Act, the other two Amendments may be dispensed with or reviewed upon because it would be wrong to continue with these in a specific manner when there is already a general law pertaining to those. When there is a general law and a specific law on these matters, it may be argued, since there are specific laws in regard to certain acts and not with regard to others, that the other ones may not come into force. So, this is for the consideration of the Hon. Minister.

Thank you. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) Hon. Wigneswaran, if you could please give me that note, I will go through that. I am thankful for your suggestions.

Sir, I too would like to start by congratulating the Hon. Minister of Justice, the Hon. Ali Sabry, for the excellent speech he made when he presented the Bills. I only hope that his position in the Government would not be jeopardized by the sentiments he expressed because I am not sure that a majority of his Colleagues would appreciate and even understand what he said.

Hon. Presiding Member, I also want to say this. What is happening right now is a very dangerous situation where we are creating states of exception for certain categories of people. Those who are considered undesirable seem not to be subject to the same kinds of protection or rights that are available to all. I think from where this kind of mentality comes about is something that we need to pay attention to because it can be very contradictory to the very sentiments you expressed.

Sir, please give me a few more seconds to mention this because the Hon. State Minister, the Hon. Lohan Ratwatte, is here. I know there is a discussion going on now about women and children - mothers and their children - in prisons. I ask you to please look at this issue sensitively. It is not only perfect or ideal mothers who should have access to their children, but all mothers have a right to be with their children and all children have a right to be with their mothers. So, when we intervene in these instances, I think we need to take the best interests of the child as well as the well-being of the mother into consideration. Also, separating especially young children from their mothers at an early age can be detrimental. So, I request you to look at this issue sensitively with the best interests of all parties in mind.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 61 .

. Bail is the rule and refusal is the exception. The principle is, you detain for investigation or otherwise, you release on bail. That is the general principle across the world. . In the Corona context, it is ironic that you are releasing so many people, keeping in some. Naturally, we come to the conclusion that you are trying to victimize them; some of these people are contracting the Corona virus. . , . , .

. . 698 , 6999 CID . case , kidnappers .. . . .. , . Black Tigers 011 Kelanitissa Power Station block lead . , . Shani refused to turn a blind eye when politicians, police officers and military personnel were involved in such cases. They were just individuals, whatever field they may have been in. We are just individuals, whatever the field we are in. There is no clean field. , 005 . , 005 . . . . . .

Twice during his Presidency - I am referring to the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa - when a close friend

of his was murdered, the murder of Presidential Adviser Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra, in 2011 and when businessman Mohamed Shiyam was murdered in 2013, the then IGP N.K. Illangakoon assigned the investigations to Shani. He received special promotions, recognition from courts and so forth at that time.

Then, we had a situation where the position of the Director, CID was vacant and the name of SSP Mevan Silva was proposed. I do not know, maybe, it was with the tacit agreement of the former President or the former Prime Minister that those names were proposed. But, the Constitutional Council appointed Shani Abeysekara even though the political authority did not necessarily propose those names.

Then, we had a situation in September, 2017 where the investigations started on the Bond Scam. Shani Abeysekara stunned the entire country by arranging the pre-dawn arrest of Arjuna Aloysius and Kasun Palisena of Perpetual Treasuries Limited on a Sunday, on the Independence Day. I do not think the then President, the Prime Minister, the then IGP or even his DIG knew about it. He did not care whether these politicians were angered or not; the people who were suspected of the Bond transaction were arrested.

The reason for me to speak on these things is purely as matter of justice. I do not have any relationship with any of these individuals and that is why I am making this case, that we must stand up for justice. We must stand up when we are not threatened because otherwise, one day, this situation can actually change.

I can go on citing incidents like these, but since time is running out, I would like to conclude with this. There were some references to Constitution making today saying that the Government has appointed an expert committee to go into that and so on and so forth. The principle of Constitution making is that Constitutions are made by people and not by lawyers. I want to repeat that, Constitutions are made by people and not by lawyers. That is the principle, whether it be the Soulbury Constitution or the Constitution-making process in 1972 in the Constituent Assembly led by Dr. Colvin R. de Silva at the Navarangahala under Prime Minister (Mrs.) Sirimavo Dias Bandaranaike. The Hon. Members had differences of opinion; some of them walked out. But, there were processes -

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please conclude. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I will conclude Sir.

I am saying again that Constitutions must be made by people. Lawyers will take up the principles and draft the principles.

Thank you again for the time you gave me, Sir.
