Now, I would like to quote from an article in The Morning newspaper of today titled "Election monitoring groups raise concerns on election expenditure law", which also points out the importance of this Bill. It states, I quote:

"A proposed law titled Regulation of Election Expenditure Bill has been listed for its Second Reading in Parliament. Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL), Peoples Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL), the Centre for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV), and Institute for Democratic Reforms and Electoral Studies (IRES) have for several years been campaigning for the enactment of a strong law to regulate the role of money in election campaigns."

To submit your amendments by 12 noon today. The Hon. Speaker was chairing the Meeting. Have you all given your amendments?

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) Why did you not check with the office? ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) No, I am asking you. If you have submitted your amendments, you can say, "Yes, we have".

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Check with the office.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You had better explain to the House what are the amendments you all have given.

Hon. (Prof.) G. L. Peiris, you represented Sri Lanka at the UNHRC. Every time when Tamil mothers and the Tamil diaspora accused you, you said, Sri Lanka was and will be a democratic country. Then, why, at this lowest level election, have you come to decide that my motherland is no more a democratic State? And, I think you have no right to declare that. It only shows the narrow ideas of power politics in this country.

I am not going to contest any election.

8 . . . ? Every election has to be free and fair. If you have elections which are not free and fair, those elections are frauds, those elections are just an eyewash and a whitewash for the community to see. Do we have a fair society? Do we have a free society? The answer is, no. Right now, our focus has to be on existential, economic and socio-political issues. Once we settle the issues with regard to the right to breathe, the right to live, the right to travel and the right to mobilize, then let us have an election. . . . . 540 000 57 . . . . . ? . . .

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan) Okay. Thank you, Sir. .

From 1931, we have had an election tradition. Sri Lanka proudly claims that it is one of the first countries in the entire Asia to adopt the universal franchise and that is the tradition we must continue. We must protect and promote that tradition, but not at the cost of power

politics. The same people who, until six months ago, defended this Government, who were on this side attacking the Opposition, are today saying that this country is no more a democracy. What kind of an accusation, a diabolical claim is that? Therefore, we have to move beyond our narrow political gains.

Sir, let me come back to the subject under discussion or to the Debate.

free and fair elections are fundamental to any democracy. Therefore, ask yourself honestly, do we have that freedom of voting? Can people go the polling station freely, take out their pen or pencil and mark their choice? If you do not have that freedom, the result also would be flawed, fragile and broken. We cannot allow our democracy to be controlled by those situational conditions. In the evening, I will vote for this Bill with my conscience because we need to safeguard democracy; we need to safeguard the remaining fragile democracy of this country.

( ) (An Hon. Member) There is no democracy at all.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan) That is your declaration, Hon. Member. Somebody can declare it, but that does make it the truth.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) How can he be in Parliament if there is no democracy?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan) That is right.

I thank the Hon. Minister (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe for being brave to bring in this Bill. It is amidst a lot of challenges, a lot accusations and bogus claims, Hon. Minister, that you brought this Bill before Parliament.

Finally, I want to say one thing. Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, I am not a law student of yours, but while working with you, you taught me one golden lesson: the goodness of anything cannot be sacrificed at the bestness of the same thing.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed - Minister of Environment) Hon. Presiding Member, first of all, let me thank the Hon. Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms for bringing in this Bill, which is long overdue; this should have been brought in much before.

Bill pass , . This Bill has to be passed and after becoming an Act, it must be implemented at any

future election because everyone in this country knows how corrupt our election system is, how contestants used to buy votes with money, how they have been manipulating the entire system and even after winning an election, in order to form the administration, how MPs, members of Pradeshiya Sabhas or members of provincial councils had been bought over, using this corrupt system. Therefore, it is very essential that this Bill is passed today and the Act must be implemented at any future election. If possible, if we are going to close nominations for the Local Authorities Election on Saturday, look at the option of implementing this law after the Bill is passed even for that election.

Of course, everyone knows that Sri Lanka's democracy dates back a long time. In 1931, we got the universal franchise as the first Asian country to do so. We led in implementing democracy, but have been far behind in implementing the right laws and regulations. That is a fact.

Look at some of the sound democracies in the world. Singapore first introduced their election campaign financing laws as far back as the year 2000 through the Political Donations Act. In the United States, the basic legislative Act which regulates federal election campaign finances is the Law on Federal Election Campaigns introduced in 1972. The United Kingdom introduced, in the year 2000, the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act which requires all political parties to set down their accounting requirements and controls on donations. In Norway, the Political Parties Act of 2005 is the main law regulating the financing of political parties. In France, the Law on Financial Transparency in Political Life introduced in 1988 is the main law regulating the financing of political parties. Similarly, many other countries have strong campaign finance laws and regulations governing the funding of political parties, candidates and their campaigns. Therefore, this Bill is essential.

I want to ask from every Hon. Member in this House, please tell me, with these 8,000 members of the local authorities, are we going to form a single stable administration? We could not form such an administration in 2018 and so many local authorities had failed in performing their duties. ,

. Therefore, the number of local authority members has to be reduced from 8,000 to 4,000 plus. It has to be reduced. Therefore, I will make this request to all the Members. date fix , , .

I will tell you what will happen if this election is held under the current system. Suppose, after the election, a clear mandate is not given for any political party, there is going to be a kind of horse-trading administration formed. With that, what is the message we are going to send out to

the world? The country is not stable. If the country is not stable, tourism is going to get affected, the remittances by migrant workers are going to get affected and what the Hon. President has so far been trying to do to bring this country to a higher level is going to go to waste. So, knowing this, are we still going to put our people, the entire nation, further into disarray? Then, the entire country is going to suffer. If you want an election at all, I suggest that you go for a Parliamentary Election; you go for a Presidential Election. If you are confident, you go for a regime change. But, by conducting this election under this system, definitely, we are going to destroy the countrys entire administration and also bring down the whole economy of this country. Therefore, I appeal to all the Hon. Members, to our Colleagues here, let us take a decision to change this system straightaway, from today onwards. Fix a date, whatever date you all want and within that period, let us change this system, bringing in and implementing this new law and then, go for elections. In the meantime, let us all work honestly and sincerely for the sake of the country.
