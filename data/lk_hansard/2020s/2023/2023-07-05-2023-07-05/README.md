) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) Hon. Member, I wish to make some clarifications. Normally, judgments are delivered in Tamil language in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. There are Civil Appellate High Courts, too, established in those provinces and proceedings in those courts are also conducted in the Tamil language. When they make an appeal, not to the Court of Appeal, but to the Supreme Court, this problem arises. At times, when there are Tamil-speaking judges in the Supreme Court, they constitute Benches accordingly. Otherwise, we will have to get translations. There was a special unit set up some time back in the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court for the purpose of translation of the brief. There has been a shortage of translators during the last few years. Now, we are attending to that matter and are trying to get more translators to accelerate the whole procedure of making appeals to the Supreme Court.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) .

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) Hon. Deputy Speaker, it is not that I am objecting to the Hon. Member's speech, but I would like to draw his attention to one matter. This is a Debate where we are discussing about laws' delays, but it does not mean that we have a right to discuss a particular pending case. If you look at Section 3 of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act, you would see that it categorically states that we are not supposed to discuss any matter pending determination by a court of law because it will prejudice the case. Also Standing Order No. 91 (f) categorically states that we are not supposed to discuss any pending case. So, Hon. Member, it is not that I am objecting to your speech, but if you discuss that matter, it will create unnecessary problems.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne. You have 20 minutes.

[2.17 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I want to thank the Hon. Sagara Kariyawasam for bringing in this Adjournment Motion because, in my opinion, the biggest problem facing the country is actually this problem in the judicial system. I think even the economy can be fixed, if we fix the judicial system.

The laws' delays are a huge problem. As we all know, justice delayed is justice denied. It is due to the inefficiency of the administration. I am not saying that administrative inefficiency is there only in the judicial system, but it is there across the country with the judicial system included and costs the public both financially, in terms of time, and emotionally. For instance, the case of a young girl who has been sexually abused is heard when she is a grown-up, married or maybe, after having children and you can imagine the emotional cost to that young mother. So, it is not the economy that we need to fix, but the judicial system of this country. I challenge anyone to take an opinion poll on some of the arguments that are coming up in the House today. It is not a criticism of individuals, but a criticism of a system which needs to be changed. I speak today from the perspective of the public of this country. We need a change. I am comforted by the fact that there are people in this profession who are equally not satisfied with how the system works and who actually want to see the necessary changes made.

Sir, if I am to start with two stories, I was visiting Sri Gnanawimala Buddhist Centre in Moratuwa. Ven. Udugama Wimalakiththi Thero is the Chief Incumbent or the chief priest of that temple. He said to me, I went to court over a case. The case had been postponed for eight years. Finally, it was heard. On the final day, when I went to give evidence, I noticed that 30 cases had been listed for that day. Twenty seven were taken up in the first 30 to 40 minutes just for

1645 1646

[ ... ]

2023 05

postponement. Ultimately, only three cases were heard, one of which was my case. He further said, Each time it was postponed, I paid Rs. 50,000 to the attorneys and it went on and on. I was wondering, why did they postpone 27 cases? Could they not have told those people, because I received justice after 10 years, 'Come after ten years from now. Then, the case will be heard and you will have to pay Rs. 50,000 only once.' " So, that is the view of the public.

Another story I recollect is, when former President Maithreepala Sirisena was in office, he summoned everybody in the judicial system to talk about laws' delays. He called me also and I asked him, Why am I being called?. He said, You are the Acting Minister of Finance. Could you please attend this meeting? I went for the meeting and all the problems were presented there. Then, President Sirisena asked me, What can you do about this? I said to him, We can provide resources for increasing the Bench, we can provide resources for upgrading the Attorney-Generals Department and we can provide resources for training and human resource. The others might disagree with me, but I must say this. For one thing, we are a poor country with limited resources and when we put our resources to use, we need to be clear where we are going to put our resources to use, and we should invest in human resources. I further said, "But, I would not invest in infrastructure because I have to make decisions and choices".

Sir, I remember, as a young boy, going to a government school in Colombo and my mother told me one day, "You are not going to go to school at seven in the morning, but one in the afternoon". And, for a year, I actually went to school in the afternoon. I asked my mother, why. She said, "It is a government school and there are not enough classrooms. Therefore, you have to go to school in the afternoon".

Our physical infrastructure is used only for half of the day. We have to think out of the box. Both the Minister of Justice and the former Minister of Justice are here. There are limitations in terms of resources. Therefore, we have to think out of the box, if we are going to resolve this issue. A day is a day in terms of time, but for a court, it could be more than a day's work and I am just putting that as a case. So, if we are going to really resolve this issue in favour of the people of this country, we have to think outside the system. The number of pending cases in 2019 was 763,000 and in 2021, nearly 1.1 million, an increase of 43.6 per cent from 2019 to 2021. I know there was COVID-19, other disruptions and all that and that is why there was this excess. But the fact is, it is a huge excess and it is the information of the statistics unit of the Ministry of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms that I am providing here.

While all that is true, when it comes to speeding up a case, everybody is on it. We had a situation where there was a case of a prospective candidate for the post of IGP in the country. That case was taken up, speeded up, concluded and the judgment was given just a few days ago. But, yesterday - it was very unusual - after the judgment had been given on that case, the attorneys brought in a motion to court requesting that a part of the petition they had filed, particularly the reference to the

present President of the country, be withdrawn from the judgment. It really calls into question the system. This is unprecedented. Professors of law could comment on this more than I could, but it is unprecedented for the petition of a concluded case to be amended. So, you have to ask yourself the questions, "What is the integrity of the system? What is the integrity of the attorneys appearing for the case and the integrity of the judges to even entertain such a thing?" Is there not more to this politically?

Sir, when we talk about laws' delays, often it is said that in every country, there are laws' delays. But, we should not be using that for an excuse. There are many reasons for such delays. Today, we heard about inadequacy of courts and judges, lack of training, all kinds of other deliberate delays, sometimes, on the part of the law enforcement officials, judicial medical officers, forensic experts and analysts, archaic legal procedures and many other issues. As the former Minister of Justice said, we increased the Bench with the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution. But, in terms of speeding up of cases, there is no visible improvement. Particularly on commercial cases, we are wondering why Sri Lanka has made no investments. It is part of the problem in the judicial system.

Sir, in the Ease of Doing Business Index, Sri Lanka is placed at the 99th position, but in enforcement of contracts, we are placed at the 164th position. Who is going to come here and invest? We set up the Commercial High Court at the beginning, but it has not given the desired results. This was referred to earlier in the keynote address by Supreme Court Justice Priyantha Jayawardena, President's Counsel, at the National Law Conference in June, 2023. Since I do not have much time, with the permission of the Chair, I would like to table* his keynote address only for the reason that there are many recommendations in it on laws' delays and how to actually handle those.

But, if I were to just quote from his keynote address, he says, I quote:

"In my view, the answer is that it is difficult to do business in Sri Lanka. There is no investor-friendly environment, predictability and security for investments."

"Widespread bribery and corruption are deterrents to getting the business community to invest in Sri Lanka."

"The Commercial High Court was considered a success initially due to the appointment of judges with a firm grasp of commercial matters."

"If one thinks that the judges can learn commercial law and civil law while serving on the Bench it is a big mistake. I believe that the appointment of judges to the Commercial High Court who are not conversant in commercial law has contributed to the present predicament."

1647 1648

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

These are not my views; these are the views of a Supreme Court Judge. He further says, I quote:

"I wish to now focus on how we have addressed the piling up of cases in the Commercial High Court. At the time of establishing the Commercial High Court, the jurisdiction of the Commercial High Court was to hear matters arising from commercial contracts, where the value was more than Rupees 3 million."

Subsequently, it was increased to Rs. 5 million, then to Rs. 50 million and so forth. He also goes on to say, I quote:

"In my opinion the remedy is to adopt the old practice of appointing learned judges who are conversant in commercial law and to train them to hear commercial cases."

So, there are lots of proposals in it. That is why I tabled it because there is not much time to go into it.

Sir, in addition to those, we have fundamental rights cases. With regard to fundamental rights cases, Article 126 of the Constitution has actually put a time limitation on the Supreme Court. I am going to quote an extract of it - Article 126(3) - very quickly.

Where in the course of hearing in the Court of Appeal into an application for orders in the nature of a writ of habeas corpus, certiorari, prohibition, procedendo, mandamus or quo warranto, it appears to such Court that there is prima facie evidence of an infringement or imminent infringement of the provisions of Chapter III or Chapter IV by a party to such application, such Court shall forthwith refer such matter for determination by the Supreme Court.

Then, Article 126(5) - this is what is important - goes on to state, I quote:

The Supreme Court shall hear and finally dispose of any petition or reference under this Article within two months of the filing of such petition or the making of such reference.

So, this is what the Constitution of the country actually states in that regard. We say that we are governed by the Constitution of the country, but the Supreme Court hides behind this and says that this is only directory and not mandatory. I think we need to look at it. There is what is called the law and also the spirit of the law. The Constitution makers put the words "two months" - I do not literally mean two months - but the spirit of the law needs to be understood because they wanted a limitation, a limitation on these cases being heard.

Sir, we have unprecedented situations. We are Members of Parliament sitting here and people are questioning whether we are citizens of this country. It is unheard of in any other parliament in the world! We have Members who have crossed over, processes into such matters going on and expellings from parties. Under this provision, such matters need to be determined quickly. Sir, as I said, my argument today is not about individuals, but about the processes. It is fair by those Members of Parliament, if they have not committed an offence, that they are set free immediately. But, if they have committed an offence, then, they must be punished and they must be punished very quickly; we must not delay it.

So, this impinges on the franchise of the people and this - this violation - is one way in which the sovereignty that we have been granted under Articles 3 and 4 of the Constitution is impinged on.

Then, if take the validity of the expulsion of an MP, it is unbelievable. I would like to quote Article 99 (13) (a) as well and actually there are two places in which such expulsion is referred to.

Where a Member of Parliament ceases, by resignation, expulsion or otherwise, to be a member of a recognized political party or independent group on whose nomination paper (hereinafter referred to as the 'relevant nomination paper') his name appeared at the time of his becoming such Member of Parliament, his seat shall become vacant upon the expiration of a period of one month from the date of his ceasing to be such member:

Provided that in the case of the expulsion of a Member of Parliament his seat shall not become vacant if prior to the expiration of the said period of one month he applies to the Supreme Court by petition in writing, and the Supreme Court upon such application determines that such expulsion was invalid.

We all agree up to that point, about the one month period and going to the Supreme Court, but it continues further, I quote:

Such petition shall be inquired into by three Judges of the Supreme Court who shall make their determination within two months of the filing of such petition. Where the Supreme Court determines that the expulsion was valid the vacancy shall occur from the date of such determination.

So, two-month are stipulated for that by the Constitution of the country, but none of that is actually being followed; neither the letter of the law nor the spirit of the law is being followed. What is the example we are actually setting? So, there are all these issues.

Today, there is general agreement that the exercise of the civil appellate jurisdiction by the High Court has not produced the desired results, considering the large number of cases before the Supreme Court, taking up the much valuable judicial time of the apex court in the country. So, I would ask the Hon. Minister to consider the Courts of Appeal sitting in the provinces taking up civil appeals as well as fundamental rights applications. I am saying that we have to think out of the box, consider these things, if we really want to see changes.

We also see an increase in Bills, almost all the Bills, being challenged by various parties in court. Today, I heard from the Hon. Ministers that they want to bring in more new laws. All those are going to be challenged and therefore, more time of the apex court is going to be spent focusing on them. As a result, other peoples cases are going to get pushed back. That adds up to the delay in disposing of other cases before the Court. Therefore, I would propose something to consider: as a solution, consider setting up a Constitutional Court as has been done in many other countries. In the Constitutional Court, you can have the career judiciary, the private and official bar as well as the legal academia. I am saying, look for out-of-the-box solutions to really solve this issue and we also can restrict the people serving on that court, maybe, to one term so that we can ensure the independence of it.

Then, I want to move on to the issue of judges and their promotions. I say this very sensitively. I do not know of any profession that does not look at performance and seniority in giving promotions. Performance and seniority, both, are important and certainly for the judicial profession, it is needed. But, the performance indicator should be, as the Minister referred to, the volume of judgments. No judge, who has a large number of judgments pending, should be promoted. Seniority, yes, I stand by that, but, surely, if he is having a large number of judgments pending, then, how can we promote him? We all are professionals. The criteria relating to professionals - performance and seniority - must be applied, I would say, to the Bar as well. The Bar must actually contribute to accelerating this process. They might feel that if cases are disposed of quickly, their income might go down. It would not go down because, then, people would have more confidence to come to courts.

Sir, todays Daily Mirror reports that the All Island Canteen Owners' Association has asked the restaurant owners to, if a politician or whoever eats in a restaurant and does not pay the bill, assualt him.

What kind of crap is that? Then, they should go to court. Why are people talking like this? That is because they have lost confidence in the judicial system of the country.

In closing, I would like to make this final point on judicial administration. As was mentioned before, on the 06th of May, 1994, the Hon. Srinath Lalaka Kumarasinghe brought in a Private Members' Motion for the establishment of a separate Judicial Administrative Authority.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I am winding up, Sir.

My plea is, do not delay it. The Hon. Kumarasinghe said that, during that time, even the Hon. Lalith Athulath Mudali was backing that idea and also said that there was no decorum in courts. I would like to say that the Hon. N. Srikantha also spoke about this; he talked about corruption within the system. If I were to quote the Hon. C.V. Gooneratne from Hansard of 06th May, 1994, he said,

Mr. Deputy Speaker, I am happy to endorse the views of the proposal of this Motion regarding the establishment of a separate Judicial Administrative Authority .. Sir, the concept of corruption prevailing in the Courts is too well known, but corruption is not confined to the Courts alone.. It is rotten to the very core ..

That was in 1994. What is the difference today? Today, people say that corruption is much worse. Therefore, we need to tackle it.

Sir, I back the Motion brought in by the Hon. Sagara Kariyawasam. I would also say that while the Minister looks at changing these situations, a Select Committee on reducing laws' delays and building confidence of both investors and citizens should be formed.

Thank you very much for the time given, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Next, the Hon. (Dr.) Susil Premajayantha. You have 15 minutes.

Whereupon THE HON. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and THE HON. S.M.M. MUSZHAARAFF took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Ponnambalam, please commence your speech.

[3.18 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, I was originally allotted 12 minutes. It has now been cut down to nine. The lost time is almost a fourth of the time allotted. So, I think that is quite unfair, but anyway, I will try to conclude my remarks within that time frame.

Sir, I completely agree with the Adjournment Motion that has been moved today, which we are debating. The Hon. Member who proposed the Motion, himself being a lawyer, stated very correctly that given the economic situation the country faces and if the country is to come out of it, one of the most important aspects will be to bring in foreign investments. For that purpose, if the Judiciary and the legal structure in the country is not improved, particularly with regard to the matter we are discussing today, with regard to the immense amount of time wasted when a matter goes before courts, I think investors will find other more attractive locations. There is no doubt about it. So, when you are literally scraping the barrel, if you do not, at least, try to get your house in order, then, once again, it will be a case of Sri Lanka missing the bus. So, in that respect, I think this particular Motion is very timely and we, our party, will fully cooperate with whatever steps that the Government chooses to take in that regard.

Sir, I was here for both the proposers speech and the seconders speech, but I do not know whether the Hon. Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms spoke soon after. I missed his remarks. In fact, I wanted to check it. So, I checked the Parliament channel to see whether his speech has been uploaded, but, unfortunately, it is not. So, I do not know what he had said, if he had spoken.

Sir, I wish to bring up one important matter, particularly with regard to the constituency we represent, which is the North and the East. Whilst, generally speaking, the judicial system has to be improved to a point where we cut down on the time we spend in court, when you talk about it in terms of civil matters, which is what the proposer was primarily talking about, it is totally different to when you talk about criminal matters. It is because when it concerns a criminal matter, a persons liberty is at stake. More often than not, on occasions when such people are in remand custody, it takes years and years. So, generally speaking, when it comes to criminal matters where one's liberty is curtailed, there is an added reason to have those matters expedited so that some sort of finale, a closure can be brought to the person concerned.

But, the point that I want to specifically mention about, when it comes to these criminal matters, is with regard to the PTA.

The Tamil Members of Parliament in particular, who represent the North and the East, have consistently been

1665 1666

[ ]

2023 05

talking about this issue. We have had several meetings both with previous Governments and with the present Government and the Ministers concerned. We have gone to the Attorney-Generals Department in our own capacity, spoken to the Hon. Attorney-General himself on several occasions and have been urging that the cases filed under the PTA be brought to a close. We say that for the reason that the moment the Government itself had accepted, not only domestically but internationally, that the PTA is a draconian law, it is an unjust law and must be repealed, then, the fact that those cases are outstanding becomes completely untenable, Sir. The onus is on the Government, therefore, to prove otherwise. I believe the Government has, on several occasions, made commitments with regard to a moratorium on the use of the PTA and of course, that moratorium is being observed in the breach. But still, when the Government, not only this Government, but even the previous Government, has gone to the extent of admitting internationally that the PTA must be repealed and new, more humane laws must, if at all, be brought in, then, it becomes imperative that the Government takes up the question of Tamil political detainees as a political issue. You cannot just leave it to the Attorney-General because, naturally, ideally he is not a political personality and must not decide on policy. Policy is something that this House must decide; it is the Government that must decide on those things. So, when the Government, not only this Government, but even the previous Government, had accepted that the PTA is a draconian law and must be repealed, then, it is our view and we will urge very strongly that all those detainees be released immediately. My figures would suggest that, today, there are 19 individuals who are to be convicted. Also, I think there are around seven convicted individuals, who also have more cases ongoing. So, a total of 19 cases are outstanding. Among the people in remand with their cases ongoing, you have Selverajah Kirupakaran, Thambiah Piragash, Nadesan Kugathasan, Subramaniam Surenthiran, Yogarajah Nirojan, Kanagaratnam Aathithan and Karthigesu Sivaji. The cases of the last three I mentioned, that is Surenthiran, Nirojan, Aathithan, have been due for judgment today. Today is the day for judgment and again, for the third occasion, those have been postponed. Then, Navaratnam, Sanmugalingam Suriyakumar, Sanmugarajan, Selvathurai Kirupaharan, Ramachandran, Valentino and Mathenasegaran are convicted individuals and you have another five people on appeal: Sivakumar, Partheepan, Ananda Suthakaran, Nimalan Thangavel and Umar Kathaas. Sir, see how unreasonable the case of the very first person I mentioned, Selverajah Kirupakaran. His case was carried over for 11 years and at the end of it, the Court found that it was on a forced confession and ruled the confession out; he was acquitted. Then, the AGs Department goes and files two new cases against him on the same confession!

So, when a court has already rejected that confession saying that it is not voluntary, for the Attorney-General's Department to, thereafter, file two new cases based on the same confession is a very unjust step, Sir. It might be completely correct when you look at the law and the rules, but these are just blatantly unfair and unjust actions.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I am winding up, Sir.

So, it is on that basis that I ask the Hon. Minister to look into this. I think the President, when he made a visit to the UK, made various commitments to the Tamil diaspora saying that he will look into this matter and, in fact, release all those political prisoners. Look, now, it has been 15 years since the war ended. Normally, Sir, political prisoners are released when that project, which might have been seen as a crime, comes to an end. When that project does not exist, to carry on by keeping them under custody is completely unfair. I think the Government and the Hon. Minister must intervene in this regard and not try again to release just a few individuals at a time, but must take a policy decision and release all of them.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. Mohan Priyadarshana De Silva. You have seven minutes.
