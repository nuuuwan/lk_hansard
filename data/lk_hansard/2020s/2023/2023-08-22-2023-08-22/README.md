: CONTEMPT OF A COURT, TRIBUNAL OR INSTITUTION BILL:

DETERMINATION OF THE SUPREME COURT ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I wish to announce to Parliament that I have received the Determination of the Supreme Court in respect of the Bill titled Contempt of a Court, Tribunal or Institution, which was challenged in the Supreme Court in terms of Article 121(1) of the Constitution.

The Determination of the Supreme Court as to the constitutionality of the Bill titled Contempt of a Court, Tribunal or Institution is as follows:

(i) Clause 2(e) is inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

(ii) Clause 3(1)(b) is inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

However, the said inconsistency would cease, if the Amendment proposed in the Determination of the Supreme Court is made to the said Clause.

Clause 3(2)(c) is inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

However, the Supreme Court holds that there is no inconsistency of the provisions that are contained in Clauses 3(2)(a) to 3(2)(e) with the Constitution, subject to the Amendment to Clause 3(2)(c) of the Bill, as suggested by the Hon. Attorney- General.

(iii) The Supreme Court is of the view that Clause 4 is inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

However, if the proposed Amendment, as set out in the Determination of the Supreme Court, is made, such inconsistency would cease.

(iv) The provisions of Clause 7(3) are inconsistent with Article 13(2) of the Constitution.

However, the proposed Amendment by the Hon. Attorney-General, as set out in the Determination of the Supreme Court, if inserted to Clause 7(1)(b), the said inconsistency would cease.

The provisions of Clause 7(3) are also inconsistent with Article 13(3) of the Constitution.

(v) Clauses 8(1)(b), 8(1)(c), 9(1)(b) and 9(1)(c) are inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

However, the proposed Amendment by the Hon. Attorney-General, as set out in the Determination of Supreme Court, if inserted, would cease the said inconsistency in those Clauses.

(vi) The Supreme Court holds that Clause 11, as a whole, is inconsistent with the provisions of Article (12(1) of the Constitution and it could be validly passed in Parliament into Law only with a special majority with the number of votes cast in favour thereof amounts to not less than two-thirds of the whole number of Members (including those not present), as prescribed in terms of Article 84(2) of the Constitution.

(vii) The Supreme Court is of the view that Clause 12

(1) is inconsistent with Article 146(2)(iv) of the Constitution.

However, the said inconsistency would cease, if the Amendment indicated in the Determination of the Supreme Court is made to the said Clause.

(viii) Clause 13 will be amended at the Committee

Stage of the Bill, as set out in the Determination of the Supreme Court.

(ix) The Supreme Court is of the view that Clause 16

is inconsistent with Article 12 of the Constitution.

However, the inconsistency would cease, if the Amendment indicated in the Determination of the Supreme Court is made to the said Clause.

I order that the Determination of the Supreme Court be printed in the Official Report of todays Proceedings of the House.

( ) (The Hon. Jeevan Thondaman) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, first, I would like to clarify what happened in Matale. First of all, it is not a worker who was mistreated, but a non-worker. The biggest issue with non-workers in the estate sector is, they are not considered as citizens of this country, but, more or less, as assets and liabilities of the estates. Today, there are about 200,000 people living within the estates, who

are estate workers. Along with them, there are another 800,000 family members who are not given any rights or even recognized.

So, with this being the case, what happened in Matale is this. If the Assistant Manager of that Estate had an issue with the non-worker who had encroached or illegally built that structure, there are legal ways through which that could be addressed. But, while that non-worker had a two-month old infant, the Assistant Manager had gone and said, I will throw you out on to the streets. He has, in fact - [Interruption]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Please let him explain. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Jeevan Thondaman) Excuse me, Hon. Member, I am addressing the Hon. Leader of the Opposition's question. So, can I clarify?

Hon. Leader of the Opposition, following that, what happened was, yes, I went there. I must admit that, though my anger could be justified, I could have gone about it in a better way. Today, there was so much of ruckus over the dignity of one man, of that particular Executive, as opposed to the dignity of my community. And, as far as the dignity of my community is concerned, we have not received any!

The estates were given to those companies on such a weak lease, which granted the companies total authority over the lands and the people there. Today, honestly, I am standing here and speaking out of pure emotion. The only way this could be sorted out is by giving these people the right to ownership of lands, about which we have already informed the Hon. President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Hon. Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena. In fact, it is the Hon. Minister (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana who started this move along with the Hon. Harin Fernando and myself. We will be submitting a Cabinet Paper very shortly to grant these people 10 perches - there are about 200,000 families - because these people are Sri Lankan citizens.

Today, we are politicizing every single issue. Now, there is a drought. We do not have any control over it. There are 13 districts which do not have drinking water, unfortunately and we are trying to address that. In fact, today, we have called for a meeting with the former Minister as well. In the midst of all these issues, we now have this issue, where a non-worker, a human being was subjected to such inhuman treatment. I am sure, all of you have seen that video. With all due respect to my Colleagues who are from the up-country, I would like to say this. I went to the spot and I did not go there as Jeevan Thodaman; I went there on behalf of all of us. I do not want to separate and create division amongst ourselves. All I am suggesting is this. Yes, you are here in black attire, protesting and I understand all that, but I think we should understand that if all of us were to come together, we could find a solution, collectively. The

839 840

2023 22

problem is, we are not looking at this in a positive manner. We are looking at how we can use this community as a vote bank. When the Rs. 1,000 wage became an issue, I am sorry to say this, the Opposition said, We will give Rs. 1,500. I do not want my people treated like slaves! We want to change that model. And, for the tea smallholders, I do not see how that is going to be possible. But, we can go towards a revenue-shared model certified by the ILO. We are working on that. In fact, what needs to be recognized here is that whichever government comes into power, the Opposition accuses them of mistreating these workers. But, the reality is, more than the actions of the government, it is the exploitation of labour that is there and that is what needs to be addressed.

I am sorry if I have offended any of you by speaking in such an aggressive tone, but it is just because of frustration, not frustration of Jeevan Thondaman, but frustration of the community.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) , .

( ) (The Hon. Jeevan Thondaman) Sir, can I just - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Minister? - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Jeevan Thondaman) Hon. Velu Kumar, please calm down!

Sir, I will just clarify something. To be honest, being the minorities we are, how have we been looked at? Though I believe I am a Sri Lankan, what has been meted out to us? You are well aware of the fact that, for 30 years, we went on without citizenship. By everything that had happened, we had been collaterally damaged. That has been the case, not just with this Government, but you know for a fact that it would be difficult to work with any government. That is only because of the fact that we have division amongst ourselves. We are playing politics with people. When that is the case, it is difficult to work with any government. And, you are telling me to join the Opposition and work. With the ruling party, I am genuinely telling you, - [Interruption.] I am asking you to join this side for the people, Hon. Velu Kumar. - [Interruption.] No, I am asking you to join for the people. You are willing to come only if a Ministry is given. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Please, now, let us stop this debate. - [Interruption] ( ) (The Hon. Jeevan Thondaman) I am sorry, Hon. Velu Kumar. Sir, let me explain.

I explained at the beginning that it was an illegal encroachment. You all are talking about it on humanitarian grounds, but I am talking about its legality. So, there is a difference. When someone has illegally encroached a land, they do not have a say over that land. Tomorrow, - [Interruption.] Can I finish, Hon. Member? Anyway, your mike is switched off. So, let me finish.

Firstly, that Assistant Manager had been removed immediately. - [Interruption.] Let me finish! Secondly, I believe the Hon. Minister has also agreed that 11 people over there, who are not workers, to be given land and houses. - [Interruption.] Let me explain! Can I finish? The thing is, you are asking to take legal action on an illegal issue. That is not possible.

Also, I will just explain one thing very clearly to you. You all are again looking as to how to play politics with this issue. But, I am trying to see the source of this issue and the source of this issue is that those people do not have rights over that land!

( ) (An Hon. Member) ! ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you. - [Interruption.] Yes, Hon. Aravindh Kumar?
