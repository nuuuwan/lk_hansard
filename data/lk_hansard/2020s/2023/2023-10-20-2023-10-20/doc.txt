ALLEGATIONS AGAINST CONSTITUTIONAL COUNCIL ON

DELAY IN RECOMMENDING MEMBERS TO COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS OF

BRIBERY OR CORRUPTION ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) On the 03rd of October, 2023, the Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Minister of Justice, Prisons Affairs and Constitutional Reforms and the Hon Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Member of Parliament made statements in the House alleging that the Constitutional Council of Sri Lanka was intentionally delaying its recommendation of persons to be appointed to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption - CIABOC - and that it is inefficient. For these reasons, they stated that the houses of the members of the Council ought to be surrounded by the people. The Hon. (Dr.) Rajapakshe stated that he, too, will join the people when they do so. The call to "surround the houses" of the members of the Council is a reference to the acts of violence conducted by mobs last year, causing death and destruction to houses of Members of Parliament.

The Constitutional Council is a multipartisan constitutional body, of which I am the Chairperson. This House is represented at the highest level in the Council by the Hon. Prime Minister and the Hon. Leader of the Opposition. In 2001, 2015 and in 2022, this Council has been established to ensure independence, integrity and expertise in appointments to independent Commissions and to constitutional high offices, including of the appellate Judiciary. Since it was constituted, the Council had met on 03rd May, 02nd August, 22nd August, 24th August, 05th September, 21st September and 10th October in 2023 and had discussed the CIABOC on seven occasions. On the 01st of February, 2023, the Council called for applications to all Commissions, including to CIABOC. However, since the Constitutional Council was informed that a new Bill titled "Anti-Corruption" had been drafted, would be enacted soon and that there would be new criteria relating to the establishment of the CIABOC, the Council did not take steps to establish the relevant Commission based on the previous law. Since then:

1215 1216

1. The new Anti-Corruption Bill was passed by Parliament and subsequently, certified by the Speaker on the 08th of August, 2023.

2. The Hon. Minister of Justice, by Order published in the Gazette, operationalized the Act on the 15th of September, 2023.

3. Since there were several errors in the Sinhala text of the Act, including in the section regarding the appointment of CIABOC, which were of major concern to the Council, the Council decided to consult the Hon. Attorney-General in that regard.

4. The advice of the Attorney-General was sought on the 17th of August and a reply was received on 22nd September, 2023.

5. The Constitutional Council had discussed at seven meetings matters connected with the establishment of the CIABOC and is striving to adopt best practices and follow an open and a transparent process in that regard.

6. As part of the process involved, the Constitutional Council has taken steps to call for applications from suitable candidates. The advertisement has already been published in the newspapers and the electronic media of the Parliament.

The steps taken by the Council demonstrate that it has been fully cognizant of its obligations under the new Act, but did not proceed due to the serious errors in the new legislation.

The allegations made by the Hon. Minister of Justice and the Hon. Member are, therefore, baseless and disingenuous. As elected Representatives of the people, those two Members, no doubt, understand the gravity of the errors in the Anti-Corruption Act, No. 9 of 2023. The Act declares the Sinhala version as the valid version when there are any inconsistencies between the Sinhala version and the Tamil version. Section 4(1), which deals with the appointment of the CIABOC, refers to the Constitutional Council as " " The Constitutional Council can only act according to the law. The Act provides for penal sanctions for the offences of bribery or corruption. It is, therefore, essential that the applicable law is clear and consistent. Any flaw in the applicable law, however technical, places at risk the enforcement of the entire legal framework anticipated under this new Act. It is imperative, therefore, that the Act be amended as a matter of urgency. Until then, the Council cannot make recommendations for appointments to CIABOC.

Instead of proposing the amendments, the Hon Minister of Justice chose to make baseless allegations in the House against the Constitutional Council, which were forthwith repeated by the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage. Both Members of the House made reference to the political developments in 2022 and to the demands made by the people of Sri Lanka for a "system

change." I would like to remind the Hon. Members that the "system change" they asked for was also for one in which the people expect their Representatives to act honourably, in good faith, with reason and in the best interest of the people. Making baseless allegations against a constitutional body, calling on the people to surround the houses of the members of the Council and most seriously, agreeing to join the people when they surround the houses of the members is unconscionable, unethical and could easily amount to an abuse of your Parliamentary Privileges. Please be warned that this House will not stand such conduct. May I also note that it reflects poorly on a Minister of Justice to attempt to belittle the Constitutional Council for failing to act when the legal issue concerned is a matter for which the Minister of Justice must accept responsibility. Similarly, it reflects poorly on a Member of the Government to berate the Council when the matter concerned is one on which the Government has to take remedial action. Instead of acting responsibly, those two Members of the House resorted to unconscionable conduct, including calling for mob aggression and agreeing to participate in such mob aggression. As the Speaker and the Chairperson of the Constitutional Council, I strongly condemn the statements made by the two Members.

Sir, I want to take this opportunity to vehemently condemn the atrocities committed and the colossal loss of human lives, especially the mayhem and death, caused by indiscriminate attacks, the attacks aimed at children, women, mothers and civilians. We condemn, without reservation, these attacks, which are crude and blatant violations of human rights. We urge all parties to this conflict to throw away arms and turn swords into ploughshares. I would tell them, get rid of arms, come to the negotiating table, talk about peace, talk about how these two nation-states can coexist side by side, talk on the manner in which you all can coexist and cohabitate, enhance the principles of brotherhood, justice and fairness and respect each others religions, cultures and religious institutions.

The world has failed in providing a progressive and constructive solution to this grave crisis. The 1948 War, the Suez Crisis in 1956, the Six-Day War, the Yom Kippur War and the ensuing conflicts during the latter part of the decade of 1970 and thereon have promoted violence, mayhem, caused an immense amount of physical damage to the humans and caused death. Unfortunately, the Middle East problem is persisting, continuing because of the power struggles that exist among the international community. We urge the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council - the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Russia and France - to go beyond the various ideological conflicts, disagreements and mismatches they may have and think of the mothers, the children and the civilian population who are grievously impacted on by this unnecessary conflict. I tell them, we need leadership and it is useless calling yourselves superpowers. It is time for the superpowers to act in the name of humanity. We need human qualities; we need humanitarianism and we need justice for the Palestinians. We stand for a Palestinian State. The two-State solution is the only formula, persistently reaffirmed through UN Resolutions 242 and 338, the Oslo Accords, the Abraham Accords and so many other agreements. Why can the protagonists and the world leaders, who have the power, not promote peace at the expense of conflict? Look at the humongous amounts of monies that are spent on armaments, on weapons. There is so much of monies wasted in the Ukraine-Russia War and so much of monies wasted on armaments in the Israel-Palestine conflict.

How about ensuring peace, tranquility and peaceful coexistence amongst the nation-states of the world and transfering those funds spent on weapons, which are

results of various military, industrial complexes that exist throughout the world, to support the livability of people, for health, education, youth empowerment, wealth generation and to promote growth for all? I think it is high time that we moved away from prioritizing military and security-oriented policies and thought about prioritizing human beings.

We have to walk the talk.

Sir, I once again urge everyone in the international community and also the Sri Lankan Government to take all the steps necessary to make sure that this very dangerous conflict which may flare up even into a world war, we do not know, is resolved. I certainly hope that that would not take place, but this conflictual situation has to be controlled, managed. And, we have to take all measures to ensure that there is a peaceful, specific resolution to this grave conflict, which is certainly a threat to international peace and security.

( ) ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Suren Raghavan - State Minister of Higher Education) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker and Minister Prasanna Ranatunga for reminding us that time management is very important because there are others who want to have democracy outside Sri Lanka, at international level, but who do not respect democracy in this House itself. That has been a major issue.

1257 1258

2023 20

Sir, I stand before you today to address the House on an issue which has plunged the world into uncertainty and disturbed, if not destroyed the soul and the political conscience of the international community, as we speak today. It is not merely a war between two countries, not a war between different cultures and in fact, not a clash of a civilization - we, at the 21st Century, are trying to design and redirect the human, political endeavour for our future - but a complex and a deep-rooted dispute which has caused immense suffering to both the Israelis and the people of the State of Palestine.

Sir, we might not have all the answers for this complex issue. But, some of the speakers here spoke as if they had complete, absolute answers for it. I feel sorry for them. I, as a student of political science, particularly in peacebuilding and conflict resolution, was seated here listening to their speeches and understood how shallow their ideas, experiences and knowledge were about peacebuilding in the Middle-East region.

Sir, the Palestinian community and the State must be recognized. Without any delay, without any difference and without any deviation, the State of Palestine must be created and the international community must, without condition, accept that.

Having said that, Sir, I must also reiterate that terrorism in any form, whether it comes from Gaza, whether it comes from Tel Aviv, whether it comes from New York, whether it comes from Beijing or from any other place, we cannot accept. We have suffered as a State which had been battled against, which had been put down to its knees because of terrorism. Therefore, I would say, whether it is State terrorism, whether it is non-State terrorism, whether it is Israeli terrorism, whether it is Palestinian terrorism, whether it is American terrorism, whether it is Russian terrorism or whether it is Left Bank or right bank terrorism, terrorism is terrorism. We must not allow terrorism to take root in this country or elsewhere as an answer to our political differences.

Sir, it must be very clear what we are talking and debating here. We must have a shared goal for peaceful resolution of this conflict in the Middle East. This requires commitment to diplomacy and dialogue and the pursuit of an all-accepted, two-State solution, a solution which recognizes the rights of the Israelis as well as the Palestinians. Without understanding that fundamental condition, we will not have peace, not only in the Middle East, but we will not be able to usher in peace in the international order as well. Therefore, as the UN is the only available body for maintaining international peace, we need to rally around its resolutions to bring peace in the Middle East.

In achieving that, Sri Lanka must support democracy and encourage and support international diplomatic efforts involving all stakeholders, particularly the people of Israel and Palestine. The people of Israel and Palestine must talk to each other. This is a problem which needs a people-to-people dialogue, a culture-to-culture engagement. Just because I am a Tamil, I take up my position; another one, because he or she is an Israeli fan, takes up his or her position and some other person,

because he is a person of Islamic-faith, takes up another position. That would not be a good way forward for the democracy we are hoping to achieve.

We have to address the core issues, recognize the importance of dialogue to address border issues, cross-border terrorism, the issue of Jerusalem, the issue of refugees, the security of the unarmed, innocent people of both sides and ask for fair delivery of justice. Even humanitarian assistance has become a major concern today. The lives of almost four million people, including children and women, are at stake there. Therefore, we Sri Lankans, as a State which believes in democracy and upholds Buddhist values, call upon the international community to provide humanitarian assistance to those people. Also, the silent majority of the West must speak now. Particularly, the Norwegian and the Scandinavian countries, who are good at peace negotiating, must get themselves involved in this because their hands are relatively clean.

Let me emphasize, Sir, that our stand on this matter should only be characterized by compassion, wisdom and commitment to peace and nothing else, not personal gains or promoting my own religious idea or cultural idea. Commitment to world peace, commitment to democracy are what we are look at here. We have a responsibility to the future generation by stopping this war here, contributing to the resolution of this conflict, helping to mend the wounds, healing the political and spiritual wounds of this conflict and ushering in a better, fair and a just solution for this conflict in the Middle East.

In advocating a peaceful solution to this Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we are not taking sides. But, in this House, I saw, from morning, Hon. Members taking sides because they are comfortable being on one side. That is not democracy, Sir.

There are learned Members in the Opposition. I asked about this conflict from one of my most respected Muslim brethren yesterday at the Members' Dining and he said, Hamas had no solution; Hamas had no option; Hamas had to attack. I would like to ask him, in that case, is all what the LTTE did right and was the Kattankudi attack right? Will you justify that? No, Sir, we cannot allow terrorism! Whether it is Tamil terrorism, whether it is Islamic terrorism, whether it is Israeli terrorism and whether it is American terrorism, we must speak against that, if we believe in democracy.

In conclusion, I would like to say again that in advocating a peaceful solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict, we are not taking sides, but are talking about international order, justice and fundamental and human rights of those people. It is our collective duty to support that cause and I stand with our President, the Government of Sri Lanka and my people in achieving that kind of a solution. We need to make compromises, we need to make comparisons and come together in finding a solution so that the people of Moses, the people of Abraham, the people of Jerusalem will, together, usher in a world order where our future generations could live in peace.

I thank you, Sir.

Israel ordered the besieged population in the northern half of the Gaza Strip to evacuate to the south, warning that it would soon intensify its attack on the Strips upper half. The order has left more than a million people, half of whom are children, frantically attempting to flee amid continuing airstrikes, in a walled enclave where no destination is safe.

There, he says no destination is safe. :

Indeed, Israels genocidal assault on Gaza is quite explicit, open, and unashamed.

"Israels goal is to destroy the Palestinians of Gaza. And those of us watching around the world are derelict in our responsibility to prevent them from doing so.

What is happening now in Gaza is an attempt to force civilian residents to take refuge and migrate to Egypt, which should not be accepted.

Egypt rejects any attempt to resolve the Palestinian issue by military means or through the forced displacement of Palestinians from their land, which would come at the expense of the countries of the region.

"Arab News" :

"He warned that such a move would turn the peninsula into a base to stage attacks on Israel."

[12.24 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Deputy Speaker, thank you for the time allotted to speak on this very important issue that is shocking the conscience of the world. Let me, at the outset, express my solidarity with the people who are suffering as a result of violence, destruction and wanton killing that is taking place even as we debate this.

We have seen footages and are hearing news of that humanitarian crisis of enormous proportion and therefore, even as a small country in the world, we cannot remain mute; we have to necessarily raise our voice on behalf of the suffering people. The political conflict between Palestine and Israel is a complicated one, we all know that. I am not going to discuss the rights and wrongs, the claims and counterclaims of both sides to that political conflict. This is not the time to discuss that. Now is the time to condemn the violence and to appeal to all sides that are indulging in violence and prosecuting a war to immediately bring a halt to that and end the human suffering.

Sir, I speak today also as a Representative of the people who have suffered as a result of protracted violence. When people suffer through violence, it is almost immaterial as to who is responsible for that. Well, it is important to identify the perpetrators, but the point I am making is, it is important, it is urgent to, first, bring that suffering to an end, to bring that fighting to an end and call for a ceasefire. I am saying that due to this reason. How can we, living, as we claim, in a civilized world, look upon and wait when people, when nations seek to settle their differences through violence? That may have happened centuries ago, but, in todays world, does that even have a place? Is it not possible to resolve it, however complex the issue is, by means of dialogue, through intermediaries, mediations and without resorting to violence and killing each other? The answer seems obvious, but what we see in the world is not so obvious. Constantly, there are fightings going on. In many places in the world, that is happening, in Ukraine and now, in the Middle East.

I cannot but say at this moment how strikingly similar the events that are unfolding now in the Middle East to what we experienced here for three decades more than 15 years ago. I heard former President Maithreepala Sirisena, who spoke before me, condemn the attack on a hospital in Palestine a few days ago. Well, I, too, condemned it, irrespective of who was responsible for that. But, there was a very important thing that happened even as that hospital was attacked: the official Israeli response was that that hospital was being used as a human shield and terrorists were firing from there. Now, different versions are emerging regarding that incident - perhaps, the bombing was not done by Israel, we do not know - but that is immaterial.

The point I am making is, when such a casualty happened, the Israeli State machinery was ever ready to

say that that happened because the hospital was being used as a human shield. And, we cannot escape but remember what happened with regard to the Puthukkudiyiruppu Hospital. That is what the State here also said. I find it unacceptable that President Sirisena condemned the attack on a hospital in Palestine a few days ago in the Middle East, but I never heard him condemn the attack on the Puthukudiyiruppu Hospital. He, perhaps, was the acting Minister of Defence at that time.

So, we can see the height of hypocrisy even in this Debate in this House. I will itemize those. Some Members are speaking for a two-State solution in the Middle East, but here, that is anathema to them. They are also appealing to the UN. I heard that speaker after speaker today referred to UN Resolutions, but when it comes to our country, they say, No, the UN has no role to play. You stay away. State terrorism is being condemned in this House and I also join my voice along with them saying, yes, that is State terrorism, but what happened here, too, was State terrorism. So, that is the hypocrisy.

Violence on people, on civilians by whoever, be it the Hamas, be it the State of Israel or anyone, must be condemned and I condemn it outright. There is no right, even if you be the nation state established and recognized, to impose air strikes and to carry out mass killing of civilians; no one gives you that right. Merely because you have the ammunition for it, merely because you are the State and you can procure arms and merely because other nation states protect you, no country, even a non-State actor, - you may not be a State; you may be an organization - or absolutely no one has the right to take away lives like that. This is where that hypocrisy is exposed. You cannot condemn what happens thousands of miles away in the Middle East while condoning the same in your own country. How can you do that? You do not just condone it, but you glorify it, you celebrate it, you exult over it! So, you would not be taken seriously; this is double-tounged.

Sir, the suffering of the people must end. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a political conflict. Therefore, it must be politically settled; so are many conflicts in the world. Those are political conflicts, political differences between peoples and nations. So, those differences must be resolved politically; so is the conflict in Sri Lanka. It is also a political conflict. I heard former President Mahinda Rajapaksa the other day say that a political conflict does not have a military solution. He is saying that now in respect of Palestine and Israel, but he was the President who prosecuted a military solution to a political conflict in our country. I am not blaming only the State for this.

So, I am saying very clearly that violence and destruction has no place in the civilized world and it must be outrightly condemned; by whoever it is prosecuted, that must be condemned. Today, we stand in solidarity with the people who suffer. They might be on one side of the divide or the other. Children being maimed, the ordinary people being put to the sword and all that is just not acceptable. Let us raise our voice on behalf of the

1271 1272

people who are suffering as a result of violence, violence perpetrated, maybe, by Hamas or even the State of Israel. Whoever it is, I raise my voice on behalf of the people who suffer violence to a proportion that is unimaginable. Let there be peace in the Middle East and, indeed, in the whole world.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) 14

( ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Diana Gamage - State Minister of Tourism) Hon. Presiding Member, I thank you for the time provided to speak today on the situation in Israel and Palestine.

Representing a country which had suffered a terrorist war for three decades, I would like to say that terrorism, under any condition, is unacceptable and should never be accepted. Whether it happens in the North, the West, the South, the East or anywhere in the world, terrorism is something that cannot be accepted under any circumstances. What the Hamas has done, their actions, must, no doubt, be condemned. Inhuman acts of terrorism have been committed, causing loss of innocent lives and those people have been swept back into a conflict spanning over decades. The response from Israel has been swift and the incoming reports and images of the large-scale collateral damage are deeply disturbing. Similarly, in Palestine, the innocent young lives are being swept into a conflict they have not asked for. Therefore, the need for a ceasefire is paramount for the survival of those innocent lives. Space for refuge for civilians must also be respected and I implore the region to make efforts on finding a peaceful resolution for that. The eyes of the global community gaze at all this with deepest sorrow and the need for a solution for this conflict has never been greater.

Sir, what is happening today in Palestine? We can see that what is happening in the Gaza Strip is genocide; the whole world is seeing it. That is also terrorism, which is totally unacceptable. So, I urge the UN and the international community that we all get together, bring about a ceasefire and give those innocent lives the chance to live because what is happening there today is unbearable. We, as women, are watching what is happening to the women and young children living in those countries, which is unacceptable.

In waging wars, obviously, there are international rules and regulations to follow and I urge that we all stick to them. Sri Lanka, having faced a 30-year terrorist war, to date has been accused of war crimes in Geneva. Looking at the situation in Israel and Palestine right now, there is a question about what is going on there. So, I think it is high time that everyone of us in every country in the world hold hands and get together for the sake of those innocent young lives because they have not asked for that conflict; none of them have asked for that. Sir, I think it is time that those two States be separated and given their independence to carry on as independent States with peace.

[2.20 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, today, I rise to take part in this Adjournment Debate on a topic that is genuinely heartbreaking. If there is a nation which truly deserves a State of its own, you cannot deny that it is the Jewish nation; as a nation that has faced genocide to an extent that the term became recognized in our legal jurisprudence, it is something that cannot be denied. As a persecuted people, they should, at some point, have a country to call their own, where they can be secure, is undeniable. Such is their history.

Sir, I used the term heartbreaking and that is because, in the process of trying to give the Jewish nation a State of its own where the Jewish people can live peacefully and in security, there also happened a great injustice to the Palestinian nation.

As a result, enmity grew and there was conflict. But then, there was a point where there was a compromise and that compromise is what we all now term the two-State solution. Sir, in that compromise, the Palestinian people had to compromise more is also undeniable, but

1303 1304

that compromise was reached. And after it was reached, that the Jewish nation observed the agreement in the breach is what is even more frustrating. Once a people who have faced the worst of crimes and who have been so terribly persecuted in their entire history have a State of their own, for that State to behave in the way it has been behaving is, honestly, so disappointing and so frustrating. So, as far as our party is concerned, we believe that we must be honest enough to call what is wrong, wrong and it has gone well beyond that.

What is happening today, Sir, in the name of fighting terrorism is genocide. There is no other word you can use to describe what is happening there today. When people are put in a war situation and when they are, then, deprived of food, medicine and water, there can be only one intention, to destroy that population in whole or in part. That is what is happening. Deliberately targeting the most vulnerable places where the sick and the young will seek refuge, the hospitals, you cannot have any other intention. Asking people to go to a particular area to seek safe refuge and then bombing that vicinity cannot surely be fighting terrorism.

So, Sir, unless we understand that there are root causes to this conflict and for as long as we do not find solutions to those root causes, there will be actions taken by the aggrieved party to, in some way, pressure those who are causing the problem to correct it and that is human nature.

When you are up against or forced to the wall and you have nowhere to run, but still, the other party keeps coming at you, then there is that saying, Sir, that even a worm turns and that is what is happening today. So, the Tamil National Peoples Front is quite clear that we are committed to a two-State solution and the fault, Sir, is the non-implementation of that two-State solution. Quite the contrary, it is the deliberate dismantling of the future Palestinian State that is causing this conflict and aggravating this situation. So, as long as we deny that and try to blame the reaction to that problem as opposed to the problem itself, we will never find solutions.

Quite honestly, Sir, I am quite surprised, but cynically so, that this House, today, is unanimous in calling for a ceasefire, a cessation of hostilities and is also unanimous in insisting on a negotiated solution for the Israel-Palestine conflict. But, Sir, 15 years ago, when what is happening in Gaza happened in this country, in the North and the East, other than the Tamil parties seated in this House, what Israel is doing today is what all the other Hon. Members did to the Tamils. When there were over 400,000 war-affected civilians and food and medicine was sent only to 70,000, what could the intention be? You declared safe zones and then went on to bomb those zones; you bombed hospitals deliberately. Those same people, 15 years later when they see a conflict happening, recognize the mistakes and the gravity of what is happening faraway and call for a ceasefire, then, that certainly surprises me. But let, at least, the Palestinian people be saved from what is clearly the orchestration of genocide and in that sense, Sir, we would like to sign up.

Sir, the Hon. Member who moved this Adjournment Motion surprises me the most, but what is not surprising is, if you look at that Adjournment Motion, a big part, 90 per cent, of it is self-interest. It is self-interest that is making you call for a cessation of hostilities because of the conditions and the economic conditions that could be caused to this country, not so much because of the mayhem, the loss of lives and the carnage that is happening in Israel and in Gaza. It is accordingly, Sir, we would like to record that the Tamil people, no matter which party they belong to, are consistant that they are not against the State of Israel, quite the contrary; we believe that the Jewish nation requires a State, they must be secure, they must be peaceful and that they have the right to exist. That must be respected as much as we believe that the Sinhala nation in this country must be saved, must prosper and must be at peace, but, Sir, not at the expense of others. You cannot prosper by trampling the rights of others and by doing that, you will never find solutions. So, unless the Hon. Members of this House, at least, look at what is happening in the Middle East, learn lessons from that and apply those same principles here, even in the Middle East, there might be peace, but Sri Lanka, for sure, will never have that.

Thank you, Sir.

[ 239] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law)

Hon. Presiding Member, today, we are having a momentous Debate on the developing situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. We are witnessing a relentless onslaught unleashed by the State of Israel on the Palestinian people under the pretext of self-defense with sustained force, including the attack on a hospital in Gaza, committing untold misery, blatant war crimes and already killing thousands of people.

The trapped 2.1 million people in Gaza have endured relentless bombardment by the Israeli forces and this unrelenting bombings and massacre of innocent Palestinians are raging on. Children just born are also bombed out. Women and old people are killed while being benumbed by the horror of falling white phosphorus bombs. Residential buildings are deliberately flattened; mosques, churches, schools and hospitals are

1307 1308

reduced to rubble and electricity and water supplies have been cut off. The people of Gaza are living and dying in the dark while an indifferent world is content to watch all that in silence.

With the active encouragement of the United States and the studied indifference of western governments neutered by self-interest, Israel is violating all international norms. The horrendous violations of human rights and humanitarian law, war crimes perpetrated by the Israeli Government and the unconscionably abusive Israeli practices against the Palestinian people are continuing with increasing intensity in Gaza, shocking the conscience of the world each passing day. Sadly, some of the western States never cease to encourage the current Israeli Government to go in a direction that only heralds a slow-motion genocide. It is apparently intended to empty the Gaza Strip of Palestinian people and to make room for Israeli annexation of Palestinian territories in the near future.

Even as some of the western States and others stand with the most ruthless and repressive occupier in the Middle East, it is abundantly evident, nevertheless, that the ongoing massive public protests in those countries clearly expose the unpalatable reality of deepening divides between the people and their governments on the issue of support for the racist policies of the current Israeli Government.

It is a conundrum in a world that is becoming increasingly polarized over geostrategic contestations that admittedly shift the centre of global power to Asia. The western States which support the current Israeli Government should help that shift even faster at the risk of domestic instability and loss of international credibility. Already, the economic costs of their support for ongoing Israeli military actions in Gaza are visible with an energy crisis looming large on the horizon. I refer to Chinese diplomacy in the Middle East in the recent past. They made a historic attempt to bring the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Iran together and have persuaded them to open diplomatic relations. That is a big milestone in Middle Eastern history. That is why I say that the shift of the centre of global power towards Asia, its good intentions and the shifting of the global power equation may change in the coming days.

Why did the Hamas do this horrendous act on the 07th of October, 2023? We acknowledge that quite apart from the ultra-rightist extremists, Israel is also home to many right-thinking, decent people and an unbelievable number of intellectually forthright writers, politicians and activists. They too ask the same question. These learned Jews, too, agree that the two million people who have been living for more than 20 years in the worlds largest open-air prison, suffering daily humiliation and harassment could be a compelling reason for this sudden eruption.

Just a few days ago, Benjamin Netanyahu, the current Israeli Prime Minister, was a cocky maverick who was attempting to undermine Israels vibrant democracy with

legislation to emasculate its Supreme Court. Today, he is a wounded warrior. With its incredulous audacity and equally stupefying barbarity, the Hamas has stunned Israel and the world, doing immeasurable damage to Israels repute as an impregnable State with its unbeatable intelligence system. We must not gloat on it because no matter what, the Hamas's act has caused immeasurable misery to the Palestinian people. We concede that.

It is time for the world to take note of the tragedy of the people of Palestine. The world can no longer be indifferent. Arab nations cannot ignore the plight of the homeless Palestine people in their own historical homeland.

I would like, Hon. Presiding Member, to recall a meeting I had with the the late Yasser Arafat when he visited Sri Lanka. It was during the time of the former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga's Government that the late Yasser Arafat, leader of the PLO, came to Sri Lanka.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member)

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Sir. I will take the Hon. Ali Zahir Moulana's time also. Then, it will be 15 minutes.

So, when I asked Mr. Yasser Arafat, What is your advice to us - at that time, we were also raging a civil war in our country - he responded saying, Young man, you have to be brave to fight a war. But yet, you have to be even more courageous to pursue peace. This is what the late Yasser Arafat told me when I asked him what his advice for us was since we were also having a war with terror unleashed by a belligerent group in our country.

Without Israeli terror, the terror of Hamas cannot exist. If the world community of nations wish to make Hamas irrelevant, it must convince the spoilt and pampered Government of Benjamin Netanyahu to make the Palestine Liberation Organization, which signed the Oslo Accord, relevant. Is it happening? No.

Look at yesterdays, of 19th of October, "The Times of Israel". It has published an op-ed article that offers a huge dose of common sense, which incidentally has some remarkable lessons for us Sri Lankans as well. I would like to quote it at length. The title of the article is "For years, Netanyahu propped up Hamas. Now it's blown up in our faces". The article states, I quote:

"For years, the various governments led by Benjamin Netanyahu took an approach that divided power between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank - bringing Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to his knees while making moves that propped up the Hamas terror group."

That is the type of intelligence operation that Israelis are engaging in.

I have some other matters concerning our own country. Today, in the "Daily News", there is an article titled "The Latest Gaza War: Israeli-Palestinian Conflict", a very neutral kind of headline, but the article is not very neutral. The article is by no less a person known as Professor Rohan Gunaratna. I have questioned the credentials of his as a professor, that is a different matter; I have had a long argument with him in one of our Committee Rooms. His bias is quite apparent in the article. But, of course, I must say that there are certain matters he refers to, certain factual situations in the Middle Eastern theatre. But, he is not neutral in the way he is describing the issue because he is looking at the it through his lens. He had his special lens put on when Zahran blasted himself here; he came to offer us advice as to how to tackle Zahran.

I remember very clearly that when I met the Cardinal, the Leader of the Catholics in this country, along with the Hon. Kabir Hashim and the Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie, he very clearly told us, "Why are you all being worried and sorry about this situation? I know that the Muslims in this country are not responsible for it". We must, of course, thank the Cardinal for his initial action in preventing a backlash against the Muslims in this country by his astute stand. He told us one more thing. The witnesses, the Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie and my Colleague the Hon. Kabir Hashim, are here. I think the Hon. Rishad Bathiudeen was also there. The Cardinal said, "I have a suspicion that this is the work of a State in the Middle East. The Israelis are behind this." That was only a suspicion at the very outset. Mr. Rohan Gunaratna, in his article is talking about the Mossad and their operations, their intelligence expertise and its wide network.

I have here the "Final Report of the Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into and Report or Take Necessary Action on the Bomb Attacks on 21st April 2019", which Commission was headed by His Lordship Justice Janak De Silva. In page 106, the Report states, I quote:

"It appears that Zaharan was vigilant of people who may pretend to be IS supporters but are in fact intelligence operatives. On the 10th of October 2018, Zaharan issued a letter on his Facebook account claiming that a person called Pakkam Bin Abu who maintains a facebook account by that name"

Pakkam Bin Abu talks about Zahran being an intelligence operative of a foreign State and then gives information about them to these intelligence agencies. The Report further states, I quote:

In response Pakkam Bin Abu on the 11th of October 2018 claimed that Zaharan was an agent of Israel intelligence and that although he tries to project himself as a hero by attracting youth towards the IS ideology, he is in fact equal to a lady.

This reference is to Israel intelligence. Zahran is a paid agent of Israel intelligence. This is the Report of the Presidential Commission, to which the incident of Easter

Bombings had been referred to. This is the very thing the Cardinal told us when we met him for the first time; his suspicion was also such.

Otherwise, what did we, the Muslims, have against the Christians in this country? Why should the Muslims get pitted against the Christians with bomb attacks on their holiest of churches in different places and on tourist hotels? And, why were certain hotels were attacked and certain hotels were not on Easter Sunday, on the most holiest of days? So, this is something that we must understand, that the Israelis, wherever they go, have, for their survival, long-term plans. So, this is what had happened even in our country.

There was a question that I asked even when we had debates on the Easter Sunday attacks. In this country, LTTE terror was there and of course, there was the JVP terror. Both the Tamils and the Sinhalese have resorted to terror to assert their political objectives. But, what was the political objective for the Muslims? None! To date, the JVP celebrates Rohana Wijeweera, their leader, as a hero at the Il Maha Viru Samaruwa. Then, Prabhakarans death has not silenced the extremists on the Tamil side. He is still remembered; every year, his birthday is being celebrated by the Tamils. But, have the Muslims ever lit a candle, leave alone a candle, did we ever pray even "Janazah" prayers for that dastardly terrorist Zahran? No! That is the difference that we failed to understand. Prophets of doom like Prof. Gunaratna can give all kinds of different arguments to prop up the idea of ISIS intruding into Sri Lanka, but all that is bunkum! All that was done to divide the Muslims and the Catholics and succeed in a political project to bring their friends to power. Today, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera was talking about the immense help that the Israelis had given to our armed forces, training them. I still remember what happened in the mid-eighties. There was talk about the Israelis training, on the one side, the Tamil militants and on the other, the Sri Lankan armed forces, that they were simultaneously training both sides. That, the Cardinal himself reminded us when we met him. So, that is what the Israelis had been doing.

The Land of Palestine is sacred to three revered religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. They have the holiest of shrines. All of us have our divisions, our worries about Jerusalem and its future. See the atrocious attempt made by the Israeli Government and the disproportionate power between one of the worlds best equipped armies and a ragtag terrorist organization. Of course, terror on all sides must be condemned. We are not upholding or celebrating what the Hamas did. But then, all the oppressed people all over the world are emboldened by what had happened to the most well-equipped, powerful Israeli defence forces on that critical day.

We condemn the barbarism of it; we condemn those attacks on the innocent Israelis. There are right-thinking Israelis are now holding rallies in US cities against the Israeli attacks. The shameful US President visited Tel Aviv and endorsed what Israel is doing and he was followed by the British Prime Minister. These are the

1311 1312

people who are now saying, Well, we will allow Egyptians to open up their borders for humanitarian assistance to flow in. But, what has happened? Up to now, people in Gaza have been dying in thousands and those countries are looking away. So, in this situation, it is important for Sri Lanka to realize that though we may be far from that theatre of war, even our country had been messed up by these devious designs of a Zionist Regime.

Sir, in this context, any reasonable person is beckoned to ask the following questions in relation to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: when Israelis destroy a part of the population under occupation while invoking the principle of proportionality, however remote the application of that principle is from the real harm sustained by them, does it not amount to genocide? Who told Israelis that the excesses they commit beyond the ambit of the principles of proportionality, necessity and distinction could still be justified, saying it is collateral damage suffered by the victims? When a group of people under occupation resists the continuing tyranny of occupation as well as the Israeli practices which deny them their right to life, land, liberty and freedom and respond to continuing provocations, is what that group engages in only terrorism? Who told Israelis that the UN Security Council would never be allowed to adopt a Resolution calling for a ceasefire or a humanitarian corridor in the Gaza to rush humanitarian assistance to the affected population because such a decision would only strengthen or reward terrorism? We also weep for the Israeli people who suffered the carnage of the 07th of October, 2023.

Sir, I conclude by echoing the words of the organization "Jewish Voice for Peace": "The loss of Israeli lives should not be used to perpetrate a new genocide or to seek moral cover for the immoral demand for innocent Palestinian lives and their land".

Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member)

[3.49 p.m.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) Hon. Presiding Member, I thank you for the opportunity given to speak on the ongoing war between Israel and Palestine. First of all, I wish to condemn the killings of civilians, irrespective of whoever who committed them. Human life is too precious and should not be expended for whatever cause.

The root cause of the current conflict can be traced back to the creation of Israel in the Palestine homeland in 1948 and the consequent dispossession of the homes of those who lived in Palestine. Much blood has been spilt as a result of the several battles and wars that have taken place since the creation of Israel. Much of it has been caused by the insatiable thirst of Israel to expand their boundaries and deprive the Palestinians of what little they have been left with.

The attack that was launched by the Hamas from Gaza on the 07th of this month was probably in desperation and in retaliation for the atrocities that are being committed daily on the Palestinian people by the Israeli authorities. The nature of the response by the Israeli authorities to the attacks by the Hamas is an indication of how the Israeli Government treats the Palestinians in Gaza. Even before the eruption of fighting in the last two weeks, the people of Gaza were living in crowded conditions with limited access to food, water, fuel and medical facilities. The recklessness with which Israel launched the attacks in Gaza without any regard for the safety of the civilians only made their lives worse. The attack on the Al-Ahli Hospital, resulting in the death of nearly 500 people is one of the most inhuman acts that one can think of. I wish to echo the call of the United

1327 1328

Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in the war. Simultaneously, a humanitarian corridor must be created so that essential supplies can reach the suffering people in the Gaza Strip. I must thank the Egyptian Government for allowing the opening up of the Rafah Crossing, which will enable supplies to be sent to Gaza. However, all these can only provide short-term relief for the people of Palestine. The international community must put pressure on Israel to act responsibily and to give up the path of belligerence and work towards peace in the Middle East.

I also wish to draw the attention of the House to another aspect of Israeli aggression inflicted on the Palestinian people. According to media reports, while the worlds attention has been fixed on Israels brutal bombardment of the Gaza Strip, for the past two weeks, the killing of at least 76 Palestinians by Israeli forces has barely made it to the headlines. In the Occupied West Bank, where the Israeli forces have killed an average of one Palestinian a day over the past two years, the number has increased drastically since the events in Gaza unfolded. So, at least, 76 Palestinians have been killed, including eight by armed settlers across the West Bank and Jerusalem when the latest escalation of attacks between Israel and Palestine began. Israeli army raids into Palestinian cities and villages have also sharply increased along with confrontations and protests against the bombing of Gaza.

It is disappointing to note that the United States and other western countries are encouraging Israel, when they should be using their influence to make the Israelis come to the negotiating table and make peace on the basis of a two-State solution. I also wish to urge the Arab and Muslim countries to rally round the Palestinians in their time of need. They should also lobby the rest of the right-thinking world to work towards ensuring justice for the long-suffering people of Palestine.

It is with great pain of heart that I speak of the tragedy that is worsening by every minute in the Gaza Strip. As this House take up this Adjournment Motion today, we learn that 1,500 Palestinian children had been killed in Israeli air attack since October 7th. How many children should die in this conflict before the world powers say enough is enough, that it is time for a ceasefire in the name of humanity? It is sad to hear that in Gaza, people are suffering without water, food, fuel and electricity. Hospitals are bombed in violation of the Geneva Convention. International humanitarian laws are observed in the breach. The civilian suffering is unprecedented while the conflict has the potential to spread across the region, in the event of which world oil prices could rise to over Rs. 1,000 a litre, a situation which countries like Sri Lanka will find hard to face.

This is why we, as a nation, must do whatever we could to bring an end to this conflict and end the suffering of the battered Palestinian people who are living under occupation, going through immense hardships and are

subjected to apartheid and humiliation. We, as a nation, should appeal to the United Nations to bring an immediate end to the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip through an immediate ceasefire that will allow humanitarian aid to reach the besieged people.

We, as a nation, has been promoting the Palestinian freedom struggle and I urge the Government not to deviate from that policy. We cannot take the side of the oppressor. Justice must be upheld.

We urge the Government not to fall prey to the Israeli lobby and abandon the Palestinian people crying for justice. Supporting a two-State solution has been our stance; let us stand by it. We urge the Government not to abandon the Palestinian cause. If we love our freedom, we should also love the freedom of our Palestinian brethren. As South Africas great statesman Nelson Mandela rightly said, South Africas freedom is incomplete without the freedom for Palestinians. We cannot and should not abandon the Palestinian cause by pointing to the policy shift of other non-aligned countries which have embraced the West and some west Asian nations which have signed the so-called Abraham Accords.

Sir, let us come together to end Israels colonization of Palestine. Let us all, in one voice, condemn Israels expansionist policy, its illegal settlement-building activities in Occupied Territories, its oppression of the Palestinian people, its apartheid policies and continuous violation of international law. Let us reaffirm our support for the Palestinians right to live within the secure borders as citizens of a free nation.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member)

Hon. Presiding Member, I think this message should go out to the United Nations, the NATO and the

international community. We cannot drag this war forever. Really, cruel incidents have been seen throughout this Israel-Palestine war. We cannot justify the actions of one party; both parties have committed genocide. We know that a war is not a happy thing; a war is a tragedy. Even though we won the war in Sri Lanka, we know it was a tragedy where our own people died. At the this juncture, some countries in the world such as Israel and Palestine and Ukraine and Russia are involved in wars. As a country, as the Sri Lankan nation, if we take had taken a side in those conflicts, I think that would not be a correct decision. We can send out the message that war is dangerous. We can send out the message Please take steps to stop this. Do not choose a side in this to the entire world. That is what we can do. We can urge the powerful nations such as the US, the UK, France and especially Iran - they have the capacity to engage in war - not to engage in this war or take a side in this conflict. If not, this whole thing will come to the level of a Third World War. If this escalates to that extent, Sir, we will not have a world to live in or to see a fourth world war. Emphasizing that message, I conclude my speech.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) 14
