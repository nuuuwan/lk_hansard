The Determination of the Supreme Court states, I quote:

"This Court bears in mind the provenance of the Bill in this trail and in the absence of countervailing evidence to controvert this chain of events, we are not fortified with cogency of material to the contrary such material to stymie or frustrate the legislative purpose that is sought to be pursued...."

"In the absence of countervailing evidence". , .. .

However, we would presently return to the question as to how some bondholders have been excluded from the ambit of the proposed legislative measure.

From the foregoing discussion it becomes crystal clear that just as much as external creditors absorb the losses, domestic creditors such as domestic savers, consumers, taxpayers and depositors do get inflicted with their share of losses and the unintended consequences resulting from this aspect of DDO concerning domestic creditors are not lost sight of by this Court as has been made clear in the material that has been made available before this Court.

It has been urged before us that in the context of Sri Lankan restructuring of International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs) and Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs), domestic banks lie exposed to the losses stemming from the restructuring and the banks cannot further contribute to the restoration of the country's debt solvency given their thin capital buffers after two years of intense crisis. In such circumstances it has been submitted by the learned DSG for the Attorney-General that pension funds would be able to contribute by bringing flow relief to the future refinancing of the Treasury.

In addition to the above second round effects, it has also been asserted before this court that the domestic banking sector has suffered serious wounds illustrated by a large destruction in private credit and a surge in Non-Performing Loans (NPLs). It has been asserted before this Court that economic recovery can only materialize with a strong and healthy banking sector that can (re)lend to productive projects.

Then, there is a table given. I would not read from that. The Determination then goes on to state, I quote:

The above table clearly shows that the banks, primary dealers, and other corporations are already paying income taxes at the rate of 30%...... They are already paying 30 per cent.

What is envisaged in this Bill is, the EPF & ETF would have to pay an income tax of 30%, or in the alternative they are given an incentive/concession, where they will only be paying l4% if they opt for the Domestic Debt Optimization (DDO) as proposed. Granting incentives/concessions for the survival and revival of the countrys economy, is clearly a reasonable exercise of the executive policy as endorsed by the legislature.

There is institutional incapacity in the Courts to reassess or reappraise the above policy decisions in the event evidence to the contrary is unavailable.... It states, evidence to the contrary is unavailable. They should have presented evidence at that time.

In the circumstances this Court perceives a rationale underlying the differentiation and this Court is not irresistibly driven to the conclusion that the policy is manifestly unreasonable."

"Before we part with this determination this Court wishes to dispose of a preliminary objection that both the learned DSG for the Attorney-General and the learned Counsel for the intervenient petitioner raised in limine to the maintainability of these proceedings. Juxtaposing some of the averments in a previous fundamental rights application namely, SC FR application 187/2023 both Counsel argued that the case of the Petitioners in SC SD 63/2023 and 64/2023 is fundamentally premised upon the challenge to the DDO process raised in the fundamental rights application. It has to be pointed out that the focus of inquiry in these proceedings is the consistency of the provisions in the impugned bill with the Constitution. In the FR application there was no such inquiry, which is sui generis to invocation of jurisdiction under Article 121 of the Constitution. In the circumstances the argument on issue estoppel, does not arise for consideration.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) , . The Hon. President read parts of the Determination of the Supreme Court. With due respect, Hon. President, I want to point out to you the sentence you missed out. The Determination states, I quote:

There is institutional incapacity in the Courts to reassess or reappraise the above policy decisions in the event evidence to the contrary is unavailable.

That is correct. They do not have the institutional capacity to do the analysis necessary.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) We have to do it. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Yes, we have to do it. Not only that, the Determination further states, I quote:

In the circumstances..

What are the circumstances? The information not being available. The Determination continues, I quote: .the Parliament which has full control of public finance in terms of Article 148 of the Constitution is at liberty to make reasonable classification and we take the view that manifest unreasonableness does not taint the clauses in the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act that is sought to be impugned in these proceedings.

All what we are saying is this. We had requested the Central Bank to provide us with some basic information, information which has nothing to do with market-sensitive information. Thereafter, we could use the authority given to us under Article 148 of the Constitution and make reasonable classification. So, that is all the information we are asking for. We are not asking for market-sensitive information; sensitive information. sensitive information ? DDO announce ? . , that is the reality.

Sir, let me also tell you what we have asked for. We had asked for the current weighted average yield of the bond portfolio of the EPF as at 23rd of May, before and after tax. That is not market-sensitive information. How can that be market-sensitive information? And, they have given that. The other information we sought is, a calculation of net present value impact on the EPF bond portfolio, if the DDO proposal is accepted, before and after tax and a set of assumptions, projections behind making such calculations. Hon. President, do you agree with me that this is non-market-sensitive information? This is not market-sensitive information. With regard to

that information, what they are saying is that as per the third extension notice of the Treasury bond exchange offer, the above information is being recomputed. So, we still have not been given that information. The next is, the return on the EPF portfolio, based on (a) status quo, (b) non-participation and (c) participation of the DDO, as proposed. Their response is that as per the third extension, the above information is being recomputed. So, therefore -

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member, you can take up all these things at the Debate. But, at the moment, we have to submit the Report and finish it off.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) , . You all are lawyers and I am not. But, I am just trying, as a layman, to interpret the Determination which states that the Court did not have the evidence. And, a part of the evidence was made available this morning. So, let us go through it. And, pending approval of the Committee, I propose that we take up this Bill. But, let us do it the right way.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Susil Premajayantha, Attorney-at-Law) That is agreeable.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Hon. Speaker, the Supreme Court has made a Determination whether you require a two-thirds majority or a simple majority to pass this Bill, which is a question of having a differentiation of 30 per cent and 14 per cent. So, the question that arises here is whether that differentiation is justified or not.

Then, on the matter which was raised - you cannot go and question that Ruling again - I must tell you, Hon. Member, that before the sentence you read out, there is an earlier sentence, which also must be read. It states, I quote:

This Court bears in mind the provenance of the Bill in this trail and in the absence of countervailing evidence to controvert this chain of events, we are not fortified with cogency of material to the contrary such material to stymie or frustrate the legislative purpose that is sought to be pursued.

That means, there had been no evidence produced to the contrary; the Petitioners had been unable to provide evidence to the contrary and then on that, the Supreme Court states, I quote:

There is institutional incapacity in the courts to reassess....

That is true, if you do not give other evidence. You have nothing new to give. There was a Petitioner called Chathuranga Abeysinghe - I think he is a member of the NPP - and he was represented by M.A. Sumanthiran, PC. So, a Member of the Committee on Public Finance had

1715 1716

2023 06

made representations and he could not give evidence to Court; he could not produce evidence before Court having been a Member of that Committee. So, why are we wasting our time? If you had evidence, you could have produced it. You did not produce it and that is over now. That is what I am saying. There was a chance to produce evidence. Now, it is useless arguing here because the Court says, Look, you did not produce it. Then, this is not the only case, but two other cases were put forward by the same counsels and what happened? Both were rejected by the Supreme Court. There are three more, just to stop this. I cannot see a basis, since the Supreme Court has rejected two, for those three to come up. So, there had been no evidence produced. A Member of this Committee had gone to Court and he could not produce evidence. So, what are we arguing here? There is no case to be argued. That is all what I am saying.

Now, the Bill is before the House. If the Hon. Leader of the Opposition wants to say that he is against it, good, all right, I do not mind. But, do not go to the companies that are making unconscionable profits and ask for money to run the sessions and all that. You cannot have it both ways. If you want taxing them, tax them. Otherwise, do not tax them. But, there will be taxes imposed on the profits made by them. That will come up in the next Budget, do not worry about that. We are not leaving anyone aside. At that time, you will vote against the Budget because we are taxing them. So, that is what it is going to be. Also, you will find many surprises in the Budget.

This Bill needs to get through because we have to get the economy moving again. So, I have asked for your support. If you do not support it, you come and vote against it. All I am saying is, debate it either now or on Saturday; choose one of the two. And as far as the Chairman of the Committee is concerned, I would like to ask him to read the letter where the Secretary says, This is what the Governor has informed me". He has conveyed that to you and said , I am not in a position to judge. I am giving it to you, but kindly maintain the confidentiality. That is all. So, at any time, you can meet with the Governor and find out what the issues are. You are always welcome to do that because the Chairman of the Committee on Public Finance and the Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means have to work with the Treasury and it is important that you all do not get into conflict. I also cannot get into conflict with them and they, too, cannot get into conflict with me. In fact, I have suggested to get the Parliamentary Budget Office going quickly. Then, a lot of these things could be sorted out there. So, the two Committees must be above conflict and let the majority view prevail.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Hon. Speaker, - ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) , -

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Let the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva finish first. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) I will finish quickly, Sir.

. . . . , . . ., . , . .. .. . . .

The only issue, Hon. Speaker, is information - the Hon. President will agree with me - is asymmetric in this instance; .. , . That is called a problem of the lemons. , .

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member, the Government has now agreed to have one full day's Debate. So, let us go for that.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) argue , . . , . And, we are willing to find a compromise.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) No, my Ruling had nothing to do with that. What I have stated in the Ruling was about the power of Parliament. That is all and I have not gone into any judicial matters.

Then, what the Hon. President said was that the Hon. Member who had appeared for that case had not submitted the required information. That is all.

Hon. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka,- Vote of No Confidence against Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella, Minister of Health,- Whereas solutions have not been put forward so far for the crisis that has arisen in the health sector at present;

And whereas the opinion of the experts is that most of the sorrowful incidents that are reported from hospitals day by day are deaths and impairments caused due to the use of drugs which either substandard or are low in quality;

And whereas he is accountable as the Minister of Health for not duly appointing the Board of Directors of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority, for the importing of low quality drugs, for the importing of drugs deviating from the tender procedure, for the importing of drugs at exorbitant prices, for the scarcity of essential drugs and shortage of laboratory equipment in the hospital system and for the purchasing of unregistered drugs on the pretext of emergency purchases thereby resulting in deaths and impairments due to their use;

And whereas the Minister of Health has neglected to duly regulate the process of importing drugs to this country in a manner not inconsistent with the guiding principles of State Policy stipulated in Article 27 of the Constitution regardless of the fact that the government is bound to uphold the Principles therein;

And whereas the Minister has acted ruining the safe health service available for people, thereby breaching the pledge he has given in terms of Article 53 of the Constitution;

And whereas the Minister has neglected his fundamental duties required by Article 28 of the Constitution and people have to pay the price of his irresponsible conduct with their lives;

That this Parliament resolves that it has no confidence in the competence of Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella, Minister of Health to function as a Minister of the Cabinet of Ministers any longer."

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) has nothing to do with health. Hon. Member, it is related to commerce and finance; it is a payment issue. A payment issue has been there right from the beginning, at the time when I took over office, amounting to Rs. 45 billion and I was able to pay that by way of bonds. Therefore, obviously, it is not fair for you to say that, due to debts, suppliers are not applying for tenders because that had been sorted out. That was completely sorted out at that time. Still, there is a backlog, which is part of the economic breakdown, and we will be sorting it out.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Sir, with regard to the question posed to me, I would like to say that the Hon. Member has made a serious point. The point is well taken and that will be attended to. We have been discussing this matter and I think it is time that we implement it. Thank you very much for bringing it up.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. S.M.M. Muszhaaraff) I am not talking politics. The Opposition parties know, I already mentioned this earlier in my speech, that we spend a large amount of money on the health and education sectors. So, we have to recover those amounts from the other failed government departments. When the Government is going to privatize those institutions, the Opposition opposes that. That is what happens.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 18 .

[5.53 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Presiding Member, today we are discussing the increase in the tax rate on the Employees' Provident Fund. Being a former member of the Employees' Provident Fund and as a person understanding the importance of it, I am really appalled at what the Government is trying to do.

Former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, Dr. W.A. Wijewardene, in an article written recently, in July 2023, talks about the misunderstood taxation of the EPF and other superannuation funds. There, he also makes the point that for too long, the members of the EPF have been deceived by telling them that they have a concessionary interest rate of 14 per cent. Actually, what is the concessionary interest? The EPF is taxed on its gross income. The corporates are taxed on their net income. They have their revenue and the cost and qualifying payments to make and only after calculating all that, they are being taxed. But, the EPF is taxed on its gross income. So, when you actually look at the taxation on the EPF closely, you would find that it is often more than the tax on a corporate. If I had a choice, as a member of the EPF, I would take my savings and manage it myself because, then, I would get a higher return than the EPF would give me over 30 or 40 years. So, this is the problem we actually have: even at the rate of 14 per cent, they tax the

whole gross income and then only allocate the return to each account. Therefore, they are actually paying very high taxes. And now, the proposal is to increase it to 30 per cent, which is unbelievable! If you increase it to 30 per cent, they will have to pay much more. Therefore, though the corporate taxes are often made out to be higher than the tax on the EPF, it is not the case; it is not true.

EPF is also a forced saving; it is not a voluntary saving scheme. So, you have no choice, but to save. If we take the present tax slabs, Rs. 100,000 is the tax-free income. Probably, 90 per cent of those on the EPF earn less than Rs. 100,000. Under the present tax slabs, if you earn up to Rs. 183,000 a month only the 12 per cent tax slab begins to hit you. So, how many people earn less than Rs. 183,000 a month?

You take the plantation workers of this country, who were about 400,000 some time ago and maybe, 140,000 or 150,000 now. They are being taxed, actually. If they had the money in their hand and put it in a bank deposit, when they take it out, they would not even need to pay tax. How about all the workers in this country? Most of them are at the low end of earning. There are 22.4 million accounts and 2.5 million active accounts in the EPF.

Sir, my point is this. What is happening is really unjust. The DDO suggests that over 16 years, you will get a return of 10.58 per cent. If you pay tax at 14 per cent, 9.1 per cent would be the return you are going to get. Even the current market return, pre-tax, is 13.77 per cent. You are not actually going to get even that. So, superannuation funds and the EPF are being treated unequally.

Banks, they are doing business. So, they need to be taxed. Then, individuals and primary dealers, they are doing business. They also need to be taxed. But, we are saying that both those categories will not be taxed. The EPF belongs largely to the poor and the low-income-earning groups in this country. Therefore, they should be protected. When the EPF Act was originally brought in, it was said that there would be no tax. So, should we tax the EPF and the superannuation funds at all? If we exempt someone from tax, it should be the poor. If we impose tax, it should be on the wealthy. There is no justification for making only the poor pay this tax.

A study by Verit Research showed us that 14 countries restructured debt only of banks. Then, out of those 14, nine included restructuring of debt of private creditors and only two had restructured debt of social security funds. But, not a single country in the world has restructured only the debt of its social security funds - that is, of the EPF - without touching that of primary dealers, private parties, businesses or banks. It is only in Sri Lanka that this has actually happened. So, clearly, there is an issue and a problem of being treated unfairly and unjustly.

Sir, our Constitution, in Article 12.(1), clearly states, I quote:

1867 1868

[ ( ]

2023 06

All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal protection of the law.

Everybody is. Then, under Article 27.(1) - Directive Principles of State Policy - it further states, I quote:

The Directive Principles of State Policy herein contained shall guide Parliament, the President and the Cabinet of Ministers in the enactment of laws and the governance of Sri Lanka for the establishment of a just and free society."

Then, Article 27.(2)(e) states, I quote:

the equitable distribution among all citizens of the material resources of the community and the social product, so as best to subserve the common good;

Or the common interest. Also, Article 27.(7) states, I quote:

"The State shall eliminate economic and social privilege and disparity and the exploitation of man by man or by the State."

Article 27.(8) states:

"The State shall ensure that the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth and the means of production to the common detriment."

Article 27.(9) states:

"The State shall ensure social security and welfare."

That is why we say this is unjust.

. Hon. State Minister, tax treatment of superannuation funds is totally different from that of the financial institutions. You need to understand that. There is something going on in this whole thing. It is not from a political angle that we are considering this, but from a technical angle. This differes in terms of the treatment of the interest paid to their fund suppliers. That is the main issue. , . . 30 . , . ., . . . . Superannuation funds are not allowed to deduct the interest paid when ascertaining the taxable income, while financial institutions are allowed to deduct the interest income paid to their depositors and the bondholders. So, you can see the difference there. The Government is attempting to treat the superannuation funds and the financial institutions comparably. That is not fair because the tax treatment of a superannuation fund differs from that of a financial institution with respect to the interest that is paid. - financial institution - . . ., . . . 30 . . .

Then, what is the actual comparison? If you look at the actual comparison, already the EPF and the pension funds are paying 14 per cent. 18 . ., 18 . Dr. W.A. Wijewardena . Verit Research .

that of superannuation funds is gross income where interest paid to members is treated as profit distribution and is non-deductible. Then, obviously, , . ? , . ? , . . . , this is not an equitable pain sharing; . . - - , . The pain should be shared by all bondholders since all bondholders have been benefitted.

(3) Such part of the gains and profits received or derived by the Employees Trust Fund, an approved provident or pension fund or an approved termination fund from treasury bonds, for the second

six months period of the year of assessment commencing on April 1, 2023 and for each year of assessment commencing on or after April 1, 2024, shall be taxed at the rate of 30%

[7.08 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Deputy Speaker, today, we are debating two Bills - the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Bill and the Social Security Contribution Levy (Amendment) Bill - in the late hours of this evening and tomorrow evening because the Government wishes to have the two Bills passed before the end of this week. Since the Opposition wanted, at least, a full days Debate on those and due to having an agenda already been fixed, we are debating them in a fairly urgent way in the late hours of these evenings.

We are debating these two Bills under circumstances that the country has never faced, where ordinary people feel that they have been bankrupted and sections who are more affluent also feel the immense burden of this crisis. I do not think any section of the society can say that they do not feel a huge change in their economic situation, which has happened over the last one-and-a-half years. Under those circumstances, Sir, there is a grave risk, where vast sections of the countrys population will begin to feel about themselves as victims. I am making this point because the Hon. (Prof.) Ranjith Bandara - he spoke in very high-flown Sinhala, from what I could understand - made an extremely valid point towards the end of his speech that there is this danger where people might feel about themselves as victims and at that point, they could get together and due to their sense of victimhood, bring about another danger, something not favourable erupting. I think what he meant by that was that there is a possibility of radicalization. That is the point, Sir, which was made.

I am not an expert in economics. So, I do not want to venture into a position where I want to challenge on the substance of these Bills and on policy. But, I, being a Member of Parliament from Jaffna, representing the North and the East, can certainly tell you that we are very familiar with this notion of victimhood. And, when you can recognize that sense of victimhood, not just in the North and the East but also outside, the feeling that we, from the North and the East, get is that it is rampant and that the country is not in a good place. This feeling of victimhood across the board is happening, Sir, under circumstances, whether one likes it or not, where there has been grave political changes taking place two years ago and where a Government and a party, which won an unprecedented mandate with former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa having a majority of over 1.3 million and that party winning a two-thirds majority at the General Election two years ago, was thrown out by those very same people who voted them in.

So, it is that Government or that party which is in Government that had its President and Prime Minister

1889 1890

resigning and then, went on to appoint another Hon. Member, who actually destroyed his party and who has no standing in this Parliament, first, as Prime Minister and subsequently, as President. And, it is under his leadership that these decisions are being taken. So, when that feeling of victimhood is prevalent and in fact, is increasing - that is our reading of the situation- and when people perceive that they are being victims and are being caused to be victims by those who are not mandated by them, that is where the danger begins.

It is for that reason, Sir, that, today, I got my hands on the Advance Unedited Version of the UN Human Rights Commissioners Report on Sri Lanka, where, under "Conclusions", the High Commissioners Office says this: Financial support from international financial institutions and structural reforms are important steps to bring the economic crisis under control, but it is essential that the burden of reforms does not fall unequally upon some segments of society".

It goes on to state, It is vital to address the underlying factors in the crisis, including corruption, centralization of power, lack of transparency and institutional checks and balances and the unresolved legacy of conflict, including accountability". It further goes on to state, "Solutions will only be long-lasting, if supported by society as a whole. Both the necessary economic reforms and the historical, institutional challenges affecting Sri Lanka require tremendous political capital, broad consensus and the trust of society". That, Sir, is our contention, that it does not have the support of the society. Quite honestly, I think the Governments actions by postponing elections prove that.

And, this notion of victimhood is across the board. The Tamils of the North and the East feel as victims. It is a never-ending story of victimhood. But, the Muslims, especially after the Easter attacks, whether you want to accept it or not, feel as victims because they were deliberately targeted. Then, with the "Channel 4" exposure which came out yesterday, that has become public knowledge. If that story is believed by practically every Muslim, can you imagine the feeling of victimhood on their part? It is on top of all of that that, today, because of this economic situation and the way in which the Governments policies, especially the policies that have been highlighted by the SJB - we fully stand in agreement with the concerns they have been raising all evening - have been carried out, this feeling of victimhood is also rampant. And that, Sir, is a recipe for disaster.

It is under those circumstances that you have steps being taken by the Government to make radicalization, as far as the North and the East is concerned, even worse. Those steps are being taken deliberately at this stage. Then, Sir, you have to ask, why is that happening? At that point, you get the grave doubt, because the Government does not have a mandate but wants to hang on to power, whether it is deliberately creating a situation of victimhood and thereby, radicalizing so that they

could, then, justify using the armed forces to crush resistance and cling on to power. I do not think any country, any individual or any investor who wants to look into Sri Lanka's situation and actually help us will consider those circumstances as fruitful or conducive for the investments that this country needs to come out of this economic mess.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . 10 .
