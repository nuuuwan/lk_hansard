( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) , . , IMF . . I can speak with bilateral and multilateral creditors and private bond holders only if Parliament is prepared to accept the IMF Report. So, I urge this House to accept the Report. If you have any issues, you can talk it over with the IMF representatives when they come back. That is all I am asking you to do. I am not getting into a debate. So, that is the request I have made.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. Speaker, I think the Hon. President should understand this. Hon. President, you have presented the Report and made a Statement in Parliament. Just because you present a Report and make a Statement in Parliament, we cannot agree without a proper examination and scrutiny and a proper Parliamentary debate on the Report. So, what we are proposing is, let us go ahead with the Debate, and I would very humbly request the Hon. President to remain in Parliament and listen to the progressive and constructive proposals that we have and take cognizance of those. Then, at the end of the day, we can agree on things that we can agree and we can part ways on issues that we cannot agree. It is as simple as that. It is called practical politics; it is called pragmatism. So, let us do that. We are not willing, just because the President makes a Statement, to approve anything willy-nilly, without proper a scrutiny and examination.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) That is correct.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Hon. Speaker, shall we start the Debate? I think there is enough time till the third week of May and if the National Council wants to, I will meet them also in the third week of April. I will ask my officials to meet them. But at the end of the day, there is only one issue: do you

approve the Report or not? I cannot force everyone to accept the Report; they may find reasons not to support it. But, the world has to know where we stand. We will ask for a Vote by name. That is all. You can vote whichever way you want. We are not forcing anyone to support it. But, if I do not get your support, I cannot go ahead and continue the second round of the negotiations. That is all I said. I am not trying to force you all; I am only asking you to give me a reply one way or the other by the third week of April, whether you want it or not. So, you all explain that.

And, there is no need for me to be in this House. I have to do other work on these negotiations. But, the rest of the team are here. My two State Ministers took part in all the negotiations; the Minister of Foreign Affairs was there; the Hon. Prime Minister knows about it and there are also other Ministers like the Minister of Power and Energy who were involved. I think I will leave it to them because they are as good as me to answer your questions. In fact, they had been spending more time with the IMF than I had been. So, they could answer your questions more than I could.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. Speaker, I do not think there is disagreement between the President, those MPs on that side of the aisle and us in the Opposition. We are fully equipped to take up the challenge of the Government to commence the Debate right now. But, I would respectfully request that we commence the Debate after the Questions for Oral Answers because I have a very poignant question to ask regarding the divestiture of shares of profitable Government institutions. So, after the Questions for Oral Answers, we will commence the Debate.

Then, it was only a humble request for the Hon. President to remain, if possible, in Parliament so that he himself could take due recognition of our views and not these bogus representatives of his, who were anti-IMF. They were the people who were talking about boycotting the IMF.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) Hear! Hear!! ( ) (Hon. Members) Yes, yes. [Interruption] ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) They were the people who were saying that IMF , IMF , . [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) That is enough. You take it up at the Debate. So, let us go ahead with the Questions to start the Debate soon.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) So, I am very much okay with exchanging ideas with a pro-IMF President.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Very good. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) A pro-IMF President and the anti-IMF group.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) That is not a point of Order, Hon. Member. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) , , I have to reply. -[Interruption.]

When the Minister of Justice presents the the Bill, kindly study it and look at what are the amendments that we all can agree on; but it has to satisfy the UN Resolution on anti-corruption. I think that is about the best standards we can use.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) The Legislature is the - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) The members of that are being appointed by the Constitutional Council. At the moment, you have to select some people for the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. Unlike the earlier times when the President selected them and sent their names to the Constitutional Coucil for approval, now, the Council has to select them and send their names to me and then, I will appoint them. So, now, you all the Parliament have taken the responsibility of appointing the people who will go into this issue, not the President; the ball is in Parliaments court. - [Interruption]

[5.18 p.m.]

) ( - ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed - Minister of Environment) Hon. Deputy Speaker, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to speak at this historically important Adjournment Debate. First of all, let me thank the Hon. President for taking the initiative, going through the entire process of completing the IMF bailout package and rescuing the country from the disaster it has been facing since last year.

When the President made the Statement about the IMF bailout package, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition requested for a debate on that and particularly mentioned about walking the talk - those were his words - repeatedly asking the Hon. President to remain in the House until the Debate is over. I was thinking that the person who mentioned about walking the talk would remain here until this Debate is over. The President straightaway said that he need not wait because there are so many other Ministers who are capable of answering all your questions, issues and misunderstandings. But, very unfortunately, the Hon. Sajith Premadasa himself, who requested for the Debate and talked about walking the talk, has finally left the Chamber and now I am talking to the Opposition benches, which are empty. So, it is very unfortunate, Sir. But, that is the reality. They are here only to criticize; they are here only to mislead the public and when it comes to real suggestions, they are not here.

When the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and the entire Opposition criticized the IMF Agreement, they came up with very silly reasons; there was no substantial reason. One of the reasons mentioned by the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva and even by the Hon. Sajith Premadasa was that that Agreement was not shown to them. Is that a reason for them to criticize the Agreement? It is there in front of you now. Why do you not make whatever possible suggestions you have? Then, let us get together and include those suggestions also in the Agreement and move forward. That is the appeal I have to make to all these empty chairs.

The President, many a time, told the Opposition, "Come up with a solution. Give me an option. What is the option available? He was prepared to consider that option and move forward, but there was not a single occasion when they came up with a solution, but only came up with criticism. Now, I wish to ask a question from those Hon. Members. Looking at the broader picture of the economy of the country and the suffering of the vast majority of the less-privileged population, which results from unbearable cost of food items, fuel and utilities like electricity, in short, should we work out a solution to end their sorrow, misery and grief or not? If you answer my question in the affirmative, there is only one option. That is, to cooperate with the Government and extend your support to this IMF bailout package.

Sir, it is most appropriate to mention here the phrase "failure is not an option" associated with the NASA. In the same way, we cannot resort to any option which will propel us to failure by opposing this bailout package. So, if you have an iota of compassion for the people of this country irrespective of their religion, race or ethnicity, you have to give your consent to the programme, putting aside political or any other differences. Can we afford to miss this opportunity? Or else, can you suggest an alternative? What is on the table is a very comprehensive economic programme. Do not try take up some isolated elements and reject the entire package. Look at the view of the forest, not at the trees.

For restoring fiscal sustainability and strengthening fiscal discipline, very ambitious, primarily revenue-based fiscal consolidation accompanied by fiscal institutional reforms and cost recovery-based energy pricing will be introduced by this Agreement. Another important element is a strong social safety net to protect the most vulnerable. We know that we cannot wait till full economic recovery to provide relief to the poorest sector of the population. An allocation not exceeding Rs. 187 billion will be made available to strengthen the existing cash transfer programmes relating to Samurdhi, people with disabilities, the elderly citizens and patients suffering from Chronic Kidney Disease in 2023. Also under this programme, the fuel prices will be determined on the 2018 price formula and will be adjusted once a month to ensure cost recovery. The electricity tariff will be adjusted every year in January and July to reflect the cost. An independent National Debt Management Agency will be set up according to global best practices. I wanted to mention all these elements to show that this very comprehensive programme covers all aspects of our reeling economy.

One of the most popular criticisms put forward by the Opposition in this Debate is that the Government plans to privatize profit-making State-owned enterprises in line with the IMF Agreement. I must say that those arguments and criticisms are obsolete or archaic and are far away from the modern global concepts of privatization and competition. Government cannot do business; businesses have to be run by businessmen. Governments are run by politicians, not by businessmen. Businesses are run by businessmen. Government uses peoples money, but businessmen risk their own money. So, they are careful.

1071 1072

2023 22

But, when it comes to businesses run by the Government, nobody is responsible or accountable for the money used. We have been just running those enterprises. That is what we have been doing. We have been running those enterprises - they have been making profit - but that does not mean those have been running effectively and efficiently, that they have been making enough profit, but they should have.

State-owned enterprises tend to be monopolies or restrict competition from the private sector. The Government cannot boost overall employment by hiring workers for the State sector. State-owned enterprises do enjoy hidden subsidies in various forms including preferential borrowing costs, lower rents or taxes. Therefore, Sir, time has come for us to critically look at whether those profit-making SOEs are actually, in real terms making profit. So, it is in that context that divestment of State assets comes in as part of the Governments restructuring process of state sector enterprises. Therefore, we need to strongly support President Ranil Wickremesinghes State sector restructuring plans to reduce burden on the people. When there is an economic crisis, you need to make sacrifices to safeguard the country. Therefore, it is imperative that we sell some of those ventures to protect the economy. You might have to amputate your leg to save your life; it is an existential choice.

Sir, I wish to conclude by reiterating the fact that the business of the Government is not to do business, but to provide a conducive environment for its people and investors to carry out their activities freely and competitively subject to a strong regulatory mechanism to ensure maximum economic and social benefit to the people and the country.

Let us learn from the successful models of neighbouring countries like Singapore, Malaysia, India et cetera, who embraced the open economy much later than Sri Lanka did. Let us make patriotic decisions not only by heart, but also from the brain. Sri Lanka is clearly at the crossroads and let us make the right and futuristic choices for the sake of our motherland and for our future generations.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) 2023 23 .
