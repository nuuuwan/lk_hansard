.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Hon. Speaker, under Section 32, Part B, Subsection 4 of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act, I would like to raise a Privilege issue. Subsection 4 states, I quote:

"Assaulting, insulting or willfully obstructing any member in Parliament in committee or in the precincts of Parliament."

2051 2052

Sir, on the 25th of April, 2023, I was on my feet trying to raise an issue that was relevant to Batticaloa. Whilst I was trying to raise that issue, I was not allowed to raise it because the relevant Cabinet Minister did not wish to respond to it. However, whilst the relevant Minister, to whom I posed my question, did not want to respond to it, the Cabinet Minister who spoke after him referred to me as "kotiya" and "jathiwadiya". The Hon. Manusha Nanayakkara, the Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment, called me "kotiya" and "jathiwadiya" and that comment coming from the Hon. Manusha Nanayakkara, I was not very surprised.

But, however, Sir, I was shocked at the comment by the Minister in charge of Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Ali Sabry.

Let me quote him.

"I raise issues relating to Sri Lankans. That is how I act."

Sir, in my opinion, the District of Batticaloa is part of Sri Lanka. So, when I raise an issue relating to Batticaloa, that is also related to Sri Lanka. Then, he goes on to say that I am a mark of division and that I am a communalist. Pointing towards the Hon. Manusha Nanayakkara, who called me a "racist" and "kotiya", and acknowledging his comments, the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs said, I quote:

I endorse what they are saying, you are a communal politician. But, I am not a communal politician."

He also said, "You contested from the Rajapaksa camp", which, I think, is no secret. In 2010, I was 19 and did not contest the 2010 Parliamentary Election. He further said, I quote:

"After that, you took up communalism and now you are a communalist."

Then, he said another word which is not just unparliamentarily but also utter filth! The Minister of Foreign Affairs, a Cabinet Minister, said that.

Sir, I would like to put on record that I am an elected Member of Parliament from the District of Batticaloa. I got the highest number of Preferential Votes in Batticaloa for my party. Sir, there is a clear distinction between a National List MP and an elected MP. As an elected MP, I have a responsibility and a duty towards the people who elected me, to put their interests first as opposed to a National List MP, who, maybe, was appointed to represent the interests of one individual.

So, I will wind up my Privilege issue by asking for an apology from the Minister concerned for that derogatory word he used, which was insulting even to my parents. I would also like to request the Committee on Ethics and Privileges to suspend him from Parliament at least for a period of two weeks. Why I say this is because the Minister said, I quote:

I raise issues of Sri Lankans. That is my priority.

Sir, I would like to put this final point on record, that Parliament is not the precinct to be a Sri Lankan by

raising Sri Lankan issues. I have always raised national issues, but I have not helped to bring in laws such as the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution to please the person who gave me the opportunity to come to Parliament. And also, I was not the Minister in charge of justice when the dead bodies of a section of Sri Lankan citizens were cremated denying their final rites. So, therefore, I will let the people of Sri Lanka to decide who is representing Sri Lanka and who is representing their masters, who gave a National List seat on charity to their counsel.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . ... ( ) ( ... - ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC - Minister of Foreign Affairs) Hon. Speaker, - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Minister?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC) Hon. Speaker, it is very important that I answer. The Hon. Shanakiyan Rasamanickam shows the world that he is a champion of the Tamil cause and that he had stood against the grave dangers done to the Tamils during the war. But, in 2015 - I have the posters - he contested from the Rajapaksa camp. He wanted to ride on the popularity of the Rajapaksas and win the electorate. But, he was defeated; he got only 3,000 votes. All of a sudden, from nowhere, now he has become a crusader against the Rajapaksas. What is this? Cheap electoral politics to divide people, to rabble-rouse communalism and win the elections. I also can do it today. If I get on to the street and say something against the Sinhalese people, the Muslims will vote for me. If I get into the Sinhalese camp and blast the Tamils, the Sinhalese will vote for me. There are people doing it. I will never do that! I will go home! That is not the politics I do. What I have done for your people, check.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Sir, this is not the place for the Minister to -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC) No, I need to say that. Why not? I need to answer when you say something. - [Interruption.] Listen, listen. Please, listen! Why do you shout? - [Interruption.]

2053 2054

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Let him reply. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC) When I was appointed the Minister of Justice - [Interruption.] Please listen to me, Hon. Rasamanickam. I had the patience to listen to you. Please sit down. Let me answer. Hon. Speaker, I must respond to this.

When I took over as the Minister of Justice, check how many Tamils were in detention under the PTA. - [Interruption.] Just check how many Tamils were in detention under the PTA. Check that. Check how many people were detained under the PTA for a long period of time. - [Interruption.] I was instrumental in convincing the former President and the current President of their plight and gave pardon to more than 27 of them. I was instrumental in amending the PTA - you voted against it - and introduced bail under the PTA. Because of that, so many Tamils got bail including one boy who was 20 years behind bars. That is the politics I do. I do not announce that.

When Muslim bodies were cremated, I took that up five times in the Cabinet. My Colleagues are here and all of them know that. I was openly against it. But, I do not play to the gallery because it will further divide our communities. So, I was instrumental in convincing that. The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara was there in the Cabinet and knows how many times I took it up. Hon. Nanayakkara, you were one of the persons who stood with me; we are now in different camps, but you stood with me then. That is the politics I do. But I do not come out and say, I raised this; I created this; we must create a big issue. Hon. Rasamanickam, what you are trying is to put the Muslims and Tamils together against the Sinhalese, against the Buddhists and do your cheap politics. I will never do that! I would rather walk out of this Parliament! I will never do that. If I have said anything - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you, Hon. Minister. Could you please wind up? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC) Hon. Speaker, yes, I appeared for Rajapaksas and for Gotabaya Rajapaksa. I am very proud of that. They may have failed in the last two, three years because of the sensitive nature of the economy, but they played a heroic role in getting rid of terrorism in this country! Even tomorrow, I will appear for them when I go out of Parliament. I am not going to be here for long. This is not my livelihood like yours, Hon. Member. I am a lawyer. I will go back and will practise again. On that day, if any more heroes want me to, I will appear for them.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Minister, now, please wind up. - [Interruption.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC) Having said so, Hon. Speaker, if I have used any unparliamentary language, I will apologize for that; I will withdraw that. I did not mean to do that. I love the Tamils, but I do not like communalists.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you very much. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker,-

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Leader of the Opposition? ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. Speaker, I think in this noble Assembly, all the 225 Members have a right to express their opinions but, of course, in a civilized manner.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Exactly. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) I think it is very important and crucial that all of us, while expressing our own opinions, views, the theories and ideologies that we believe in, abide by the noble principles of decent, civilized Parliamentary practice. I know, Hon. Ali Sabry, that you are a learned Member of this House. I have an unedited copy of your statement on that day and may I have your permission, with all of you Hon. Members not shouting and creating rancour, mayhem in this Assembly, to just quote what you said. You mentioned -[Interruption.] One second please. Let me finish. -[Interruption.] Please be decent. Please allow me to speak. Try to be patient. Practise what you preach. This is not something that I have written. This is an unedited copy of your statement, which I obtained from the Hansard Department. - [Interruption.] Hon. Member, I have a right to speak. So, allow me to speak. I am quoting from an unedited copy of your statement. You say, I quote:

2055 2056

You are a communalist, bastard!

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] It is here and I want to table that.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Minister apologized the Hon. Member and withdrew it. So, let us finish it at that. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) No, no, hold on. Let me finish. I appreciate, Hon. Minister, that you basically said that if something unparliamentary was uttered that you apologize and withdraw it. What I am trying to tell you is, you have to put it on record that you mentioned the words "communalist, bastard!"

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

and that is totally -

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I will get all those words expunged. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) This is an unedited copy of your statement. I have no necessity to lie.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) All those words will be expunged. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Right, apology taken. I am sure that Hon. Member has to accept the apology, not me. - [Interruption.] But, all I am trying to say is, Hon. Minister, I have a very high regard for you. Okay? I have a lot of regard for you, much more than the so-called belligerent Members who are here right now and are trying to support you do. - [Interruption.] These donkeys

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

do not understand the meaning of what I am saying. A total bunch of donkeys!

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Let us finish this now, please. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Anyway, all what I am trying to say is, unfortunately it has come on record your calling him a "communalist, bastard!".

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) It has been withdrawn now; it will be expunged. So, that is enough.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) So, I am happy that you have taken back what you had said. I am happy about that. Thank you.

.. ( . ) (The Hon. Premnath C. Dolawatte, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Speaker, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) That is enough. Let us finish this off. - [Interrutption.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC) Let me say this, Sir.

I did not say that. But, if I have used any unparliamentary word, I have the humility to apologize and withdraw that and I apologize to my learned Friend. One must also understand that it was recorded because the mike was on. But, you must also consider what kind of crosstalk was going on at that point in time. The Hon. Member just tried to - I do not need to go back to that, I do not need to. But, I have the humility to apologize. I have not come here to fight with people. I have come here for a purpose and I will continue to do that. And, I love their people.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Minister, we need not go into those details. Let us finish this off. Now, everything is okay.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) What is the point of Order, Hon. Eran Wickramaratne? ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Speaker, it is unfortunate that you were not in the Chair on that particular day and I am sure, if you were there, you would not have allowed it to deteriorate to that level. We are happy to hear the Hon. Ali Sabry making the statement he did just now. The issue really is, before him, the Hon. Manusha Nanayakkara, another Member of the Cabinet, spoke as well and he basically used the word "kotiya". I think we should get off this kind of politics as a House and respect each other. Our politics is not the politics of the Hon. Rasamanickam. We are making a wider point here, that the decorum of the House should be maintained and the Cabinet Ministers should set the example.

Thank you.

the Hon. Leader of the Opposition. Just now he uttered an unparliamentary word. Neither the Hon. Leader of the Opposition nor am I a donkey.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] It is an unparliamentary word.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Those unparliamentary words, whoever who used them, will be expunged. Whoever who used that, it will be expunged; that kind of words will be expunged.

.. ( . ) (The Hon. Premnath C. Dolawatte, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, please do not use that kind of words. You also used such words. Do not do that. We let you speak and we have never disturbed you. Why are you calling us donkeys?

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Hon. Speaker, just give me a minute.

Sir, I raised a Privilege issue regarding a derogatory comment made by the Hon. Minister and I appreciate the fact that he has apologized and withdrawn that comment. So, I would like to thank the Hon. Minister for that.

At the same time, Sir, the Hon. Minster said a few more things and I would like to clarify just two things; I am not making it a debate.

Sir, in 2015, I contested under the SLFP - that is no secret - and that politics was not the kind of politics which suited me.

2059 2060

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) That issue is over now.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Give me a minute. I will wind up, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Right. ( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) I realized what was happening within the SLFP at that time was not suitable for my people. So, I decided to leave that Party.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Give me a minute, Sir.

Hon. Minister, in 2015, the SLFP did not win a single seat in Batticaloa and therefore, the votes were not counted. You said I got only 3,000 votes. I do not know where you got the figure from. Those votes were not even counted. Sir, I stand by the people who elected me. The Hon. Minister said that I have given a single proposal. We have been proposing to devolve power for 75 years. We have proposed so many solutions for the issue of the missing people. But, when the victimized community does not accept the solutions proposed by the Government -

( ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Diana Gamage - State Minister of Tourism) Hon. Presiding Member, thank you very much for the opportunity given to speak on this very important issue.

Right now, the country is in a crisis, due to which we have approached the IMF and have got the green light to go ahead with the IMF Agreement, bringing about some trust among the international community about Sri Lanka, where they could come in and make investments back again. So, this is only a green light and I would say that going to the IMF for the 17th time would not bring about any good for this country if we do not have discipline. We are trying to get back to the normal situation, where Sri Lanka was before. The earlier system has not worked for Sri Lanka. What has happened is, the earlier system is not working anymore and it is not going to work either. So, we cannot get back to normal with that as a country or as a nation which has declared bankruptcy and we will have to do something better. Had we got back to normal under that system, we would not have learnt the lesson this country has learnt today. Even though we had been to the IMF 16 times before, we had not learnt a lesson earlier. Hence, we had to go to it for the 17th time. So, let us make this right and not look forward to going back to the IMF for the 18th time. I would like to say that we will make through this storm because, so far, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has worked tirelessly with the international community to bring about this change in the country. However, if we would not make through this storm, but we will, it would be because we have not gathered more knowledge from what happened, achieved a new skill and have been lacking discipline, which is something that Sri Lanka needs today. New national policies, economic policies and discipline are the only way for this country to go forward and also we must work tirelessly in the next few years to make this a developed country for the next generation.

. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed - Minister of Environment) Hon. Presiding Member, thank you for the opportunity given to me to speak at this historically important Debate.

The long-awaited assistance from the International Monetary Fund, often described as a bailout, was announced on 20th March, 2023 in Washington, D.C. The 48-month Extended Fund Facility will include approximately US Dollars 3 billion, out of which the first tranche of US Dollars 333 million has already been received.

2117 2118

[ ]

2023 2

At the very outset, I want to pay a glowing tribute to the Hon. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is also the Minister of Finance, for Sri Lankas success in winning the long-awaited IMF Fund Facility. He steered the loan negotiation process strategically, patiently and in a focused manner like a master sailor navigating through the stormy seas and safely reaching the shore. Only a seasoned, strategically visionary leader in the caliber of the Hon. President Ranil Wickremesinghe could achieve such an outcome and therefore, a larger part of the credit of winning the IMF deal should go to the Hon. President.

I stated in Parliament on a previous occasion, too, that the IMF deal has been an exceptionally hard task for Sri Lanka, given the magnitude of the crisis. We have faced an unprecedented delay and have been waiting for about 187 days to finalize the bailout after reaching the Staff-level deal with the IMF. That is, compared to the median of 55 days it took for the low and middle-income countries over the past decade to go from a preliminary deal to a Board sign-off. This situation created a lot of doubts and negative sentiments whether Sri Lanka would ever get through the IMF deal. On the other hand, various opposition parties, individually and collectively, created an environment of mass-scale agitation and unrest by getting the general public out on the streets to show the world why Sri Lanka should not be given the IMF loan. In the midst of all these challenges, steering the IMF discussions to reach a successful conclusion demanded much of the political wisdom, grit and acumen, which only the Hon. President Ranil Wickremesinghe could give.

Sir, it is true that the EFF of US Dollars 3 billion over the next four years would not by itself boost the external finances much. However, it would enhance international confidence in the country and enable the adoption of more flexible exchange rate policies which could boost exports and increase capital inflows and inward remittances. In fact, the IMF arrangement is expected to unlock a further US Dollars 7 billion of multilateral and bilateral assistance. Multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank are likely to finance development projects. They are likely to begin development projects; some of the halted multilateral and bilateral projects, too, are likely to resume.

On the other hand, due to the improved investor confidence and tourist perception created by the IMF Fund Facility, there has been an improvement in the countrys external finances in the first two months of this year. A balance of payments surplus of about US Dollars 2.5 billion is expected owing to the higher remittances of about US Dollars 5 billion and the US Dollars 3 to 4 billion earnings from tourism. Those two sources of external finances could bring about US Dollars 7 to 8 billion this year and generate a balance of payments surplus of about US Dollars 2.5 billion. Therefore, the significance of the IMF EFF should be looked at in the larger context of this "ripple effect", that it could potentially bring the Sri Lankan economy back on course.

Sir, now that Sri Lanka has won the IMF bailout package, I believe it is only now that we are entering the

most challenging phase of the countrys economic recovery process. The success of the IMF programme depends on whether the country would follow pragmatic economic policies and prudent economic management, eliminate corruption, undertake economic reforms and properly utilize the funds. These are difficult challenges, given the countrys political culture and social setting. We need to view this as an opportunity to break with past unsustainable policies and follow a path of economic discipline to stabilize the economy and achieve economic development despite the fact that the countrys political culture is ideologically against IMF involvement and reforms. This is where I want to ask those opposing the IMF programme to tell us what the next viable alternative is.

Several vociferous Opposition parties which have a few seats in Parliament are ideologically anti-IMF. They consider the multilateral agency, of which Sri Lanka has been a member for seven decades, as an agent of the capitalist West that undermines developing countries. They also view the IMF facility and reforms as a step towards further indebtedness and dependence on the West. This perception is also held by a large proportion of people who do not have an understanding of economics. In contrast, many economists emphasize on the need to follow the reform programme.

Sir, the road to economic growth and development is long and difficult; tough decisions and hard times are ahead. The questions we all, as Legislators, must ask ourselves are, could we make this IMF arrangement a turning point in the countrys economic development? and will the country make this a tipping point in the nations economic history to revive the economy or fritter away the opportunity for economic growth due to the political motives of some party leaders? In this regard, I would like to refer to an analytical report published by Nikkei Asia, a leading media organization on market behaviour related to Sri Lankas IMF loan. It has been revealed in that report that since Sri Lanka has maintained a poor record with IMF loans and has completed only nine of the previous 16 programmes and interrupted seven in the middle, this time, the loan was given on extremely strict conditions and with continuous monitoring. Therefore, if Sri Lanka loses this opportunity, there would not be a chance for the 17th application to the IMF. Therefore, as a responsible son of Mother Sri Lanka, I humbly appeal to all my fellow Parliamentarians, let us forge a strong political commitment and a broader political consensus that are needed to effectively implement the required economic reforms and explore the possibility for, at least, the two main political parties to come to a consensus as happened in India when they adopted an IMF Structural Adjustment Programme in 1991.

In conclusion, I must reiterate that the current spate of strikes, political protests, social unrest and discontent are not conducive to the functioning of the economy and for the upsurge in economic activity. Political stability and law and order are vital to achieving economic growth.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, your time is over. Please wind up.

. ( ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed) Sir, please give me one more minute.

Sri Lanka had lost two great turning points in the recent history. The first turning point was the opportunity created in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in 2004. The second turning point was the opportunity created with the conclusion of the separatist war in 2009. Now, we are at the third turning point in 2023, where we are trying to recover from the worst economic crisis in the post-independent Sri Lanka. Let us not slip away this turning point. Therefore, let us go through this painful and challenging reform process together for the sake of our children and future generations. Let us all strengthen the hands of President Ranil Wickremesinghe at this crucial juncture in the history of our country to take the nation swiftly out of this multifaceted crisis.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. S.M. Marikkar. You have eight minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) What about the MoU? ( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) The MoU is attached there. Please refer to it.

The thing is this: you have a personal issue with the IMF. So, I cannot sort that out; I cannot give an answer to that. Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, could you please refer to page Nos. 84 and 85 of the IMF Report? You will get all the details there. Once you refer to page Nos. 84 and 85, you will realize it.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) I have gone through it.

( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) No, you have not. If you have gone through it, you would not have asked me about it. I am sure, you have misled the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella also. The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella knows better because during their Governments, IMF programmes were implemented. You have misled him also. I am very sorry, but please refer to the pages I mentioned.

[4.02 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Deputy Speaker, we are taking part in the Debate discussing the Agreement with the IMF. Sir, you would be aware that ever since the country started facing this economic crisis and in fact, even before it became the crisis it is today, practically all Members of the Opposition, except for the NPP, were of the view that the Government should start negotiating with the IMF. That position was echoed by our party as well. When former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was still in office, our

position, as a joint Opposition, had been that the Government should start seriously considering going to the IMF and taking steps before the situation spirals out of control and that if we were to go to the IMF at a time when the country was defaulting, then the consequences would be far worse. It was the Government, except for the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe who was, at that time, seated in the Opposition, and all those Members who are seated in Government benches today who supported the previous President in not going to the IMF.

So, when the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe became President, one would have thought that it would be a natural thing for him to, in fact, galvanize the support he would need since he decided to go to the IMF and if that was the case, again the natural thing would have been to take the Opposition into confidence at every level to genuinely try and build a bipartisan approach. And in doing so, first, if the Government today thinks that the Opposition is playing politics in opposing or in criticizing the Agreement with the IMF, well, that could have been pre-empted. Secondly, there could be no doubt that the public opinion would also be that the best effort was made, the strongest effort in trying to bargain and negotiate was made. Instead, we had nothing of that sort. Despite the Members of the Opposition repeatedly asking the Government to table the Staff-level Agreement which was agreed upon quite some time earlier, the Government refused to do that and kept it a secret till the very end and now, once the Agreement has been finalized, is seeking Parliamentary approval; they are doing it in a way by threatening and saying that if the Opposition does not back it, it will weaken the hand of the Government and as a result, it will not gain any confidence internationally for bilateral and multilateral donors to help Sri Lanka recover. So, that is the basic argument, Sir.

As far as the Tamil people are concerned, our view has not been a secret. We have stated, once again across party lines, on numerous occasions that Sri Lankas economic crisis is not something that started yesterday or the day before, but it is something that was about to happen for quite some time. Quite apart from mismanagement and corruption which have contributed greatly, one of the main reasons why Sri Lanka is in debt and had, in fact, laid the foundation for the type of debt was the ethnic conflict. Sir, a country spending double the amount of monies allocated both for health and education by its annual Budget on defence means that there is something radically wrong and the reason why that is happening is because you are at war with your own people. If you consider the Tamils part of Sri Lanka, well, you are at war with your own people. So, you consider your own people enemies and for as long as you do that, you would naturally have to take the sort of steps you are taking, allocating almost double, actually more than double the amount allocated both for health and education together on defence by your annual Budget.

So, our view has always been that if Sri Lanka is to genuinely take a turn for a new beginning, the ethnic conflict has to be resolved. Without doing so, you are going to, again only temporarily, try and recover to some extent, but the burdens will continue and the sort of

2157 2158

[ ]

2023 2

potential that Sri Lanka is capable of achieving will never be achieved. We have, in fact, been taking up that position with the multilaterals and bilaterals in our own negotiations and talks with them. We have repeatedly told both those countries and other institutions that whilst they would be looking, in some way, to help Sri Lanka out of this mess, they must insist that Sri Lanka makes changes to what has led to its failure and that by not doing so, that recovery would not be sustainable.

Sir, going by the documents that have been tabled, clearly none of our expectations have been included. Maybe, the IMF Agreement is not something where the ethnic conflict should be referred to and in fact, there is a possibility that instead of including it in the Agreement, the Government has, in some way, been told that those efforts must be made because it is not a coincidence, I think, that President Ranil Wickremesinghe, quite soon after becoming the President, called for an All Party Conference to discuss and negotiate a final settlement to the ethnic conflict. So, clearly there must have been some linkages with that call and negotiations with the IMF.

But, if we are to assume that that was the reason why he called for those All Party Conferences, then one must also try and understand why, before those talks could reach its conclusion, he started announcing that it was the implementation of the so-called Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, some document which was signed in 1987 and which has been rejected by the Tamil people consistently as not being even a starting point to negotiations, that he expected to come out of those negotiations. You call for talks, talks are ongoing and whilst those talks are ongoing, there is an announcement to say that it would be the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution! So, as far as the Tamil people are concerned, Sir, no matter from which angle you look at it, no matter from which way you look at it, that process has been an abject failure, it has been a let down at every turn.

And instead on the ground, what we face is an accelerated Sinhalization project that is going on in the North and the East, where ancient Tamil worship sites and ancient Tamil sites which mark our identity in those areas are being destroyed. It is being done in a clandestine way as part of Government policy with the help of Government departments like the Department of Archaeology, the Forest Department and the Department of Buddhist Affairs; it is being done as part and parcel of Government policy. Court orders that had been obtained against these anti-Tamil, racist actions have been violated and it is the military and the police that is being used to violate those. So, what is the alternative for the Tamil people? We have been battered by war; for over 30 years, there was an economic blockade in the North-East; we are poorer than the rest of the country by at least 30 years and for the last 14 years since the end of the war, no government or whichever party that came to government did anything to try and protect the vulnerability of those peoples economy. When we pleaded saying, "At least now, you have to change and reform because you have hit rock bottom. Look at the past 75 years of failure in ethnic relations and change that since that has been the foundation for this countrys lack of development and

failure", despite our saying all of that, that is being totally ignored.

Today, I am a Member of the Sectoral Oversight Committee which reviews the actions of some of these departments, one of which is the OMP. The Government brandishes the OMP - the Office on Missing Persons - as a great success story to the international community on the question of reconciliation and transitional justice. The OMP, something that the Government wants to sell to the international community, has a cadre of 250 and we were told that only 28 have been filled! So, this is the way you do things. Everything as far as ethnic relations are concerned is a box-ticking exercise and nothing more and it is for those reasons, Sir, that our party has chosen to oppose this Resolution.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) ( . 10 .
