[2.28 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Presiding Member, our President has, time and again, made it a point to brief Parliament as well as the nation about his intentions and programmes to revive the economy. Today, we are discussing the latest address he made.

I must say that this country, ever since Independence, has been having a toxic mixture of both the populist policy decisions of different governments as well as an entrenched entitlement culture that we have been used to. So, trying to wean away the people from such a toxic culture is not an easy proposition for our new President. However, I must say that his current Colleagues in Government had been very critical of him in all his past experiences in office and his efforts to reform our economic framework. Now, they all have become strange bedfellows in praising the President and his progressive steps.

Sir, I have very clearly noticed that some of his attempts to increase revenue have also had some negative impact. If you look at the garment industry, today, with the tax threshold being reduced to Rs. 100,000 for people who are employed, the middle management in most of those garment factories have begun to feel the pinch and have started looking at other avenues of joining different employments abroad or seeking greener pastures elsewhere. Because of this problem, I am told, several garment factory owners have undertaken to pay their taxes to retain them. They have to either increase their salaries or pay the difference in the tax they have to pay. That is how some of these people are being retained. But, even with that, there is a large number of people who are now seeking to go abroad, crippling the money-spinning or rather, the foreign exchange-earning export industry, the garment sector in this country. It is true even for several other industries. Therefore, it is important for us to look at this whole issue. Even having lowered the tax bracket, I am sure, the desired results have not been achieved because it is having other negative impacts. Those also have to be addressed.

Similarly, now we have to look at the issue pertaining to the Government policy on attracting investment. I am now part of the Select Committee which looks into the need for reforming the higher education sector. Our report is to be submitted soon; our Chairman, the Hon. Minister

of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms, will soon be submitting the report. We are looking at ways and means of introducing some far-reaching reforms, where Sri Lanka would be made an attractive destination for higher education.

So, in order to do that, we will have to introduce some very salient reforms which may not be palatable to some of those people who are professing very extreme leftist ideas of not inviting foreign investment into the higher education sector in this country. If you are to attract foreign investment and to make Sri Lanka a preferred destination for higher education, it is important for us to have a very competitive higher education sector, where the State sector will be compelled to compete with private sector higher education providers. Right now, it is happening through the various affiliated degrees offered by private higher education providers in this country. But then, the accreditation as well as the quality assurance aspect of their degrees have been seriously neglected. That has to be addressed, unless otherwise, we will not be able to attract proper investors into the higher education sector, even if we liberalize the existing climate.

2023 22

Sir, today, we are taking part in the Debate on the Presidents latest address to the nation, where he attempted to brief the country with regard to the prevalent economic situation in the country and also, in particular, with regard to the steps that the Government has been taking in trying to alleviate the severe hardships the people have been facing and most importantly, in trying to revive the economy of the country at large.

Sir, in that respect, you would appreciate that when you look at the country in general, one glaring perspective that you cannot omit is the economy of the North and the East because the North and the East, unlike the other parts of the country, has been a war zone for over 35 years and has been severely affected. Even before this economic crisis happened, soon after the war came to an end in 2009, what became quite obvious and something that our party, in particular, and many academics, many civil society leaders based in the North and the East have been saying repeatedly was that the Governments since 2009 have failed the people of the North and the East and that particularly because they came out of a war situation after almost 35 years with an economic blockade in that area and where development was so severely stifled that they were not in a position to compete with the rest of the country. Therefore, it was imperative that the Governments took note of that special status and to some extent, protect the economies of those local population so that they could be given some time to safeguard their economy and to allow it to grow to a point where they can compete with the rest of the country. So, that was the the prevailing situation in 2009 and of course, not a single Government since 2009 to date took those warnings and the advice that came from the ground and instead, the people of the North and the East, the Tamils in particular, were thrust deeper and deeper into a situation where they could not compete with the rest of the country and went into a debt trap. Microfinancing in the North and the East was the first venture the Government permitted soon after the end of the war. So, you can just imagine the calamity those people have to face economically.

Most of these people in the North and the East, after the end of the war, got displaced, Sir. I want to specifically mention some places in Kokkuthoduvai West in the Mullaitivu District, particularly places like Sinnakulam, Mundirikaikulam, Amaiyankulam, Sampankulam, Thaddayamalaikulam, Parayanaru paddy fields, Sooriyanarayar paddy fields and in Vavuniya North, Kokkachchankulam and Kachchalsamanangkulam areas, where round about the end of December, 1983-1984, the military asked those people to vacate. The Sri Lanka military asked them to vacate those areas because they declared those areas a "no mans land" and that they would be far too vulnerable to crossfire. So, those people got displaced; the people of the entire list of villages I read out got completely displaced and could not go back. That was in 1983-1984 and the first time they were able to go back to those lands was in 2009 or 2010. The Government, of course, did not allow anybody to return to the North and the East because they kept them all in concentration camps in Vavuniya, as you will recall, but eventually, due to international pressure, people were allowed to resettle there. And, when they started resettling and when they went to those villages in Kokkuthoduvai

West and Vavuniya North, they found that their lands had been given away. Their lands had been given away to people who did not belong to that district; Sinhalese people who belonged to the adjoining districts have, all of a sudden, been settled in those lands the Tamil people had been cultivating for centuries, for generations. Even today, Sir, those families own permits for the lands. Now, nothing has happened with regard to these peoples lands being illegally taken away from them and given to others. At a time when they had just finished a war, when they were just trying to get up on their own feet after almost 30 years of economic embargos and when they came back wanting to pick up the pieces, they are deprived of their lands and are told that the lands are not theirs and someone elses. The demography in those areas has so systematically been changed that the consecutive Governments, since the end of the war, had made sure that their local government bodies would eventually change hands from being controlled by Tamils to that of Sinhalese. Sir, this is the reality that we face.

Of course, these Sinhalization projects that took place, pauperizing the local population who had already suffered for over 30 years due to the war, where their economies had been embargoed, happened in a blatant way under "Rajapaksas" because they did not care. Their form of Sinhala Buddhist nationalism and their form of racism made them not care what the consequences would be and what people thought about it. But, what is happening today? Sir, this House has been debating and several Hon. Members have been talking about it and in fact, the Hon. President had also talked about Kurunthurmalai "kadu" where, by a Gazette in 1933, 72 acres had been identified as archaeological sites. Sir, I am tabling* five documents which show that this Kurunthurmalai "kadu" was an archaeological site and at no point was it described or discovered as a Buddhist heritage site and the first time it was identified as a Buddhist heritage site, as a site belonging to Kurundi Viharaya was by a letter by a surveyor who was asked to go and survey that area on the 14th of December, 2020.

A surveyor who is not even an archaeologist had already discovered that this is Kurundi Viharaya. Not one document, until then, cited this particular site as belonging to a Viharaya. I am not trying to say, Sir, that this should not be identified as an ancient Buddhist archaeological site. If it is, by all means, it has to be and has also to be protected. But, what has happened? When courts gave orders saying that no new buildings should be built there, in breach of those court orders, the army went out to build a new Viharaya and now, 230 acres of land in addition to those 72 acres is being demanded by Buddhist clergy like Ellawala Medhananda Thero, saying that it is only the Buddhists who can be settled in those areas.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, I am winding up.

So, the original way of grabbing lands belonging to the Tamils is now being done in the name of archaeological sites and Buddhism in order to colonize and Sinhalize. This is the worst thing that could happen to a people who have faced a war and who are coming out of that situation when their lands, out of which they are trying to gain some form of income, are being deprived to them in this way, Sir.
