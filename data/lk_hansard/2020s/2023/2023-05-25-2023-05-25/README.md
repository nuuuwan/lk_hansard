1 ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) : 1 [11.41 a.m.] ) ( - ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa -Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Deputy Speaker, today, we all are gathered here to express our thanks to the outgoing Secretary-General, Mr. Dhammika Dasanayake. I would like to express a few sentiments regarding the departing Secretary-General's tenure in this Forum, where we all are expressing our thanks to his functioning and how he had exercised his leadership skills in trying to make the Secretary-Generals position an effective and efficient position in promoting a vibrant and functioning democracy.

Although we are using this as an eulogy to express our thanks, I would like to depart from the usual custom and practice of merely showering praise and to have a very objective and a balanced assessment of Mr. Dhammika Dasanayakes role as a bureaucrat who had worked within the Parliamentary system for 29 years as Assistant Secretary-General, Deputy Secretary-General and Secretary-General. I think he had performed his functions in a very difficult environment. I say this because it is his duty to advise the Hon. Speaker, administer the institution and also balance the interests, the interests of the Governing party and the Opposition parties, and ensure that the conduct of Parliamentary Business is implemented in a fair manner, that there is fair play. When I look at the way he has conducted himself in performing this very difficult, trying and arduous task, I think he has performed admirably. Not that we have not had criticisms, but, at times, we have been vociferous in our statements, both for and against his conduct. I want to be very frank. However, I think he had always tried to balance the interests of all stakeholders in this Parliamentary process.

We all know, Sir, that there are three main pillars which strengthen and enhance a vibrant and functioning democracy: the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary.

Therefore, it is very important that in a vibrant and functioning democracy, the role of the Legislature is performed in a positive and constructive manner. Mr. Dhammika Dasanayake, throughout his career, promoted, initiated and embarked upon various initiatives to improve the functioning of Parliament, the role of Parliament and in enhancing the functions of the Legislature.

We have seen that outside the Floor of this House, under his tenure, many programmes and initiatives were implemented to improve the Committee system, the facilities available for the Committees and to improve the Parliament Library, including its Research Service. I have always mentioned to him that a model for Sri Lanka Parliament Library's Research Service is the Congressional Research Service of the US Legislature. The Congressional Research Service provides thorough information, facts, details, substance which are indispensable for sound public policy decision-making. He took those suggestions into account and throughout the years, we have seen a vast improvement in the research services provided by the Library of Parliament, which is quintessential for sound public policy decision-making. In addition, I must also mention the support services given to Ministerial Consultative Committees and the Sectoral Oversight Committees, which, I am sorry to say, were redundant for a few months during this administration, which administration thought wrongly that the Oversight Ccommittees were not relevant to the democratic process. But when they were functioning, Mr. Dhammika Dasanayake played a very important role to ensure the smooth functioning of the variety of those Committees which played a very valuable role in the Parliament's function as a modern day legislature.

I also recognize the important role he had played outside Parliament and outside the country, especially with regard to the formation of democratic institutions in Afghanistan. He was crucial in providing the necessary models, the necessary information and knowledge in building up a new democracy there. I am not too sure whether those attempts were a resounding success, but we are proud that the Secretary-General of the Parliament of Sri Lanka, Mr. Dasanayake, was one of the main participants in the democratizing process that took place in Afghanistan and also of the role he played in advising Laos, specifically in terms of providing advice related to the Parliamentary Petitions Committee.

All in all, I think, throughout his career, he had used the vast amount of intelligence and knowledge he had accumulated in the academic arena. He is a product of the D.S. Senanayake College. Having achieved his LLB and LLM, he also accumulated knowledge as an officer at the Attorney-Generals Department and all that knowledge, I believe, had been used on most occasions to improve the functioning of Parliament, to improve democracy and to provide necessary advice to the Speakers of those times.

1115 1116

[ ( () : ]

We may not have agreed with your advice, Mr. Dasanayake, on certain occasions, but I think, considering your role as a person who had to balance a variety of interests and a variety of requests, by and large, your performance is to be commended.

Of course, we will miss your presence in Parliament and I know that you are going to be replaced by your able Deputy Secretary-General, who is now the Secretary-General of Parliament. I think both of you had the opportunity of learning and getting the experience necessary for the proper functioning of this very important position by engaging in that service. We will miss you, Mr. Dasanayake, on the Floor of this House, but I am happy to say that the Constitutional Council has unanimously decided that we need your services further as the Secretary-General of the Constitutional Council. It was not decided on any allegiances, favouritism or friendship but you were considered and appointed to that position because of your experience and hard work for 29 years and the lot of toiling to ensure that the functioning of the various positions you held was done in the most efficient manner. So, while we bid you farewell, I want to also congratulate you on your appointment to the Constitutional Council, an institution which once again provides checks and balances within the democratic system; it is meant to provide the necessary checks and balances, enhancing the principle of separation of power that we have in our tripartite system of democracy.

Mr. Dasanayake, I bid you farewell and wish you all the very best and all the luck! I would continue to insist that you provide your good counsel and impart your experience, and would even recommend you to write a book on your experiences as the Secretary-General of Parliament, which would be very important and vital for students of political science and the academic arena to understand the functioning of the Secretary-General of Parliament, how you saw your role from your vantage point with a very impartial recollection of your experiences.

I fervently believe that that would be crucial and vital for the all students of political science and democracy in Sri Lanka. So, all the very best to you!

Also, all the very best to the incoming Secretary-General of Parliament, if I may use this opportunity to congratulate you. We welcome you as part of the 52 per cent of women in Sri Lanka 's population. It is quite right that the role of the woman in society and in democracy is enhanced, but that should not be the sole qualification for this position. You also have worked under the tutelage of the outgoing Secretary-General and I would openly request you to follow the noble principles of impartiality and being balanced; try to balance all sides and all interests. Again, I wish you all the very best! And, I do hope that in recruitments to these various important positions, very sound procedures of recruitment are followed because all of you who are sitting there today hold a very valuable and impartial function to carry out. These should not be politicized. Whoever is in government, whatever the government is or whichever political party is in power or in Opposition is totally

irrelevant. It is of utmost importance that those who hold your positions are recruited in the most correct manner and we, as the Opposition, will have a hawkish eye on how those procedures are implemented in due course.

Mr. Dasanayake, again, all the very best and congratulations! Let us see you next time in the Constitutional Council. Let us get together and try to move forward in decision-making at the Constitutional Council, hopefully, through unanimity. I am proud to say that, so far, we have been unanimous in our decisions. We have had our share of differences, but let us try to be role models in a bankrupt country. Let us make sure that these democratic institutions - the Constitutional Council and Parliament - play a most substantive and pivotal role in extricating our country out of this horrendous and disastrous situation. All the very best! ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) 1 [11 00159] ( ) (The Hon. Wasantha Yapabandara, Attorney-at-Law) : 1 : : : 1 : :1 : : 1 1 : 1

I have had the honour and pleasure of working with the former Secretary-General of Parliament. I think today is the last day he is officially in this Chamber. So, I think tomorrow morning, he would probably wake up and think, What am I going to do next?

I wish to remind the House of the yeoman service he had rendered to this country and to this Parliament. I have

1131 1132

known him from the Eighth Parliament, the last Parliament and worked with him especially in setting up, monitoring and evaluating the Sustainable Development Goals, serving in the Chairman's Panel and in setting up Sectoral Oversight Committees then and recently as well. Like organizing seminars, lectures and study tours for Hon. Members of Parliament, there had been many things he had done for us. Right throughout his 29 years of service, he had been working with international organizations very closely, had been rendering his services to the Standing Orders Committee and I can go on and on, but I do not think I have time for that. So, let me join this august House in wishing you every success. For me, you have been like an older brother. I cannot believe that you are 60 years old and are retiring. There was also a suggestion that you should write a book. I think that is something I also can endorse with the wealth of knowledge and experience you have gained. Dhammika ayya, I think you should really do more for this country. So, I join all the Hon. Members of Parliament in whishing you every success in your future endeavours! It is not the end of a journey; I think it will be a beginning of a journey. My best wishes to your family also! Your great wife has helped us personally as well, I wish to have that on record.

Sir, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity.

[12.56 p.m.] ) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Hon. Deputy Speaker. I want to take the two minutes to appreciate the services of the former Secretary-General, Mr. Dhammika Dasanayake, the decade of service as the Secretary-General and another two in Parliament. Over the last 12 years, I realized the difficulty of the task of being in that chair. I acknowledge that Mr. Dasanayake tried his best to take impartial decisions, even though, sometimes, we disagreed with him. However, at no time did he come under physical attack by flying chairs or chilli flakes; you did not. Perhaps, that is an indication of the impartiality of your decisions. Given the time constraint, let me once again thank you for your yeoman service, Mr. Dasanayake, and reiterate the wonderful comments of my Colleagues during this Debate. I wish you the best in all your future endeavours!

I also take this opportunity to congratulate the new Secretary-General, Mrs. Kushani Rohanadeera, who is actually from the hometown of Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka and myself - Ambalangoda. But, let that not have any influence, positive or negative, during her tenure as long as we are in this Parliament.

As one last point, I would also like to thank the former Deputy Secretary-General and now, Judge of the Court of Appeal, Mr. Neil Iddawala, who is in the Speaker's Gallery today, as we never got a chance to acknowledge his services in this House. So, I take this moment to thank him also. Once again, let me wish you and your family all the very best! I hope you clean out the next-door property to my father's and perhaps come to live there, so that you can become my extended neighbour.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) 1 : 1

[1.59 p.m.] ) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, but I might not need all that time.

Sir, the Hon. President has met the Japanese Prime Minister. Acting Minister of Finance, why do you not stay for a little while because the way you portrayed the situation, it seemed as if it was our fault that we are in this deep mess, which, in fact, is not. Like I said, the Hon. President has met the Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and thanked Japan for the support extended during the crisis in Sri Lanka. Devoid of politics, we would like to reiterate what was conveyed and thank the Japanese people on behalf of the Sri Lankan people. And also, we appreciate the genuine cooperation extended by Japan's Ambassador to Colombo, His Excellency Mizukoshi Hideaki in all these transactions thus far.

Just to mention a few humanitarian support measures made by the Japanese people in the last few months, US Dollars 46 million had been given to purchase diesel for hospitals, US Dollars 6.5 million had been given for food aid through the World Food Programme in addition to the US Dollars 30 million which had been already given, US Dollars 1.5 million had been given to support women micro-entrepreneurs and others who faced violence during the crisis and US Dollars 4.5 million had been given for free fertilizer through the FAO to help some 250,000 paddy farmers to recover from the near fatal assault by Gotabaya Rajapaksa. By the way, todays newspapers report that the "dumb" decision by the then President fully endorsed by yourselves, who are talking here as if you were not part of this calamity, caused a 50 per cent drop in the paddy yield in the Maha Season in 2021! So, what are you talking, Hon. Acting Minister of Finance? You all fully supported those idiotic decisions. Now, you are coming here and looking at us, are saying this as if it were us who made those stupid choices. It is not us who made those. You have no right to preach to us, Hon. Acting Minister of Finance. We kept telling you, Do not take stupid decisions like this". It is because of the decisions you all made that people are in such misery today. Then, Sir, almost US Dollars 4 million has been given by Japan through UNDP to smallholder farming families to adopt green agriculture technology. So, the list goes on.

But, given the Resolution on international trade and double taxation avoidance treaties with the Czech Republic that is being debated today, it is more than apt to take a case in point that is between Japan and Sri Lanka. Sir, I want to take it in the context of the address by the President at the Nikkei Forum a few hours ago in Tokyo. The Hon. President Wickremesinghes Office has sent us tweets. One of those tweets states, I quote:

"President focused on trade integration and debt sustainability...."

And it goes on to state, I quote:

"... highlighted the importance of upholding rules-based multilateral trading systems with the WTO at its core."

1151 1152

Sir, Japan has always been a genuine partner in the development story of Sri Lanka, both through aid and more importantly, through investment and trade.

In addition to that, Japan came forward to co-chair the official Creditor Committee for Sri Lanka along with India and France and is currently discussing how best to restructure the almost US Dollars 7 billion official forex debt in such a way that ad hoc committees representing the international sovereign bond creditors and the China Development Bank, which holds approximately US Dollars 15 billion, could also follow the lead. Since the Hon. Acting Minister of Finance is also here, I need to however note the risk of mismanaging the proposed domestic debt restructure, which is renamed as domestic debt optimization. While all of that is happening with the support of Japan, India and France on the forex side, on the domestic side, if domestic debt optimization is mismanaged, it could lead to absolute calamity. Therefore, the Hon. Acting Minister of Finance should make sure that the stability of the Employees Provident Fund is maintained and its members are not, in any way, impacted negatively by doing this domestic debt optimization, which you, at the beginning, said will never happen.

Having said that, Sir, now, I want to make three specific points in relation to what the Hon. President said in Tokyo today. That is, on trade integration and debt sustainability. Yes, we can come to this House and talk petty stuff about some little gazette here or there and say that we are adjusting this or that, but it needs to go beyond that; this House must agree on what the future of this country is going to be turned into. Of the three points I want to make, the first is, this House must, at least now, understand and accept that trade integration and debt sustainability are absolutely strongly, positively correlated. The greater the trade integration, the stronger the sustainability of debt, if any at all.

The second point is that trade means both imports and exports, Sir. The rhetoric that we must severely restrict imports as much as possible and encourage exports is an absolute myth. I was shocked to see the policy of the Ministry of Industries along those lines. Even during the Hon. Acting Finance Ministers speech today, it is on those lines that he was taking this discussion. So, the ideology seems to be to restrict as many imports as possible and encourage exports, which is not the reality. Sri Lanka, at present, is one of the most closed - I reiterate "closed", not open - countries in the region. Our ratio of international trade to GDP has continuously fallen since the late 1990s. This is in complete contrast, Sir, to that of the other fast-growing countries in the region and States in India. In todays global production networks, closing borders with high duties, tariffs and in our case, complete bans are only going to give us one certain outcome and that certain outcome, Sir, is failure.

My third and last point is that such trade integration is directly correlated to foreign direct investment. We need foreign direct investment. If I am to be specific, we need to become partners in producer-driven global production networks, meaning integrating vertically into complex production with investments by established brands. Since the last push by President Premadasa, what have you done

to achieve this for the last 20 years? When our neighbours went from apparels to electronics, to biotech, we remained in the same place, took US Dollar loans for consumption and for useless ego-boosting projects of the Rajapaksas in Hambantota, might I add, and fell into a huge foreign debt hole. And you all, Hon. Acting Minister of Finance, supported completely those unwise decisions of Gotabaya Rajapaksa and now, for you to come here and pontificate to us is, I do not think, acceptable to any right-thinking person.

Japan, unknown to many, is a key investment partner in the fledgling electronic and electrical component sector of Sri Lanka. I would like to table*, Hon. Acting Minister of Finance, this table relating to parts and component assembly firms in Sri Lanka by Prof. Premachandra Athukorala, whom you also know very well.

According to him, Japan has invested in the most number of such mid-size firms in Sri Lanka. According to the HS codes, Hon. Acting Minister of Finance, the volume of exports in this sector is about US Dollars 500 million. But, if you really dissect the HS codes and put together these subcategories of HS codes into one unit, perhaps it is about US Dollars 1 billion. Those companies are, Esjay Electromag, FDK Lanka, Tos Lanka, Lanka Harness, Okaya Electronics et cetera and they are slowly, but surely making solid progress.

Sir, if we are to attract such actual and much larger investments, we must not treat the double tax treaty such as with the Czech Republic, which we are supposed to approve in this House, as useless toilet paper. We treat them as useless toilet paper. Why? Because that is what you all did with the Gotabaya Rajapaksa administration. Japan was working with Sri Lanka on a number of major projects like the US Dollars 2.2 billion LRT project, which included the land acquisition cost as well. You all threw away that Agreement even without discussion with Japan. As a Minister, what did you do then? Did you tell Gotabaya Rajapaksa not to do it? Now, you are pontificating to us. You were a part of that absolutely idiotic decision made. What did you all say with regard to that LRT project? You all said, it is a "very costly and inappropriate transport solution for metro Colombo; that is what was said. Today, the Hon. Minister in charge of the UDA is saying, The LRT is the best solution for metro transport. Did he hit his head somewhere or is it just pure political support for their own survival? What nonsense is this? Actually, Hon. Acting Minister of Finance, you first have to pay US Dollars 5 billion in claims to Japan through JICA for the cancellation of the LRT Project. Now, the Hon. President is going there, seeking assistance. He is saying, Come and invest in Sri Lanka, but you all are even refusing to pay the cancellation charge, which, originally, was US Dollars 5 billion and now, is close to US Dollars 10 billion, they say.

Then, what about the East Container Terminal? Now, you are calling out to investors to come here and invest. But, what did you do? It was a Tripartite Agreement that

1153 1154

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

we had for it between Japan, India and Sri Lanka. It was unilaterally cancelled; just like the LRT project, it was unilaterally cancelled. Now, you all are going around the world seeking investments. The President is meeting the former Prime Ministers of Japan, the sitting Prime Minister of Japan and speaking at the Nikkei Forum, seeking investments. But, this is what you all have been doing. The Hon. President actually openly offered the East Container Terminal to Japan. Tell me, if what I am saying is not true. But, have they responded? No.

In fact, the Japanese Ambassador recently said, which was reported in this newspaper article I have here with me, this: On the governance and transparency of the economic policies, in the past, there have been very frequent changes of policies that have caused the loss of trust by Japanese businesses. Loss of trust. Who can forget the Katunayake Airport episode between Japan and the Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation, who was sacked on allegations of corruption and reinstated in the same position? Is that the governance we are looking for? Is that going to build trust for the Japanese investors and businesses? I do not think so, Sir.

In conclusion, while, again, adding an appreciation to the Japanese people for their help during the crisis, I would like to say that what we really need for debt sustainability and growth, like the President said today, is trade integration. And for that, no longer should politicians hoodwink people. We must break down these protectionist walls.

In fact, today, Sir, I saw this news report on the "Daily Mirror" website, which states, I quote:

Country has no intelligent politicians to develop economy:...

Who says this? Indika Sampath Merinchige, who is the President of the Vehicle Importers' Association of Sri Lanka. This article goes on to state, I quote:

"Addressing the media, he said the VIAL has better proposals for the importation of vehicles into the country.

We can get help from Japan. But it is unfortunate that the country does not have intelligent politicians to hear our proposals.

Nearly 600 vehicles, including cars and vans, have been stuck at the port for two and a half years. We made several requests to the government to release them. The vehicles in the port are worth billions, but the government does not want to take that profit,..."

So, he is accusing you all of being unintelligent. And the Japanese Ambassador has said that we need to try and open the complete ban on imports. We understand that there are certain issues which we need to deal with and that those are temporary. But, you have to give a time frame. That is what the President has said at the Nikkei Forum, that we must use the WTO as the core of rules-based trade. So, as politicians, when you take certain decisions without analysing any data, this is what happens.

Therefore, Sir, I want to end by saying that we need to break down these protectionist walls. We need to build trade and investment bridges not just to Japan - as I said, I

took Japan as a case in point today - but also to China, India, the European Union, the United States and more. Let me conclude by agreeing with the Hon. Acting Minister of Finance. We have no issues with these Orders and Regulations published in the Gazette Notifications, which we have taken up for debate today, but we have to think beyond. Just saying, Look, we are adjusting the tariffs in such and such percentages for such and such vehicles which have such and such cubic capacities" is okay, but that is not going to cut it; those are just marginal changes.

We have to have a mindset change; we have to have an ideological change. I am happpy, Hon. Acting Minister of Finance, that even at this late stage, you seem to be agreeing with what we have been saying for a long time.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam. You have eight minutes.

1177 1178

[3.25p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I thank you Hon. Presiding Member.

Sir, I wish to bring to the notice of this House the incident that has taken place on 23rd and 24th of May, 2023. It has already been spoken by several Members representing the Jaffna District. But I also wish to put on record our position, since the Hon. Selvarajah Kajendren, who is a Member of our Party, has been brutally and illegally assaulted by the police. With regard to this matter, I wish to place on record what actually happened.

Sir, as you know, in a place called Thaiyiddi in the Jaffna District, there is an illegal Buddhist Viharaya that has been built. I say it is" illegal" because it is built on a private land. It amounts to 120 parappu, which works out to between 7.5 to 8 acres of land. These are deed lands belonging to fifteen families. When we first heard about this matter that the military had laid a foundation stone, with Shavendra Silva going to the North at that time - about two years ago, In 2021 - at the District Coordinating Committee Meeting, the Hon. Selvarajah Kajendren and myself took it up. At that time, the Chairman of the Committee was the Hon. Angajan Ramanathan and he was in Government. When we brought this matter up, he tried to resist; but eventually he gave in and assured the Jaffna District Members of Parliament that this illegal attempt to build a Viharaya on a private land will be halted and a full inquiry will take place. Despite those assurances, this Viharaya was built.

It is on that basis that the colleagues of mine along with the people of the area and the families that have been affected, started protesting on the 23rd of May and at that instant the police assaulted the Hon. Selvarajah Kajendren. These are documented. There are videos that are circulating in the social media and in the mainstream media; the newspapers have also carried it. Without proceeding to arrest the Hon. Selvarajah Kajendren - because it was a Parliamentary Sitting week the police would have got advised it would have been a direct breach of Privilege - they chose instead to arrest nine individuals that included an attorney-at-law, Mr. Sugash, and they were released only yesterday through court. The court in fact asked the police superiors in the Northern Province to carry out an investigation, an inquiry, into the OIC of Palaly for having behaved in the way he did. I am reliably informed that the OIC is under suspicion of several fraud cases and also a murder case.

These are the circumstances, Hon. Presiding Member, where the Hon. Selvarajah Kajendren and nine of our colleagues were illegally - unlawfully- assaulted in broad daylight. Sir, what is more important is the actions of the police.

We are told that the police are here to safeguard our interests. But the police have gone and got a court order

under Section 106 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, which is to prevent an imminent nuisance from taking place. So, what is this "nuisance", Hon. Presiding Member? The police have gone and got an order to protect an illegal Buddhist viharaya that has been built on a private land, in breach of peoples ownership of that private land, without even telling the court that it is under these circumstances, that viharaya was built. So, the police are looking after the interests of an illegality; and when the public and the Hon. Members of this House go to protest against that illegality, those individuals are arrested; those individuals are assaulted. These are the people, the Hon. Members opposite - who belong to the Government and the President - asking the Tamil people to repose confidence in when it comes to investigations with regard to wrongs that had been done to us. This is what is happening, Hon. Presiding Member. It is an utter disgrace.

The Hon. Premitha Bandara Tennakoon, who spoke before me, mentioned with regard to the economic crisis, that the corner-stone reason for the economic crisis is because of over 50 years of legacy of bad ethnic relations resulting in various armed insurrections, armed struggles et cetera. But, what was the cause for that? The cause for that was fundamentally one community that numerically was largest, choosing to usurp the powers of State for itself and completely disenfranchise those others who are equally and rightfully owners of this country. So, when you chose to behave in that way, people cannot just sit and watch. And when people react, you call that a bad reaction that led to the crisis that this country is facing.

Now, after the crisis has happened, today, whilst you make these words - whilst you say these words in this Parliament - your own very Government is overseeing through its military illegal acts that disenfranchise the Tamil people in their own areas, because of your own racist policies. Then, you sit here, and you make a speech asking, Do you want to repeat the last 75 years of mistakes?. You will repeat it. You will repeat it! Because you have learnt nothing. You have learnt nothing and this country will never get off on its own feet. You will go for the next 75 years; you will continue to go with begging bowls; sell everything that this country can claim that it owns to outsiders. That is the path you will take, because you would rather get a commission and watch out your own family than look after the interests of the people who get you elected.

Therefore, Hon. Presiding Member, I would like to urge that you refer this matter to the Hon.Speaker. It is a serious offence. It is an offence committed by the police. It is an offence committed by the police that have lied to a court of law; that have hidden to the Hon. Magistrate material facts in order to get this order under Section 106. Therefore, you must refer this matter to the Hon.Speaker and have this matter looked into, and a full inquiry is asked for.

Thank you, Sir.

Clarification of Fuel Station Business

We, SINOPEC, would like to address recent rumours regarding the fuel station project. It has come to our attention that there are unfounded claims suggesting that we have hired agencies to manage certain aspects of our operation.

We categorically deny these claims and emphasize that we have not engaged any external agencies or third parties to handle any part of our fuel station operation or related business activities.

Furthermore, we clarify that SINOPEC has no intentions whatsoever to transfer any right of the licence of fuel station supply to any other entity. We are committed to upholding the integrity and reliability associated with the 'SINOPEC" brand, and we reserve the right to take further legal measurements to protect SINOPEC brand image.
