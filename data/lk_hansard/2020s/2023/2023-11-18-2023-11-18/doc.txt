NATIONAL HYDROGRAPHIC BILL: DETERMINATION OF THE

SUPREME COURT ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I wish to inform Parliament that I have received the Determination of the Supreme Court in respect of the Bill titled National Hydrographic, which was challenged in the Supreme Court in terms of Article 121(1) of the Constitution.

The Determination of the Supreme Court in terms of Article 123 of the Constitution concludes as follows:

Clause 15(2)(c), Clause 23(3), Clause 25 and Clause 43 of the Bill are inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution and could be validly passed only with the special majority provided for in Article 84(2) of the Constitution. However, the Supreme Court has stated that the said inconsistencies can be ceased if the said Clauses are amended as per the Determination of the Court.

Further, the Supreme Court has arrived at the conclusion that the Bill, as a whole, and the specific provisions excluding the provisions referred to in above paragraph are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution.

In the circumstances, the Supreme Court is of the view that upon the Amendments suggested by the Supreme Court and the proposed Committee Stage Amendments being effected, the Bill and its provisions will cease to be inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution.

I order that the Determination of the Supreme Court be printed in the Official Report of todays Proceedings of the House.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, I wish to bring to your attention a matter which is rather urgent. Former Member of Parliament Jeyaratnam Sri Ranga has been remanded with regard to a fatal accident case and the remanding was done under the old Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act, which had been amended this year. All the witnesses under that previous law had been released except for Mr. Sri Ranga. His mother who resides in the UK is desperately calling us because his health condition is deteriorating. All the witnesses who were supposed to be protected under that law, under which Mr. Jeyaratnam Sri Ranga was remanded, have already given evidence. Despite that, Madam, he is not being released and his health condition is deteriorating. On several occasions, doctors have made appeals and there has been no referral for bail or steps being taken to produce him.

Therefore, I appeal to you, Hon. Presiding Member, to use whatever good offices you have with the Hon. Speaker and also the Members of the Government to convey to them the urgency of this matter. That poor lady who resides in the UK is requesting this out of desperation. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, I will bring it to the notice of the Hon. Speaker.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana. You have 15 minutes.

[4.46 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, I rise today as a Member representing the Batticaloa District to respond to the Hon. Presidents Budget Proposals for the year 2024 through the perspective and lens of the people of Batticaloa and our nation as a whole.

I speak today from a unique perspective. When our economy failed, our citizens descended on to the streets and our country went into an unprecedented turmoil last year, many speculated that we were a failed nation. I am standing here today having been declared elected to this House just last month. At that time, I was not a Member of Parliament but was, in fact, part of those protests against successive, failed leadership and the present elected Representatives. I bring with me the pain, the thirst and the yearning of our well-intended youth for a system change to build a better country for all of us from Batticaloa across to Colombo and from Jaffna down to Matara.

Sir, let me begin by saying this. The Hon. President in his Budget Speech, as he rightfully should, has been quick to point out the fact that since his ascension to the office of President, he has managed to revive our economy from its collapse last year. We no longer have fuel queues or quotas, power cuts, a food crisis et cetera. We are back where it was, at least, on the face of it; there is a semblance of economic recovery. We give credit where it is due: the Hon. President and his team have succeeded in this.

But now, we have to look ahead. How do we repair and resurrect our economy and our nation and how do we do so without making the same mistakes that had been made in the past? Even if the President has steadied our ship for now, we are still in troubled waters and by no means does it mean that we could blindly allow him to steer us out of it, especially when this Budget shows that he is slowly starting to rock the boat again. We are a democratic nation and we all must steer our ship together as one nation out of troubled waters on to the horizon, to the calm seas.

Sir, where we stand today is unprecedented in our nations history. As a nation, we have undergone tremendous obstacles and hardships since Independence 75 years ago, which are too many to list, but all of which converge to one singular common denominator: that is, the decisions that had been made by the successive occupants of this hallowed Chamber and those who had occupied the highest offices in our land have led us here. As such, it is not just the economic policy, the percentiles and statistics that should change, but our political culture.

The notion of an honest politician who works diligently towards bettering the lives of his constituents and country is unfounded; it is merely an oxymoron in the Sri Lankan context. Just last week, in public interest litigation, the Supreme Court ruled that two of our former Presidents and a former Finance Minister, all three from the same family, and Treasury and Central Bank officials were responsible for the desecration of our economy. We know that billions of our rupees and assets have been intentionally stolen from us and what are we doing to recover them? Where is accountability and responsibility and what are we doing to change things or make things better?

Sir, we have to be accountable to our past and that is the only way we can responsibly work towards stabilizing the present and building a better, brighter and sustainable future because our nation and the people who sent us here demand it and moreover, they deserve it. That responsibility lies solely with us, the Members of this Parliament. It is with this grave and integral responsibility in mind that I wish to comment on this proposed Budget.

At the outset, I must say that now, more than ever, our fiscal responsibility needs to move away from prioritizing politics, handouts and elections over sustainable, long-term economic growth. That has been, beyond reasonable doubt, the singular reason behind our economic failure and why we were on the brink of being a failed State. Never in our history have we accomplished this nor have we, as one Parliament, at least come to the consensus that we should focus on our collective fiscal responsibility to sustainably better the lives of our fellow citizens instead of doling out handouts, tax cuts and subsidies for the sake of getting re-elected. When looking at this Budget, I still doubt whether it was crafted with the intention of doing just that.

Apart from the obvious lessons we have learnt from the past, the first thing that I make out is, there is zero

1103 1104

2023 18

transparency for the public in the budgeting process. This Budget was prepared by a group of so-called "experts" headed by a group of unelected individuals - I emphasize "unelected" - who have received no mandate from the people, starting with our President who was not elected by the people, the Secretary to the Treasury, the Governor of the Central Bank and so on. Are we to trust and allow this group of people to put together a sound plan which will accurately and effectively address the burning needs and priorities of our citizens? We need to ensure that the Budget Proposals are transparent and are shared with the public. Citizen participation in Government budgeting processes can make a difference and ensure that the Budget reflects the priorities of the citizens.

Secondly, this Government is already struggling to meet the revenue targets set by the IMF for this year, projecting a 15 per cent shortfall.

The proposed revenue targets in this Budget for the next year are ambitious, and there are significant inherent risks with this. We have a record of fiscal slippage and revenue collection has been a persistent challenge. Will these ambitious Proposals actually reflect the reality based off the indisputable facts from the past?

Thirdly, the Budget sets a deficit target of Rs. 2.85 trillion, which is a colossal 9.1 per cent of our GDP. Then, where is sustainability? We have to focus more on reducing this deficit and our debt to address our long-term sustainable measures.

Fourthly, this Budget is seen as a means to meet IMF targets and maintain its US Dollars 2.9 billion bailout. This is irrefutable. While we look to appease the IMF, are we, in fact, appeasing the needs of the general population? A balance must definitely be struck, but not just by merely raising wages of the public sector employees; it needs to go deeper than that. The people are in need of an economic stimulus, not an economic handout!

My final point is exactly what I was saying from the beginning: this Budget is not a Budget for long-term economic reforms for Sri Lanka or the Sri Lankans, nor is it for the next generations of Sri Lanka; this Budget is solely to please the IMF and to elect Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe as the President of Sri Lanka once again. There is nothing in it which addresses the burning needs of the people at all, but all it does is raise our taxes and the cost of living, make an ad hoc raise of allowances to State employees and pensioners, provide lands for political mileage and thereby, kick start the election campaign for the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe. That is all. I urge all Members to please start thinking of this constructively with the mindset of building our country instead of our own political establishments. As such, I wish to oppose this Budget and to campaign against using the people's money in a manner that will drive us further into an abyss as opposed to the opposite.

Sir, having said that, let me take the liberty of speaking in Tamil as well.
