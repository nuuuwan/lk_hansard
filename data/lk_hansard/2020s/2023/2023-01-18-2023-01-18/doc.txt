This entire Bill, as a whole, is unconstitutional or inconsistent with the Constitution was the Determination of the Supreme Court. I am not sure whether the Supreme Court has made that kind of Determination on any other Bill presented to Parliament in its history. So, it is in that context that they had asked specific Clauses to be repealed or removed, if this Bill is to be deemed constitutional.

Now, the problem is, even with the revisions that have been made and presented to us, , . , , . , " " . " " . , . , " ..." . , ? ? , , . .

It is a huge problem in this country. Whenever we talk to people, whenever we go for any meeting, especially when we meet parents and teachers, the issue of drug addiction comes up. It is a critical problem in this country. The rehabilitation of those who are drug dependent needs our attention, there is no doubt about that.

But, where in this Bill that has been presented today do you get a proper understanding of what is necessary or what goes into rehabilitating those who are dependent on drugs? Rehabilitation of drug dependent persons is primarily an issue of mental and physical health. It has nothing to do with confining or punishing a person; you cannot beat a person out of dependency. You cannot confine or isolate a person in some institution and resolve or treat that persons dependency. It is primarily a physical and mental health issue. Yet, by the looks of this Bill, the way this Bill has been presented, the constitution of this Bureau is again a replica of the very militarized rehabilitation programmes that currently exist. So, rehabilitation is primarily understood as punishment, as something that needs to be corrected through punishment rather than something which has to be treated through a holistic health approach requiring a much bigger, much wider process which understands the social and the health-related aspects of drug dependency and the importance of rehabilitating those who are dependent on drugs. This Bill, too, continues with the model of rehabilitation which gives the understanding that rehabilitation is a punitive approach, a punishment for some socially unacceptable behaviour. We know that that has not worked; we know that our current programmes for the rehabilitation of those with drug dependency have also not worked.

Minister referred to my involvement in the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms, I would like to mention that I did participate in the discussion and pointed out to the Hon. Minister that we must have another Consultative Committee meeting to discuss the seriousness of the issues involved. And, it was postponed for that reason before the December holidays. Then, when we came back, we found this in the Order Paper. That is why - ( ) (The Hon. Anuradha Jayaratne)Hon. Member, your request was not regarding this. ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) No, it was regarding this. The Hon. Minister was presiding and I made a specific request that this Bill must be discussed in detail. But, subsequently, without summoning another meeting of the Consultative Committee, suddenly we find this Bill in the Order Paper. That is the problem because this Bill is replete with so many inexplicable provisions which might result in utter confusion. Actually, this is a ham-fisted approach by the Government. Look at the Cabinet Memorandum, the way in which the Bill has been drafted and the damning indictment by the Supreme Court itself. Never in the history of the Supreme Court that an entire Bill has been found to be unconstitutional, as the Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya says. ( ) (The Hon. Anuradha Jayaratne)Hon. Member, I do not know how many times this Bill has come before the Ministerial Consultative Committee. At all those meetings, there were a number of opportunities where the Hon. Members of Parliament could have expressed their opinions.

If I am to explain that, Sir, in the recent history of this country, it has never been possible for the Supreme Court to determine that an entire Bill violates the Constitution. This Bill was drafted in such a way, totally contrary to the purposes even of the Cabinet Memorandum, that somebody in the Ministry of Defence thought that we must include certain provisions so that we could bring in several categories of people who have been identified through a vague interpretation of the law and then send them to the rehabilitation centres which are to be set up. That is the whole problem.

If I am to tell you, Sir, globally, including in Sri Lanka, the approach towards compulsory rehabilitation is counterproductive when it comes to drug rehabilitation because it leads to relapse - we see withdrawal symptoms in drug-dependent persons - and various other problems. So, this rehabilitation has to be done through proper medically qualified personnel who run such centres. You do not involve the military in rehabilitation centres of this nature, to rehabilitate drug-dependant persons. This is why I mentioned at the Ministerial Consultative Committee that this Bill must be examined by the Committee taking time and that we should not rush into passing it. But, there seems to be some haste by the Government to try and set these centres up for some other reasons.

Sir, earlier, in the Bill, they had the categories of ex-combatants, members of violent extremist groups and any other group of persons, but all those were struck down by the Supreme Court Judgment. So, they have had to remove all that and they have, now, stuck to the drug dependency issue. Substance abuse is a rampant problem in this country, we agree. Rehabilitation has to be a curative process, not a punitive process. You do not compulsorily send such people to rehabilitation centres. When you make it a compulsory rehabilitation, what happens? In the Kandakadu and Senapura Rehabilitation Centres, how many times had inmates broken away and run out because of torture that takes place there and hard labour they are subjected to? The military personnel who are running those centres have found to be so insensitive sometimes and treating those inmates with such gay abandon, using so many other punitive measures. So, that has to be regulated.

We will finally become a banana republic by setting up detention centres to send ordinary people. Also, you will find ways and means. In this Bill, you are identifying a group called "other persons identified by law". Now, there is a serious suspicion that, subsequently, the Government could bring in a law to identify this group of "other persons" and send them also for rehabilitation. "Other persons" is a very vaguely worded group, an unidentified category. So, there is nothing preventing the Government from passing later legislations to try and identify such "other persons".

Sir, I already mentioned about the military involvement in rehabilitation. Then, what about the social stigma of persons who are being forcefully sent to these centres? Rehabilitation has to be a totally voluntary issue; entering these centres and coming out need to be voluntary. You cannot forcefully keep people in those centres without proper judicial supervision. Setting up such centres is also very harmful to a harmonious society. That is what we are saying.

Of course, substance abuse is a problem in the society, but we need to follow the international best practice in rehabilitation. What is the international best practice? The UN has been very clear on this; they do not encourage rehabilitation practices followed now. They would rather see that those centres are set up and run by properly qualified psychologists and medically qualified people. You do not allow the army and armed forces to run such centres.

If you look at what had happened in the Senapura and Kandakadu Rehabilitation Centres in the last several years, there had been frequent occurrences. Severe acts of violence had been reported and serious human rights violations had been taking place inside those centres. Now, you are trying to hide behind the hype that has been created by the media about drug-related issues and the overcrowding in prisons. But, this is not a solution for overcrowding in prisons. If you are going to do that, this Bill has to go through radical changes, in my opinion. Those radical changes were never discussed and there was also no sufficient time provided for the Opposition to discuss the serious gaps we find in this Bill. That is why we are opposed to this Bill.

Of course, there is a provision for the magistrates to visit those centres every month. The Officials at the Head Table who had been in the Judiciary also know that it is practically impossible. There are provisions in other laws also for the magistrates to visit prisons, but how many magistrates find the time to go and visit prisons with the caseloads they have to manage in the courts? So, that will hardly happen and even if it happens, it is only going to happen once in a month. In between, rampant torture will take place. Also, if you want to complain, you have to go through a laborious process and for the IGP to take a decision on that. Never before have we seen substantial inquiries being conducted and persons being convicted of torture. If we take the United Nations Convention Against Torture, we are a signatory to that, but if you look at the number of convictions, there is hardly anything we have achieved in this country.

This whole thing has been designed with some other motive. The previous speaker, the Hon. Anupa Pasqual, finally came out with the hidden motive of the Government; talking about burning of houses of the politicians, he virtually mentioned that some of the political groups are mentally deranged, that they need to be rehabilitated. Of course, unfortunate things happened during the civic unrest we faced between April and July last year. That was an unprecedented thing which happened because of the Governments totally regressive way of addressing the issues in the country.

As a means to control such civic disobedience, you do not need to set up rehabilitation centres, and that is why the Supreme Court gave you that damning indictment by throwing out the entire Bill, saying that it is unconstitutional. Taking the advice given by the Supreme Court, you have now limited it only to drug-dependent persons, but even then, there is going to be abuse. That is my argument. Even if you do comply with the Supreme Courts Order and have now restricted it only to the drug-dependent persons, sending them for compulsory rehabilitation is something that you have to rethink because that is going to create serious issues in the society since rampant abuse has been prevalent in such camps. And, we cannot become another banana republic which sets up these detention camps like in some of the countries where there is a one-party or a single-party rule. That is what is going to happen. We cannot, in a law-abiding society, set up such centres without proper regard

to the human rights norms in the country. So, the Bill was bound to be totally unconstitutional. Though you have complied with the advice given by the Supreme Court and have now limited it to one category of persons, even that category of persons will finally be subjected to very inhumane treatment in those centres, if you do not follow the international best practices to avoid compulsory rehabilitation and also to have medically qualified personnel - psychologists and others - to man such centres without involving the military or the armed forces in such matters.

Of course, you have provisions under the PTA to have a Commissioner General's Office for Rehabilitation. That did happen several times in the past and those camps were set up and certain psychologists and other medical advisers were also given. Twice during the insurgencies in the past - once, in the '70s and then, in late '80s - and subsequently, after the LTTE war was concluded, such centres were set up, where thousands of young combatants were rehabilitated. But, that was a different issue; do not confuse that with what happened recently. What happened from April to July, last year was a civic disobedience and you cannot consider them all deranged people and push them in to rehabilitation centres. But, that was your original motive. That is why you identified those categories as ex-combatants and people entertaining extremist ideas. Having been given that thundering slap by the Supreme Court by saying those are overbroad and vague definitions, now you have restricted yourself to this category alone, but even then, there is going to be rampant violation of human rights of those inmates. Therefore, we feel that this Bill must be reviewed once again. At least, I plead with the Government, refer it to the Legislative Standing Committee and let us look at it before you put it to Vote because this is a serious violation of the rights of the people.

Having said that, I conclude my speech. Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Anuradha Jayaratne)Sir, I need to clarify two things. This Bill had been taken up in the Ministerial Consultative Committee twice. For the first Meeting of the Ministerial Consultative Committee, you had been attending and you all had requested for another meeting to give your opinions. That meeting was also held yesterday. But, Hon. Member, you were not present. So, I do not think that is a - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. State Minister, your Government has called for an election. We are Party Leaders busy with the nominations. You called for a Ministerial Consultative Committee in middle of handing over nominations, which has to be concluded in two to three days. We are filing nominations all over the country. So, we all are busy and how can we attend the Meeting? Also, we did not know.

457 458

( ) (The Hon. Anuradha Jayaratne)Hon. Member, I totally understand that. But, submitting nominations and bringing in a Bill to Parliament are two different things. What I want to clarify here is, the Hon. Minister of Justice, Prisons Affairs and Constitutional Reforms has given the opportunity for you all to submit your opinion, which you have failed to do. That is the fist thing I want to mention here. ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Not to summon the Ministerial Consultative Committee - you do not have to do this in post-haste - but why did you not refer it to the Legislative Standing Committee? ( ) (The Hon. Anuradha Jayaratne)Sir, the second thing I want to clarify is this. I will not take much time.

On page 17 of the Supreme Court Determination, (b) (ii) clearly states, I quote:

the Bill is limited to the rehabilitation of drug dependent persons and such other persons as may be identified by law;

So, it states such other persons as may be identified by law, not by an individual, the police or any other party; it basically refers to the law. So, I do not think any problem or question would arise here as you mentioned. If you have the Determination, you can look into it, Hon. Member. That is, (b)(ii) on page 17.

( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Sir, let me read from the same Determination of the Supreme Court. Vagueness and lack of clarity in core provisions is what the Supreme Court says. The Determination goes on to state, I quote:

the answer that subsequent specific laws will deal with or define the persons who require rehabilitation is a dangerous route for this Court to adopt in the specific context of this case. " It further states, I quote:

its constitutional duty conferred by Article 123 in examining this Bill on the basis that a future law will fill in all the blanks of this Bill. Furthermore, in a constitutional framework that does not provide for post-enactment judicial review and only a limited time period for the challenge of a Bill, there is no guarantee that this Court will definitely get the opportunity to consider the constitutionality of such subsequent Bills.

That is what we fear. You say there is a category of "other persons" and then, we fear that there will be a subsequent Bill. The Supreme Court has foreseen that you are going to do something like this. That is why they have mentioned this in their Determination. That is why I am saying, please refer this to the Legislative Standing Committee.

The Canadian Government has imposed sanctions against two of our former Presidents. The reason, they say, is the gross and systematic violations of human rights committed during the civil war between the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE from 1983 to 2009. Also, they say that they have taken decisive action to end international impunity against violators of international law. Along with Mahinda Rajapaksa and Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Staff Sergeant Sunil Ratnayake and Lieutenant Commander Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi were also named in the sanction list. On 11th January, 2023, the Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, Minister of Foreign Affairs, summoned the Canadian Acting High Commissioner to Colombo, Daniel Bood, to officially register Sri Lankas strong protest against the Canadian Governments action.

This is a typical example of how a sovereign government could be influenced by recent immigrants from Sri Lanka, the separatist Tamil diaspora and the block vote of the Tamil community in Canada. So, I unreservedly condemn this act of the Canadian Government. It is a crass example of hypocrisy and double standards.

Then, I would like to quote from the Editorial of The Sunday Times of 15th January, 2023.

"It is good that the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) Secretary General, a former British MP, is in the country at a time when Canada thought it fit and proper to impose sanctions on two former Presidents of a sovereign country - a fellow member of the Commonwealth.

The CPA was formed to protect the representatives of the people in democracies and the preamble to its Constitution refers to the respect for the rule of law and individual rights and freedoms. It has also been at the forefront of formulating the Commonwealth (Latimer House) Principles adopted by Heads of Government that enunciate not just the separation of powers, but also checking the over-reach of the Executive branch (the government). He can make his own assessment if the Canadian Executive interfered with the role of the judiciary and upended the rule of law by imposing ex-parte strictures on foreign leaders."

I think it is high time for me to teach both the Canadian leaders and the UNHRC about Geneva Conventions and the type of war we had in our country. First, I must say that the fight against the most ruthless terrorist organization in the world, the LTTE, was not a civil war as mentioned by Canada, but a non-

international armed conflict. It was mentioned both in the Report of the UN Secretary-Generals Panel of Experts or the Darusman Report and in the OISL Report by the former Commissioner General of the HRC, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein.

As per the Geneva Conventions, the applicable law with regard to a non-international armed conflict is the international humanitarian law and not the international human rights law. It is also acknowledged by the representatives of the LTTE to the European Court. The applicable legal framework for a non-international armed conflict is the Additional Protocol II of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. Part II of Paragraph 2 and 3 of Protocol II specifies the types of violations.

The Rome Statute confirms that domestic laws take primacy over international law. Hence, only the offences which do not come under the Sri Lankan Penal Code come under international law according to Additional Protocol II.

Article 6 of Additional Protocol II deals with penal prosecutions, of which the salient features are, the accused has to be informed without delay of the particulars of the offence and only the person who has committed the offence should be convicted.

It means, command responsibility is not recognized in Protocol II. Also, according to Article 25 of the Rome Statute, a person who commits a crime within the jurisdiction of the court shall be individually responsible and liable for punishment. There too, command responsibility is not there.

Anyone charged with an offence is presumed innocent until proven guilty. Hence, the countries which rejected visa for the senior officers just because they took part in war and the Government of Canada, without proving any charge, have acted against Article 6 (2) (d) of the Additional Protocol II. Protocol II does not specify the punishment for offences. Hence, punishment should be guided by the Sri Lanka's Penal Code.

So, if command responsibility is not recognized in Protocol II and even in Rome Statute and if there are no individual charges against the two former Presidents, how has the Government of Canada found them guilty and imposed sanctions? I ask them, did you find that those Presidents are individually responsible for any human right violations? Where is the evidence? It clearly shows that you took this action just to satisfy the separatist Tamil diaspora for their block vote. It is a disgrace! It is also an act contemptuous towards the UN Charter and the Geneva Conventions.

Sergeant Sunil Rathnayake was charged on account of common intent. How can one man be responsible for common intent? Common with whom, when no one was around? So, that is the reason why he was pardoned by the former President on the question of doubt. If Canada is objecting to the release of a soldier, why did they not object to the release of an LTTE terrorist who was also given Presidential Pardon? Why is this double standard?

Against Lieutenant Commander Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi too, there is a case pending. Apparently, no solid evidence is there and still, a verdict is not given. He was acquitted in the other case.

So, how can Canada interfere in our Judiciary? They should be charged for contempt of court in laymans term.

Now, about Canada. There is strong information to confirm that a mass massacre of indigenous Canadians and Indians had taken place. I ask Canada, what have you done about it? Also, the French-speaking people in Qubec and the Aborigines are still being treated as third-class citizens there. So, how about their human rights? You had better ensure their human rights first before poking your finger into our affairs. Also, you have a notorious record of supporting other terrorists like you have supported the LTTE. You supported the Sikh separatist group fighting for Khalistan within India. An Air India plane flying from Montral to New Delhi was blown off killing 300 innocent passengers. Everyone knows that you have, not an indirect hand, but a direct hand in it. Does a country like you have a moral right to speak about human rights?

It is also hilarious to note that only two soldiers have been mentioned from an army of over 200,000 who took part in the military cum humanitarian offensive. The case of one of the two soldiers mentioned is on an incident that took place 20 years ago. Are we to believe that one soldier killed 40,000 people, as is alleged? The UNSG and diplomats appealed to the LTTE not to shoot the fleeing civilians. Why has Canada not mentioned LTTE war crimes? A plenty of witnesses have spoken about the LTTE shooting at civilians. Why has Canada forgotten that the LTTE put their injured fighters into buses and bombed the buses, killing all of them? Is that not cold-blooded murder? How can Canada forget the LTTE suicide bombings, assassinations of political leaders including an Indian Prime Minister, cold-blooded murder of unarmed civilians in villages, on buses and trains and LTTE butcheries inside Buddhist temples and mosques? It is laughable that Canada, which banned the LTTE and continues the ban on the LTTE, does not make a single statement on LTTE crimes or incriminate their fronts which materially supported the LTTE and are operating from Canada. Therefore, Canada will enter history books for having become a puppet of an internationally banned terrorist organization and which Canada continues to ban, but supports. Canada has made a mockery of itself in front of the world community.

Also, the external mechanism established by the UNHRC to gather information and evidence against the Sri Lankan Forces was an act contemptuous towards her own UN Charter and the subsequent inclusion of "economic crimes" in a Resolution that originated due to alleged human rights violations in war is nothing but hilarious.

Lastly, we have a few of our own local journalists who also toe the line with the separatist Tamil diaspora. D.B.S. Jeyaraj has the audacity to say, It also demonstrates that all those charged with alleged human rights violations,

war crimes and crimes against humanity are equal in the light of international humanitarian law. I would like to advise Jeyaraj, who is a veteran journalist, to, first, study the said Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions and the law relating to non-international armed conflict before trying to justify all the actions taken against our armed forces and the leaders. I also tell him, you should be aware that you and your family are now safe in this country without getting blown off whilst travelling in your vehicle or in a supermarket because of the supreme sacrifice made by our war heroes. At least show some gratitude towards them as a human being before you find them guilty with no evidence. I have not seen you write about human rights violations when the LTTE was massacring innocent Sinhalese and Muslims, including infants and pregnant mothers. You start writing about human rights violations only after our soldiers crushed the LTTE. On whose side are you, the LTTE or the peace-loving citizens? Lastly, again, I would like to advise Jeyaraj: before you write anything about this war, first, you had better consult intellectuals such as Mr. Neville Ladduwahetti, who has authority on this subject. He is a master in this subject. He writes very good articles to the The Island newspaper. Before you write anything about this war against terrorism, please consult him, go and study under him about non-international armed conflict, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Then, I think, we will definitely consider your proposals.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member)The next speaker is the Hon. Ishak Rahuman. You have eight minutes. [.. 3.19] ( ) (The Hon. Ishak Rahuman) , . . , 65 . 50 . . , . .
