( ) (The Hon. Speaker) ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Sir, it states, I quote:

In our view the 2A respondent has breached the public trust deposed in him in exercising his executive powers of the people in his capacity as the Minister of Finance in this regard by his failure to place all relevant facts with sufficient details in the Cabinet Memorandum when he invited the Cabinet of Ministers to make a choice between seeking assistance from the IMF and adopting a "home grown solution" at the given situation. As elaborated before, the following comment of the 30th respondent in his letter dated 14th September, 2021 addressed to the 2A respondent reiterates this position.

Similarly, as evident from the Cabinet Memorandum dated 2nd of January, 2022 and the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers dated 3rd of January, 2022, it shows that the Cabinet of Ministers has taken a decision not to get the assistance of the IMF. Instead, it was decided to have a homegrown solution to the fiscal and economic issues that were faced by the country at the time. Moreover, the said decision had been informed to the Parliament on the 10th of December, 2021 by the 2A (3rd) respondent."

; Some will argue here that you should not have retrospective taxes, that it is bad to have them. But, even in the USA, windfall gains are taxed; when people have an unlimited and unfair profit, then it is taxed. Sir, there is a principle of unjust enrichment in taxation.

The Sri Lankan economy has faced multiple severe challenges in the past few years that have contributed to its current state of economic recession. Some of the primary issues include:

1.**Debt Crisis**: Sri Lanka is heavily indebted to foreign countries and international organizations. Much of this debt is in the form of high-interest, short-term loans that the country has struggled to repay. The situation was exacerbated by the pandemic situation where the government revenue fell and the escalating expenses. "

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC) Hon. Speaker, now we must tell the officials of the Department of Inland Revenue, The ball is in your court. You have a duty, a national duty, to get your act together. Do not allow anyone to get out of the Income Tax net; bring them all in and collect the amount required for us to run a welfare economy in Sri Lanka because we cannot, under any circumstances, get away from free education and free health. For us to continue all that, we need to have taxes. If somebody is saying that without taxes, we could continue those, tell us how. That is what we also thought and went on and on printing money. Then, what happened? We saw inflation rising. Therefore, there is no other way than increasing the tax revenue. Now, we have made the tax structure, empowered the Inland Revenue Department and I would tell them, "The ball is in your court now".
