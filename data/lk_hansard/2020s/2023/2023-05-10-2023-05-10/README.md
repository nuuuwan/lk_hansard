, . , , "Erskine May: Parliamentary Practice" . 04 . 441 . sub judice . It states, I quote:

"That, subject to the discretion of the Chair,...

Sir, you are holding a very serious responsibility. It is a responsibility on the part of the Chair to uphold all the rules and regulations and also Standing Orders of this Parliament.

Erskine May goes on to state, I quote:

"That, subject to the discretion of the Chair, and to the right of the House to legislate on any matter or to discuss any delegated legislation, the House in all its proceedings (including proceedings of committees of the House) shall apply the following rules on matters sub judice:

1. Cases in which proceedings are active in United Kingdom courts shall not be referred to in any motion, debate or question.

a. i. Criminal proceedings are active when a charge has

been made or a summons to appear has been issued, or, in Scotland, a warrant to cite has been granted.

ii. Criminal proceedings cease to be active when they are

concluded by verdict and sentence or discontinuance, or, in cases dealt with by courts martial, after the conclusion of the mandatory post-trial review.

b. i. Civil proceedings are active when arrangements for the

hearing, such as setting down a case for trial, have been made, until the proceedings are ended by judgment or discontinuance.

ii. Any application made in or for the purposes of any

civil proceedings shall be treated as a distinct proceeding."

. .

Lord Hardwicke justified the sub judice rule as follows: "Nothing is more incumbent upon courts of justice than to preserve their

219 220

[

proceedings from being misrepresented; nor is there anything of more pernicious consequence than to prejudice the minds of the public against persons concerned as parties in causes, before the cause is finally heard." . . . . . ; . . - 100 - .

Sarath de Abrew Vs. Chanaka Iddamalgoda, Chief Inspector of Police . . Attorney-General - Supreme Court - ; - prosecute - . . . . . It states, I quote:

"It may be appropriate to quote the following passage from H.W.R. Wade on Administrative Law - 11th Edition at Page 259."

I think the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris knows this very well as he himself is an authority on administrative law. It further states, I quote:

An element which is essential to the lawful exercise of power is that it should be exercised by the authority upon whom it is conferred, and by no one else. The principle is strictly applied, even where it causes administrative inconvenience, except in cases where it may reasonably be inferred that the power was intended to be delegable. Normally the Courts are rigorous in requiring the power to be exercise by the precise person or body stated in the statute.

? " . " ? ? -Attorney General - . That Judgment further states, I quote:

" '..As the Chief Law Officer of the State, the Attorney-General has always exercised the powers with regard to the public interest, interests of justice and the need to prevent abuse of legal process. But what happens is that he takes sole responsibility in coming to a decision, in the exercise of his discretion, as to what amounts to public interest, interests of justice and the need to prevent abuse of legal process. It is in his taking this responsibility, that he is a master of his house and a law unto himself. Whether or not he makes any consultation is a matter peculiarly within his discretion, but whatever decision he arrives at is his responsibility.' "

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, please go ahead. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Hon. Minister, if you had answered this question before I came into the Chamber, I am sorry and just tell me that you did; that is enough. Why was the wreck allowed to be removed and why did we not have a physical hold on the wreck when it was within our territorial waters?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC) That was a technical decision. Of course, the expert committee took it. When we did a scan of the ship wreck with the support of the Indian Navy, we identified that half of the containers were still remaining in the wreck. The balance had drifted all over, in an area of about a five-kilometre radius of the seabed. So, our first priority was to remove the containers which had drifted all over

255 256

[ ...

because otherwise, it could have been a problem. Then, the second one was to remove what was inside the wreck itself, to safely transport them without causing further damage because those carried hazardous substances like nitric acid and all the other substances. So, the immediate attention was to prevent a further pollution. Because most of them were inside the wreck, a technical decision was taken that having the wreck in our maritime waters was not safe. So, they called for bids internationally. I understand that they paid about US Dollars 99 million to get that wreck removed because it was a huge ship, contained hazardous substances and was not safe for us to keep it there for a long period of time.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) But, we have no hold on it. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC) What is the point? That was a wreck which is not worth, Hon. Member.- [Interruption.]So, that was a technical decision taken after consulting the fishing community and all others. It was only a wreck by that time.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . [.. 1. 0 ( ( - ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa - Leader of the Opposition) . - .

Particularly, we are talking about a global climate justice issue and the principle of equity where everybody is equal. However, the Global Wests per capita emissions on average is much higher than that of the Global South. Everybody knows that; everybody accepts that it is much, much higher. These emissions are going to cause massive damage to the Global South even though our contribution to the emissions is actually limited.

Prof. Mohan Munasinghe, the Sri Lankan Nobel laureate, led the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. I saw him on CNN just a few weeks ago, in which he said that the excess emissions are 900 billion tons and when you compute it in dollars, it is US Dollars 40 to 45 trillion! That is the damage the Global North has done. So, it is an environmental debt that the Global North has to pay to the Global South and I think we, in the Global South, must make our case very clear that it is a debt they owe. They are always talking about the financial debt the Global South owe, which is about US Dollars 10 or 11 trillion, whereas their debt to the Global South is US Dollars 40 to 45 trillion! So, this is a question of equity. While there is no legal basis for us to actually claim it, there is an ethical responsibility on the Global North for basically damaging our environment, the Souths environment.

The President went to COP27. He took his team and went; I went to COP27 with the Hon. Harshana Rajakaruna, MP. It was in Egypt. What was the message given in COP27? The message given in COP27 was, the

Global North has a responsibility to the Global South. It has a responsibility, at least, to create a fund. Why are we pursuing the "X-Press Pearl" disasater? We want to definitely clear or minimize its damage. We want to create our own fund because we were exposed, very badly exposed to the effects of that disaster. Sri Lanka is an island and our sea territory is eight times bigger than our land territory. Therefore, we definitely need to protect both our territories.

Yesterday, I saw an article in the Daily Mirror written by journalist Yohan Perera. Quoting the Department of Meteorology, he reported, I quote:

The inter tropical convergence and the increased temperature in the sea will give rise to current atmospheric disturbances and cyclonic storms in Sri Lanka.

This was reported in yesterdays newspaper, warning us that we are at risk. Why are we at risk? Why is the global temperature going up? That is because of the emissions which have gone on for years and years.

The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka also issued a statement yesterday. I am going to quote from that statement.

X-Press Pearl disaster did have an immense impact on the environment both on land and in territorial waters, economically and potentially although not quantified on the health of affected communities of Sri Lanka.

It was for Sri Lanka the largest maritime and man-made environmental disaster of its kind....

I repeat, It was for Sri Lanka the largest maritime and man-made environmental disaster of its kind. I would say, it is one of the biggest in the world.

...and comparably so internationally in particular as regards the pollution caused by the immense quantity of both toxic nurdles, and nitric acid awash in the ocean and along the coastal belt. These had both immense economic ramifications and health considerations.

I did not want to discuss all the details of the X-Press Pearl disaster because of the request that has been made. But, why are we thinking that we are undermining the case by that being heard in Singapore? Does sub judice rule apply to Parliament? Under Constitutional and Administrative Law, as we have heard, the legal principle of the supremacy of Parliament prevails. The whole doctrine of sub judice is in question worldwide. Furthermore, are you suggesting that the Judiciary in Singapore is incapable of discerning between the legal principles, evidence and fiction? Our argument that the case could be instituted in Sri Lanka was not based on the capability of the judicial system in Singapore or because we do not have trust in it.

We do. But, why have we been objecting to it being heard in Singapore? It was based on three simple things and I am going to conclude with that. The first is, for undermining Sri Lankas sovereignty in a crime committed in the Sri Lankan territorial waters. It would be normal and regular to have instituted proceedings here. The second is, it is not only a matter of legality, but

a political philosophy as well. The third is, you have undermined our legal and judicial capability. Therefore, is it the correct thing that you have done?

An article which appeared in the "Forbes" Magazine of 24th November, 2020 states, I quote:

The oil spill in Mauritius in August has had lawyers scrambling through their maritime insurance libraries to understand the implications of the incident, caused by the Japanese bulk carrier, ... Lloyds insurance I quote:

It is unacceptable for a poor third-world government only to receive tens of millions of dollars in compensation for a clean-up that will cost hundreds of millions of dollars to undertake,...Even if that is legally right, it is morally wrong. There are questions about whether the Lloyds opinion piece on the legality of liability is accurate.

Then, why do you adopt two policies on two different issues? On the issue of missing people, on bringing justice for those people who had lost their lives in the last stages of war, you adopt one position, where you do not want to go to foreign courts, you do not want the intervention of foreign judges. But, when it comes to a matter you want to get away from - we feel the Government wants to get away from it - you run to a foreign country and a foreign judge.
