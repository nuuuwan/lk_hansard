Hon. Chairman, I want to start my speech by referring to what happened in Parliament yesterday, which, I thought, was an absolute disgrace. When a Bill or a proposal is brought before Parliament, a government can always get it approved because a government, by the definition of itself, normally has a majority and can get it passed. Then, the whole point of having a Parliament and a debate is to hear out the views of the Opposition, to see what their proposals and amendments are, and to either accept or reject them, a Vote in Parliament is actually called for. Therefore, I thought it was an absolute disgrace as that process was not really followed even if it was a very important Bill.

Sir, I would like to mention that the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act talks about freedom of speech and debate. In Section 3 it states, I quote:

There shall be freedom of speech, debate and proceeding in Parliament and such freedom of speech, debate or proceedings shall not be liable to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament."

This is not about the freedom of an individual, but about the freedom and the Privilege of the House to actually debate a very important Bill. Why do I say that it is important? I say it is important because the Government revenue originally estimated to be Rs. 3.4 trillion in the Budget last year is now estimated to come down to Rs. 2,851 billion; it has come down. Then, the new Budget Proposals state that the estimated revenue in 2024 would be Rs. 4,127 billion. So, the difference between the actual revenue in 2023 and the estimate for 2024 is Rs. 1,276 billion. Out of this increment, 56 per cent or more than half of it will come from the VAT, which would be Rs. 720 billion. That is why this Debate is absolutely important, though it was not permitted and it is a disgrace that it was not permitted. The International

Monetary Fund, in its Governance Diagnostic Assessment, talked about this kind of situation; the civil Society in this country talks about governance diagnostics. Why? Because it is a matter of process, not something about numbers and budgets. That process must be followed; that is good governance. But, unfortunately, Hon. Chairman, you did not follow the proper process, actually permitting a debate on this subject; a debate should have been held on this subject. And, this is what the IMF is talking about with regard to governance diagnostics.

[11.45 a.m.] ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe - President, Minister of Defence and Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies) Hon. Chairman, in fact, I asked for a note from the Ministry and they say, However, service providers such as PickMe, Uber, Daraz et cetera do not fall within the ambit of the IT sector and they were not exempt from Income Tax or VAT.

Sir, I would like to say a few more words about that sector and finish my speech. There have been questions on VAT being applied at 18 per cent on this whole sector. I would like to say that IT services provided to persons outside Sri Lanka, for which payments are received in foreign currency, are exempt from Income Tax. The supply of IT services was liable to VAT until 31st December, 2019 and was exempt from VAT only from 01st of January, 2020. IT services will be liable for VAT, effective from 01st January, 2024 by the new Amendment. However, making IT services liable for VAT will not become a burden to the industry since those IT companies are export-oriented and export of IT services is a zero-rated supply. Furthermore, even in India, the GST rate for all kinds of IT software supply services and products are 18 per cent. We have decided, as a policy, to increase the VAT up to 18 per cent. Then, it must apply to all sectors; you cannot exempt some sectors and apply it to others.

Now, many in the IT sector have said that they can go ahead, provided certain assistance is given to them. Some of the others are complaining, but they have always been complaining. When we tried, in 2003, to bring the Tata Group in to digitalize the revenue collections and the home affairs services, they all complained. But now, they say they can do it. To date, we have had nothing. Now, we are still piggybacking on Aadhaar system after 20 years. Similarly, when we started this in 2015, there was a big debate as to whether you need foreign personnel and that was the biggest debate, not how we should increase it. Finally, there were no foreign personnel. Half the people who shouted then are now leaving the country. So,

we are having a serious dearth of experienced people. What we are doing now is, if any company wants people from abroad, we would allow it. We are going to train more people, but that would not, in fact, resolve the issue created after those trained, experienced people left the country. So, if a company wants foreign personnel brought down, we will let them come in. Whatever we have collected by increasing VAT from 15 to 18 per cent will come back to the sector because there is Rs. 1.5 billion kept aside for research on AI and another Rs. 8 billion for all other technological research, of which, I am sure, this sector should take anything from Rs. 1 to 2 billion or about Rs. 3.5 billion. What we are doing is, we are shifting emphasis on to research and helping research. If you look at the potential of the IT industry, even SLASSCOM usually talks of a revenue of US Dollars 5 billion. We have not reached US Dollars 2.5 billion yet. I think you can go up to about US Dollars 7 billion. So, were they to go ahead, the Government is prepared to support them. We are moving very fast towards digitalization and we will be looking in the next 2 to 3 years to do that. We will go piggyback on India and then, let us develop it. So, the whole digital sector will expand. You may have to pay an 18 per cent VAT, but you are going to expand that sector here in Sri Lanka and that is development. Then, we have to send out the personnel who are required. Especially on artificial intelligence, the Government has focused because AI is the future and we should expand on it.

We should expand on artificial intelligence. Otherwise, we will be competing with Myanmar to have low-income, low-wage manufacturing.

So, the new agency will be the Digital Transformation Agency, and they will do the policy work. Like ICTA, they will not get involved in project management. That was built - I think the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne knows that - and was to be there for 10 years, and then they kept extending it. But, now, you need a new agency and within that there will be the AI centre. The other one is the Digital Technology and Innovation Council, which will look at commercializing innovations in the field of technology. They are the people who will use that Rs. 8 billion, of which a part would go for research in IT and the rest for the other sectors. So, they will certainly work on this field.

The National Science Foundation will purely be for research and we will make some of the monies available for that Foundation. So, there would be money available. Nearly nine-and-a-half billion rupees would be available next year for research. We have never made that much of money available for research; it is for the first time that that much of money would be available because we have to become a country which has a strong science and technology base. We cannot survive without it.

Connected to that is agricultural modernization. Modernization of agriculture is, again, increasing productivity and applying of technology. We are going to apply technology to agriculture and part of this money would be available for the application of technology in agriculture. We have a limited land space available. So,

3771 3772

[ (

2023 ) 12

we have to use it to the maximum. To maximize our output, we must also use technology. That is the second area and we are bringing in the University of Colombos Institute for Agro-technology and Rural Sciences, which will update the research institutions and work to back up the modernization scheme in Sri Lanka. We are combining the private sector and the public sector together. In most areas, whether it be tea, paddy or other crops, our productivity is low. So, we have to increase productivity. Then, there are problems, as you know, with regard to rubber. There are many issues that we have to resolve in the rubber sector.

The third area we are looking at is renewable energy. Sri Lanka has a vast potential for renewable energy. We are only looking at net zero for Sri Lankas supply. But, that is not what we have to look at; we have to look at the total potential available. They are talking of 30 to 40 gigawatts generated just by wind. The Minister told me that the Ministry has estimated that about 200 gigawatts could be generated by solar power, but that is without the share from rooftop solar panels. Then, that would virtually double it. So, we have potential for all this energy, which would be more than we really require. We could sell some of it to India through connectivity. Then, we also have to go for green hydrogen and green ammonia, which would also help the Colombo Port because green hydrogen would be used by the shipping industry. So, we have this tremendous potential, on which we have to do research to be ahead. I have already spoken with Germany on helping us with green technology and similarly with France, as to how they have established green industries. We also have the Australian private sector advising us. Australia wants to be a green hydrogen superpower. So, we are working with them. We have the potential to export. India can make green hydrogen more than us, but they can never export them since all that capacity is needed locally. China also can make more than us, but they, too, need that capacity locally. But, we are one of the countries which could export renewable energy.

Then, we must also apply technologies to industry for our manufacturing. The best example is 3D printing. The 3D printing is going to come into effect. So, we have to be ahead in that. There are so many other areas of technology that we have to get into. We must, somehow or other, get into those. In the next five or six years, we have to establish ourselves in that sphere and in the next decade, say, by 2035, we should be known as a leading country in technology. Our survival depends on it. In the olden days, we had achieved that position. We were the top country in engineering; no one could beat us on engineering. Our structures were, sometimes, better than those of the Egyptians who built pyramids.

We did not build pyramids; we built semi-circular dagobas, which were far more difficult to build. We had built forts like Sigiriya, which has an amazing hydraulic system. So, look at the combination we had in engineering, that no other country could show any constructions with all that. The only other country which had those skills had been China; China and us. We are a small country, but we have the potential.

Look at the number of students who pass the G.C.E. (A/L) Exam. But, they all cannot go to universities. So, we have to have more places created for them. Therefore, in addition to the existing universities, we will be starting some more new universities. The KDU will be expanded and they will start two affiliated universities. That is, the Technology University of Kurunegala and the Science and Technology University of Sitawaka. In addition, the NSBM will also become a university. We are talking with India about establishing a campus of the IIT Madras in Chennai, which can become an independent institution in time to come. Those universities are for science and technology; they would not teach any other subject other than, maybe, management. Then, we are looking at a third university to be established with foreign assistance and we are discussing about that. So, the Government would start, at least, four universities and finally, we will have altogether five with the Indian campus. Then, there will be other non-government universities as well. So, we want to ensure that universities are expanded and we are making amendments to the law, to which all of us agree, to allow non-government universities to come in and foreign universities to establish their campuses here. But certainly, emphasis would be on management and technology; that is the area we hope to focus on. That way, we hope to produce more and more qualified people. The existing universities will also expand their numbers in this field. So, we are setting the ground for a transformation into science and technology. The biggest modern-day transformation we had had was under President J.R. Jayewardena when we did the Mahaweli Development Programme and two Free Trade Zones. I think what we are going to do now would be much bigger than what happened at that time. That is why we want everyone to cooperate with us. Whether you are in the Opposition or in the Government, whether you want to join me or not, let us all get together and have a scientific, technological revolution in this country.

Then, with regard to investments, we would bring in laws which would make the necessary changes sometime in January or February. The BOI and the EDB would be scrapped and would be replaced by the Economic Commission, which would draw investments in to all the fields in the country. It would be done quite differently from what we are doing now. I will brief the Members of the House at that time. The industrial estates and investment zones would be separated. Then, there would be an Investment Infrastructure Corporation which would set up the investment promotion zones. We would allow the private sector or the Government to do it and all of them would be registered as public companies. Then, they would provide the services. The Corporation will oversee and regulate those investment zones. There would also be an International Trade Centre, which would deal with international trade. Those three institutions would be connected to each other and that is basically going to be the new structure for foreign investments.

Then, we are looking at amending the Colombo Port City Economic Commission Act to make the Port City

into a Financial City. We have got the draft from Shearman & Sterling LLP; they have updated it and are doing the regulations. All of you will be able to go through the new draft, which will make provisions for offshore financing.

So, I thought I would inform you all of what the Government is hoping to do and we want to start all that next year. I hope we could depend on all your cooperation, whether you are in the Government or in the Opposition, to go ahead and implement these. I am happy in a way that I have been able to do these. One day, when I was Minister of Industries during the time of President Premadasa, he summoned me and asked, Why do you not take over the Ministry of Science and Technology? I told him, Sir, I am a lawyer, not a scientist." Then, he said, "It does not matter, you take it over. So, I was able to do a lot of work there and I am happy that I have, again, the opportunity of holding the same Ministry.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Thank you very much, Hon. President, for your presentation with regard to investment and technology. I just have one or two queries, if I may explore you.

Your attempt to increase the number of universities in the technology field and elsewhere is a good proposal and a good attempt to enhance technological education in Sri Lanka. However, I want to bring to your notice that right now, in the State university system, where we are supposed to have 12,000 teaching personnel, whether it be professors, lecturers and so on and so forth, the cadre provision is 8,000, but presently, the numbers hover around 5,000 because a large number of them have gone for international internship programmes and also on sabbaticals. Hon. President, I can understand your intention, improving the number of students, but however, we need to find the relevant teaching personnel as well.

When we spoke with academics - doctors, engineers, software engineers and so on and so forth - one of the main reasons they gave for this brain drain was this present APIT or the PAYE Tax, that this tax is structured in a manner that those skilled personnel - in this case, the teachers - are overtaxed. I will give you one example, Hon. President. When I posed this question to the Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya - actually, the Governments target of APIT was to raise Rs. 100 billion - he himself admitted that they had already raised Rs. 107 billion. The estimated revenue from the APIT as at 31st December is Rs. 150 billion. So, there is a clear case of overtaxation. Therefore, I would like you to pay attention to that matter and try to remedy the situation. Otherwise, the brain drain will be accelerated.

The second issue, Hon. President, is that when you increase the number of students without increasing the number of teachers, the student: teacher ratio becomes a

muddle, the ratio becomes very big. When that happens, the international ratings of our universities are downgraded. I can give you two examples. The University of Peradeniya and the University of Colombo, which hovered earlier among the top 500 in those rankings, have now been downgraded beyond the thousand level, I believe to the level of the 1,200 universities. That is because the brain drain has impacted on this situation with the teachers going abroad.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) , 0 ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) And, the last thing I want to point out is this. Hon. President, you may increase the number of students, but they do not have the facilities in universities. You need to give them human resources, physical facilities and equipment in order to make sure those universities are of high standards. So, I just wanted to raise those issues since you are here. Thank you for your presentation, Hon. President.

Hon. Presiding Member, it was really Charles Babbage who, in 1860, invented the analytical engine that was actually known as the first computer. So, with that, technological advancement really started in terms of computers and digital technology. Today, Sir, the buzzword is "artificial intelligence" - 0 Leading nations such as the United States and China led their economic growth based on modern technology. The two Ministries that are being debated today are most important, the Cabinet Minister of which is none other than the Hon. President.

Countries like China have now developed technology to be used in transportation. There is a speed train in China which does over 425 kilometres an hour. Sir, I was fortunate enough to be in Estonia recently. They have a very small population of only about 1.3 million, but they are completely technology-based. From the time of a persons birth in hospital until his death certificate is issued, they use technology; all that is done online. Once they are registered on their Government App, Hon. State Minister, they do not need anything else. Even in terms of getting married, registration and all that is done via this App. Their technology is so advanced that, for example, if you want to go for fishing, the App asks you, "Do you require a fishing licence?" So, it is that advanced.

Therefore, with this technology, a tool for anti-corruption could be adopted by your Ministry. We are talking in Parliament about various acts of corruption, corrupt deals that had taken place and tenders that had not been correctly awarded. All these could be rectified, if we look at adopting technology as a mode for anti-corruption. Hon. State Minister, my father had worked very closely with your father. I am happy that you are handling a Ministry of this nature. I wish you success but, at the same time, a lot of work has to be done and I think being a young State Minister, you are capable of doing that. I think you have got a staff that supports you. So, again, let me wish you every success.

When talking of technology and Estonia, today, another country which is using technology even for its war is Ukraine. Ukraine has an App of this nature that they have developed and they are able to fight the war today using that App. That App is used not just for what it was created, but in terms of giving information to people about the war situation. So, they are able to fight with a superpower like Russia, not just because they have the military capabilities, but also technological advancement.

If you look at India, for example, they had allocated 1.5 per cent of their GDP on technology in the 2023 Budget. Then, countries like Singapore, Korea and even

3847 3848

[

2023 ) 12

the Middle East use technology now. I know that, mostly, the income of the Middle Eastern countries come from oil, but countries like Dubai, for example, do not solely depend on oil, but also uses technology in terms of their development. They have set up free trade zones and made technological advancement by investing in technology.

So, for Sri Lanka also to progress into the next stage, I think we have to look at the technology aspect, which, I think, is the most important when it comes to education and health. I would rank the Ministry of Technology as one of the most important Ministries in the country right now, especially given our economic situation.

One might easily think that investing in technology at this time is foolhardy because of our economic situation, but actually, it is the other way round. Because we are in this situation, we have to invest in technology, we have to develop the Apps that are required, we have to be transparent and have to ensure that democracy is preserved. In doing so, one tool that the Government can use, Sir, is technology. I am not saying that technology is the answer to all our problems, but certainly, technology could be used in that way. In our country, for example, we are still using the same National Identity Card ID Card that was used 40 or 50 years ago. We could have a smart ID Card in this country, which could be used to board a train, for transportation or when you enter a government office or a building. Even in this Parliament, for example, , biometrics 0 But, biometrics is only one aspect of technology. There are so many other aspects of technology we could use.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) )0

0 RAMIS 0 , 0 software 0 update 0 ) , ) 0

) 0 0 , VAT 0 VAT ICT industry 0 , when they impose the VAT, monitors, laptops and all other appliances will get taxed and a black market will be created. So, with that black market, you will have another problem created. Therefore, Hon. State Minister, I urge

you again to speak with the Cabinet and ensure that this VAT on technology industry is somewhat removed because a black market will create another big problem, from which we would not be able to get out.

The other matter is about software providers. Currently, 50 per cent of the major software providers in Sri Lanka have started overseas operations. So, with the increase of VAT, almost all the companies will start operating overseas and will only send the salaries here to be paid. The two Hon. State Ministers are here. One is the State Minister of Investment Promotion.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) I would urge both of you to get together in sorting this out.

The final matter is with regard to the digital service platforms. It was mentioned in the morning that VAT is applicable to Uber, PickMe and also Daraz. This will create another problem. So, I would urge the Hon. State Minister to ensure that these issues are sorted out.

SPECIAL EXAM OF LAW COLLEGE FOR LLB

GRADUATES OF FOREIGN UNIVERSITIES

[6.18 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Velu Kumar) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I move the following Adjournment Motion:

Currently, the Government is actively encouraging the inclusion of foreign universities within the country. However, it is perplexing that certain councils are concurrently imposing restrictions on students who have studied in these recognized foreign universities. This raises a concern about the Governments contradictory approach.

As per the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2332/02 dated 15.05.2023, the graduates who possess a LLB degree from a foreign university recognized by the Legal Education Council require to pass a separate special entrance exam, which raises questions about the fairness of allowing only a small batch of students to proceed to the Law College exams based on a cutoff.

3913 3914

However, it is worth questioning why this entrance exam is only applicable to these individuals when there is already a process in place for all students to become lawyers by clearing the Law College exams over three years.

If the goal is to produce high-quality lawyers, is it sufficient to merely regulate the three-year Law College exams? Additionally, why impose such punitive measures on students who have invested their time and money into obtaining a law degree with the aim of becoming lawyers?

In todays context, legal experts are not limited to the courtroom; their skills are in demand across various fields. It is important to note that no lawyers in Sri Lanka paid by the Government to practice in courts. Therefore, the creation of lawyers does not have any detrimental impact on the country.

Hence, the Sri Lanka Legal Education Council should promptly revoke the Government Gazette, especially the particular section that unilaterally introduced this new measure. At the very least, according to the current system, students who have completed their legal studies in foreign universities recognized by the Legal Education Council should be allowed to proceed directly with the three-year exams at the Sri Lanka Law College, one after the other.
