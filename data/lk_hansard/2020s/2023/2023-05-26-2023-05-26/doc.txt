. ( . ) (The Hon. Premnath C. Dolawatte, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Presiding Member, I had the opportunity to pay my last respects to the late Hon. Joseph Michael Perera inside the Parliament premises a few months ago.

Sir, I think he was a prestigious politician born in 1941. At the same time, he had been serving in Parliament for nearly four decades. He was Minister of Fisheries from May, 1988. Earlier, he was Deputy Minister of Labour. He made a name for himself when he was in the Seventh Parliament.

The Hon. Joseph Michael Perera was educated at the Christ King College, Tudella. He served as a theatre manager for eight years. He was an active Member of the UNP from the early stages and was a very vocal, brave speaker at UNP rallies alongside the late Hon. J.R. Jayewardene. Not only that, he led several contingents to countries all over the world, representing Sri Lanka. The Hon. Joseph Michael Perera led the Sri Lankan delegation to the Asia and the Pacific Regional Meeting of the International Labour Organization held in Wellington, New Zealand in March, 1978. Again, in January, 1983, he led the Sri Lankan delegation to the Asia and the Pacific Regional Meeting of the International Labour Organization held in Tokyo, Japan.

Sir, I must say that we need politicians of his calibre for the betterment of the society. He served in Parliament for almost four decades. I entered Parliament at the age of 39. By that time, he had served for almost 40 years in

Parliament. Some Parliamentary officials spoke to me about him and asked me to mention that the Hon. Perera was a very simple and a humble politician who had always talked to them and looked after their welfare and well-being. Sir, I admire his behavior towards the employees of Parliament. . We, as politicians, are criticized by the society from time to time. , , . Sir, as a Member of Parliament, you are representing the Gampaha District. I think his demise is a great loss to the entire Gampaha District, one of the districts in the Western Province.

Finally, I would like to pay my deepest sympathies and express our sorrow to his family. , .

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam. [12.33 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, today, I was actually supposed to go to Jaffna. I have been out of the country for the last three weeks. I attended Parliament yesterday and this morning, after the meeting of the Committee on Parliamentary Business, I was to leave for Jaffna. But, when I found out that todays Vote of Condolence was on the late Hon. Joseph Michael Perera, I thought I must stay back and say a few words.

Sir, I never knew him as a Minister. When I got elected for the first time to this House on the 19th of December, 2001, he was also elected as the Speaker of this House. That was a very difficult time, Sir. When one gets elected to take up the post of Speaker, which is meant to be a non-partisan, neutral position, from a particular party and that, too, someone of the calibre of the late Hon. Joseph Michael Perera, who was a very frontline Member of the UNP at that time, it is not an easy task. So, that alone sets the bar quite high. Then, on top of that, if you recall, in the 2001-2004 Parliament, there was an unsuccessful cohabitation, where you had the Executive Presidency held by President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the Parliamentary majority held by the UNP and the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister. So, that Parliament was a hotly debated, hotly contested House since the main Opposition, whose candidate was the Executive President, had a governments mentality. As a result, there were very heated debates taking place and the attitudes in Parliament were rather hostile, which was the very fact why that Parliament did not survive beyond 2004; it only survived for a two-thirds of its elected number of years. So, it is under those circumstances that the late Hon.

Joseph Michael Perera took up the post as the 17th Speaker of Sri Lanka.

And, it was during his tenure as Speaker that I, as a 27-year old, began taking part in debates in this House. I must say, Sir, that when I first got elected - I was, at that time, elected under the TNA - in the South, the TNA was seen, to a great extent, as an extension of the LTTE, even though that was not the case. It was at the height of hostilities, where the war had gone terribly wrong for the then Government, the economy was having a negative growth and ultimately, the Government was forced by its international donors to come into a peace process. Those were the circumstances in which that peace process commenced. So, even though you were in a peace process, there was a situation where a considerable number of Members of this House felt that if the donors had given them another chance to carry on the war, well, the war could have been pursued. Therefore, you can just imagine how hostile the nature in which a significant number of Members of this House saw the TNA, and that, too, a young Member such as myself, would have been.

Yet, under the Speakership of the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera, this House was kept well in check. Then, young Members such as myself, when we stood up to speak, were never disturbed. No matter how much Members of this House disagreed with what we had to say, he made sure that our speeches were never disturbed, that we had our say in this House. You could disagree, but you could disagree in a respectable manner when you get your time to do that. So, that was the sort of culture he inculcated within this House. As a young Member, even when I saw him down the Lobbies or the corridors, he would always make it a point to acknowledge me. I got the impression that actually he went out of his way to encourage younger Members and probably because he was a Catholic, he might have also understood where Members not belonging to the majority community come from. I got the feeling that - I have been a Member of this House under three different Speakers, including the current one - it was the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera who properly understood where Members such as us, who represent a community that is not belonging to the majority community, come from.

Therefore, I felt that when we are paying our respects with this Vote of Condolence in this House for the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera, I must put on record the Tamil National Peoples Fronts deepest sympathies and condolences, not only to his family, but also to his constituency. Today, we have the prefix of Honourable before each of our names, Sir. I do not think a vast majority of our Members today deserve that prefix because if you judge us by the standards of the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera, we disqualify. That is how dignified he was, that is how honourable he was and that is the high standard in which he kept his name and that prefix which came before his name. And, it is under those circumstances that I pay my most sincere respects to him, to his family and his constituency.

Thank you, Sir.
