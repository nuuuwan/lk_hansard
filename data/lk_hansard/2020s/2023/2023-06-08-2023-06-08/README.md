Just because you get some instructions from your "operators" in other countries, who are operating with an agenda to divide Sri Lanka, revive separatism and mislead another generation of Sri Lankans who have lost everything in this country, it is not fair to use the Privileges of Parliament to do so, particularly by someone who had contested the Parliamentary Election under the party of the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, under whose Government Gotabaya Rajapaksa was the Defence Secretary who led the operations against the LTTE and brought peace to this country.

PRIVILEGE: INCIDENT OCCURRED AT MARUTHANKERNY PUBLIC PLAYGROUND

ON 02.06.2023

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Speaker, on the 02nd of June, 2023, at around 3.10 p.m., I attended a small gathering comprising of 25 persons. The gathering was organized by the Eastern Boys' Sports Club at the Maruthankerny Public Playground. The gathering was held under a tree and no loudspeakers or similar devices to amplify sound were used as the gathering was merely to serve the constituents in my capacity as a Member of Parliament and not a propaganda meeting.

Within about 10 minutes of the gathering commencing, two individuals arrived at the event on a motorbike. They parked near the tree we were gathering under. After they alighted from the motorbike, they stood behind where I was seated without joining the gathering. At this point, since I, as a matter policy, have not taken any personal security from the Ministerial Security Division or the police in general, my research officer approached the two individuals and enquired as to what their purpose was. Since the two individuals had not given a satisfactory answer, my research officer suspected

one individual of having a possible concealed weapon and he requested the two to establish their identity, if they were to continue to remain in the vicinity of a non-public meeting. At this point, both individuals initially refused to produce any form of identification, but instead stated that they were police intelligence officers.

When I overheard this, I approached the two individuals, stating that I was a Member of Parliament and that I would like to see their official identity documents to satisfy myself that they, in fact, were who they claimed to be. The two individuals not only refused to do so, but went further to state that there was no need for them to produce any identification and that if I wished to confirm their identity, I should come to the police station. They also accused me of taking part in an "unlawful meeting". Once the allegation of an "unlawful meeting" was made, I began to insist on seeing their official identity documents and that failing which, I would be forced to take action against them. At this point, one individual attempted to make a getaway. When I tried to stop him by reaching out to him, he assaulted me and began running away. By that time, the second individual had been surrounded by other members of the gathering, who were insisting on him to prove his identity documents of being a police officer. The individual instead began calling out to the police officers from a school that adjoins the playground. He was specifically calling out to police officers who presumably were stationed there, at which point two individuals appeared from one of the buildings of the adjoining school. One individual was in police uniform carrying an automatic rifle and the other individual was wearing what seemed like a blue-coloured sports attire.

Whilst I was walking back towards the individual who had been surrounded by the members of the gathering, after pursuing the individual who ran away, the person in the school compound wearing the sports kit began rudely shouting saying that the unidentified individuals who had come on the motorbike were, in fact, police officers and ordered the gathering to let the individuals go. At that point, I asked the person in the sports kit as to who he was and to confirm his identity and if not, to mind his own business as he had no authority to get involved in what was happening in the playground. The person, then, began to swear at me, at which point I walked away towards the individual who the members of the gathering had managed to surround.

At this point, several members of the gathering began alerting me simultaneously that the person in the school compound wearing a sports kit had drawn a pistol, proceeded to load it and was aiming it in my direction. There was some commotion for a few minutes, at which point a police vehicle began to enter the playground. A uniformed officer alighted from the vehicle and immediately began to shout out saying that the persons who had come on the motorbike were police officers, that we had no business to restrain them and ordered us to let them go.

I, then, approached the officer in uniform, who subsequently identified himself as SI Jayathissa, acting

467 468

2023 08

OIC of the Maruthankerny Police. I proceeded to explain to the SI the events that had transpired. The SI, then, proceeded to order the surrounded individual to show his Police ID. The SI, thereafter, apologized to me and asked me to forget the matter. I refused to do so and pointed out that not only were my rights violated, but also offences and breaches of my Parliamentary Privileges had been committed by the Maruthankerny Police. I also told him that I wish to know the identity of the individual who ran away and the individual in the school compound wearing the sports kit, as they had committed offences against me and the others, where one had assaulted me and the other had aimed a loaded gun at me. The SI, then, stated that the individual wearing the sports kit had nothing to do with this incident. When I insisted on knowing his identity, the SI asked me to come to the Maruthankerny Police and to make a statement there. I declined to go to the Maruthankerny Police Station, as members of that station had committed major offences against me, which included pointing a loaded gun. I told the SI that I am prepared to make any statement immediately on the spot but not at the Maruthankerny Police. I stated that as I felt there was a threat to my life by the Maruthankerny Police, who had been acting in a hostile and life-threatening way. The SI, then, left the premises.

Subsequently, at about 3.30 p.m. on the 05th of June, the OIC, Maruthankerny contacted me, requesting my cooperation in recording a statement regarding the June 02nd incident. I informed the OIC that I was on the way to Colombo to attend Parliament Sittings and that I will be returning to Jaffna on the 12th of June and that I will make the statement on the 12th afternoon or any date convenient thereafter. The OIC also informed me, Hon. Speaker, that you had been informed.

I, thereafter, promptly called you, Hon. Speaker, but was informed by a recorded message that you were abroad. I still pursued staying on line as I needed to speak to you urgently. I tried several times but as there was no answer, I left a WhatsApp message. I, then, called the Deputy Speaker - he is present here - who promptly answered the phone. I told him that the Maruthankerny Police wish to record a statement from me, at which point he confirmed that someone from the police had called him requesting the same. I then explained to the Deputy Speaker of the need for me to attend Parliament and asked him if the police could be informed that I will make the statement after the 12th of June. The Deputy Speaker immediately agreed saying that since it is merely a statement, he sees no reason why I should not attend Parliament and make the statement thereafter. I, thereafter, contacted the Maruthankerny OIC and explained what the Deputy Speaker had informed me and the OIC seemed satisfied. He also did say that he would like to record the statement and close this matter up as soon as possible, at which point I assured him that I would make the statement as soon as I return to Jaffna on the 12th of June.

Despite those assurances on my part, the Maruthankerny Police, through the Colpetty Police, attempted to serve me a written message on the 06th of June around 1.00 p.m. requesting me to produce myself

on the 08th of June at 10.00 a.m. at the Maruthankerny Police Station to record a statement regarding the said incident. Since the written message was in Sinhala and I cannot read Sinhala, I refused to accept the note. The police officers, then, said that all they were asked to do was to convey the message, and that since they had done so verbally, that would suffice. They left my residence thereafter.

I, then, proceeded to prepare a written request to you, Hon. Speaker, regarding a breach of my Parliamentary Privileges, which I handed over to the Secretary-General personally on the 06th of June at around 5.00 p.m. since the Speakers Office was locked up by then. I was to raise the Question of Privilege in the House on the morning of 07th June, that is, yesterday. I also handed over a handwritten letter addressed to you, requesting that you inform the police that I will make myself available to record a statement on the 12th of June or soon thereafter.

Subsequently, at around 8.30 p.m. on the 06th of June, the Colpetty Police arrived at my Colombo residence with the earlier written message and Tamil and English translations of it, which again stated that I should make myself available at the Maruthankerny Police at 10.00 a.m. on the 08th of June. Whilst this be the case, on the morning of 07th June at around 6.30 a.m., the Jeyapuram OIC turned up at my residence stating that he had to arrest and take me to the Maruthankerny Police to record a statement. I, then, informed him that I had informed the Maruthankerny OIC that I have got the consent of the Deputy Speaker to make the statement on the 12th of June and anyway, since it was only the previous night, that is, at 8.30 p.m. on the 06th June, that the Maruthankerny Police itself served me a written message requesting me to, in fact, produce myself on the 08th of June at 10.00 a.m., I asked them why the sudden hurry to arrest me despite the police itself wanting me to make the statement on the 08th of June. The Jeyapuram OIC had no reply except to say that those were his orders.

I promptly contacted you, Hon. Speaker, and explained the situation and requested that you inform the police that the statement can be recorded on 12th June and you agreed to do so. However, after about 15 minutes, the police again wanted to arrest me and take me to Maruthankerny. I again contacted you, Sir, and informed you of the situation. You, then, informed me that if there was an arrest warrant, you would not like to prevent them from taking me, but if not, the police cannot prevent me from attending Parliament, especially in the context that I was to raise a Question of Privilege, which was scheduled for the 07th morning. You also told me that if they were adamant, they should allow me to attend Parliament on the 07th , that is, yesterday, to raise the Question of Privilege and thereafter, take me to Maruthankerny. Sir, I asked you to kindly inform the IGP of your stand on this matter. Despite that, once I hung up the phone, the police insisted on arresting me. I asked that the arrest warrant be produced, to which they replied they had none, as there was no warrant. Then, I asked them to provide me with a receipt of arrest so that my family have a record of my arrest. That, too, was not given. Instead, I was illegally arrested and taken away. A receipt of arrest was

469 470

subsequently handed over to me personally at the Colpetty Police. I told the police that there is no point in handing it to me, that it should be handed over to my family or someone at my home, who will have proof of my arrest if my whereabouts became unknown. .

However, the police refused to hand it over to my house. I was, subsequently, taken to the Kilinochchi Police Station, where my statement was recorded and was, then, produced before the Kilinochchi Magistrate, who, enlarged me on bail and withdrew the foreign travel ban that had been issued on me.

Sir, whilst this is what actually transpired, the police headquarters' spokesman, who is also an attorney-at-law, has been making several false statements to the media regarding the incident. All those statements have been made as the official position of the police inquiry whilst, till yesterday, my statement regarding the incident had not even been obtained. Several Sinhala and English media have unquestioningly accepted the polices version of events, despite the police being a party to the 02nd of June incident, and have published many news items which are blatantly false or thoroughly misleading, at the very least. One newspaper in particular, the Divaina, ran a lead story on 07th June saying that I had gone into hiding. Sir, even when my father was assassinated by the State, I or my family did not run. Even at the height of the war, when white van abductions were rampant and extrajudicial killings were taking place against Tamils, I did not run away. Now, when the police has completely exposed themselves for what they are, an institution completely corrupt which unleashes State terror on the Tamil people and in my case, have completely acted illegally and partially, I am hardly going to run away. It is, in fact, in my and my peoples interest that I want to expose everything for what it is.

Considering that it is ultimately the Police Department itself which has to investigate this incident, which also consists of possible crimes committed by one of its own police station members, the fact that the Police Department has already drawn adverse conclusions against me means that my rights have been violated by the entire Department and has, thereby, lost its credibility to investigate this matter in a just and impartial manner pertaining to me and the other individuals associated with me, whose rights also had been violated.

Accordingly, Hon. Speaker, I ask you to take all measures that you deem fit to safeguard my rights and Privileges.

Thank you.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, may I? ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) ?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Minister, with respect, all those people I had interactions with, who you claim you saw on the video, do you agree were in civvies?

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) Yes.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Right. My point is, you might know that they are your officers, but I do not. I cannot take their word for it. If they come to a place and try to act in the name of police, they must establish themselves as police officers; you cannot come in civvies and just say that you are police. There are enough individuals who had murdered people pretending to be police. I want to know whether you are, in fact, who you say you are. They refused to produce their identity. So, all your assumptions are based on the fact that I knew they were police officers.

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) No.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) You show me in any one of those videos whether I am arguing with anybody in a uniform. You say that you have got a report. Can you tell this House that you will produce or submit it to the House? You say that you have called for a report; you told the media that you have called for a report.

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) Hon. Member, once I get the final report, I will.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) So, today, you are talking without having a final report.

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) No, but I have got - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Today, you are talking without having a final report.

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) Why are you not allowing me to finish my statement? Then, you can say whatever you want.

When you went up to the fence and shouted at that person who was not in uniform saying, " , he was with another officer in uniform. Would you accept that?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, can I have the mike?

541 542

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) No, I will - [Interruption.] .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) The point is, Hon. Minister, again, it is not the person in a uniform that I had a problem with. The person in civvies was the one who was trying to order me how I must behave with the person the people in that gathering had surrounded. That person who came to our gathering was also in civvies and was calling our meeting "illegal". What right does anybody have to come and say that my meetings are "illegal" when I am a Member of Parliament and I am actually serving my constituents, without him trying to prove who he is?

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) Hon. Member, when you shouted at the person who was in civvies, he was with another officer in uniform. -[Interruption.] No, it is not.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, can I have the mike?

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) No, first, I will finish and then, you say whatever you want to say.

So, that other officer was in uniform and then you went and said, " and all that. Hon. Member, that is not acceptable; whatever you say now, that was not acceptable. As the Minister in charge of the police, I just cannot tolerate that kind of behaviour and also I cannot tell the police not to take action, whether that person is a Member of Parliament or whoever it is. - [Interruption] I will finish, first. What I am saying is - [Interruption] No, no.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Once you sit down, you will not allow me. - [Interruption]

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) No, I will.

So, Hon. Member, what happened was, there was this incident. I will table all the video tapes. Then, every single Member of Parliament will see exactly what happened there. I think those videos were mostly recorded by your people, not by us. I will table those when I get them because they have been submitted to the court also. When a thing like that happens, I do not think anyone can tolerate, Hon. Member.

Even if I speak to a police officer like that, no one is going to tolerate that. So, what happened was, this incident took place, then the police submitted a "B" report to the court on the 05th morning and that "B" report was lodged there, making you and two others suspects. The other two were arrested and remanded by the Magistrate and then, they were trying to get through to you to record your statement. By then, you had left Maruthankerny and come to Colombo. As you know, on the 05th , the OIC tried to call you, but you did not answer the phone. You sent a text to him saying, You can text me. Once the OIC sent a text message, you called him and then, the OIC informed you that they need to get a statement. At that time, you had said, I cannot come till the 12th. All that is fine. Then, on the 06th, you were given a message through the Colpetty Police, which you did not accept; you said, It is not in Tamil and did not accept it. Then, for the second time when they went to give you the message, I think your watcher or someone had said that there was no one in the house and they could not accept it. So, it went on like that from the 05th to the 06th. When you were not accepting the messages, the police decided to send a team to Colombo and they came looking for you to your place last morning. In fact, I personally thought that you would be in Parliament the day before yesterday, but you were not here. So, yesterday, when the police came to your place, they arrested you. Once they announced that you had been arrested, you had called the Hon. Speaker and the Hon. Deputy Speaker. You said here that the Hon. Deputy Speaker said, No problem, you come to Parliament. But, the Deputy Speaker got up here and said that he never said a thing like that. So, this is exactly what happened.

I really do not think the police has done anything wrong from the 05th to yesterdays arrest. They had followed every single step, what they should do. On the 05th itself, they informed the Hon. Speaker that they were going to arrest you. So, all that was done. - [Interruption.] I will answer any question.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Minister, you make allegations quite unbelievably. As someone who has called for a report,

543 544

2023 08

you make allegations against me, listening to the police officers who are party to this incident before you even got that report. So, it is very clear to me that the police were acting on your advice. But, let me tell you this. The Hon. Jayantha Weerasinghe, a very senior Presidents Counsel and a criminal lawyer, is also here. When the police come in civvies, the first thing they must do in carrying out their duty or especially when interacting with civilians is, they must identify themselves saying that they are police officers. If the police officers concerned came up to me and identified themselves as police officers and said, Sir, you cannot have a meeting here for these reasons" - let us say, they could have told me that there was an exam centre next door, that gathering could be a disturbance to the exam centre and therefore, I cannot have a meeting here - I would have accepted that. The parents of those students who were sitting for the exam are my constituents. They vote for me, not for you. It is in my interest that I must make sure that I do not disturb them. But, it was only a coordinating centre, it was 3.30 p.m. and there was no exam going on. The last exam that was going on finished at 3 o clock islandwide. The person the Hon. Minister says was in the exam centre did not even come into the picture. It was the two individuals who came to disturb the meeting in civvies - despite my asking them to produce their identity cards, they repeatedly refused to - who shouted out to the people in the school. All these are in the videos. I hope you would produce the videos. Those would be in my interest, if you produce the videos.

So, they shouted out to the people in the school, asking them to say that they are police officers because, by then, the people in the playground had surrounded them. It was then that the two individuals inside the school came out and one was in uniform. The person in uniform, who was carrying an automatic rifle, did not open his mouth. It was the person next door, who was in civvies, who was interacting with me and what did he say? The first thing he said was that those were all police officers. When two individuals had come to the playground, one of whom hit me and did a getaway, and refused to establish their identity, someone in the school came out in civvies, shouted across to me in a rude way and said, They are all police officers, they are all our people, you cannot keep them and let them go. So, I asked him, Who the hell are you? Who are you to tell me that? First, you establish your identity. Show me your Identity Card, none of which they were prepared to do. So, without them establishing themselves, as they were in civvies, as police officers, how on earth am I supposed to know that they are police officers? They can be your SLPP thugs; they certainly acted like that. Why should I accept them as police officers? So, as Minister, if you do not know this basic principle of policing, it only means that it is on your instructions that they had been behaving in such a thuggish and illegal way. They were serving your purposes. That is why even after you told the -

( ) (The Hon. Mohamad Muzammil) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) point of Order ?

( ) (The Hon. Mohamad Muzammil) . . ? . ? [ . . . . . [

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes, Hon. Sumanthiran? . . ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I am raising a point of Order and asking the Minister concerned - [Interruption.] The Member of Parliament concerned has made two points: firstly, that it was 3.30 in the afternoon and there was no examination going on and secondly, whether anybody in civvies can come and claim that they are police officers without

establishing their identity. Are we supposed to take their word? Any thug on the road will say, I am a police officer. But, he must show you his identity. Those are the two points the Hon. Member has made.

Hon. Minister, you explained about his arrest. The police knew very well that he was travelling from Jaffna to Colombo to attend Parliament. Under Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act, it is illegal to stop a Member of Parliament from attending Parliament. What was the hurry in arresting him yesterday, during the Sittings of Parliament this week? - [Interruption.] They had initially informed him to come and make a statement today, not yesterday. Why could they not wait till Friday, until the Parliament Sittings were over, for him to make a statement? He had not committed a murder and was fleeing the country or anything like that. They knew very well that he had travelled from Jaffna to attend the Parliament Sittings. So, Hon. Minister, I am raising this, as a Member of Parliament, which concerns you as well. We, all of us, have the Privilege to attend Parliament and that must take precedence.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . . . ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The law permits, the law states or assures us that we can attend Parliament and that we cannot be prevented from attending Parliament. The police, under you, knew very well that he was in Colombo to attend Parliament and what was this hurry to arrest and take him all the way to Kilinochchi?

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) Hon. Member, you asked me three questions. One was about not showing the ID. Now, that is what our Hon. Member says. But, what the police say is that they showed the ID and the Hon. Member tried to grab the ID. So, let us leave it at that and wait for the video footage to decide.

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) All right.

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) Then, the second question you asked me was about him coming to Colombo to attend Parliament. Was it or was it about something else?

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The next question I asked was about the exam centre. There was no examination.

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) Right. That centre, from the information I have, was not an examination centre.

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is right.

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) It was a centre where all the exam papers were brought to and distributed from, a place like that.

The third question was,- [Interruption.] Shall I answer first?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, can I have the mike? ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Thank you.

You are correct, Hon. Minister, it was not an examination centre but was a coordinating centre where they normally keep the exam papers before they are distributed. And because it was a Friday, there were no exam papers also there. That also, I double-checked. There were no papers even there.

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) The third question was about your coming to Parliament, Hon. Member. That is what you asked me, Hon. Sumanthiran.

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes. But, what was the indecent hurry -

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) Can I explain that? The police were looking for him on the 05th to obtain a statement. You say he came to Colombo to attend Parliament. On the 6th , he did not attend Parliament even though he was in Colombo.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, I want to correct that. The Secretary-General is here. I came to Parliament at 5 oclock.

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) Do you mean, 5 oclock in the evening? ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) Hon. Member, I am just answering the Hon. Sumanthiran. Let me finish.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. I have to correct him. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . [

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) Yes. Let me finish answering. After that, you say anything.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) No, Sir, let me just correct him. Then, I want his comments with regard to my correction.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . .[ .

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) Hon. Sumanthiran, I said he was not in Parliament. I was here from morning that day. He was not in Parliament. Now, he says that he came at 5 oclock. So, that is not to attend Parliament. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Milan Jayathilake) ?

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . [

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) No, no one knew about that. - [Interruption.] . . ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) How do you say so? The Secretary-General knew that.

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) The Secretary-General would have known about it, but she did not inform the police because she does not have to inform the police. -[Interruption.] No, no.

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) A Privilege issue was going to be raised. You ordered to arrest him. That is what you did.

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) No, no. That is all wrong.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) The Police were acting on your instructions, Hon. Minister!

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) You are assuming that. - [Interruption.] No, you are assuming! - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) No, there is no point of Order in that. Just because you can shout, do not think that we are going to shut up and wait.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) No, there is no point of Order in that. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Minister, you are saying that I never attended Parliament. I am saying - the Secretary-General is present here - that I came to Parliament at 5 oclock and I handed over my written statement on breach of Privilege to the Secretary-General. And, the Hon. Speaker knew all of this.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Order, please! .

Whereupon THE HON. SAMANPRIYA HERATH left the Chair, and THE HON. SPEAKER took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Minister, you continue.

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) Hon. Member, I said you were not in Parliament in the morning on that day. That is what I said. I also said that I was here in the morning.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Speaker, I was the one who was talking. -[Interruption.].

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) No, I was talking.

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) ? [

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Please! Now, it is not the time to raise this kind of points of Order because you know that, now, the matter is under control; the matter is under consideration of the legal authorities. So, why do you worry about it? - [Interruption.]

You joined in the middle of it, troubling him, Hon . Member. Now, you have raised your issue and it has been discussed. The matter has been handed over to the relevant authorities. So, thay matter will be looked into.

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) Hon. Speaker, they were raising this issue and I had to answer it. Then, the Hon. Sumanthiran raised three questions. I answered them. That is all that happened.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I do not think this is the time to answer that kind of questions here because you know the matter has been handed over to the relevant authorities. So, let it be taken up there. Even you can go and argue there; you can go and submit your case. Of course, the people who are responsible would be punished properly. So, let that be found out reasonably. There should be some discipline in considering this. Hon. Minister, have you finished your comments?

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Item No. 2, does the House agree?

( ) (Hon. Members) Aye. . . Question put, and agreed to.
