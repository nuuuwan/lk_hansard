( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . [1.50 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Presiding Member, on the 24th of April, 2019, when I made a statement about the Easter Sunday bombings, I suspected there was some kind of an international connection by looking at the way the bombings took place. However, looking at the evidence of Senior DIG Ravi Seneviratne, the head of the CID at

2887 2888

that time and who was appointed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, it seemed that there was no such evidence, no ISIS connection because there was no evidence of their funds coming into the country, no evidences of training, logistical support or a communication link and the explosives used had also been locally available ones. That is the first point.

The second point is, was there somebody above Zahran? Abu Hind talked regularly to Zaharan, Hadiya, the wife of Zahran said and she also said that on such occasions, she was asked to leave the room. Then, Noufer Moulavi, the theoretician of the National Thowheeth Jama'ath - the NTJ - and Zahrans team clashed. What did they clash about? It was because they had planned an attack in 2020, but wanted it advanced to 2019. Zahran returns two days after the clash and says, "No, we are going to execute things much earlier."

We need to think about the next point. They had deployed another cadre to take away a suicide bomber in case he was unable to explode the bomb. So, if Zahran died, then somebody else was left behind. This naturally leads to the conclusion that there are others above Zahran. We know that CCTV cameras showed that Jameel left the Taj Samudra Hotel after receiving a call. Azad Maulana says that Suresh Salley called him and wanted him to rescue Jameel. Whether that evidence is right or wrong is up to the investigators to find out. We would not come into any conclusions about that. But, due to the doubt that Maulana may not act, a military intelligence team goes to Jameel's home and Jameel's mother's home in Dematagoda and in Wellampitiya. Taken by a three-wheeler driver, Jameel goes to the Tropical Inn in Dehiwala and he keeps the bomb there. Then, he goes to a mosque in Dehiwala and the worshippers were troubled by his suspicious presence. The agent of the security company which looks after the mosque comes and questions Jameel. Jameel says, "I had a disagreement with my wife and came here". The security agent then takes a call to Jameel's wife and she says the same story; the husband's and the wife's stories actually tallied. Therefore, the security agent releases Jameel. We know the story after that, Jameel goes back to the Tropical Inn and explodes the bomb. The question is this: why did military intelligence then go to Jameel's house? That is really another unanswered question. According to the information available, when those intelligence officers were questioned, they said they were surveilling Jameel. If they were surveilling Jameel, what happened on the 20th and 21st of April, 2019? Where was the surveillance of Jameel? So, those are unanswered questions.

Then, Shani Abeysekara was removed from his position and transferred. Former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa promised that when he was elected, he would get to the bottom of this, go after the culprits and serve justice. But, after he was elected, he completely forgot all of that and really went after individuals. So, Shani Abeysekara was transferred on the 21st of November, 2019 as the PA to the DIG, Galle. See what had happened to him. Subsequently, he was even interdicted on the 07th

of January, 2020. Former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa recently made a statement that he transferred Shani Abeysekara because of Ranjan Ramanayake's audio tapes. He transferred him on the 21st of November, 2019, but Ranjan Ramanayake's audio tapes came out on the 04th of January, 2020. So, that statement is not an accurate statement and I have to, unfortunately, mention that. Shani Abeysekara has not even been given his pension, even though the AAT has determined and the National Police Commission has also approved that he should receive his pension.

On the 19th of February, 2019, Hadiya and Sara Jasmine, the wife of Hasthun, the suicide bomber of Katuwapitiya Church, together established Zahrans identity by a photograph. The wives were not arrested because they had not committed a crime. Shani Abeysekara was implicated in the Vaas Gunawardenas case, held for ten months and subsequently, released because there was no evidence; he was exonerated. So, it is very unfortunate that that kind of things actually happened.

We do not know whether Sara Jasmine is alive or dead. Three DNA tests were done, two tests proved negative and the third became positive. Hadiyas evidence suggests that Sara is alive. We do not know. So, those are things for the investigators to establish. We, as Parliamentarians, cannot say anything definite, but we can raise questions.

So, we need revelations. What are we talking about here? Nearly 270 deaths with over 40 foreign nationals among them! Who is responsible for that? Who are the brains behind this? The suicide bombers, obviously, and those who aided and abetted. Also, the failure of the intelligence services to stop that has been established. Of course, we would like them to clear themselves by actually having an independent investigation. Therefore, an independent investigation is necessary.

Now, I have a few suggestions to make. One is, the National Security Council must be legislated because you cannot have a situation where the Prime Minister says that he did not actually attend the meetings of that Council. We cannot leave only to the President to decide on national security. Therefore, the National Security Council should actually be legislated. Also, an international investigation is needed. Whether an investigation could be held with some of those people mentioned still in those positions is another question. The President has a legal and moral responsibility to initiate that.

On the day of the bombings, former MP Hon. Ajith P. Perera, my Colleague, the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva, former MP Hon. Mujibur Rahuman and I went to the Temple Trees and subsequently, to the Defence Ministry. We went there and we were shown into the National Security Council. We were not really satisfied with what we actually heard. Subsequently, the Hon. Ruwan Wijewardene called a press conference. I also walked in to the press conference with him. At the press conference, we decided to declare an all-island curfew, even though

2889 2890

[ ]

2023 22

we had no approval. I want to state that to show the Hon. Ruwan Wijewardene's courage. I also want to state that he actually did it because we did not want a repetition of what happened in 1983.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) So, we did not want it to happen; we did not want anything to go wrong on the streets. Even though we would be sacked, the Hon. Ruwan Wijewardene and I decided that we should declare an all-island curfew and bring things under control.

Madam, I would like to conclude with this. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, when he was Prime Minister - this was also brought up by the Hon. Niroshan Perera yesterday when he opened this Debate - said on the 17th of May, 2022 that he would provide international expertise necessary to establish the truth about the Easter Sunday bombings. That was in reply to the letter sent by the Hon. Manusha Nanayakkara and the Hon. Harin Fernando, present Ministers. Then, the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe was quoted in the Daily News of 19th July, 2022 - by then, he was the Acting President - as saying, "We seek assistance of the British Government and the police authorities in the investigation of the Easter Sunday terrorist attacks, which killed nearly 270 people, due to the incomplete nature of the investigation". As Prime Minister and Acting President, that is what he said. I would like to ask him, now, as President of the country, what are you going to do? This needs an independent investigation acceptable to everybody and prosecution. We want to make sure that prosecution is done in the Sri Lankan jurisdiction, not overseas. But, if we do not have a proper investigation, unfortunately, like in other things that had happened in this country, it is foreigners who will interfere in our internal affairs.

Thank you very much for the time given. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 15 .

Order, please! Before he starts, will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Imran Maharoof to the Chair?

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Kanchana Wijesekera - Minister of Power and Energy) Hon. Presiding Member, I propose that the Hon. Imran Maharoof do now take the Chair.

. . Question put, and agreed to.

[5.14 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Hon. Presiding Member, today, we are debating the Easter Sunday attack and the events related to that.

Sir, first, I would like to mention that I have just returned from London this morning after attending a five-day Course on Post-legislative Scrutiny conducted by the University of London - UCL. It is so saddening to see that legislations passed by the Parliament of Sri Lanka over the last so many decades are not being implemented properly. But, the world is moving on. They are scrutinizing their legislations. The Hon. Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms is here. Around the world, with post-legislative scrutiny, they scrutinize the legislations passed previously by Parliaments, add review clauses to those legislations to see if the legislations that had been passed are working properly, if the public is satisfied with them and whether the legislations that had been passed are actually serving their intended purposes. Since the Hon. Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms is here, I would like to urge him to consider introducing post-legislative scrutiny to the Parliament of Sri Lanka also so that we can scrutinize legislations that had been passed previously to see if they are doing what they were intended to do, if the public is satisfied with those and whether we can improve the legislations. Also, we can add review clauses to the legislations. To the new laws or legislations we are to pass, we can add a review clause or at least a sunset clause to ensure that if a certain law is not needed forever that it is only used for a short period of time.

In that sense, I would like to urge the Hon. Minister to consider this matter as well, which we are debating today. There are many laws in this country. If we really wanted to find out the truth behind the Easter Sunday attack, I am sure and you will also agree, we could have done that as a country. It is very evident after the "Channel 4" documentary.

I have here with me the statement made by Azad Maulana to the UN and in that, he has mentioned many things. Now, as a country, what we should do is, we should try to investigate into the matters that have been mentioned in these statements. But, as opposed to that, we see Pillayan,

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

one of the main accused and a State Minister of this country going to the CID and filing a complaint. I do not know what the content of the complaint is. In this

statement, Azad Maulana has very clearly mentioned names of people who were part of the State Intelligence Service. He has also said that the Tripoli Platoon - Pillayan was one of the main operatives of that squad - directly reported only to Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Sir, let me quote from his statement:

The unit was initially led by Major Prabath Bulathwatte and later by Colonel Shammi Kumararatne. It was under the direct command of Maj. Gen. Amal Karunasena, who then had been Director of MI and was later made Army Chief of Staff. This platoon reported to Gotabaya Rajapaksa directly and received orders only from him, when he was Secretary of Defence. This platoon and the TMVP were responsible for a number of major political assassinations during and after the war, including the assassinations and disappearances of journalists. They are particularly responsible for the assassinations of former parliamentarians Joseph Pararajasingam and Nadarajah Raviraj, the assassinations of journalists Lasantha Wickrematunge, Sivaram and Nadesan as well as the disappearances of Professor Sivasubramaniam Raveendranath, Vice-Chancellor of the Eastern University and cartoonist Prageeth Ekneligoda.

I am sure you have seen this statement. Sir, I would like to table* this statement.

Hon. Minister, we need to start an investigation with international help. There is no way that this country is going to prosecute or even investigate its own intelligence apparatus. They are the ones who have been accused.

Thank you for raising with us Sri Lankas request for an independent investigation into the Easter Sunday attacks. The bombings that took place on April 21, 2019, were both shocking and horrific, tragically claiming the lives of 269 people, including five U.S. citizens, and injuring hundreds of

other innocent people. In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, and continuing to the present day, the U.S. government provided assistance in the investigation and prosecution of those responsible - to the point that the Department of Justice filed a criminal complaint in January, 2021 against those deemed responsible for the deaths of U.S. citizens. In light of that, even as we stand ready to continue providing support to your government, it would not make sense for the United States to conduct an additional investigation into the attacks.
