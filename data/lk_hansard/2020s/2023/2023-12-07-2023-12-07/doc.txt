I think our biggest challenge is that we should not be drawn into any particular camp and seen as we are an extension of a particular country, a particular region or a particular alliance. On the basis of the instructions given to me and also on the experience of the Hon. President, Sri Lankan foreign policy is, friendship towards all and enmity towards none. I think we have succeeded in that. The Hon. President Ranil Wickremesinghe had been able to talk to many of the leaders all over the world particularly, the big powers. He visited India; he visited China; he visited Japan twice; he visited France; he visited Germany; he went to UAE and attended the COP28 of the UNFCCC; he engaged with many leaders in the world and articulated Sri Lankas vision. I think, because we have done that, without getting entangled into

2809 2810

a pro-country strategy, but standing together as an independent sovereign State, we have got the respect, which Sri Lanka richly deserves. As a result of it, we have been able to conclude the debt restructuring process to a great extent; get those assurances which were required and was able to get the IMF first tranche. I am certain that we will get the second tranche within the next couple of weeks. So, I think we are doing things in the right direction.

, if you wait for that perfect law to come, it will never come, but any progress in the right direction should be attained. Therefore, I will always stand for a country where all Sri Lankan citizens irrespective of their race, religion, caste and language, should be part of this governing; should be able to live with dignity and for that, we will continue to make whatever possible contribution. But, I also urge that we must get out of this separatist tendency.

I am sorry to say that, a few days ago, we had a beautiful programme to talk about the Sri Lankan expatriate communitys contribution in another country. A lot of people spoke so well about Sri Lanka, how they want to contribute to the Sri Lankan society, but some representatives who represented a particular community, were not talking about Sri Lanka or Sri Lankan unity, they were talking about separatist ideals and creating a homeland. Where are we going? What are we going to achieve? I think that is where we have gone wrong.

As far as our engagement with the UN is concerned, Hon. Chairman, we will continue to engage. We have

2813 2814

been taking part in what is known as the UPR process- Universal Periodical Review. We are going to the Cabinet to establish a oversight committee within the Cabinet, and to implement those recommendations which we have adopted. But we will not be bullied by any Western countries who practice hypocritical double standard and tell us how we should run our country. We will never be bullied by that. We will do what is good for our people in this country. We will include everybody, but we will not be bullied, because I have no intention of going and seeking the refuge in some other country. Therefore, I have no obligation in this role other than for my country and what is good for my country.

I must also say we have absolutely no problem with those countries and their administration, but we have some problems with some of the politicians. The External Affairs Minister of India very correctly pointed out that the world is driven by vote-bank politics, which is very true. So, we are not going to cater to the "vote-bank politics" of Western capitals. We are a sovereign State. We are not going to beg and give up our rights and our sovereignty just to create a few jobs. It has to be a dignified, sovereign relationship between our country and any country in the world. That is how we can stand up; that is how we will survive and that is the only way forward. Sri Lanka had done in the past. That is what we are doing now and that is how we should do in the future.

Thank you very much, Hon. Chairman. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa -Leader of the Opposition) , lunch break 0 0 0

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) , 0 () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. I just want to make a correction to what the Hon. Minister said. The original system of the Consular Division was made electronic in 2017. It was done on the direction of Ambassador S. S. Ganegama Arachchi. We won the best award for e-governance that year. Hon. Minister, it is good that you talked about the good things that have been done, but also, you must recognize how it happened. So, you did not create the e-DAS system; the e-DAS system was created in 2017. I just want to make that point so that, in future, you would not make that mistake.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC) Sir, I will just respond to that. I never talked about the e-DAS system. We introduced the e-channelling system last year in order to give appointments. That eliminated the queues. Then, we connected it with the Ministry of Education three months ago. That eliminated the queues of people who were asked to be physically present, by 50 per cent. Of course, the computer systems were there, but at the time we took over, you know how many days they had to wait in queues; there were thousands of people in queues. I think Hon. State Minister Tharaka Balasuriya will be able to clarify that.

() ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Hon. Chairman, can I have the microphone, please?

Hon. Minister, let us be honest. Sir, then, the actual waiting time was six hours. When we did it under the late Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, we brought it down to 10 minutes by creating the e-DAS system. It is because these people messed up this country that there were so many people wanting to leave the country. That is what happened. So, let us be honest about what we are saying. That is all I am saying. Give the credit to people who did it. - [Interruption] Do not shout, Hon. Minister. - [Interruption] I never said anything about myself; I never said anything about me. I said about the late Hon. Mangala Samaraweera. Just tell the truth. You all created all that nonsense! - [Interruption] You do not need to scream like that - [Interruption]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC) Hon. Chairman, I never take anybody's credit. I gave the credit to my State Minister; he is the one who was behind this. It is easy for somebody to write theories and make lectures. What matters is how it is executed on the ground and how challenges are taken on and faced. Do that, Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva. - [Interruption]

() ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Hon. Chairman, let me respond. He is talking to me. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Yes, Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva? () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Sir, let me respond. Do not try to make insinuations against me, Hon. Minister. What did you do? You say that you are standing up for every community in this country. But, what did you do? Did you stand up for your own community?

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya - State Minister of Foreign Affairs) . . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Let us listen to the Hon. State Minister now. - [Interruption] Please, calm down.

( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Hon. Member, I am trying to provide a clarification.- [Interruption]

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Please calm down, Hon. Minister. Let the Hon. State Minister explain. - [Interruption] Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva, please calm down.

( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva, if you just calm down, I can provide a clarification.

Yes, the e-DAS was created during the "Y ahapalana" period and what we did was, we integrated that with other institutions such as the Department of Examinations. So,

now, nobody has to come to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. One can get the certificates from - [Interruption] Let me finish, please. You can get the certificates from your laptop or your home computer now.

Now, if it is a question about who gets the credit, I really do not care. What we really care about is that the people are getting a better service and I think we all should get together and work towards that end without arguing who did it or who should get the credit for it.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Exactly.

() ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) I appreciate the gentlemanliness of that response; I appreciate it, Hon. Chairman. That is how we need to work.

But, I did not mention my name. I only mentioned Ganegama Arachchi's and the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera's names. That is all I did. So, I am not trying to take any credit that is not due to me, but what I am saying is, let us be honest. Nobody needs to shout and scream.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Now, the matter is settled. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) What the Hon. State Minister said is correct; that is fine.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Now, let the Hon. Leader of the Opposition start his speech.

[11.05 a.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Chairman, let me at the outset explain my attire today. I am wearing this shawl to express my solidarity in attaining peace in the Middle East and also peace and security worldwide.

Then, Sir, I want to follow on from the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva and would like to say that theories and

2817 2818

lectures are important. That is how we obtain higher education. But, I think lectures, theories and ideologies should be transformed and translated into action. That is what is most important.

Sir, I think the foreign policy, the external policy or whatever you may call it, forms one of the basic fulcrums of governance. A strong, innovative, vibrant, thought-provoking, result-oriented foreign policy is of great benefit to our own nation-state.

One of the most important international legal dictums is - I will say it in Latin first- pacta sunt servanda.. I am sure that the Hon. Ali Sabry is very much aware of it. The meaning of it is thou shalt abide by ones agreements. Sir, unfortunately, our track record in terms of abiding by agreements is quite dismal. We remember that in 2019, soon after the end of the war, there was a Joint Statement signed by the then UN Secretary-General and the then President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, but the substance of that Joint Statement was not implemented. With regard to the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission - LLRC, the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms, the Udalagama Commission, the Paranagama Commission, in all of those instances, unfortunately, Sri Lanka abrogated its responsibility of abiding by agreements. Pacta sunt servanda - abiding by agreements - is of essence in a credible foreign policy. In a foreign policy, credibility is also very important, whether the agreements are oral or written.

We have been a signatory to the protection of human rights, civic rights, political rights, economic, social, cultural, and religious rights, but, unfortunately, in the domestic jurisdiction, the Government has embarked on a so-called Online Safety Bill and also on an Anti-Terrorism Bill, which destroy the very essence of democracy, the freedom of speech, the freedom of thought, the freedom of affiliation to political parties and expressing ones vision and wishes.

Sir, I think it is very important that Sri Lanka's Foreign Policy, in actual fact, walks the talk; 0 The sine quo non for a successful foreign policy or the indispensable requirement for an achievement-oriented foreign policy is, credibility. We need to have credibility, internationally and domestically. So, I think we have to commit ourselves to protect human rights. Today, I am wearing this shawl as a symbol of Sri Lankas wish for international peace and security as well as in the Middle East. We condemn unconditionally the attacks on civilians perpetrated by all actors and stakeholders on both sides of the divide; we condemn those heinous attacks.

Hon. Minister, I would like to use this opportunity to say that we, on this side of the aisle, believe in a two-

2821 2822

State solution as far as the Israeli-Palestinian issue is concerned. Throughout the history, we have had the War of Independence, the Suez War in 1956, the Six-Day War, if I remember correct, in 1967, the Yom Kippur War in 1973 and in the latter part of the 70s and in the early 80s, several wars in Lebanon. As a result of that, we have had many agreements: the Camp David Accords, the Oslo Accords and the Abraham Accords. Many politicians, both Israeli and Palestinian, who had been in the extremes have come to the middle.

The Hon. (Prof.) G.L.Peiris was the Foreign Minister. He called me and asked whether I could be the Minister-in-Attendance for Hon.Imran Khan. So, I took that opportunity to make representation to him and told him, Please, make some representation to the Government and tell that it is illogical, it is against the WHO" All of us said that. So, I did what is in my power.

My religion has taught me three things. You can try to prevent any illegality or something injustice. You try to do it; if you cannot do it, raise your voice. If you cannot do that, then raise within yourself and say that you are against it. My religion in the Holy Quran says that Allah will not burden you beyond what you can bear. So, I had two choices: give up and run away, or stay back and fight. I am glad that we stood back, fought and made some sense at the end of the day and because of that we were able to give a decent burial to 3,500 people in Oddamavadi. It is very important that you must know both sides of the divide. You only see your side of the story, but others have gone through more pain than that staying there and fighting.

The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris was in the Cabinet and I raised it several times again and again. I am thankful, the Opposition took up that stand and our Members also took up that stand. That was a mistake and we must not commit that kind of mistake in the future.

Thank you.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC) Sir, I have just a couple of clarifications.

First of all, I salute my Friends position that they have now given up the demand for separatism and that they want a dignified living within a unitary Sri Lanka. So, that is their position now. We will stand by that and will work towards that with you. Again, I salute that position. But, unfortunately, as I told you even yesterday, I had a different experience during a discussion, where we wanted to create a Sri Lankan awareness and build bonds with our diaspora, a representative from a country, a very highly educated lady, was still talking about separatism. So, I was disappointed because the whole purpose of the discussion was lost when that happened.

Secondly, I agree with you that our relationship with India is very important for us. India stood with us during a very difficult time for us, and if not for the Indian support, we would not have come back so fast. Therefore, we will not do anything that will threaten the legitimate Indian security concerns. We are very clear on that.

In the meantime, we are discussing everything with everyone and that is why we have introduced a Standard Operating Procedure - SOP - to grant diplomatic permission for everyone. The vessels are not just coming here for research. They work with one of the agencies in Sri Lanka. They identify the areas of research and come. Therefore, we will ensue that none of the Indian legitimate security concerns will be threatened. We do not want to do that; we do not want to have an unstable area here. A prosperous India is good for Sri Lanka and vice versa. We do agree with that.

Thirdly, as far as human rights are concerned, I think it is important that all of us come to some sort of terms with devolution, agree on some criteria across the party line and deliver it. There is very little that the Foreign Ministry can do for it. As a political decision, the entire Parliament must get together and do it without doing politics with that. It is time that we come to a final solution on that. I do agree with that. I am sure, the Hon. Manusha Nanayakkara, Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment and his Ministry will understand the problems faced by our Tamil youth in your area. So, it is our duty as the Sri Lankan State to provide equal opportunity for all Sri Lankans. So, Hon. Adaikkalanathan, I am sure they will continue to do that and you can talk to the Ministry of Labour and Foreign Employment and expedite a solution to the people in your area, whom you have identified as victims of injustice.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Hon. Amirthanathan Adaikkalanathan, can you make your comment fast?

( ) (The Hon. Amirthanathan Adaikkalanathan) , . , . .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC) Sir, with your permission, I would like to say that the fisheries problem is a long-standing matter. It is a sensitive issue. Hon. Member, whatever the decision that we have to take, it has to also be acceptable to the fishing community in your area, because the problem is in your area, particularly in the North and the East. So, with the officials of the Ministry of Fisheries and all of you, we will have a consultation and find a way. A practical solution needs to be found on this. The Hon. Prime Minister did not say that he had given that solution. He said that among many solutions proposed, one solution was licencing; that is what he said - not that he was going to give licences or anything like that. So, we need to practically agree on this. We have told that the bottom trawling should stop. But we cannot do that.

Secondly, Sir, I have spoken to the Navy. Unfortunately, the Navy is saying that a sheer number of

2845 2846

vessels, around 300, come in and they cannot practically stop every vessel. That is why we need to be pragmatic on the ground. We will convene a meeting among the Members of Parliament of the two districts, officials of the Ministry of Fisheries and the officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We will form a solution which is acceptable to all. Thank you.

Whereupon THE HON. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and THE HON. SAMANPRIYA HERATH took the Chair.

[1.34 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Yadamini Gunawardena) Hon. Presiding Member, at the very outset, I must say as a Member of the MEP, a pioneering party in the formation of the Foreign Policy of this country, that we are very much for the non-aligned policy and also for continuing with the friends-only policy in international relations because we never intend to invest or take sides in the global political scenario.

Therefore, we must condemn any kind of inhuman, barbaric killings or assassinations done under the pretext of bringing liberty or liberation to a certain section of community. We must clearly state that this Government will continue with the non-aligned, friends with all Foreign Policy we have strengthened over the last few decades because throughout history, we have seen that Sri Lanka has succeeded only in continuing with that non-aligned policy whenever we were at crossroads, where we had to make decisions as to how to continue in the global arena.

Having said that, I must also congratulate the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs and his able team working under the leadership of the Hon. President for having been able to negotiate and win support from so many different sectors across the world. Especially during a time when Sri Lanka is faced with a grave economic crisis, officially declaring bankruptcy about 16 months ago, we have been able to, more or less, get support from all quarters across the world. Therefore, it is our duty to thank the countries that have gone out of their way to support and assist Sri Lanka during this difficult period, especially our regional neighbours - India, Pakistan and other countries in the SAARC region, China, Japan, the Paris Club, the EU and also other western countries who extended support towards Sri Lanka on humanitarian grounds to make sure that we sail through these turbulent times into a more manageable situation.

Having said that, I must also congratulate the foreign office. I think they are extremely busy round the year doing their extreme best to somehow bring Sri Lanka into a more stable situation. Therefore, I would like to propose as a Member of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on International Relations that Parliament should take interest in developing a Parliamentary Foreign Office, maybe with the collaboration of the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute, which is now in the able hands of a former foreign secretary, who had been a career diplomat, to create new synergies because there are quite a number of able people, a large segment, outside the Foreign Service and the foreign office, who are globally recognized for the contributions they have made in the international arena, in the Chambers and other outfits - emerging academics and students of international relations - and who could actually help in an immense way to renegotiate the terms of our treaties. I think we have about three different faculties in the country coming up. Parliament should provide a platform

2865 2866

together with the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute to develop a foreign office for international relations in Parliament in this complex situation.

As Parliamentarians, we must take a better interest in developing friendship associations with other countries. During the last one year, I know that quite a few friendship associations have done their extreme duty to build new bridges, bridges that never existed before and which have never been even thought of before. It was a crisis time and every Parliamentarian contributed in this effort towards building bridges. I think there is a lot of capacity among the Parliamentarians and maybe, with proper guidance and support from the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute, a new foreign office should be set up in Parliament.

There are one or two areas on which I want to add a few thoughts. One of our key ambassadors in the international arena has not been properly tapped or recognized. That is the ambassador of "Ceylon Cinnamon". "Ceylon Cinnamon" can not only be a trade commodity which could bring in a lot of revenue to the country, but also an ambassador that could give us access to over 25 or 30 countries and territories of the Hispanic world. "Ceylon Cinnamon" is part and parcel of their culture and it could create avenues to attract over 500 million of the world population. But, so far, we have not embarked on that mission. The Friendship Associations of Parliament have been requesting for a Mission in Madrid for the last decade. I think the first Resolution was adopted in Parliament almost a decade ago. But, for ten years or more, we have not been able to even set up a trade office in Madrid, that being the Capital of the Hispanic world. Therefore, that is food for thought. Also, there are so many other areas that I would wish to talk about, but as I am constrained by a time limit of ten minutes, I have to touch only upon the critical issues.

Another area is this. If you look back the last 12 months of the year, you would see that two out of the three richest people in the world have invested US Dollar 62 billion in satellites of the Global Positioning System. Why? Because in the coming years and decades, it has a key role to play in international relations. Otherwise, no individual would invest US Dollar 62 billion in that. Yes, it is for navigation, to detect climate changes, communication and also for international defence systems. Obviously, the foreign office would have been a busy place for the last 12 months, but unfortunately, we have not focused on that area. Sri Lanka, being a pioneering signatory to UNOOSA, United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs, in Vienna, Austria, our Embassy being just five minutes away from its headquarters and one of the honorary citizens of Sri Lanka being a pioneer in this sector, we have not actually tapped into the vast areas we could develop our relations on. That is a critical area for international relations in the coming years and decades.

That is why I said, maybe, a Parliament Foreign Office could address these issues much more frequently with more synergy especially in collaboration with the

Arthur C. Clarke Institution for Modern Technologies and the Gamini Corea Foundation. As you know, Dr. Gamini Corea was a pioneer in developing new trade regulations for the world through the South-South Cooperation. However, we did not see their compassion towards small countries like ours during the COVID period. Through trade regulations and shipping formulas, they continued to make staggering amounts of profit. As a president of an overseas country mentioned, they earned over thousand per cent of profits. But, we have not been able to develop on the South-South Cooperation and extend it to the areas which Sri Lankans had contributed immensely in the past to develop. One such area is the Law of the Sea, to which our top diplomat Mr. Amerasinghe made an immense contribution. However, the laws have changed over the last 30 to 40 years, but the Parliament of Sri Lanka has not been able to make the necessary amendments to suit the present day Regulations.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , 0

( ) (The Hon. Yadamini Gunawardena) Hon. Presiding Member, I am winding up.

Finally, I just want to congratulate the Hon. President for taking a very important step towards addressing climate change issues, winning the support of the entire international community in that regard. Climate change will affect all aspects of Sri Lanka, not just the ocean waters and agriculture, but all aspects. I think the Hon. President has taken lead in that and put Sri Lanka back on the map; Sri Lanka should give leadership in the international arena. Sri Lanka, in the past 75 years as well as in the long history that runs into thousands of years, has shown the leadership in the international arena. Therefore, I think this should be congratulated on.

I would now like to wind up by thanking you, Sir, for allocating me time to participate in this important Debate.

[2.56 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Vadivel Suresh) Thank you very much, Hon. Presiding Member. First of all, let me thank the President for having appointed me as the Senior Advisor to the President. It is the first time in the history of Sri Lanka that a Tamil person from upcountry has been appointed to such a position. So, I am thanking the President on behalf of the upcountry Tamil people.

Sir, I must say a few words about the Hon. Manusha Nanayakkara, Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment. He is doing a wonderful service in the Ministry. With my experience as a trade unionist in the last 35 years, I have noticed that he is handling and settling issues by introducing new systems according to the modern world and expectations of the international organizations. I do not have many things to speak about the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I am very proud of this gentleman, the Hon. Manusha Nanayakkara - I am not talking about party politics - because I saw the way you handled and sorted out issues, especially of plantation-sector workers. They were recognized because of you . Before you took over, plantation workers were paralyzed. After you took over only, we were recognized as a union. With that strength, we are fighting and working for our rights. So, on behalf of the plantation workers, I am thanking you and your entire team including the Commissioner General of Labour and the Secretary to the Ministry.

[3.07 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, I wish to speak with regard to both the Ministries, but I will start my initial comments with regard to the Ministry of Labour and Foreign Employment.

Particularly, the Hon. Jagath Pushpakumara replied to an issue raised by a Government Tamil Member from Batticaloa. That Hon. Member actually raised an issue which I also wished to raise, and that is regarding the sending of employees from here to Korea and Japan. There are, according to the website, 6,500 Sri Lankans who have gone to South Korea and out of that, Hon. Minister, the number from the North and the East is miniscule. The Hon. Jagath Pushpakumara, in trying to explain, stated that there is a certain amount of capacity-building to be done, particularly with regard to language, before they go. But, there are absolutely no such centres in the North and the East. As a result, the people in the North and the East are not even aware of these employment schemes. These employment schemes are very lucrative. We are talking about the North and the East as a war-affected area, where the people are suffering and economically, they are already 35 years behind. So, I appeal to you, Hon. Minister, -

( ) (The Hon. Manusha Nanayakkara) Can I give you a reply now?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Yes, but do not take my time.

( ) (The Hon. Manusha Nanayakkara) No, no. Hon. Member, in the North and the East, we do have training centres in Ampara, Jaffna, Batticaloa, Vavuniya and Trincomalee. , 7,056 0 0 , 0 0 0 0 , 0

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I understand that. In fact, that is what the Hon. State Minister also said. But, the thing is, Hon. Minister, we are already talking about an area that is lagging behind.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) , 0 What I am trying to say is that the onus is on you because there is no capacity there; there is a massive lack of capacity.

So, you have to create awareness for people to realize that they also can actually participate in this. I can tell you responsibly that no such awareness programme is there. Actually, Hon. Minister, until you mentioned this, I have not been not aware of this; none of us are aware of it. The Hon. Viyalanderan is a Government State Minister from Batticaloa. He got up and said the same thing which I am saying now. I do not know whether you understood him because he said that in Tamil, but he said the same

2897 2898

thing that I am saying. So, I am saying this with responsibility that there is a massive lack of awareness. You might be having offices there, but they are not functioning, in the sense that people are not aware of it to even approach those. Anyway, that is something I want to flag to you because the people there had been affected by war and need a sort of income, and you must make that effort.

( ) (The Hon. Manusha Nanayakkara) 0 0 , 0 , 0

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Thank you very much. I appreciate that answer, Hon. Minister. So, that is the main point I want to raise with regard to that Ministry.

The next matter is with regard to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Sir, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has presented their Annual Report along with the Action Plan and with regard to Missions, in very catchy terms, they say, The Promotion, Projection and Protection of Sri Lankas national interests internationally, in accordance with the Foreign Policy of the Government and to advise the Government on managing foreign relations in keeping with Sri Lankas national interests. Those are nice words, but the question is, what these national interests are because the key is what you identify as national interests. If national interests, Sir, are not plural in character, which recognize that Sri Lanka is a multinational country and that it needs to encompass all the nationalities within Sri Lanka and their interests, then for those who are left out or who perceive themselves to be left out, those national interests become hostile. A good example is that in 2015, the Tamil National Peoples Front, that is, our party, warned the Tamil people about the then Governments peace efforts. At that time, primarily, when it came to dealings with Geneva, it was Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who was in charge and the Foreign Minister was the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera. We warned the Tamil people, when the then Government went and agreed to co-sponsor the Resolution in Geneva, that that was a bogus gesture. We were the only Tamil Party which said that those efforts would go nowhere. So, the person who was leading that was the then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is now the President of the country. When he takes over as the President of the country and is the Head of everything, the same Foreign Ministry goes to Geneva and rejects those Resolutions and instead says - like what

the Minister of Foreign Affairs said this morning in reply to some other Member's comments - We will safeguard our sovereignty and our interests. You all sponsored the Resolution; nobody else came and sponsored it for you. So, you all sponsored it, but now, when it is convenient for you, you say that that Resolution is hostile and that it is an impingement of the countrys sovereignty. That Resolution, a lot of Tamil people actually thought was good. We were the only ones who warned that that was bogus. When this term national interests is interpreted in a way where sovereignty is seen as protecting only the interests of the Sinhala majority, when the Tamil people thought that there was a glimmer of hope through that Resolution and when, subsequently, the person who was in charge at that time to bring that Resolution for co-sponsoring, the then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, now, as President, sends his Foreign Minister to say that they reject it, what is that national interest?

After 75 years, of which 35 years had been bloodshed and which has, today, bankrupted this country, we are still in the same deep pit and are not prepared to come out of it. What is wrong with that Resolution? The whole point why we criticize that Resolution is because it is in the Human Rights Council, which cannot compel a government that is not willing to cooperate like Sri Lanka; they can just pass Resolutions and that is about it. But, technically speaking, what is wrong with that Resolution? It is asking for accountability. Actually, our criticism about that Resolution is that it is asking the Government to be accountable, to carry out an accountable mechanism. Our complaint all along has been that when the Government or the State has been a party to the conflict, obviously, they are not going to carry out an accountability process, as we can see now. But, what is wrong with asking for accountability, if wrongs have been done? Last week and right throughout this week, we have been talking about the disaster and the genocide that is taking place in Gaza; this House was unanimous in talking about Gaza, in support of the Palestinians. That same thing happened to this country. The Tamil people in the North and East were the Gazans of today. So, why can we not ask for accountability? Why can we not say, Look, excesses had happened and let us look at those. Is it not important for every single person who is serving in the military also to feel that he could go out and say, I am clean; I am not an accused person; I am not a war criminal? I would think so. If this Parliament is said to be corrupt, I would want myself to be checked so that my name is cleared. Does the military not require that? Is it not in their interest?

So, Hon. State Minister of Foreign Affairs, it is in the interest of this country to not dismiss those questions of accountability and to not dismiss the cries for a political solution. It is "in the interest" of this country.

Take a look at where we are today? We are bankrupt, but we are spending over 15 per cent of the Budget on defence and public security. That 15 per cent could be diverted to other most important Ministries, which are crucial for production and export. It is 15 per cent of the annual Budget! You will never be able to do that, Hon. State Minister, for as long as you all and the State feel that the Tamil people are aggrieved because you will go on thinking, Oh my God, tomorrow, they might take up arms. We are not prepared to give anything. So, those people will not just keep quiet. Everything the Tamil people want or say will be seen as hostile and that is what is happening. When we want to commemorate our dead, for you all, it is the LTTE being revived. The red and yellow flags are the colours of Tamil nationalism. For you, they are LTTE colours because the LTTE had those colours in their flags. Everything is a question of paranoia for you all and it has fed into you all to an extent that you cannot get out of this rut you are in today. So, is this something wrong to ask for? Today, the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs said that there are Members in this House who still have separatist ideals? Who are those Members? Not a single party that is represented here aspires a separate State; they cannot. We are not fools. We know that all of you are waiting to throw us into the prison. We are not going to ask for that; nobody asks for that.

But, why do you say that? I am an unapologetic federalist; I insist that this country has to be transformed into a federal State because I feel that is the only way justice would be done. What is the separatism in federalism? He is a learned person in all ways, professionally as well, but for him to stand up as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and say that to talk about federalism is separatism, is that not wrong? And, pointing out the fact that that is wrong, does it make us racists? But, that is what is happening. With this policy of 75 years, which has estranged not only the Tamils, but, after the war, the Muslims as well, it is going to get worse, especially at a time when everybody is desperate because everybody is bankrupt. If you are going to rant up this nonsense, this rhetoric of racism, separatism and terrorism against the non-majority communities, you are going to estrange them more and more. Then, when the Sinhala majority become desperate financially, they also will get distracted; there are enough people who are trying to distract them to create violence and you all are feeding into it. I am saying this with utmost responsibility and with good intentions, not with bad intentions.

Then, I wish to say that this Annual Report states, International community's support for Sri Lankas measures to address economic challenges has contributed to the restoration and re-graduation of Sri Lankas economy. That is true; factually, that is correct. But, let me tell you why because we also speak to the international community. They are terrified that Sri Lanka, which is strategically located, will become a failed State. This is not something to boast about.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , 0

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) All right.

We are going around with a begging bowl and they are giving us money in the way they do, purely because they fear that Sri Lanka will become a failed State. So, these are not things to misinterpret and make it look as if you all have gained something big. Quite honestly, you all have not. - [Intteruption] Us, included. We have messed up and we are continuing to mess up. Even this time, the IMF gave severe warnings. All the economic indicators and global monitors have warned that this Budget is very ambitious and most likely would not be implementable. These are serious warnings because it was those same watchdogs who gave us the earlier warning and downgraded Sri Lanka, which created all the trouble. It is those same watchdogs who are waning us again. So, unless you decide that we have failed in the past 75 years and have to genuinely change, we would not get out of this rut.

Both the Hon. Minister and the Hon. State Minister of Foreign Affairs are individuals who I personally respect. I know the Hon. State Minister from childhood; I know his personal views and I have nothing to complain about his personal views. But, I must tell them that when it comes to State policy, there is a lot to change, especially with regard to the Foreign Policy.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , 0

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) The Hon. Minister is also financially very sound. He is one of the top lawyers in this country and he does not need to be in this mess, in politics. He must use his position to help those in the administration, who are genuinely capable of changing this system and having new thoughts. It is people like you all who can do it. So, do not be silent.

Thank you.

2901 2902

( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) It is just a clarification on what the Hon. G. G. Ponnambalam raised, why we, first, cosponsored UN Resolution No. 30/1 and thereafter, withdrew from that. I think, in this House itself, former President Maithreepala Sirisena had stated that he was also not aware of that Resolution and that Cabinet approval as well had not been sought for that Resolution.

Today, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, as a former Minister of Foreign Affairs, made a good speech, in which he explained how, by going for this co-sponsorship, it opened up for the international community to come and interfere in matters of Sri Lanka.

As far as the Hon. Members contention pertaining to federalism, that just because someone asks for federalism, whether I think he is a separatist, I would say, certainly not. Even if someone wants a separate State, as long as it is not done by using arms, that person is well within his rights. And, also he wanted to know whether we, the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe Government, believe that there should be devolution of power. Yes, certainly, we believe that there should be devolution of power and at what level, I do not know. That is something which we have to negotiate. Even if it is federalism, I think we have to have a mechanism to ensure that there is no secession, but certainly there should be devolution of power. That is why the Hon. President invited all parties represented in Parliament to come and have talks with him in order to see where we could stand as far as devolution of power is concerned.

[3.39 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Presiding Member, I think the Hon. Minister has a very difficult task ahead of him because, today, our country is bankrupt. And, when the country is bankrupt, it is very difficult to follow a strong economic policy. Today, we have to go around the world with a begging bowl because we are bankrupt. When a country is strong, economically, it could conduct a very straightforward foreign policy.

I remember, in the early 1950s when Sri Lanka was to sign the Rubber-Rice Agreement with China, the Americans opposed our signing it because no country was dealing with China at that time. But, because we were economically strong and we had a surplus of foreign exchange, we disregarded the concerns of America and signed it. That Agreement lasted for 30 years. Before that, when the Hon. J.R. Jayewardene was in Parliament, soon after the World War II, when the entire world, at San Francisco, told Japan that they must pay war reparations, it was J.R. Jayewardene who got up and said, Let us not take revenge. He quoted the Buddhist stanzaNahi verena verani and the whole world listened to him and the demand for reparations against Japan was dropped. Then, when the Hon. (Mrs.) Sirima Bandaranaike was Prime Minister, during the Indo-Pakistani War, when Pakistan asked for refuelling - though we were very close with India and the Hon. (Mrs.) Bandaranaike had a strong relationship with Mrs. Indira Gandhi and the Nehru family - she agreed and gave them refuelling facilities. Then, we were economically strong and had respect right round the world.

But, today, what is the situation? We are bankrupt, totally bankrupt! When we go to the UN, we do not have any respect; they have no regard for us. Now, in addition to the violations of human rights, today, we are accused of economic crimes - - as well. ; , adding insult to injury. So, how can we conduct a strong foreign policy? We have to listen to the big powers because we are going to them with a begging bowl. If we disregard their concerns, we will not get any support from the IMF. That is the sad situation today.

Now, take up the war crimes which are happening in Gaza. Sri Lankans are close to their Muslim community. In our heart of hearts, we bleed, our hearts bleed for the people in Gaza. But, can we get up and say that there are war crimes being commited in Gaza? Can we say that? We can say, but we have not said so. We always talk about the two-State solution, that is all. Two-state solution is far away. The present concern is the violation of human rights and war crimes committed in Gaza daily.

Daily, war crimes are taking place there. I concede that Hamas made the initial mistake of attacking the Israeli people. But, now, the Israelis have gone beyond that; they have exceeded the right of self-defence and are giving collective punishments - - , which is a war crime. But, we have not

said so at the UN; we have never uttered a word. Hon. Minister, we know the plight of the Jews: six million Jews were killed during the World War II. I hope, when you go to the UN next time, you will have the guts to ask, who killed the Jews? It was not the Asians or the Arabs. Jews were killed by the Europeans and they are the people who preach human rights to us today. That is an unfortunate situation. Therefore, as I said earlier, when the economy is weak, we are in a very bad situation. We cannot speak our mind out because we want help from the IMF and if we speak our mind out, we will not get the aid we want. I hope you would attend the Human Rights Council next week because I saw in the newspapers some time ago that you had given up on the Human Rights Council. Is that correct? I heard the top person saying, We will not go to the Human Rights Council in the future; I heard it myself. Therefore, I hope you would go there the next time and put the record straight.

Before I conclude, Sir, I would like to speak about cricket. Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, you are the Chairman of the Cabinet Subcommittee on on cricket. In that, one thing you all are discussing is about bringing reforms, the Chitrasiri Report and all that. I must tell you what they did in India. When a cricketer went to the Indian Supreme Court, the Court appointed an Interim Committee to carry out the reforms. So, my advice to you is, appoint an interim committee that is loyal to you - I am not telling you to accept our interim committee - and through them, do the reforms. As long as the Sri Lanka Cricket is there as it is, they would never support the reforms; they would sabotage those. So, appoint a new interim committee and carry out the reforms.

Then, I want to tell you an experience I had when I was the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs in the late 90s.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , 0 ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) I will conclude, Sir.

At that time, the LTTE forces were advancing towards Jaffna. I was the Deputy Foreign Minister and the Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar was ill in India; he was in India for one year. The LTTE forces came up to Pallai, nearly 40 kilometres from Jaffna. We did not have ammunition; we did not have guns. Major General Janaka Perera, who was the Commander at that time, spoke to me every day and asked, "Where are the guns and ammunition?" The LTTE forces were nearly 40 kilometres from Jaffna. We asked help from various countries. We asked help from our nearest neighbour.

What did they say? They said, We cannot give you guns and ammunition. We will give you ships to take the troops away; 0 But, fortunately for us, Pakistan, in the nick of time, gave us multi-barrel guns and we were able to send them to

Pallai and repel the insurgents. That was the closest they came to achieving a separate State. If we had removed our Army that day from the North, it would have been like Bangladesh; there would have been a separate State. But, thanks to Pakistan, it did not happen. The Hon. Kadirgamar, who was my Minister, said in his last speech in this House, We have two real friends and named China and Pakistan because they helped us in our hour of need. Thank you very much.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC) Sir, just give me a minute.

First of all, thank you very much, Hon. Member, for reminding of those horrific days we had to go through in the past. In the meantime, the position of the Sri Lankan Government on what is taking place in Gaza has been consistent. We have voted in favour of all the UN Resolutions calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. In that, we have made our interventions and our Permanent Representative is the Chairman of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories appointed by the UN. So, we have done our part and our support is consistent with everybody; I am glad that we have extended that support across the board.

There is one more clarification I need to make. My State Minister informed me that my Friend, the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam, had said that I had made a remark this morning that there are some Members of this Parliament who have separatist tendencies. No, I did not say so. I ask the Hon. Ponnambalam to please go through my speech made this morning, getting it from Hansard. What I did say was that there are some elements among the international community, among the diaspora, which is obvious, who advocate separatism and advised not to become prey to that, leading another generation of young Tamils into disintegration. That is what I said because, yesterday, we had an engagement with the Sri Lankan diaspora in different countries to get their support to rebuild Sri Lankas economy as well as to support each other. So many people made submissions at that and there was one lady representing the NDA, who made a speech full of ideologies supporting separatism, a separate State or a separate homeland concept. Then, I said that is not going to take us anywhere and that it will again bring us back to square one. We have come out of it now. I am glad that all the three TNA MPs who spoke said, We do not advocate separatism. We advocate maximum devolution within a Unitary State. The Hon. Ponnambalam has always stood for his right to advocate federalism. That is his right. Sri Lankas Supreme Court had ruled in their Judgment that within a Unitary State or a united Sri Lanka, people can advocate federalism and that it does not amount to a separate State. So, I just wanted to clarify that for the record. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Sir, before I start my speech, let me clarify that the TNA's position has always been maximum devolution within a united framework of Sri Lanka. We have never said "unitary". So, I just want to correct that because the Hon. Minister said that the TNA Members who spoke said "unitary". We have said that maximum possible devolution could be discussed within a united framework of Sri Lanka. So, I want to correct that.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) 0 14 0

[4.19 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Presiding Member, today, when we are debating the Votes of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the first thing that strikes me is the ranking of the Sri Lankan passport. The Sri Lankan passport is ranked 97th among the global passports. In the Hanley Passport Index, which is probably the worlds top Index in ranking passports, we are ranked 97th. What does it mean? It means that if you have a passport of one of the top countries in the world, you have access to 40 countries without visa. Sri Lanka has very little access to other countries, to get a visa on arrival. Among those few countries are Pakistan, Singapore and Dominica. I was in Dubai this week and even to go to Dubai, now, you need a visa. So, that is the real state of our passport.

If our Foreign Policy is to be measured in terms of what needs to be done, a lot of things need to be done. I know that we are a member of the Non-Aligned Movement and we have a very proud history about that, but NAM is only a platform. Today, our Foreign Policy has to be multi-aligned with nations and entities which currently hold and wield global power. Most countries in the world are like that. They are in numerous associations, not like being in the bipolar world, into which we were born. Such an approach must be both strategic in content and long-term as well as tactical in its application in line with our national interests and aspirations, I emphasize, of all the communities living in this country. Therefore, it is prudent to embrace a multilateral system which promotes the global world order governed by the rule of law and international norms. The United Nations Charter reminds us of the non-use of force, peaceful resolution and settlement of conflicts.

Sir, Sri Lankas national security is not a military endeavour. We are a little island nation. Our national security largely rests with the Foreign Policy of the country and the role the Ministry of Foreign Affairs actually plays. Where appropriate, Sri Lanka may enter into defence, security, naval and non-military agreements to boost the countrys national and maritime security. Such collaboration will facilitate networking opportunities for the countrys Navy and ports to bring more value to the economy. So, our Foreign Policy must now, as a strategy, have economic diplomacy at its core in policy formulation. Sri Lanka must trade with all the States for mutual benefit and we have to maintain our open-market strategy. We know that, maybe, 10 to 15 per cent of our population lives overseas. Largely, they live overseas for economic reasons. Therefore, they are very important for us.

Furthermore, we also need to be mindful that we should have good relations with all our neighbouring countries. In geopolitics of today, this is the challenge that a small country like ours faces in decisions we have to take. However, in building those relationships, first, we need to acknowledge our own constraints, both internal

2921 2922

and external. There are internal constraints in terms of the state of governance and the institutions in this country. The rule of law, the economy, human rights, reconciliation, politico-military-religious nexus and related problems, climate and environmental realities, social issues in terms of health, aging population and human resource constraints are our internal issues. We also need to understand that, externally, we have limitations such as market, skilled human resources and the immediate neighbourhood and beyond. So, we have to re-establish our credibility. That is critical, both internally and externally. Rebuilding internal credibility is essential in restoring trust and confidence, particularly among the minorities in this country. Throwing shots at each other across the Well of Parliament is not really going to help us. That is very unfortunate. We also have to work with our bilateral partner nations which have been close to us. Even countries like Japan, the USA and Canada, for decades, have been working closely with us.

Sir, we must face the fact that we have to uphold domestic responsibilities because if we do not uphold domestic responsibilities, our sovereignty erodes; it is not for any other reason. There is no point in blaming other countries for this. Taking measures to rebuild and regain our sovereignty must be of critical importance. Therefore, we need an authentic rebranding of this country. I do not want to hold the Sri Lankan passport ranked 97th in the world when some of us, who had even studied and lived abroad, have the option of obtaining other citizenships and passports. We did not because we want to rebuild this country. We do not want our passport to be at the 97th place. We need to rebrand our country. We must identify and stand to represent fundamental values. This endeavour must be an authentic one, where Sri Lanka could say that it is democratic, multiethnic, multilingual and stands for human rights. It has to do what it says and build a reputation for being so and not come here and just criticize every institution, including the United Nations, the UNHRC and all those other parties. If we do the right thing, we do not have to be really concerned about others.

We need to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific Region with active and unimpeded sea lanes and ports. Among other things, we have the potential to be inter-connected, secure, resilient and a prosperous region. Sri Lanka must, as the Chair of the Indian Ocean Rim Association, leverage the opportunity in resolving the multitude of regional concerns in consultation with member countries, as we lead them. Sri Lanka must pursue its commitments to the Bali Process and we have to position ourselves as a regional leader in advocating the fight against human trafficking - this matter is thrown at us when we go to other countries - people smuggling and related transnational crimes. We have to work really hard in rebranding ourselves and our country.

We must uphold the principles of the Indo-Pacific Strategy of the US. What are those principles? Problems are dealt with openly; rules are agreed upon transparency and applied fairly; people, ideas and goods flow freely across the land, cyberspace and the open seas with

governance that is transparent and responsive to the people of this country. That is the foreign policy we need. We must be committed to regional integration. The SAARC region is the least integrated part of the world. And, unfortunately, it is out of our hands because of Indias relationship with Pakistan. But, we must pay attention to BIMSTEC, the only functional regional platform at this moment. Also, the late Hon. J.R. Jayewardene explored our relationship with ASEAN and I will call upon the Government to explore our relationship, even 30 to 40 years later, with ASEAN. The world order has changed and other small countries have taken these very drastic measures. So, we need to think about these anew. Traditionally, the close and friendly relations with India must be nurtured with a view of benefiting from India's rise as a major economic and political power. India is very important to us and our relationship with India is one to be projected with exclusivity and one that Sri Lanka has engaged with over the millennia. I do not think there is any debate about it, whether we are in Government or in Opposition.

Sir, we have a long-standing friendship with China but in different forms and manifestations, especially in the context of the rise of China in this Century as an economic power. Sri Lanka joined the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative as a mutually beneficial enterprise. However, there are concerns over some projects started in Sri Lanka, that despite the enormous cost to both Sri Lanka and China, they are yet to yield the expected results. I have been a critic of some of those infrastructure projects because those were on long-term debt rather than on equity. Therefore, we have to pay the debt and the results of the wisdom of engaging in some of those will come in over 20 to 40 years later. In this context, the debt burden of Sri Lanka is a major cause for concern, though the debt debacle is totally Sri Lankan made and China is not central to that. I have to make that absolutely clear. We had the option of taking or not taking debt. But still, we now call upon China to take the initiative to create a path for us to recover from the debacle we are actually in.

Sir, I would also like to pose a couple of questions to the Hon. Minister who is here to respond. What is really happening to the Millennium Challenge Corporation - MCC - and the Status of Forces Agreement - SOFA? How are the negotiations going on? Are we concluding them? Presently, Singapore is the hub for ships. However, Sri Lanka has the potential to become the regional hub for those ships with suitable international diplomatic trade engagements. Sri Lanka must pursue such international engagements. We do not have to run away anymore because for a long time, we have been pushed to a corner. Our priority has to be the creation of society in this country, where all our children could live because it has a future. That means, engaging with the international community, thinking out of the box and not going back to executing our archaic Foreign Policy and not being bullied by anybody because of that. Therefore, we have to think about how we are going to engage in that. We gave Singapore that opportunity 40 years ago. We also have natural ports in this country. We need to generate income. Therefore, we have to look at how we

2923 2924

[ ]

2023 07

are going to engage in it. Therefore, Sri Lanka must pursue such international engagements, particularly in a situation where domestic politics have impacted on the outlook of the country, as was the case with the MCC. I remember during the Presidential Election, how politicians got up, just screamed and shouted about the MCC and then actually destroyed a good opportunity. But, let us not do that in our engagements on using our ports to really make money.

Sir, I would like to conclude by referring to some operational modalities, which I would like to leave for you to answer, Hon. Minister. I heard the Hon. Minister saying in his speech this the morning that we need to maintain an ideal mix of 65 per cent of career diplomats and 35 per cent of others. I want to say that under the foreign policy of the SJB, we wanted to keep make it 75 per cent of career diplomats because that is their job, that is what they are going to be trained for and that is what they are encouraged to do. Our defence, our frontline in economic prosperity is going to be the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. So, for a thriving economy, international trade and finance, Sri Lanka must appoint qualified and experienced career diplomats to strategic markets including new markets. We need to do that in consultation with the Department of Commerce and the Department of Trade and Investment Policies as it is imperative to have an economic diplomacy strategy compiled upon the pillars of investment, trade and tourism.

I would say that the recruitment process which has been going on in the past few weeks, we need to relook at. Sri Lanka has a mentality where even if one is going to do dancing, singing and other aesthetic subjects, we only look at his Z-score. I say that very soon, we would have people who could answer papers but could not sing or dance. The same thing is going to happen to our Foreign Ministry.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Okay, I will conclude quickly, Sir.

So, we need to look into that.

Then, the appointment of relatives of politicians to diplomatic positions must be halted, there is no question about it. It does not matter whether it is done by that side or this side, but it must be halted. Also, appointment of defence officials who have certain allegations, proven or unproven, it does not matter, to diplomatic positions should not be made. I am asking even from the Committee on High Posts how they could appoint such people? We must move away from individuals to principles to see that this country go forward.

Hon. Minister, in the Sri Lankan Consular Service, basic things like showing courtesy in answering the phone

have to be improved since there is a lack of it. I must commend the Consul General of Sri Lanka to Dubai, whom I did not meet during my recent visit, but I heard about the wonderful job he is doing there. I say that we need to look at all these.

Sir, the President goes around castigating the Quad, AUKUS and so on and so forth. I do not think those are wise moves given the Indo-Pacific Strategy. Even Bangladesh recently had its own one and ASEAN also had its own one.

Earlier, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was in the front in answering questions posed under the RTI. Now, it is far behind in doing that and excuses are given. The website does not give the RTI officials stationed across the country. I would suggest that we attend to those things and improve our services because we need to serve the Sri Lankans living overseas, who are a big asset to this country and not a liability, as people used to think they were.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. Ali Sabry Raheem. You have eight minutes.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC) Sir, give me a minute to answer the Hon. Member, please.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes, Hon. Minister? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC) A couple of questions were asked. First of all, I thank the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne for making a very interesting speech and making good suggestions, many of which we will take into account.

As far as working with regional bodies, we have already applied for RCEP and we are working with the different member countries to get access to RCEP. There are also suggestions that we should explore joining BRICS. We are looking at that, too, and will probably go to the Cabinet with that suggestion. And, there was a good suggestion in the morning from one of the Members of the Government ranks that a foreign relations committee should be established here in Parliament to take bipartisan decisions. For example, with regard to agreements like the Millennium Challenge Corporation and SOFA, if one party takes a decision, the other party opposes it. Therefore, it is time that we take up such matters at a foreign relations committee and then take

2925 2926

policy decisions so that those decisions would not be changed when governments change or other things happen. So, we have worked on that.

As I said in the morning, it is not that we are aspiring, but we have already recruited three batches as heads of Missions. We have achieved a target of 65 per cent of career diplomats. If you look at the numbers per se, 65 per cent of those are career diplomats and, unfortunately, we have a huge shortage of diplomats in the Service. We have a cadre of 264 diplomats, which was approved about 10 years ago, whereas now, we have only 164. Finally, yes, we are in the process of recruiting them. The Interview Panel was telling me that out of the total marks, just 3.1 per cent is given for the performance at the interview. Out of 800 marks, 700 marks go for the written test, 75 marks go for certificates, for their MA or BSc or any other qualifications and for performance, just 25 marks. Therefore, I think it is time that we relook at the marking scheme. So, thank you very much for those suggestions. We will certainly take them into consideration. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. Ali Sabry Raheem. You have eight minutes.

Hon. Presiding Member, I am happy to speak today at the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Labour and Foreign Employment under the Budget, 2024.

Before I move on to the Ministry of Labour and Foreign Employment, I just want to bring a matter to the notice of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Hon. Minister, the Embassies of the Middle Eastern countries in Colombo provide very poor support to our workers. You would not believe that those workers apply for leave from their places of work to go to those Embassies to get their documentation done. The Embassies do not even support them to get photocopies. Since there are no shops with such facilities close to the embassies, our workers have to waste the whole day to get the necessary photocopies from other places to get their work done. There is a complaint given to me in that regard and please look into that. This problem prevails mostly in the Qatar Embassy in Colombo. People also say that when dealing with such problems, the other embassies like the Indian High Commission and the High Commission for the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh are faster than us. So, please look into this matter because our workers are going to work in those countries. To get these things done, they have to take a days leave from their places of work and bear a large expenditure to come in a three-wheeler or a rented car. Therefore, Hon. Minister, attend to this complaint, taking into consideration all these matters and rectify this situation.

Secondly, I would like to speak about the Ministry of Labour and Foreign Employment. 0 Sectoral Oversight Committee on Foreign Employment and Labour 0 Foreign Employment Bureau Section , O/L and A/L pass next step 0 500 0 workshop 0 , workshop , 500 0 0

I propose that after the O/Ls, it is good if the students could undergo training at a camp conducted by the National Cadet Corps or the National Youth Corps until their results are released. I think it takes about seven months for results to be released. So, you could give them a tranining for one year in such camps. In those camps, first of all, they should be taught self-discipline, foreign languages, improve their computer literacy and so on. Hon. Minister, you would not believe, but in countries like Korea, Singapore and Japan, students are being trained that way. Actually, they are not trained only in those subjects, but also given a two-year training in armed forces. Hon. Minister, I am not asking you to give them training in the armed forces, but they have to be trained in such a way that after the O/Ls, we produce a disciplined student so that the country will have disciplined people. You could start it, at least, from 2024. From then onwards, we could send some disciplined people to work abroad. For example, take the Filipinos who are employed in foreign countries. I do not know how they do their service. If you take the Middle East, the people there prefer to employ Filipinos than us because they are disciplined, know the language and they are skilled. Therefore, my request is for the Government to have a new policy, under which our workers could be trained for one year in centres like in the training camps I proposed earlier. During the last Government, they had a lot of National Youth Corps training centres with enough space. In those spaces, you can establish centres for language and other training and to teach them discipline and thereby, the country would prosper day by day.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , 0 ( ) (The Hon. Faizal Cassim) Actually, what I feel is that the training programmes in our country are conducted in a totally wrong way. If we can bring all those programmes under the control of one department, we can make the country prosper.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva. You have eight minutes.

[4.52 p.m.] () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Hon. Presiding Member, I regret that I had to get entangled with the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs in the morning; it was not my intention.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC) I, too, am sorry about that.

() ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Sir, I think the Hon. Minister wants to say something. Sir, why do you not give him the mike?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC) Hon. Member, my feelings are also the same. I do not think we should get into that kind of an entanglement.

Thank you.

() ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Yes, let us drop it.

All I want to say is this. Hon. Minister, what we tried to do was to reduce the time that it took for people get their work attended to. We did a survey. Earlier, it took six hours. People came from various parts of the world to get things done at the Ministry and we brought that time down to ten minutes with the Electronic Document Attestation System. I do not want to go into it, but all I want is to get this opening days notice into Hansard. Sir, I table* it.

Also I would like to table* a press release and a news report which state that that project won not only the Most Outstanding ICT Achievement Award, but also another award.

That is all I want to say. If there is any assistance I could offer you, Hon. Minister, I will be more than happy to help.

The next point I want to make is, you made a bit of a tongue in cheek remark. You said that I know only theory. But, theory matters. I will tell you why. We, recently, had the privilege of listening to one of the largest exporters from Vietnam. He highlighted five things which help increase Vietnam's FDI inflow and exports. As you know, in 1995, both our countries' exports were at three and a half billion US Dollars. Our country, this year, with the drop of about 20 per cent in exports, would be lucky if we could reach US Dollars 11 billion. But, it is expected that Vietnam might cross the US Dollars 400 billion target. So, there is something radically different in our approach.

One of the main points highlighted by that Vietnamese exporter was economic diplomacy. If you have not seen his presentation, Hon. Minister, I urge you to get it from the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce. It was done at the Sri Lanka Economic Summit. When we spoke to our diplomats, what we found was - they are obviously very well qualified like you said. When I was in office, actually the people whom I worked with in the Foreign Ministry were the smartest and they were really hardworking - that they really needed some additional help in converting themselves from Foreign Service officers to marketing officers for Sri Lanka.

The next one is a long story and I hope to table the relevant documents. This is about a programme conducted with the Harvard University. We started a programme called Dynamic Economic Diplomacy Online Course for 18 weeks. It was a collaboration between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Commerce and the Centre for International Development in Harvard Kennedy School. The goal of

this programme was to enable diplomats to play a more proactive role, spearheading the Governments new policies pursuing exports of US Dollars 20 billion by "Vision 2020". We are already in 2023 and are still at US Dollars 10 billion. It was an 18-week programme and in the Participation Agreement of this course, it is stated that this course is being offered by the Harvard Centre for International Development for the first time with Sri Lanka being the first country to engage in such a course. It had been developed to particularly help the countrys specific needs. It was signed on the 07th of March, 2017. Unfortunately, after the first round of this course, I do not know what had happened to it now.

I am not going to talk about anything else but that. Sir, I also table* this Summary Note on the 2017 Dynamic Economic Diplomacy Course, which I would like you to take a look at, Hon. Minister.

There, what we tried to do was to connect the front office, meaning the diplomats, and the back office, which is essentially the BOI, the EDB and other government agencies. During the first three weeks of that course, we tried to tell them why it is important. Then, during the next three weeks, we taught them theory, the practice and what Singapore did in the 1960s and what Costa Rica did in the 1990s. We took those two examples. Sir, there is a brilliant article written by Prof. Sanjaya de Silva, who is a friend of mine at Bard University. There, he is asking why we want to compare Sri Lanka to Singapore and not to Costa Rica, which is of similar size, has similar type of people and a similar geography and explains what they did and how they became successful. So, we took both those examples. Then, during the next four weeks, we talked about how we connect the front office and the back office and it was practised.

We got 49 diplomats to participate in that course and 39 of them finished it. The rule was "300, 30, 3 and 1: 300 contacts yield 30 discussions, 3 active engagements, and 1 deal". It is very difficult, but unless we actually go out and try it, we would not achieve anything. Cold-calling was something that they had never done. They said, We cannot cold-call. How can we do it? The actual comments given by our 39 diplomats and how successful they were will surprise you, Hon. Minister. I will just read the list. For instance, in Guangzhou, five connections with solar sector; In Singapore, 10 connections with real estate sector; in Saudi Arabia, four connections with the food sector; in Mumbai, 10 connections with the pharmaceuticals sector; in Sweden, seven connections in the auto parts sector et cetera. So, in economic or commercial diplomacy, the lesson you learn is that you need a new structure, has to have targets and those targets must actually be meaningful and could be met. They also learned the importance of knowledge in outreach. You know that investors are knowledgeable. So, if investors know about what is happening, we need to be even more knowledgeable to tell them why they are,

sometimes, wrong and how we could change those. Also, they had a better understanding why Sri Lanka has not done well. I will read out one comment partly: Our embassies and missions are just not set up to really facilitate this kind of work. I think that is an important point. So, how do you restructure this system? Like the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne said, sharing culture and all that is fine, but our target should be to sell Sri Lankas products overseas and get FDIs to flow in here. Then, their ideas on why Sri Lanka needs to continue doing this work were sought and one diplomats said, I am planning to continue this work and also the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Colombo has already informed me to meet at least three investors and five business leaders per month.. But, do we do that? No, we do not.

Hon. Minister, you spoke about the need to restructure our debt. I completely agree with you.

We cannot continue to get loans and develop this country. We must attract FDIs.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Then, under "I CAN DO THIS!", the summary note I tabled states what another diplomat said with regard to cold-calling. He had said, "I would not have realized that I had it in me to really embark on this course of cold-calling. When I saw the document from Mr. Andrews..." - Prof. Matt Andrews is the gentleman at Harvard who actually conducted this course for us- "....saying to cold-call I had serious doubts, but Jinko Solar is one of those companies that responded well to the cold-calling. They had convened an upper management meeting to discuss the potential of investing in Sri Lanka, which is a first step even if it didn't work out."

There is also an Annex in that summary note, which I would like you to go through, Hon. Minister. That Annex gives the assignments actually done by the diplomats: V. Krishnamoorthy and Yasantha de Silva in Chennai,India and Saroja Sirisena and Vireshika Bandara in Mumbai, India. It gives the assignments in London, South Korea and France as well.

Then, an Hon. Member mentioned Mr. Alexi Gunasekeras name and I might as well say that I, too, have found out the good work that is being carried out by him. There are our diplomats around the world who are doing a good job of work. They are your asset. You just need to refocus them towards commercial and economic diplomacy.

Since I do not have any more time, finally, I want to appreciate all the good work done by the officials of the

entire Ministry of Foreign Affairs, from Mrs. Aruni Wijewardane downwards. I guess I have a certain inherent liking towards the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I am certainly not jealous of you, Hon. Minister; I want you to succeed. I do not think that comment you made earlier was necessary. What you have to handle is complex, I understand that. Some other time, we will have a long chat outside this Chamber on how we could do everything we can from your side and from our side of the aisle for this countrys well-being.

Thank you. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC) Sir, give me only a minute.

Thank you very much for that wonderful comment and that humility, Hon. Member. I reciprocate it. I also think what happened in the morning between us was not necessary; I should not have acted in that way. I do not think the public of this country and this House would expect that from people of our calibre. I am sorry about it.

Having said that, I must mention that I did not say that we introduced e-DAS; I did not say so. I think I must make it very clear. What I said was, before that was introduced, people were in queues for two to three days. Then, we introduced the e-channeling system and also managed to link the Ministry of Education to that, as a result of which those queues became shorter, substantially. It would not have been possible, if not for introducing the e-DAS in 2017 by you all. Now, I am only improving the existing system. Therefore, I think we should not compete with each other. Ultimately, our aim is to see a better country for all of us, I agree with you.

Also, I want to thank you for consistently maintaining this position about improving our economy, dealing with the IMF, on debt restructuring and bringing the required reforms, which is not easy being in the Opposition. But, I congratulate you for maintaining that. Both the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne and you have consistently maintained that position without looking for short-term glory or applause from the gallery; you have consistently maintained tht it is required for us to do these reforms. That is how India, too, has succeeded.

So, thank you very much once again. ( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Sir, I just need to make a clarification on what Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva stated. I think once before also, in this House, he had stated about that training programme they carried out in an effort to train the officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the Harvard University. I think I invited you to come to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sometime back to share that information. I did go through that file, which was at your previous office. I

think the course was free only for the first batch, but from there onwards, we had to pay. Given the circumstances we are in, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs cannot afford to pay the Harvard University for that, but I do agree with the crux of your point, that we need to do more in order to educate our officials in the Foreign Service on economic diplomacy and the business language which is being used.

Thank you. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Hon. State Minister, actually, it was free. We did not pay a single cent to the Harvard University.

( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) It was free only for the first batch. Thereafter, we had to pay.

() ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) It is easy for us to raise these funds; we can do it. There are so many grants that go around. We have an issue and we are trying to resolve it. So, we can approach a grant for that.

( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Certainly. So, you are most welcome to come to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, share a cup of tea and discuss this matter. Thank you.

() ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) I will. Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. Udayakantha Gunathilaka. You have seven minutes.
