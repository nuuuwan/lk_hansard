( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Jeevan Thondaman - Minister of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development) Hon. Member, I would like to assure you that this "Water Market" concept has not been discussed in any official capacity or with any stakeholders. It was just something that we had explored informally. So, I can give you the assurance that there is no "Water Market" concept even up for discussion.

Secondly, as far as the water sector is concerned, I would like to inform you that even prior to the water tariff hike, I always made sure that it was not a decision of only the ruling party; we had made sure that it was an all-inclusive decision. I have brought forward whatever decisions that we had taken in the Ministry of Water Supply, prior to the Cabinet, to Parliament. In fact, the water tariff policy also, we have brought before Parliament and we are now working on it and I think we should be able to bring it forward by January, hopefully.

Sir, I would like to say one last thing. As far as the agriculture sector is concerned, the Hon. Minister has given his opinion. But, in terms of the water sector, I can give you another assurance. You know that this whole idea of exporting water and all that is nice to talk about, but actually making it happen is a long-drawn process. The assurance we can give you is, we are prioritizing our domestic market first. We cannot expect to export water, if we do not have adequate water for the domestic market. So, I can give you that assurance as well, Hon. Member.

( ) (The Hon. Vijitha Herath) Hon. Minister, everyone knows the difference between management of water and the "Water Market" concept. We need a real clarification regarding the "Water Market" concept. What is it?

( ) (The Hon. Jeevan Thondaman) Hon. Member, I mentioned it once and I will repeat it. We have not discussed this "Water Market" concept anywhere. I do not think we have discussed it in any official capacity.

The second matter is, as far as any reforms to water are concerned, this year, we brought in some important ADB reforms to create a Water Resource Management Secretariat. That Secretariat is headed by the Hon. Prime Minister's Office and all the different stakeholders are part of that. So, it is not just the Ministry of Water Supply which takes this decision. But, I can tell you that there is a bit of miscommunication. This "Water Market" concept was not there in any official discussion. So, I am not sure where that information particularly came from. It is something that we were just exploring. That is about it. - [Interruption.] Hon. Member, just give me a minute.

The last matter is this. What we were discussing was, how we would be able to incentivize the public of this country for lesser consumption of water because 2 per cent to 60 per cent of water is lost as wastage. Just to get back to the "Water Market" concept, I think you are referring to the Water Credits. The Water Credits are what compromises at the "Water Market" discussion, I think, and that is something we were talking about in relation to the UN-Water and all that. But, there has been no official discussion as such. If there is a discussion on any new reforms, rest assured, we would put them forward to Parliament, to all parties.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, this is a very serious issue that has been raised. According to the Constitution, there is no IGP in the country today.

( ) (An Hon. Member) .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is the law that will prevail, nothing else; that is the supreme law of the country. So, there is no Inspector General of Police today in terms of the law and that is a very serious matter. Also, when the President

. [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

does this, this is intentional violation of the Constitution by the President.

. [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

It is not that the President does not know. This is intentional violation of the Constitution by the President

. [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

which is an impeachable offence.

Sir, I just want to make one change to what the Hon. Minister of Justice said. There are three Bills to be taken up and the passing of two Bills without debate is okay. But, the Contempt of a Court, Tribunal or Institution Bill needs discussion. So, why do you not delay that? We are agreeable to passing the other two Bills without debate. Although the Contempt of a Court, Tribunal or Institution Bill is a good piece of legislation, there are some serious issues that we would like to raise. So, if you do not mind, delay that. It is a very serious matter because this is the first time that we are making a statute with regard to contempt of court. - [Interruption] Thank you. So, let us not pass that without debate, but only the other two.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Next, the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. You have 22 minutes.

[2.59 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for the time allotted for me to speak on this very important Bill that has been presented by the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms today.

I am saying an important Bill because for a long time, this need was felt; the issue of contempt of court needed some intervention by the Legislature so that what we thought was the application of the common law of contempt, with all its uncertainties, would be regulated better, particularly with regard to the procedure one adopts in the superior courts. The Civil Procedure Code has a chapter which prescribes procedure for inferior courts. Therefore, there is some procedure prescribed. The Judicature Act prescribes the limitation with regard to sentences that can be imposed and in any case, it is in facie contempt that they can try. Anything outside of that court, unless specifically authorized by law, our Constitution has given the jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal to try.

The superior courts of record, both the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal, have adopted their own

1705 1706

procedure in dealing with this issue. We have seen in the past, not very long ago, instances where the Supreme Court, in the exercise of its fundamental rights jurisdiction, had summarily detained persons without a charge being read out, sent them to prison and tried and committed persons to judicial custody, holding them in contempt. This happened particularly in one or two cases, if I remember right: one, with regard to sand mining and the other, with regard to sound pollution, where the then Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva, presiding in the Chief Justices Court, would entertain even photographs that somebody gave, look at it and say, Ah, here, you have done sand mining and sentence the man to prison. So, those things happened.

Therefore, it was important to lay down a procedure, particularly, with regard to the right to be heard and that also, we understand, in a very substantial manner before a person is condemned. And also with regard to punishments, there have to be some directions and some limitations rather than leave it to the court to decide as they please as to what kind of punishment must be meted out when a complaint of contempt comes before court. Unfortunately, although in the original Bill that issue has been addressed, the Supreme Court, in a special Determination, seems to have suggested that that limitation is contrary to the Constitutional provision and that it requires a Referendum.

Therefore, the Minister is moving an Amendment at the Committee Stage, which has been given to us, removing those limitations in the punishment. That is very unsatisfactory. It is ironic that we discuss conferring jurisdiction - it is already conferred through the Constitution - affirming that the court must have a right to punish for contempt and also in the same Proceedings here in Parliament, that we express our dissatisfaction with regard to some of these special Determinations. That does not lower the dignity of the Court. There must be, at least, one place where this must be discussed. It is not only in Parliament that we can disapprove judgments of court; also, there can be academic discussions outside Parliament - that is not contempt - where you can disagree with judgments. So, this is one such instance, I believe, where one of the core purposes of bringing a statute is defeated when you leave those limitations of punishment out of this Statute.

We have had instances when court had acted with anger, not with restraint or proportionality. So, that is why it is important that we put down in the law the categories of offences of contempt and limit those punishments. I think the original limitations were good: six months, one year, up to two years and not more than two years. Unfortunately, we are unable to do that because of the Supreme Court itself. Today is an instance when, in this House, the conduct of judges and court was taken to the cleaners by a Cabinet Minister, no less! Often, we have found Members of the Opposition, if a Government Member said something contrary to the Standing Orders, saying things or raising objections based on Standing Orders that he cannot do that. But today, the gravity of the subject was such, that not one single Member of

Parliament objected on such instances. The Deputy Speaker, who was in the Chair, felt uncomfortable and at one point, merely drew the Ministers attention to Standing Order No. 83. That is all. All what the Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs wanted to say was said and that is a reflection of the sad state that the Judiciary is also in today. I do not think we should back off thinking that if we discuss it here, that is, in some way, an affront to the Judiciary. No, it is not. After all, it is Parliament that gives the Judiciary judicial power; the Constitution has given that. That was enacted in this Parliament.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Samanpriya Herath to the Chair?

... ( ) ( ... - ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC - Minister of Foreign Affairs) Sir, I propose that the Hon. Samanpriya Herath do now take the Chair.

, . . Question put, and agreed to.

, .

, , .

Whereupon THE HON. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and THE HON. SAMANPRIYA HERATH took the Chair.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Presiding Member, in any case, the judicial power of the people is vested in Parliament and is exercised through courts and other institutions for the administration of justice. Therefore, Parliament has a special task to discuss these matters.

I want to draw the Ministers attention to developments in other jurisdictions. It is well and good that in order for judicial orders to be obeyed and respected that we have provisions to punish those who violate court orders. But, whether the offence of scandalizing the court should amount to contempt of court is a matter that other jurisdictions have looked at and in many places, it is no longer a part of the offence of contempt. England and Wales removed that as part of the offence of contempt in 2013. That is because the idea of free speech, expression and accountability of the Judiciary to even defend the orders they make is seen to be an important element in a democracy. I have the Report of the Law Reform Commission of Victoria - it came out recently or just last year and that is why I have that document - which has serialized how, in other jurisdictions, the scandalizing contempt has been

1707 1708

[ .. ]

2023 08

removed from the law. However, in certain places they have allowed it to remain, but with very limited application and limited need to protect against statements that impair public confidence in court. The whole idea is, the confidence that the public have in the Judiciary must be earned; they must demand that confidence in themselves by their conduct. It is like respecting your elders or anybody else. By their very conduct, the citizens will give them the due recognition and respect and it cannot be forced out of them. In certain areas, on certain issues, judges come out and explain and some countries have passed laws making it obligatory to explain. Our law also states that you must give reasons in making judgments. That is the underlying principle. Why should you give reasons otherwise? You can say, Well, the court has power to rule and it has ruled. That is why even today, in certain instances when court particularly refuses leave to proceed in fundamental rights cases, we ask for reasons. In most cases, they do not give reasons because it is not obligatory, but you must give reasons. We have had fundamental rights cases argued for ten days at the leave stage itself! Surely, to argue for ten days, there was reason to look into the matter. After full ten days of arguments, the full Bench had said, We see no reason to grant leave to proceed. That is their only reason. But, that should not be. On matters of public importance, they must give reason for their decision. The Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal supervise judgments of inferior courts and if inferior courts' reasons are not given, that itself is a ground for appeal. Then, we go and say, Well, they have not given reasons. This issue has not been dealt with. And, that must apply equally to the superior courts also because the accountability is to the people.

The judicial power, one has to understand, is the power of the people and when we say it is the power of the people, that must have some meaning. As regards judicial independence, it is true that when a judge is appointed, he cannot be removed except through special procedures. All of that is there, but that does not take away from him or her the obligation to answer to the people because the function that they perform is a function of the power of the people which has been given to them to perform and they must constantly give account to the people of what they do.

This morning, during the Sitting, various comments were made regarding the Judiciary. It brought the Judiciary into disrepute. Tomorrow or today even, when people have seen what was discussed in these hallowed precincts, people will regard the Judiciary with contempt. But - I am not making any reference to this particular case - if courts have conducted themselves in such a way, like the instances I gave earlier, that would be the result. That same former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva, after he retired, on a political platform said, " . " . He should have been sentenced to prison for that, for abuse of judicial power and public confession. Another one who sat in that seat of the Chief Justice - later, it was resolved that he was never a property appointed Chief Justice - a former President publicly said, had gone to the President and said, Do not remove me from this post. I will hold everything in favour

of the Government. President Maithreepala Sirisena publicly said that. So, when you have people who had sat in the seat of the Chief Justice, the Head of the Judiciary, and behaved like that, is it any wonder that people have only contempt for court? Is it any wonder?

So, what are we trying to do then? This is like the policeman in the Magistrates Court, who thinks that you must not cross your legs, that you must not read a book; he thinks that is contempt. So, it is a false idea of what it means to respect court. That is why I think the issue of scandalizing court should be removed from this. Enforcing a court order, violating a court order, yes, that may be visited with punishment, but scandalizing court, in todays age, is not something that should be there in the statute. Other civilized jurisdictions are, little by little, removing that. This is the other reason why even with regard to the Online Safety Bill, when they had put in this contempt of court provision, we argued before the Supreme Court that that should not be there. Free expression must be permitted. When it exceeds bounds, there will emerge a societal pressure, a community restriction, which will somehow regulate that. Not everything can be regulated by enforcement of a strict law like this.

Again, unfortunately, we cannot agree with the Determination of the Supreme Court in regard to the Online Safety Bill. Very serious concerns had been raised - a record of 54 petitions had been filed; there were 45 counsels; one day, the Supreme Court sat till 10.00 in the night and they had written a 62-page Determination - but many of the very crucial issues raised by the petitioners are not dealt with in the Determination. So, where can we say this? I mean, we can say it anywhere.

We commend the Minister for having taken step towards bringing in a statute that has been long felt needed, which prescribes procedure. We thought it would prescribe punishments also, but, at least, the procedure is prescribed so that a person knows that if he is accused of contempt, there is at least a procedural safeguard. But, as it is, you are going to remove the limitation on punishment, leaving it to court to even pass death sentence for contempt. Strictly, that is possible and that should not be the case.

Another matter is the limitation of time. A very salutary provision was there in the original draft, that within one year of the alleged offence the complaint should be made. But now, it states that court must take action within one year from it being reported to court. So, 30 years after an alleged offence, when somebody reports it to court, the court has to take action within one year; that is how it will read. How can that be? When penal offences themselves have a restriction of 20 years, how come this has no restriction at all? So, from the alleged offence, there must be a limitation of time.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am concluding, Sir.

So, while welcoming this, I urge the Minister to take necessary steps to remove the scandalizing contempt from this, to somehow, even by amending the Constitution, if necessary, have limitations on the punishment and to bring in limitation of time.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , ... . [ ]

accountability performance evaluation .

Sir, it is very important that we protect the dignity of the Judiciary. Just like any other arm of government, whether it is the Executive or the Legislature, the Judiciary is also accountable to the people and is also accountable for its performance. Therefore, it is important that we come up with a mechanism which is transparent and which evaluates the performance of the Judiciary, as to how many judgments have been pronounced and how many cases have been heard. We have increased the number of judges. But, whether the final benefit of those increments and investment we made on the Judiciary has gone to the general public in this country is a very important question.

Therefore, it is important that we work diligently towards improving the quality of the judicial process in this country. It is important to have not only an independent Judiciary - the independence of the Judiciary is fundamental; if there is no independence, there is no point in talking about the Judiciary, but that is only one aspect of it - but also an efficient and efficacious Judiciary which adjudicates disputes between parties in a timely and an efficient manner because it is fundamentally vital for a functioning democracy, the rule of law and also for a thriving economy.

Justice delayed is justice denied. So, if it is said that delaying or not implementing any judgment is insulting the courts, I ask the courts, have you all not insulted the poor people of this country so long and deeply? Therefore, I thank the Hon. Minister for bringing in this Bill, but this alone would not stop all that. We need to ask, do the people not have the right, not to criticize, but to critique the law system in this country? I do believe that democracy must allow critique of the courts. Courts are to decided on the democratic nuances of a country; courts are established for the democratic advancement of a country. The courts, judges and the entire system is paid for and maintained by the people of this country and their tax money. Today, the public has almost lost faith in the court system. I am sorry to say that. Therefore, Hon. Minister, I thank you for bringing in this Bill.

Now, let us ask ourselves, how do we rebuild the trust of the general public in the court system? Why are people not coming to courts? Why are people being afraid of courts? An Opposition Member, the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran, reminded us of some past utterances of a former Chief Justice. How shameful they were!

The Post Office of Nuwara Eliya was built in 1894. That red-brick building was built by the British according to the Tudor style and is a two-storey building with a clock spire. This building is located at the centre of the Nuwara Eliya Town and it is one of the oldest buildings in Sri Lanka. The Tudor-style, two-storey, red-brick building with a clock spire was constructed in 1894 by the British. In 2012, the former living quarters of the Post Master on the upper floor of the post office was converted into tourist accommodation. On the 26th of December, 1990, the Sri Lanka Post issued a Rs. 10 stamp with a photograph of that post office to commemorate the World Post Day; . , . , , . , . 2017 . . .
