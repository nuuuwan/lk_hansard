. , . The Debate stood adjourned accordingly.. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Speaker, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) What is the point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Speaker, you are the custodian of our rights. You have to bring your mind to bear that when a Question of Privilege is raised by an Hon. Member, to look at the issue raised according to the relevant Standing Order and determine whether there is a prima facie breach of Privilege which arises out of that.

Now, I come to the specific issue. Sir, our right to raise a matter of Privilege should not be used or abused for a collateral purpose. I specifically refer to the matter of Privilege raised by the Hon. Premnath C. Dolawatte two days ago in this Chamber, the Privilege Motion of which appeared in the Order Paper of yesterday. I say "collateral purpose" for the reason that there is an attempt to bring pressure on the Judiciary and public officials in this country through the vehicle of Question of Privilege in this House. That has to be avoided, Hon. Speaker, with all respect. What I see is that that is a total abuse of the process. I also heard the Hon. Member who raised it go to the extent of imputing motives to a particular judge's conduct. Whether a judge should recuse himself from a case before him is a matter personal to him and if he takes that decision, well and good. And, there had been instances where, on matters of public importance, judges did no do that. For instance, late Justice Prasanna Jayawardena, in the famous case on the then Prime Ministers appointment, though his brother appeared before him, chose to hear the case and held against the brother. You cannot interfere with a judge's conduct.

Particularly, here, we are bringing disrepute to this House, abusing the processes and are also creating unnecessary conflict between the different arms of government - the Judiciary and the Legislature - and that is, for the convenience of the Executive. For the Executives own convenience, if the Executive wants to avoid an election, so be it. The Executive can come to the House, put the cap on and say, I do not want to allow any election until the next Presidential Election; that is

his prerogative. But, our own rights and Privileges cannot be subverted by another Hon. Member, raising a Privilege issue here and bringing undue pressure on the bureaucracy in this country - on the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and the Supreme Court Judges. That is a total abuse, the Hon. Prime Minister knows. In the past also we brought up such issues and tried to impeach a Chief Justice and finally, this same House had to reverse that whole decision. That is what happened; this had happened in the past also. So, please do not allow the processes of this House to be abused in this manner.

Sir, I take serious objection to the manner in which this matter of Privilege had been allowed because you have to, first, see whether there is a prima facie case that arises and whether the Hon. Member's Privileges have been abused. Similarly, there was another Hon. Member who wanted to raise another Privilege issue to ask for a Select Committee against the independent Election Commission, saying that his Privileges have been affected. So, these are all very frivolous issues and it is unbecoming of an Hon. Member of this House to be using these different subterfuges to achieve a collateral purpose. Therefore, Sir, when you take a decision on Privilege issues, please be mindful of that. You have to, first, satisfy yourself whether there is a prima facie case, particularly in this case. Absolutely, this is a total abuse of the process of this House.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. S.M. Marikkar) .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Speaker, I would like to refer to Standing Order No. 83(1). This particular Privilege issue the Hon. Dolawatte has raised should be read along with Standing Order No. 83(1), which states, I quote:

"The personal conduct of the President, or the Acting President, Members of Parliament, Judges or other persons engaged in the administration of justice shall not be raised except upon a substantive motion;"

So, what we are doing here is, subverting this Standing Order and through the vehicle of Question of Privilege, questioning the conduct of the Judge. This is totally wrong and is an abuse of the process of this House!

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) We will keep that in mind. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) So, what you have permitted is in violation of Standing Order No. 83 (1). He should have brought in a Substantive Motion.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) We will look into it. - [Interruption.] It need not be repeated, Hon. Member.

. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. Naseer Ahamed. You have 14 minutes. [2.00 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed - Minister of Environment) Hon. Presiding Member, let me start my speech by saying that the democratic right of the people to elect a government of their own should never be compromised. As a Representative of the people, I stand to protect their sovereign right of franchise at any cost.

I am not in favour of any move to postpone the Local Government Election or to extend the term of the local government bodies by a single day beyond the mandate of the voter and to suppress their right of franchise. I am one person who expressed my candid views and opinion on a similar situation in 2017 when the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Act, No. 17 of 2017 was brought in. I was the Chief Minister of the Eastern Province

at that time and I know the sentiments of the people in times of postponement of elections. 2017 2017 20 , , () . , . , . . peoples franchise ? .

At the same time, there are occasions where exceptional circumstances such as crises and disasters may mean that holding an election would potentially introduce greater threats to human life and security. The problem was laid bare as the Coronavirus pandemic spread in 2020. Between 21st February and 2nd August, 2020, at least 69 countries and territories across the globe decided to postpone their forthcoming elections.

The electoral system that was introduced for the Local Government Election in 2018, for the first time, was a method based on combining the features of both the Proportional Representation and the First-Past-the-Post Systems, a system that is inherently plague-ridden. A number of local bodies, during the period of the past five years, has failed to pass their budgets mainly due to switchover of allegiance by members. Allocation of bonus seats under the system, which was introduced to strengthen the administration, seems to have been counter-productive. The local administration is far below the efficient and effective administration the lawmakers anticipated.

On the other hand, the number of members elected under that new system was almost twice the number elected under the previous system, resulting in an exponential increase of cost. Given the present intricacies of the cash-strapped State coffers, can we really agree with the move to elect as high a number as 8,711 members and maintain them, if continue with the same system? , . Opposition , local government members 8,700 Opposition . , . , . We know it is a wrong system to continue with. But still, we insist on having the election just because of personal benefits. Why do we all not get together to change this system, come to an agreement on a proper number of elected members, fix the date and go for the election? At the Local Government Election under discussion, 16.6 million voters will vote to elect 8,711 members for 340 local authorities, of which 24 are municipal councils, 41 are urban councils and 275 are Pradeshiya Sabhas.

The motives and causes for not holding elections are varied and complex. It is important to distinguish these because occasions of not holding elections are not always just power-grabs by autocrats, which is the most intuitive reason given as to why an election might not take place. The Government of President Ranil Wickremesinghe is not talking about a cancellation of the Local Government Elections. Cancellation of elections violates democratic norms. The Government does not subscribe to that kind of ideology of governance.

Throughout the past decades, various major crisis situations have exposed democracies the world over to considerable challenges in maintaining the normal functioning of democratic institutions and particularly, as regards holding of elections. As a result, many elections have been postponed and held later than originally planned. In the United Kingdom, local elections were postponed for a year, until May, 2021, due to the outbreak of the COVID pandemic. Likewise, the Spanish Regional Elections in Basque and Galicia were originally scheduled for April, but were moved to July, 2020. Both holding and postponing elections in times of crises have implications for the political rights of individuals under State jurisdiction.

There are a variety of reasons why elections might not take place. The international experience shows that deep political crises such as the one in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia during 2012 to 2016 can cause an institutional breakdown, preventing the taking place of the scheduled elections. Postponement of elections may, therefore, occur because of deep-routed nation-wide crises. The causes for not holding elections, therefore, are deeply complex, but they are not direct power-grabs always. And, there is no indefinite cancellation of elections. We experience a parallel situation here in Sri Lanka as we face the worst economic crisis compounded with a resultant political crisis.

Then, there are transitional postponements where States determine that a broader constitutional framework needs to be established before elections are held. Both Nepal and Tunisia decided to adopt new democratic Constitutions before conducting general elections. Sri Lanka, too, is passing through a similar transitional period, where the country needs reforms to the local government election laws. The executive power of the local government bodies should be vested in a chairman-based committee instead of a single chairman, as proposed by the Hon. President Ranil Wickremesinghe. There is a need to draft laws for this amendment before the next local government election. The Hon. President has also stated that a Referendum would be held, if the Select Committee tasked with deciding on the matter fails to do so by July, 2023. Therefore, in that context, Sri Lanka is going through a transitional period where the constitutional framework is concerned.

There are also technical delays causing postponement of elections. Elections are huge, complex logistical events which require a vast volume of resources, laws and staff. The Nigerian Presidential and National Assembly

Elections of 2019 were postponed by the Independent National Electoral Commission three days before the scheduled election date following a careful review of the implementation of the logistics and operational plan. The Bosnian post-war elections in 1996 were postponed for three months due to technical delays. We face a similar situation today, which potentially threaten the smooth holding of the elections as a result of the economic crisis.

Finally, there are humanitarian postponements of elections, where elections might not take pace because of threats to human life. If disasters and crises, whether they are natural or man-made, create an environment unconducive to hold elections, they may be postponed temporarily. But, at their peak, prolonged and complex crises could place humanitarian strains on State resources which address public well-being, leaving public services undeliverable.

Sir, what Sri Lanka faces today is a multi-faceted and complex scenario contributed by natural and man-made factors, which justifies delaying of local government elections due to all the previously mentioned reasons of postponement such as crises, transitional, technical and humanitarian.

On the other hand, at a time when a beacon of hope of crisis recovery can be seen over the horizon as indicated by share market indices, currency appreciation and forex reserve buildup, we can grab the opportunity with both hands and have a breathing space to review the electoral system of the local government bodies. The easiest is to revive the old system of Proportional Representation. We should be happy that signs of economic recovery is visible earlier than expected. Look at some of the most recent numbers: the rupee advanced 3 per cent to Rs. 317.7 per US Dollar yesterday, taking its annual gains to 15 per cent. The appreciation was driven by better dollar inflows from tourism and remittances. The annual inflation rate eased for the fifth straight month to 50.6 per cent in February, 2023, the lowest since May 2022, from a downwardly revised 51.7 per cent in January. Migrant workers foreign remittances increased to US Dollar 437.5 million in January, 2023 from US Dollar 259.2 million reported in January, 2022. The total number of international tourist arrivals during January, 2023 was 102,545. That is an increase of 24.5 per cent compared to January, 2022, reaching 43 per cent of that during pre-pandemic time in 2018. The countrys foreign reserves have increased by 4.5 per cent from US Dollars 2,121 million in January, 2023 to US Dollars 2,217 million in February, 2023. In the Colombo Stock Market, all indices such as the ASPI, S&P and the turnover are all in an upward trend.

There is a lot of positivity around the IMF announcement and more dollar loans are expected with the approval of their bailout.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, your time is over.

471 472

( ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed) Sir, I just want to raise one more point. Of course, the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva was saying that if we do not have the Local Government Election and if there is no stability, the IMF will not give us money. What is he going to say now? The IMF is going to give us almost US Dollars 790 million or US Dollars 780 million now. The World Bank is also prepared to give us money and loans from other institutions, too, are in the pipeline. We are going to get almost about US Dollars 2 billion within this month. What is the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva going to say now, that we have not held elections? What they did was, I must tell them, they gave out a wrong image about the country to the international community. That is what they did everyday; they held press conferences every day.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, please wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed) Just give me one minute, Sir.

So, that is what they did. Therefore, I ask you all to be mature. Keep this country in mind. If you come to power even after 10 years, you have to have a country and the economy in a sound condition to govern.

I must say that the IMF deal has, so far, been an exceptionally hard task. Sri Lanka has faced an unprecedented delay and has been waiting for about 187 days to finalize the bailout after reaching a Staff-level Agreement with the IMF. That is, compared to the median of 55 days it took for low and middle-income countries over the past decade to go from the preliminary deal to the IMF Board sign-off. Therefore, we should not put this hard-earned achievement of the Hon. President at risk.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, your time is over. Please wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed) Therefore, I appeal to all the Members, let us join hands and support this economic recovery plan of the Hon. President and postpone the election until we recover from this economic crisis. Thank you.

. , IMF . . . . ; we are an independent nation. Nobody or no country in the world can force us to conduct elections in this country. They have no right to do that because we gained our Independence 75 years ago. No one can force us to do what they want and they are not willing to do that either. But of course, there are conditions - rules and regulations - of the IMF, which we have to follow. Even if you, the Opposition, would, one day, go to the IMF, there are rules and the regulations you would have to follow.
