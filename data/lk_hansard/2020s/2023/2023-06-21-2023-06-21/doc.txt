Minister, I appreciate that you want to get advice from the Hon. Attorney-General. This Bill itself identifies the United Nations Convention Against Corruption and as mentioned by the Chief Opposition Whip a moment ago, the Bill, in its Long Title, also states .....other Internationally recognized norms, standards and best practices;... So, although in the Constitution, there is a bar to retrospective effect on criminal matters, making people liable for offences, that has a proviso. That is, if it is a crime recognized by a community of nations, it could be done. We have one such example: the Offences Against Aircraft Act. When Sepala Ekanayake committed the offence prior to that Act being passed by Parliament, since it was a crime recognized by the civilized community of nations, it passed muster.

Here, you have specifically mentioned the conventions. So, there cannot be any objections to it having retrospective effect at least up to the time of those conventions is what I think. In any case, since the Debate is going to be taken up on another day, would you kindly consider that as well and make it clear, by a specific provision, that this has retrospective effect?

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. You have 11 minutes.

[12.06 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Presiding Member, I am glad to speak just after the Acting Minister of Finance who recognized some good that may have come about as a result of the economic crisis. He did say that it is not a good thing to have the economic crisis, but there are some lessons that we are learning from that as well. I agree with him.

Before I get on to the Anti-Corruption Bill, I just want to deal with the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Bill. Hon. Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms, it is a good Amendment. Particularly for running-down cases, motor accident cases and so on, this will be of immense use. So, I congratulate the Minister for this Amendment.

The new Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Bill has a history and I am glad that it has been brought in with some new features, particularly enabling video evidence. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is here. When he was President, he appointed a Presidential Commission of Inquiry under Justice Udalagama. There was video evidence which started to be recorded from Dr. Manoharan, whose son was one of the five young persons who were killed by security forces in Trincomalee, and halfway through his evidence, that was stopped and was not permitted. From that time onwards, to enable video evidence through law was mooted, but it was not possible under that regime. It was only in 2015, when there was a change in government, that, for the first time, the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act was enacted, but that, too, had serious shortcomings and I am glad that some of those are being rectified in this Bill.

The point I want to make here is that accountability is an important issue. . , . . The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has very specifically mentioned that Sri Lanka has not taken enough measures with regard to accountability. When there is no accountability, it is impunity that reigns.

Sir, that brings me to the main Bill that is before us for debate today, the Anti-Corruption Bill. What I am reminded of is what Judge Weeramantry wrote in his book called The Law in Crisis: Bridges of Understanding. In the Preface to that book, he said, Sri Lanka is embarrassed by the richness of the sources of law and not the lack of them. So, we are embarrassed by the richness of the laws that we have, not by the lack of laws. But, the implementation of the laws is what has been the problem and continues to be a problem. I say continuous to be a problem because it is an irony that it is this Government that is bringing in these laws now; by pressure from the IMF, from various other international actors, we are enacting laws.

I am wondering whether this is just a waste of paper when the country is going through an economic crisis because only when it is implemented that we can see the efficacy, the benefit of this. Just to satisfy the IMF or other international bodies, passing laws is not going to combat corruption in this country. It is a shame that when the IMF came in, they identified corruption susceptibilities as one of the challenges! And now, they have instituted governance diagnostics. These are heavy indictments on the governance structures of this country. There is no politician or person who has held political office who has been convicted and sentenced in this country for corruption. In a country where the International Monetary Fund says one of the greatest challenges is corruption susceptibilities, we have not ever convicted such persons for corruption. We have had persons who have contested elections, for treating and so on, being unseated, but no one who has held a Cabinet portfolio or those who have held political office, to date, has been convicted for corruption.

Sir, the test of the pudding is in the eating, not in looking at it and saying, Oh, how nice it looks! The aroma is lovely. That is what we are doing today. So, the test is in the eating; only when it is implemented, will we know whether we have done the right thing or not. So far, we have not. I said it is an irony that it is this Government that is bringing in these laws because only a year ago, the constant chorus we heard in this country was kaputu kaak, kaak, kaak. Why, "kaputu kaak, kaak, kaak"? Because of the big crow that steals. This Government is still controlled by that kaputu kaak, kaak, kaak". It is the same people who sit in the Government ranks, no change. So, is it not funny that you are now bringing in all these

915 916

laws while the persons who were identified as the ones who let the economy of this country to collapse and the ones who stole from this country are still in charge? In fact, the news is that as soon as the President returns, the persons who were kept away from the Cabinet are going to get Cabinet portfolios. Why were they kept away? It is well-known; there are no secrets in this country. People know who takes 10 per cent, who takes 15 per cent and who takes 100 per cent. People know. That is why a year ago, there was this revolution in this country. But, you only managed to chase away the then President; others were just put away for a while. And, they are still in this House; they are still seated in the front rows. They have just not been in the Cabinet for a little while, but they are creeping in; one by one, they come back. So, without that fundamental change happening, where the control is still in the hands of the wrongdoers - all of you Ministers were there in that Government - merely because you made some cosmetic changes, it does not mean that you all have changed. You are only bringing in these laws now to say, Okay, we have brought in the laws. We have changed them. After this, there would not be corruption in this country, there would not be bribery in this country. No, that is farfetched. So, while appreciating that this law must come in, I should say that this was prepared mostly during the last Parliament, but still, there are lots of shortcomings. Due to lack of time, I will not go into many of the details.

You have mentioned "Member of Parliament" in Clause 93, which you should, but why do you also not include members of provincial councils and members of local authorities, particularly Chairmen of local authorities? There are serious allegations of bribery everywhere.

With regard to the issue the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris raised, I would say, as was in the original Bribery Act, - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes, Hon. Kiriella? ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) Sir, give him a few more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Okay. The Hon. Kiriella is giving you a few more minutes.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you.

I think the original Act - I am not referring to the Act that was passed in 1994, but to the one prior to that - said that if the person himself who makes a false complaint against someone had been found guilty, was liable to be punished with the the same punishment. So, I think what the Hon. (Prof.) Peiris was raising was that the punishment for the offence is seven years, but if the person who made the complaint is unable to substantiate it in some way, he goes in for ten years. It is higher than the punishment for bribery itself. Therefore, I think it will be just if you make it the same.

I also agree that the span of what is bribery and corruption must be expanded and the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law that was passed in 1975 was useless in a sense. I remember that in 2010 when I was appointed to this House, there was a delay in appointing National List Members since, in certain areas, polling had to be re-held. So, National List Members were appointed just a day or two before Parliament Sittings started. I read the law and hurriedly made a Declaration of Assets and Liabilities because the law said that you cannot sit or vote in Parliament without that. So, I was very concerned and immediately did it. But, a few months after I came to Parliament, I realized that out of the 225 in that Parliament, only 17 had actually made the Declaration. Then, it was a useless piece of paper, but thereafter, there was public consciousness and I think everybody makes a Declaration now, but it is not available to the public. Even for the person who pays that Rs. 750 and gets it, it is an offence to publicize it. It is because of that that some of us - five of us did it and then a few others joined in - on our own, voluntarily publicized our Declaration of Assets and Liabilities some years ago. And now, it is all available on the web. So, it is a welcome move to make it public because that is the whole purpose of an assets declaration, the people must know.

Sir, I want to raise one other matter while the Acting Minister of Finance is here. SOE reforms are important and is going to happen. The Hon. Minister of Justice, in responding to the Hon. (Prof.) Peiris, mentioned two cases that I appeared in: the privatization of the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation and the LMSL, which he, as the Chair of COPE, brought out to the public then. I was privileged to appear as the counsel for the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara in both matters and in both matters, the Supreme Court reversed the privatization. The current President was the Prime Minister at that time when all of that happened. Recently, at a forum, I raised the issue about the privatization of the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation because one of the institutions that have now been identified for privatization is that. The last time you did that, it was sold for Rs. 6 billion when its basic asset value itself was Rs. 155 billion, not to mention the goodwill, the monopoly that it had, the actuarial value et cetera. When I raised that issue, the then Minister of Finance said, No, there was no fraud in it. It was only a question of valuation. Do you say when the difference is Rs. 6 billion and Rs. 155 billion, that it is only a problem of valuation? Obviously, there was fraud in it.

So, I am raising this matter because in the economic reform agenda, you have to do SOE reforms. But, how do you ensure that there is no corruption in it? You might say, Well, this law will take care of it. No, it would not.

In one of those matters, the then Secretary to the Treasury was found guilty by the Supreme Court. He was fined Rs. 500,000 and was told that he should not hold public office thereafter. He gave an affidavit to Court. But, then what happened? As soon as that Judge who gave the Order retired, the full Supreme Court - ten Judges - sat. One Judge? No, ten Judges sat! Subsequently, it was a three-Judge bench which gave the Order, but ten Judges sat originally. Finally, only one judge dissented and all the other Judges allowed the withdrawal of that affidavit and that person became the Secretary to the Treasury all over again also under President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is here.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am concluding, Sir.

I am flagging these matters to say that you can have a perfect law on paper, but how do you ensure that it is implemented? So far in this country, we have not seen it implemented. That is the concern I have about the Delayed Prosecution Arrangement - DPA - you have brought in here and about withdrawal of indictments because we saw, as soon as the Government changed in 2020, that the indictments the Commission to Investigate Bribery or Corruption had instituted had all been withdrawn. So, that is the political culture of this country and until that changes, this will be dead-letter law.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. S.M. Marikkar. You have 13 minutes.

Before he starts, will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Madhura Withanage to the Chair?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC) Sir, I propose that the Hon. Madhura Withanage do now take the Chair.

We are in support of the amendments to the sexual bribery component of the Anti-Corruption Bill. The current Bill contains provisions on gratification pertaining to sexual bribery. However, some important amendments must be made in order to further strengthen those provisions. The following are the critical provisions that we believe need to be included in addition to others:

In the Bill, the term "sexual favour" has been used to define sexual bribery or sexual forms of gratification. However, the term "sexual bribe" is more appropriate as it reflects the gravity of the demand for sexual gratification coming from a position of power or authority. Further, the current Bill allows for the prosecution of both the perpetrator and the victim. We firmly believe that the law should not prosecute victims of sexual bribery as sexual bribery is fundamentally different in nature to other forms of bribery. The offence of sexual bribery is limited to soliciting or accepting of a sexual bribe and should not encompass the act of offering a sexual bribe.

The punishment for the offence should be sufficient in consideration of the fact that this constitutes not just an act of corruption, but also a case of sexual violence. Further, due to the nature of the offence, punishment for sexual bribery must include compensation to the victim. We urge that these critical amendments to the Anti-Corruption Bill be taken into consideration in finalizing the provisions of this Bill.

[12.51 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Presiding Member, today, we are debating the Anti-Corruption Bill and one of the big flaws of this Bill is that it has not really given full effect to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption. That is a big flaw. It refers to certain provisions of the Convention, but does not give full impact to it. Dilumi De Alwis, Attorney-at-Law made submissions in the Court about this Bill and I am mentioning some of those.

As we know, Article 156 was brought in by the Nineteenth Amendment. Then, it was taken out by the Twentieth Amendment and was again brought back by the Twenty First Amendment to the Constitution. Article 156(A).(1)(C) clearly states , I quote:

measures to implement the United Nations Convention Against Corruption and any other International Convention relating to the prevention of corruption, to which Sri Lanka is a party.

So, basically, we have committed ourselves to implement it, but we have not really brought that into our law. We all know that Sri Lanka is a dualist State. So, we sign up international conventions, but, subsequently, we have to, to give effect to those, basically bring in local enabling laws. What we have done is, we have actually not given an effect to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption and neither are we satisfying the Constitutional requirement that is there.

The United Nations Convention Against Corruption consists of 71 Articles and covers five main areas: preventive measures, criminalization and law enforcement, international cooperation, asset recovery and technical assistance and information exchange. In terms of prevention, it covers legislations and measures every State should adopt and implement to enhance transparency, oversight and controls. Under criminalization and law enforcement, it identifies the main corruption-related crimes, offences including bribery, embezzlement, influence peddling, work-related exploitation, illicit enrichment and other crimes and their sanctions. There is reference to "sexual favours", but not to "sexual bribery" and we agree with the Members of the Government who also made the point that it should actually be "sexual bribery". If I move on further, the measures that are provided for in the United Nations Convention Against Corruption are aimed at finally tracing and retrieving stolen assets, especially the assets that are most often parked away in other jurisdictions.

Article 51 of Chapter V - Asset Recovery - of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption states, I quote:

The return of assets pursuant to this chapter is a fundamental principle of this Convention, and States Parties shall afford one another the widest measure of cooperation and assistance in this regard."

But, our Bill, which has been presented to Parliament today, does not talk about stolen asset recovery. That is one of the main things that the United Nations Convention Against Corruption talks about, but the Bill does not provide for it. The Convention also states that widest cooperation should be provided in that regard.

It should also be noted that in the proposed Bill, provisions have not been made to give effect to Chapters IV and V of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption. Mutual legal assistance, transfer of criminal proceedings, law enforcement cooperation, joint investigations, prevention and detection of transfers of proceeds of crime, measures for direct recovery of property, mechanisms for recovery of property through international cooperation in confiscation, international cooperation for purposes of confiscation, return and disposal of assets, financial intelligence, none of these are there in the Bill.

It is also pertinent to note that Article 1 - Statement of purpose - set out in the UNCAC categorically recognizes international cooperation in asset recovery as one of its main purposes. But, this Anti-Corruption Bill ignores it and that is not acceptable. Therefore, we must say that not only are we not fulfilling the obligations of the United Nations Convention, which we signed in 2004, but are also not meeting the requirement that is stated in our Constitution. Therefore, duty is cast upon the State, especially in view of the reintroduction of Article 156A to the Constitution, to bring in sufficient measures to the proposed new law for the implementation of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption. We have not done that.

Then, in 2016 in London, we had the Anti-Corruption Summit. Not only did we sign the United Nations Convention Against Corruption in 2004, but also went to the Global Forum on Asset Recovery in December, 2017. Sri Lanka is one of the four focused countries along with Nigeria, Ukraine and Tunisia and we committed ourselves to it. But, we do not do anything about it. This is a law we are bringing in after 30 years and still, we are not doing it. We are hiding behind the fact that we have some laws like the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, No. 5 of 2006, the Financial Transactions Reporting Act, No. 6 of 2006 and the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, No. 25 of 2002. But, those are not sufficient. Therefore, we should have included more comprehensive measures in this law.

Several practical issues are faced in prosecuting for money laundering. Now, this is what has happened in practice. The present Act has made it nearly impossible to successfully complete prosecutions. Therefore, reliance cannot be placed on the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act for asset recovery. So, we have really failed on the fundamental principles and therefore, we must do something about it even through the Amendments.

929 930

Sir, I might also say that Transparency International, under Krishantha Weliamuna and Asoka Obeysekara in the past and under the present Head Nadishani Perera, all Attorneys-at-law, has done a tremendous amount of work over a long period of time to actually make asset recovery an important part in anti-corruption.

Then, silencing informers and whistle-blowers is another issue. Clause 119 of the present Bill talks about giving them an imprisonment of ten years, if they have informed with a malicious intent. I think we need to relook at that because you are going to silence the whistle-blowers if you do that.

Then, there is also withdrawal of indictments under Clause 67, which also needs to be looked at. We know that the AGs Department has been going in for prosecutions and then, withdrawing. Sri Lanka has a poor track record on that. Are we going to continue on the same route? Therefore, we should relook at Clause 67 or if necessary, even delete it.

I would say the ultimate test is this. Firstly, whom have we brought to justice? Secondly, what are the assets that we have recovered? And thirdly, has corruption actually reduced?

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Next, the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam. You have 11 minutes.

[2.21 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, we are discussing today three Bills: the Anti-Corruption Bill, the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Bill and the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Bill.

These are Amendments and Bills, Sir, which ought to be looked at uncontroversially. Sri Lanka, as a county, has its reputation down in the doldrums precisely because, firstly, of corruption and secondly, because the judicial system itself is seen as unsafe, heavily politicized and is prone to interference from the Executive to a point where the notions of separation of powers, independence

955 956

of the Judiciary and fair trial, all of these concepts are called into question. So, with the very foundations of the justice system in the country being questioned, its legitimacy being severely tainted and primarily the Members of this House, Members who belong to parties represented in this House being accused of grave charges of corruption, most of which in fact, we all know are true, any law that is brought in with the intention of trying to curb those, obviously in principle, must not be opposed and if at all, must be supported.

But the question, Sir, is when we are debating these Bills, whether, ultimately, there has been a change in the culture of this country. There have been laws previously as well and the whole point as to why we are in this position of being totally discredited, being the laughing stock of the world at large is precisely because of the culture that we perceive. Everything that is done in this House and outside is merely a box-ticking exercise to try and demonstrate to the world in some way that we merely qualify for democracy. That is it; nothing goes beyond that. Everything else is just a pack of cards. There is nothing inside; it is hollow because it is window dressing. It is playing to the gallery and simply an exercise of ticking the box. And until that culture changes, Sir, my view is that all these laws will remain mere academic exercises and hollow promises.

Sir, the UN Human Rights Council sessions have just commenced. The High Commissioner, in his General Address to the Commission, has referred to Sri Lanka specifically and has noted that there has been no forward movement at all on questions of accountability and has, in fact, demonstrated quite strongly, given that it is a general statement regarding all Member Countries, of his disappointment. The High Commissioner two High Commissions back, Prince Zeid, made the observation that Sri Lanka, as a country, cannot be trusted and cannot be entrusted with the duty of carrying out a meaningful and an impartial inquiry into crimes that had been committed during the war and in his reasoning he said that the State structure, not only the Judiciary, but also the State structure in itself, because of the ethnic conflict and the civil war, has been so corrupted that you cannot possibly expect a free and fair trial.

Those are observations, Sir, that go to the very core of what we are discussing here today because if the system that is supposed to implement these laws in itself is considered to be so corrupted, then, these laws obviously cannot, by extension, be implemented with the intention of what the international community or the right-thinking people in this country who genuinely wish for there to be a just system could possibly expect. Now, that is the fundamental problem.

Take a good example, Sir. We have a Minister of Public Security. An incident took place on the 02nd of June, which concerns me, and it was blown up in the media and got a lot of publicity. When the Minister was asked at one of the Governments press conferences regarding the incident, he immediately stated to the press

that he was going to call for a full report from the police and that he expects that report to be presented to him on the 05th. That, in the face of it, is correct because even though he is the Minister of Public Security, he obviously does not control the police. Polices functions are supposed to be entirely independent; it is supposed to be entirely free from political interference. So, rightly, if there was some issue and since it was a high-profile issue, he quite correctly, at that stage asked for a report. But, then, what does he do? On the 08th of June, when I came here to this House and raised a Privilege issue, and on the 09th of June, when my Colleague, the Hon. Selvarajah Kajendren, asked the Minister whether that report he asked for to be submitted on the 05th has been received by him and whether he has gone through it, he admitted to this House that he had not received it, that the report was not complete. But, without batting an eyelid, the Minister then stands in front of us in this House and goes on to defend the police. Now, why would the Minister, if he was not, in fact, directly involved in pressurizing the police to act in a certain way, because I am a political opponent and a severe critic of this Government, have to jump the gun even before he got the report he had asked for into his hand and read it and defend the police in that way?

Why would such a person behave in that way if, actually, he has not been the person behind the polices conduct? So, unfortunately, that is the true nature of the culture. It is not only the Minister of Public Security who has done this, but all Members of all the governments are accused of this. It is not something new, Sir. Not only that, but the witnesses with regard to that incident concerning me are continuing to be harassed; possible witnesses are being harassed. Today, a journalist, Pradeepan Thambithurai, who had reported on the incident has been called before the Kilinochchi Police. That journalist is actually a critic of our party; he has criticized our party. Simply because he had reported something which hurts the police, he is today being called by the police potentially as a suspect. So, this is the culture, Sir, that this country has galvanized over the years almost to a perfection that its credibility, even when you have laws that you enact, is so low that all of these are seen as just merely box-ticking exercises. That, unfortunately, Sir, is the curse that is before this country and the irony of it is that the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms, someone who was very critical of the corruption that the Members he seated with have been indulging in and critical of the Leader of the party he, today, depends on to be a Minister, has to go and sit there today.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Do you think that the Hon. Minister, no matter what his good intentions are, can see through these Acts with

the intentions they were passed? You cannot because the culture stinks and until you change that and until you root it out from the very bottom, all of this will just simply be hollow.

Airbus received from SLA Executive 1 a further invoice for an additional US$ 1 million on 2 December, 2013. Payment was approved by Airbus employee 1[senior] and Airbus employee 9 [senior] (Airbus SMO) and US$ 2 million was paid in Euros to the Company of Intermediary 1 (i.e. 1,454,651.24) on 27 December, 2013.

Hon. Minister, according to what you are saying, that is proceeds of crime. Is that not so? So, are you taking steps to forfeit that money?

( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) Hon. Presiding Member, if I have the power, I will do it now itself. But, this power is vested in the Commission. Certainly, anybody can make a complaint to the Commission. Under the new law, the Commission, even without entertaining a complaint, on its own, is entitled to look into these matters and make suitable orders. If that power is vested in politicians, then you know that there would be a problem. That is why we are establishing this independent Commission. So, the power is vested in the commission and you can certainly make a complaint.
