[9.39 a.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Chairman, several decades ago, Singapore was infested with mosquitoes and the literacy level of Singaporeans was at a very low level. At that time, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew made a distinct and unique decision. He stated, Education is the most powerful equalizer and the most important instrument for reducing poverty and inequality. Sir, I commenced my speech with Singapore as an example and also in English primarily to emphasize the need for Sri Lanka to embark on a new voyage in educational transformation.

There was a time when Sri Lanka was considered a shining star in education. Its literacy levels, numeracy, primary school enrollment and gender parity was the envy of most of the South Asian peers.

However, in recent times, we have not kept pace; the countrys education system has not kept up with global advancements in education. We have, through an old-fashioned system, struggled to ensure quality, find relevance and validity amongst the regional and international peers. The existing system of school and State university education, Hon. Minister, is outdated and has ceased to be inspiring or capable of firing the imagination of our student population. Our system does not adequately prepare the students for newer jobs of the emerging decades of the 21st Century nor does the system prepare young people to meet the existing challenges of society and to face the multidimensional crisis that Sri Lanka continues to face. Therefore, the crisis in education in this country can be summed up as a crisis of quality, access, equity and relevance and inclusion augmented by a huge crisis in funding.

Hon. Minister, internationally, it is well-known that the majority of jobs that would be available and in demand in 2030 are not even known today.

The World Economic Forum, the OECD and similar agencies and institutions regularly evaluate educational needs and developments and predict that the priority skills sets that would be sought after by employers in 2025 would include creative thinking, analytical thinking, collaboration, artificial intelligence and big data. The British Council did a recent study titled Current Challenges and Future Directions - 2023 and that has exhibited the major and glaring weaknesses in Sri Lankas education system. The skills gaps among the young people in Sri Lanka include technical skills and digital literacy, analytical and creative thinking, leadership skills, communication and language skills, understanding and adapting to new skills sets that are needed professionally. Making learning student-centric, project-based, dynamic, inclusive and collaborative and allowing creativity to blossom are all essential ingredients for Sri Lankas success in education. If Sri Lanka ever hopes to transcend the current economic and multiple crises, we have to ensure that there are revolutionary, path-breaking and transformative changes in the Sri Lankan education system.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan) I can give you time from my allotted time.

Hon. Member, you are speaking of an issue very well known. You are documenting the issue and we all are aware of it. That is an issue I inherited, but did not create; neither the Hon. Minister nor did I create it. But, I would like to report to this honourable House that we have solved the problem. You pointed out exactly where the problem is. It is an interpersonal, intertrade problem. We have solved that and three wards will be dedicated for that. Prof. M. Sunil Shantha, Vice-Chancellor of the Sabaragamuwa University confirmed that from the 12th of this month, they would be able to start the process.

Thank you.

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Athukorala, Attorney-at-Law) Thank you, Hon. State Minister, but the problem is about accreditation.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan) The SLMC has agreed to look into the new standards and to visit the sites. I must tell you, with the permission of the Minister, that the SLMC must understand that this country and the entire universe was going through an unprecedented situation for the last four years. The COVID-19 pandemic was not something that the Leader of the Opposition or I started. But, we all suffered from it. So, one cannot demand not to compromise, but, of course, as creative people, we must find new solutions for that.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Susil Premajayantha, Attorney-at-Law) In the morning, I spoke to Dr. Palitha Abeykoon, one of the members of the Sri Lanka Medical Council. He

2389 2390

assured that provided the professorial unit would be started very soon, within the next couple of days, within six months, they would have an evaluation and could go ahead with that. At the moment, it is sorted out, but another week or two will be taken to start the Professorial Unit in the Ratnapura Hospital.

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Athukorala, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Minister, I thank you very much for that clarification. But, the problem is these students will have to sit for their scheduled examinations.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Susil Premajayantha, Attorney-at-Law) They would not miss their batch.

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Athukorala, Attorney-at-Law) But, accreditation also has to be done. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Susil Premajayantha, Attorney-at-Law) It will be done.

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Athukorala, Attorney-at-Law) It has nothing to do with the SLMC, I have to state that clearly.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Susil Premajayantha, Attorney-at-Law) I intervened in this matter three times. About two weeks ago, I was invited to the COPE. The Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of the Sabaragamuwa University, the Vice-Chancellors of the Sabaragamuwa and Moratuwa Universities and the Deans of Faculties of the three universities were also present there. We discussed it in detail and even this morning, I spoke to the Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana. He also assured that three wards will be converted into professorial units, consultants will be attached to the Faculty of Medicine and that, of course, the students will not miss their batch. After six months, an evaluation by the Sri Lanka Medical Council would be done and they could go ahead.

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Athukorala, Attorney-at-Law) Thank you, Hon. Minister. I really do not know about the current situation. In fairness to the GMOA, I must say that they are also supporting these students to see that their studies will be continued.

Without calling for any interviews - they cannot just do that because these are not permanent cadres - they had simply taken them in and therefore, there is a serious injustice caused to others. There are several other teachers who had already applied. What happens to them? They have lost their opportunity to get in there. These people have been attached for that particular purpose for a short period of time. This preferential treatment by certain people there, is causing a serious problem and I hope, since the Minister is aware of what is happening there, he will look into this matter.

Sir, I would like to raise one other matter. Since the Minister is also the Leader of the House, he is quite aware of the decency that is required by us, Members of Parliament, when we start criticizing judges and judgments.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Okay, Sir. Yesterday, the Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe had taken up a matter regarding which I have certain comments to make. Since my time is up, I will speak about it tomorrow. I think the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam also will raise a Privilege issue tomorrow since his name also had been dragged in for a different issue. But, I would like to talk about another Members comments on judges. I think we will have to correctly apply our Privileges because the procedure should not be abused. Privileges should be there, but under the guise of trying to exercise the Privilege of free speech, you cannot go on using outrageously intemperate accusations and wordings. So, these have to be avoided. I will deal with it when that Privilege issue is taken up by the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam tomorrow morning. In fact, I mentioned to the Hon. Speaker today at the meeting of the Committee of Selection that I have serious reservations about what happened in the House the other day.

Thank you.

I think, yesterday, the Hon. Minister of Justice made a Ministerial Statement. Hon. Hakeem, it would be better if the matter is taken up in his presence tomorrow morning. Then, of course, he can reply and you also can raise any additional matters.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan) Sir, I am taking one minute from the Hon. Sanjeeva Edirimanna's time and you can pass him that minute from my time.

I need to clarify this to the Hon. Rauff Hakeem, a former Minister of Higher Education. Hon. Hakeem, your observations are well taken. The crisis in higher education or in the education system is not something which has just sprung up or something that has happened yesterday. You are a seasoned, veteran politician who knows about Parliamentarians and who was also a one time Minister of Higher Education. For far too long, this countrys education has been politicized, ethnicized, regionalized and even religionized. So, we must come together and stop that nonsense.

You said that the Vice Chancellor of the South-Eastern University wishes to have a faculty. We cannot allow such wishes. There is the Chairman of the UGC; there is the CVCD and they have to decide as to which university needs a faculty. Even I cannot decide that. - [Interruption.] Sir, let me finish this. For far too long, politicians and outsiders have interfered in the education system of this country. I have been in this Parliament only for three years, but you all are veteran and senior politicians. Please do not appeal to that human instinct. There are educationists, there are people who have gone abroad and studied these things and also there are those

people who are going to Washington next week, and let them decide it. We will make the principles, but starting faculties cannot happen according to the wishes of somebody who is inside or outside the system.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Presiding Member - ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes, Hon. Rauff Hakeem?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) The Hon. State Minister of Higher Education is suddenly taking umbrage at a very solemn request that I made.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please do not have a debate on this. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) But, that is a long-standing issue which had been considered by the Council. Proper procedures are adopted in this and they will send it to the UGC and only after the UGC approves it, the faculty could be started. Those procedures, we are also aware of. We are not asking the Hon. Minister to, by edict, set up these faculties tomorrow. Therefore, I do not think that you need to get unnecessarily disturbed, Hon. State Minister. The only thing is, I know that the Hon. Minister has a problem with the Vice-Chancellor. That is a different issue. ( ) (The Hon. Dullas Alahapperuma) , .

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) But one minute has been reduced from your time. [.. 4.43]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) . .

Hon. Presiding Member, firstly, I would like to congratulate the Hon. Minister Susil Premajayantha and his team of State Ministers for giving priority to the concept of English education. I am someone who had had the good fortune of being educated in English. I know its advantages and sincerely hope that that advantage or that practice is available to everybody.

In that respect, though there is a small proviso, when you do make that transition, it must be a complete transition. For example, the Law College - I think we have raised it in this House - insisted that its exams must be conducted in English. The law students have come from a background of studying in Sinhala and Tamil and to suddenly insist that at the Law College, they all have to sit for the exams in English, I think, is terribly unfair. So, as the Hon. Member who spoke before me stated, since it is a ten-year programme of implementing it, at that stage to take such decisions, I think, would be fair, but not otherwise. But, I certainly endorse the shift and the fact that this team of the Ministry of Education has had the backbone to face up to the implementation of this policy, which, I think, should be congratulated.

Then, with regard to the situation of education in the North and the East, especially in the backdrop where the Provincial Councils are not functioning, unfortunately, a Cabinet Minister who had been elected from Jaffna has taken it upon himself to use the Ministry of Education in the Provincial Council as a private property. He, as a result, has been interfering in all the transfers, which ideally ought to have been taking place through the Transfer Board that, under Circular No. 2007/20, includes unions and heads of departments.

That is a circular applicable to all the provincial councils right throughout the country. But, in transfers in the North, in particular, and in the East as well, that

2439 2440

Cabinet Minister who had been elected from Jaffna uses his influence and intervenes and as a result, it is just throwing the whole system out of sync. Therefore, I appeal to the Minister, the Hon. Susil Premajayantha, to intervene in this matter and make sure that such interferences do not take place. It must be looked into as a matter of priority.

The second matter that I wish to raise on behalf of the principals and the teachers is this. Sir, you would recall that last year and the year before that, there was a big Debate with regard to the need to revise the salary schemes of the principals and the teachers. There was a lot of trade union action, particularly during the last Budget and that trade union action reached a climax and eventually, the Ministry of Education agreed to implement the recommendations of the Subodhini Committee in three stages. As the first stage, they agreed to one-third of the salary revision, but, unfortunately, in this Budget, there is no mention of the second and third stages. So, I urge the Hon. Minister once again to look into that. I mean, the last thing we want is another trade union action on a matter that had already been addressed and settled. Therefore, I strongly urge that that matter is also looked into as a matter of priority.

Then, with regard to the situation in universities, the State university system, quite honestly in my opinion, is going into a crisis. There is a brain drain. People are wanting to leave the country because of its economic situation. This will definitely threaten to paralyze education activities. The academics, the non-academic staff and the technical staff are either permanently leaving the country or taking advantage of the opportunity to go on no-pay leave. Some who go on leave are exploring the possibility of finding permanent jobs overseas and may not even return. That is a grave danger happening, not only in the higher education field, but also in other sectors, particularly in the health sector, and I think the Hon. Minister concerned must address that situation.

Another reason why this brain drain is taking place is, the way in which taxation is handled. University teachers have been affected by the new tax regime. The Federation of University Teachers Association - FUTA - has submitted some reforms to the current tax regime. Amendments are needed to that, Hon. State Minister. The Government has to seriously take into consideration an individual's ability to pay taxes. A blanket system that applies uniformly to everyone is unfair. Factors such as the number of dependents of the individual, the previous loans he has obtained et cetera should be taken into consideration in that. The introduction of a wealth tax and the taxation of big businesses, I think, should be the way out, not so much the current approach. So, I think that is another reason which is causing this brain drain.

Everything looks quite greener from outside. Countries like Australia and Canada, I think, are welcoming our academics and doctors with open arms and the amount of remuneration that is offered to them in those countries cannot even be compared to what is

offered here. So, unless we get our house in order, we are going to lose in this matter.

And also, Hon. Minister, the probationary lecturers have to sign a bond, if they want to go on study leave to pursue postgraduate programmes overseas. That amount of the bond is huge and that is mainly because the Government is factoring the scholarship money provided by western universities and scholarship-warding institutions such as the Fulbright Commission in calculating the bond amount. Due to the depreciation of the rupee, that figure has risen exponentially. Probationary lecturers are unable to find guarantors. Young academics with a commitment to serve the country are sadly resigning from their positions. This also discourages young academics from pursuing their higher studies in internationally acclaimed universities overseas. Therefore, the system which factors in scholarship money and other stipends provided by overseas institutions should be abolished.

The Faculty of Arts at the University of Jaffna is understaffed; the teaching load per academic has increased and the teachers are overburdened. They have very little time to engage in research and outreach activities. Therefore, the students have written a letter to the university administration to recruit academics so that their degree programmes can be run smoothly.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. Your time is over.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I am winding up, Sir. I table* that letter written by the Arts Faculty Students' Union.

There are huge disparities between the University of Colombo and the universities outside, especially those in the North and the East, when it comes to allocation of human resources in certain disciplines or areas. I would like to point out the sociology statistics which appeared in a UGC publication released in 2022. If the State cannot create new cadre positions, it should actively redistribute the existent cadres in such a way that the universities in the North and the East and outside Colombo could also remain academically vibrant.

Finally, Sir, I wish to state - the Hon. State Minister knows this because he was a Governor of the Northern Province - that militarization within the universities is huge. I am someone who believes that there should be free thinking in universities and that students should be allowed freedom with regard to political ideology. I think it is only through that that you could get a fully formed society and leaders. But, in the North and the East, the

2441 2442

complete opposite is happening; it is a very unhealthy position. I believe that if we are to progress, students must be given - it is lawful - within democratic limits the opportunity to freely engage in political thought and in political activity to a point that it will create a society that is more representative as opposed to something that is prescriptive.

Thank you.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan) Sir, I will take 30 seconds to respond to the Hon. Ponnambalam. I think he raised many pertinent issues, on which we find common ground. His last point that militarization is taking place in higher education centres in the Northern Province is somewhat contested and I would say that recent incidents show contradiction.

Swasthika is a social activist. She was supposed to deliver a lecture. Because she had critiqued the LTTE and its violence, she was not allowed do her lecture. That is what the last report states. So, I think there are contradictory reports coming in. As a policy, the Government and I, as a former academic, stand for intellectual independence of every university away from politics, whether it be southern politics, northern politics, parliamentary politics or even armed politics. That is the way we want to rebuild democracy in this country, Sir.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam)

. . rose.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes, Hon. Ponnambalam? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. State Minister, that good lady being prevented from delivering her lecture is something that, in principle, I do not agree with; she should have been allowed, But, the argument is this. The university prevents the complete opposite view from being expressed. Not only in the University of Jaffna or in the Eastern University, but also in any other university in this country, the complete opposite view of the good ladys opinion on political affairs, particularly that with regard to the Tamils, cannot be expressed. So, you cannot, very conveniently, try to project a political thought in that way. That is the primary contention with regard to those who opposed it.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. A. Aravindh Kumar. You have 10 minutes.

[4.56 p.m.] . ( ) ( . - ) (The Hon. A. Aravindh Kumar - State Minister of Education) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member. My only problem is, since I have to answer many questions that have been raised by the Hon. Members, I do not think I would be able to do that within 10 minutes. Anyway, Sir, I will try my best.

I am sorry, I do not want to take your time, Hon. Member. But, you have completely misunderstood about the Climate Change University. It is not a university that offers undergraduate programmes, but a research university where postgraduates and persons with doctorates from other countries would come and do researches at a global level. So, what are you talking about? We have identified the land; there is an international agreement that is being prepared and the University of Oxford is working with us. Please do not say these to become popular. That university is underway.

Hon. Presiding Member, as I commence my speech, I wish to express my unwavering solidarity with the people of Palestine. In a world often divided by borders and differences, it is crucial to remember our shared humanity.

The struggles faced by the Palestinian people are deeply rooted in historical complexities, causing pain and hardship for generations. It is incumbent upon us to acknowledge their right to self-determination and a dignified existence.

Solidarity is not just a sentiment; it is a call to action. As a House, we must advocate for a lasting resolution. As Parliamentarians and as the global community, we have a responsibility to amplify the voices of the oppressed and advocate for a world where all people can live in freedom, security and prosperity. It is only through unity and a shared commitment to justice that we could hope to bring about a positive change for the people of Palestine and contribute to a more peaceful world.

( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana) Hon. Chairman, in expressing solidarity, let us not only empathize with their struggles, but actively work towards a future where everyone, regardless of their background, could coexist in harmony and prosperity. Together, let us build bridges, not walls and stand united for the cause of justice and human rights.

Having said that and expressed solidarity to the Palestinian people, let me now engage in the Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Education, which is led by the Hon. (Dr.) Susil Premajayantha. Alongside him, we have the State Minister of Education, the Hon. A. Aravindh Kumar, and the State Minister of Higher Education, the Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan, akin to Hon. Ministers right and left hands, providing valuable support and strength to enhance the education system.

First, I take the opportunity to commend the Hon. Minister for making reforms in the educational sector to achieve quality, equity and excellence. I was made to understand, Hon. Minister, that you have formulated to implement a National Education Policy Framework, which was prepared by a Cabinet Subcommittee chaired by the Hon. President and which also included the Prime Minister and that it has already been approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. I am also made to understand that you have appointed a 25-member expert officials committee to support that Cabinet Subcommittee. We look forward to the NEPF which aligns with the national development goals and the countrys global commitments on education. And, as responsible Members of Parliament, our fullest support will be extended in that regard.

In the meantime, let me draw your attention to the many shortcomings prevailing in the Batticaloa Central Education Zone. Hon. Aravindh Kumar, you must be knowing that the Batticaloa Central Education Zone stands out for its achievements in both the academic and sports domains, earning numerous national awards and recognition. The operational hub of the Batticaloa Central Education Zone is currently situated in the premises of Al-Juffriya Vidyalaya in Eravur Town, but it has been facing challenges due to insufficient space and basic amenities since inception. Therefore, I respectfully urge the Hon. Minister to promptly support the establishment of a fully-equipped zonal office complete with necessary furniture and equipment.

There are numerous schools in the Batticaloa Central Education Zone which have secured multiple victories at national and provincial competitions. Nevertheless, it is worth highlighting that those schools, currently, lack sufficient sports and recreation facilities. Hence, there is a crucial need for the development and provision of sports grounds as well as recreational facilities and equipment for those institutions.

Further, deficiency in furniture affects both students and teachers in a majority of schools. These schools continue to rely on furniture provided more than 10 to 15

years ago, which need reparation, but no funds are allocated for the same.

Therefore, it would be highly valued if the Hon. Minister could focus attention on the prevalent furniture shortages in most of those schools.

Principals and teachers have been grappling with salary irregularities since 1997. As you are aware, as a result of implementing Public Administration Circular No. 2/97 issued based on the Report of the B. C. Perera Salary Commission, a salary anomaly was created for principals and teachers. While the Hon. (Dr.) Susil Premajayantha has approved a policy to overhaul the salaries of retired principals and teachers, there has been no implementation of it by the relevant Ministry, nor do we see any funds allocated in the Budget for that purpose. It is unfortunate that teachers and principals are compelled to either resort to legal action or to take to the streets to advocate for their rights. The situation becomes even more disheartening when they face mistreatment and brutality from the police or security officers during such protests. I respectfully implore the Hon. Minister to promptly address that issue of salary anomaly affecting the principals and teachers.

The English Diploma holders who have successfully completed their HNDE courses and applied for the available positions faced the open competitive examination held on the 27th of February, 2021 for recruitment as English teachers for Grade 3-I (C) in Eastern Province. Subsequently, they were selected following the interviews on the 25th and 26th of July, 2023, but are experiencing delays in their appointments due to non-approval by the Treasury.

Considering the dearth of English teachers in the Eastern Province, I respectfully urge the Hon. Minister to expedite the approval process for their appointments. When the present Government appointed 50,000 graduates as Development Officers, some of the selected officers among them were appointed to schools and they performed well as teachers, too. Therefore, I urge the Government to facilitate the appointments of those Development Officers as teachers in the respective schools where they have previously demonstrated strong performances.

Throughout the country, there are performing principals, who have been serving in that capacity for eight to 10 years. Given their unwavering commitment and dedication despite the challenges, I respectfully request that they be officially appointed as principals in the respective schools they have been serving as performing principals.

Once again, I would like to wish you, Hon. Minister, success in implementing the National Education Policy Framework, which contains policy principles for making a transformative change in the education sector in line with the vision of "Developed Sri Lanka in 2048".

Thank you, Hon. Chairman.

Governments, all over the world, are under severe pressure to cut back on higher education provided in the welfare mode. This is the post-Berlin Wall neo-noir reality of the communicative capitalism that we are facing. The biggest threat is to Arts and Humanity subjects. Those subjects are cut away in such a manner that recently, the Oxford University removed even the subject of classical music they had had for 600 years, which is a tragedy of humanity, but that is the reality we have to face.

How are we, in Sri Lanka, going to face this? We have, I think, taken Jesuss golden statement "Man shall not live by bread alone into consideration. A nation cannot be built only by IT engineers. Mothers and fathers, everybody, want their children to do IT, but we tell them, IT alone would not build a society. We need artistes; we need social scientists; we need political scientists; we need anthropologists and that is why, for the first time in the Sri Lankan history, 285 Arts degrees are being brought onto one digital dashboard to find out how effective those degrees are, what their employability rate is and how we can combine those degrees. Unfortunately - Hon. Minister, you know about this - , . . , staff . .

, . 30 . . . , . . . , .

Let us, at least, agree on developing our education without dividing ourselves on political and regional lines. It is important. I say to the diaspora, particularly to the Tamil diaspora, You have a responsibility to rebuild the war-affected areas of this nation. Come back and revisit the Jaffna University, the Vavuniya University, the

2479 2480

Eastern University and the South-Eastern University and see where the problems are and how you could help, invest or teach in those universities. I must confess, Hon. Minister, that this time, with your initiative, we have 600 diaspora academics who are willing to come and teach in Sri Lanka during their furlough or sabbatical. That is a very good move. I am asking, why can we not have the next most efficient scientist coming from the Jaffna University? Why can we not have the next most talented surgeon coming from the Batticaloa University? We will do that.

Could you give an assurance that they would not be arrested and detained under the PTA like it is happening right now? Do you think they will come to the country?

That is the way forward.

In fact, now, that number has risen to ten, just from Batticaloa.

"......during the last week of November in Batticaloa at a memorialization event, and charged them under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

Is the Government trying to mislead the international community and the Human Rights Council by talking about reconciliation and a Truth and Reconciliation Commission - TRC - whilst oppressing citizens in the country?"

Sir, I am glad that it is the Hon. State Minister of Foreign Affairs who will be responding to this Motion along with the Hon. Minister of Public Security because my view is that the Cabinet Minister of Foreign Affairs is not fit to hold that portfolio, considering the fact that he had been the personal counsel of somebody who is accused of crimes against humanity and also economic crimes. So, I am glad that the Cabinet Minister in charge of foreign affairs is not responding and that it is the State Minister who would, since the Cabinet Ministers opinion does not really count as there is a conflict of interest.

Moving further, Hon. State Minister of Foreign Affairs, if you follow the tweets of last week on Twitter, you would notice that Ambassador Julie Chung of the US Embassy has tweeted about the use of the PTA, High Commissioner Andrew Patrick of the British High Commission has tweeted about the use of the PTA and also the Office of the European Union in Sri Lanka has tweeted about the use of the PTA, just like they did with the rest last year relating to the protests in Sri Lanka. The High Commission of Canada to Sri Lanka and the Maldives has tweeted; the UN Human Rights Council has also tweeted in their Twitter account. So, this is a very serious issue, Hon. State Minster in charge of foreign affairs, because you are telling the international community one thing and within the country, you are doing the exact opposite. There is no reconciliation in this country!

Right now, the number of people who are migrating or leaving this country and seeking asylum in foreign countries has increased. That is because they cannot live within this country. They are arrested under the PTA for memorialization of their dead. There were no LTTE flags or symbols relating to the LTTE at those events in Batticaloa, but they were arrested. There was a young boy who is 18 years old and a school student. The only thing he did was, he accompanied his father, who provided equipment for that event. He also had been arrested and detained. His school has given a letter regarding his studentship. Then, a person who works in a bakery had been arrested for selling a cake! Now, how do you expect the Tamils to live in this country and expect us to believe that the Government is genuine in its reconciliation efforts? Livestock farmers are forced to sell their cattle because you are taking over their pasture land; you all are not letting them live.

There is intimidation from the TID and the CID. Apart from the membersof the Government parties, the others connected to the Ilankai Tamil Arausu Kadchi and other political parties from the North and the East are being intimidated, even today. They do not even want us

ADJOURNMENT () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Susil Premajayantha, Attorney-at-Law) , .

. . Question proposed. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , .

CONTINUOUS ENFORCEMENT OF PREVENTION OF

TERRORISM ACT

[6.52 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I would like to move the following Adjournment Motion on a very important matter:

"For years, Sri Lanka occupied the international spotlight for one of its most contentious laws - the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). The PTA was introduced in 1979 during the Sri Lankan Civil war as an emergency law provision in Part II of the Public Security Ordinance.

Successive Sri Lankan regimes have used this draconian law to detain mostly Tamils and Muslims without genuine cause, and to extract false confessions through the use of torture. The crackdown on anti-government protesters in 2022 saw the arrest of Sinhala youth who were also detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

In 2022, a nationwide mobile signature campaign asking for the PTA to be repealed was led by Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran and myself. This campaign received nationwide support from citizens, activists and all political parties, barring the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna.

While the legislation has been repeatedly condemned by sections within the country and the international community, Sri Lanka has failed to repeal it. A series of US, EU and Canadian representatives, alongside international human rights organizations, expressed their concern over the Sri Lankan Governments use of the PTA to detain the protesters last year.

In a tweet last year, the European Union said it was 'concerned' by the development, and claimed that the Sri Lankan Government had given assurances to the international community about the 'de-facto moratorium of the use of the PTA.'

Despite such assurance, the police have arrested over nine individuals........."

to mention in Parliament the names of those who have been intimidated because if we do, they are worried of further prosecution.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , .

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) , .

Sir, those people have been intimidated; ex-combatants are still being intimidated. So, how do you expect them to live in this country? Why are you lying to the international community, saying that you are genuine in your reconciliation efforts? The Cabinet Minister spoke about the TRC with the Tamil Members of Parliament and we rejected it because we represent the victim community and they do not accept this. Do you know why? It is because of the Governments actions.

Now, moving on to the Ministry of Public Security, I spoke to the Minister of Public Security over the phone and explained that situation to him, thinking that the police in Batticaloa had made a mistake by arresting those people under the PTA. I conveyed to him that that was wrong and should not happen, that the PTA should not be used since the Government has declared a moratorium on the use of it. But still, they have been remanded. I asked the Hon. Minister of Public Security to intervene. So, the Government cannot say that it was not their doing or that that was a mistake. This was predetermined.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , . ( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) , .

On the day of the memorialization, I was there. There were women who were around 70 to 80 years old. The police brought in excessive force; there were hundreds of police officers with batons. For what? Was it to hit those women and children? There were military tanks parked outside.

Sir, I expect a response to what I raised about the TRC from the State Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Public Security. Will you not release those people? Are you going to hold them and destroy their lives like you have destroyed many lives of Tamil youth in this country? Are you going to do that? Is the President instructing you to do this or is the President pretending

not to have any clue about it and you are doing it? Is there no real communication between the President and you all? What is going on in this country? Are you going to destroy the lives of those ten people?

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , . ( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Sir, there is one last thing. There is one Mr. N. Nagules, the Vice President of the Crusaders for Democracy, a political party. The reason why he had been arrested was, providing lunch for some women! So, providing lunch is a terrorism-related activity in this country! Is that your opinion? So, Hon. Minister, please do what is right. If you have a conscience, do the right thing, tell the police not to charge them under the PTA. If you want, charge them under the Penal Code. Please, please, do not destroy any more lives of young, innocent Tamil people in this country.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , .. . 4 .

[6.59 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank the Hon. Shanakiyan Rasamanickam for bringing this Adjournment Motion, which is very timely. I think the Motion itself is self-explanatory and very accurate.

Sir, the point I would like to make is that the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, not that of any other country or any other international body, way back in 2015 or 2016 gave a recommendation to the Government that even LTTE members as the LTTE must be allowed to be commemorated, that that is their fundamental right and that the whole notion of commemoration is part of transitional justice - it is the fifth pillar of transitional justice - and that it must be permitted. The Government, ever since, has gone to Geneva and many other places and has stated that they would allow it. And in the process, they have also given several commitments not to implement the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

What happened over the last week with regard to those commemorative events is important, Sir, because the Governments stated policy from the President down is that commemorations are allowed, and it has been repeatedly stated. Thereafter, the police went to the

2493 2494

[ ]

2023 05

magistrates of all the relevant areas within the North and the East, seeking bans for the commemorations. But, the magistrates, at every instance, rejected to give a ban; except for the magistrate in Sampur, all others rejected it and stated that there is a right to commemoration of the dead secured under the Constitution and that people are entitled to commemorate, with the only proviso that LTTE paraphernalia, outwardly, must not be projected at any stage, and instructions were given that if such things happen, then, the police can go ahead, arrest and bring them under the law. That is what was instructed.

But, instead, what happened was the complete opposite: people were prevented from commemorating their dead. In fact, the Batticaloa Organizer of our alliance, the Tamil National Peoples Front, went to one of the cemeteries with his son. Had hired a vehicle to take some red and yellow flags, simply red and yellow flags, to the cemetery and when he went, he was turned back. The police refused to allow him and other people there to commemorate. So, he turned back; he did not even commemorate. He turned back, was on his way to the Batticaloa Town and midway through, was stopped at another checkpoint and there, the police decided to arrest the vehicle and the driver. Why? Because, they had red and yellow flags. Red and yellow are the colours of Tamil nationalism. My party is the All Ceylon Tamil Congress. In our flag, we have red and yellow; the Federal Party also has red and yellow. Long superseding the LTTE or any militant groups, that war criminal Pillaiyan had had red and yellow in his flag. But, for having red and yellow flags, they were taken into custody. My organizer and his son went along with the police - they were not even arrested, they went along because it was my organizer who hired that vehicle - and at the time of 6.05 p.m., the son of our organizer wanted to commemorate and asked the police and the police said, Go outside and light a lamp. When he did it, he was then arrested. All of them were arrested under the PTA.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Now, against commemoration, you all are using the PTA despite the fact that you all have said to the world that there is a moratorium on the usage of the PTA. Simply for commemorating, when you could use whatever other legal measures you want to investigate, you use the PTA, primarily because you all want to terrorize the population. You want to terrorize them to make sure that they give up commemorations effectively because your intention is not reconciliation, your intention is not to allow people to have their rights. On the contrary, you want to make sure that it is breached in such a way that on the next occasion, those people themselves will censor their own activities and not commemorate.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . . .

[.. 7.04]

. . ( . ) (The Hon. Premnath C. Dolawatte, Attorney-at-Law) , .

Whilst the Hon. Shanakiyan Rasamanickam has the ability to speak in all three languages, he addressed this House in English. I think more than addressing this House, he addressed the entire world regarding this matter. Anyway, he has the liberty to speak in any language he wishes to. I know that and have no objection to that. But, unfortunately, we are raising racism in this House. We do not care about whatever commemoration that was held in the North and the East to memorialize those who died in the civil war.

But, we cannot just let go of the PTA in this country. Any country can have a prevention of terrorism law. So, we also have to have that. We cannot just let go of the PTA and allow anybody the liberty to carry out any terrorist activity. Even the USA, as a so-called democratic country, has its own Patriot Act. So, we must be very careful when we ask for something. For instance, there have been some incidents which happened in Colombo and in the southern area, for which some suspects had been arrested under the PTA. The PTA might be used in the wrong way. - [Interruption] I did not disturb you, Hon. Member. I have only three minutes. - [Interruption] What is this? Behave like a gentleman. - [Interruption] Just wait! So, there are some instances where barricades and checkpoints are set up.

This is one entire country. The North and the East are also parts of this country. So, we have to understand that reality. . . , . PTA . , LTTE , . , PTA . , PTA . .

That law is not entirely for the Tamil people. Tamil people are also part of the brotherhood of this country; they are also citizens of this country. Whether they are Tamils, Sinhalese or Muslims, if somebody has violated their rights under the PTA, we are against that. Definitely, we do not have any difference because of their ethnicity. PTA violate , . , PTA . , we

2495 2496

experienced the Easter Sunday attack. While discussions on the cancellation or the amendment of the PTA were going on, unfortunately, due to lack of security and attention, what happened? Ultimately, we had to face the Easter Sunday attack. Therefore, any country should have some kind of Act for prevention of terrorism. While exercising such an Act, there might be occasions where the human rights of others could be violated. So, we have to ensure the protection of everybodys rights. That is a different story. That has nothing to do with ethnicity. Whether they are Tamils, Sinhalese or Muslims, all are citizens of this country, all are human beings. Also, whoever comes to this country, we have to ensure their human rights as well.

So, what I say is, do not focus on a particular race. We all are Sri Lankans; whether we are Tamils, Sinhalese or Muslims, we all are Sri Lankans. We have to just get together and work towards protecting human rights. That is our duty. My Fellow Members who moved and seconded the Motion are well-educated politicians. I think you all have broader minds. Just stop being racist and work as Sri Lankans. So, I urge the well-educated Members of this House, please, let us work together, just forget about the past and move forward. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . 3 .

[7.09 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I stand before you with concerns about the abuse of the Prevention of Terrorism Act of Sri Lanka, particularly against the youth who wanted to talk about their rights or who were commemorating those who had fought for their rights.

The PTA has been used to justify numerous human rights violations including torture, sexual abuse, arbitrary detention and violation of international law. Members of all communities in Sri Lanka have suffered consistent discrimination and harassment, especially the Muslim community from 2013, culminating in the adoption of Government policies explicitly targeting the majority group.

The PTA has been expanded to include crimes such as property damage, theft and robbery and restrict the rights to freedom of assembly and speech. This vague and overbroad legislation has led to serious human rights violations as seen in the case of protestors, minority groups and political opponents, with them being targeted by the Government.

The proposed Anti-Terrorism Bill further expands the definition of terrorism and contains provisions which can lead to more abuses. The Anti-Terrorism Bill has been criticized for its potential to violate human rights and fundamental freedoms and particularly, our community would be affected by that legislation. The Sri Lankan Government has used the PTA and other laws to target members of the minority communities, especially the Tamils and Muslims, while taking no action against those inciting violence and discrimination against minority groups.

Therefore, it is crucial that we come together as a nation to address these issues and ensure that our counter-terrorism legislation complies with the international human rights standards. We must learn from the past and work towards a future, where the rights and freedoms of all citizens, regardless of their ethnicity or religion, are respected and protected. I urge you all to join in this fight for justice and human rights in Sri Lanka.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . 3 .

[7.20 p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya - State Minister of Foreign Affairs) Hon. Deputy Speaker, at the outset I want to tell the Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam that my Cabinet Minister had gone for "COP28" and thus he is unable to reply - not for any other reason. I know, the Hon. Minister and the Hon. Member have crossed swords in this House before. So, I do not want him to have a misconception as to why the Hon. Minister is not here.

In the Adjournment Motion that the Hon. Member has moved, he asks the question whether the Government is trying to mislead the international community and the Human Rights Council, by talking about the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and reconciliation in the country whilst oppressing citizens of the country. The short answer to your question is "no" and "certainly not". We do not want to hoodwink anybody.

When the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe became the President of the country last year through Parliament and through the Constitution, the need of the hour was economic reforms. But not only did the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe embark on economic reforms, he also spoke of political reforms.

We, all the Members in this House, spoke of Palestine and then, we spoke of how we need to address the root issues of Palestine in order for them to progress. Similarly, we do accept and understand that the root causes of the war in Sri Lanka also have to be addressed. There is no contention in that regard and I will tell you why the President, Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe or the Government does not want to suppress its citizens.

When Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe became the President, he not only spoke of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Office for Overseas Sri Lankan Affairs which he started, but he expedited the

work of OMP, the Office for Reparation and the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation also and most importantly, he invited all the representatives in this Parliament for a meeting to see what form of devolution that we can embark on. I think, we need to reach an agreement and we need to move forward.

I regret that a certain narrative is being built. Pertaining to the PTA, in 2017, the previous Government -the Yahapalana Government- gave an assurance that the PTA will be amended and in March 2022. The PTA was amended after 43 years. As a result of that amendment, so many Tamil prisoners who were in prison for a very long period of time were released.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , .

( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) And we have also given a commitment to the international community that the PTA will be repealed and a new anti-terrorism law will be brought forward. The Cabinet Subcommittee was appointed in September 2022 and on 20th February 2023, the Cabinet approved the Bill but there was a lot of feedback from the Bar Association and civil society, which said that they need to do further deliberations and on the 28th of August 2023, the Cabinet approval was given for the Bill. On the 1st of September 2023, a diplomatic briefing was conveyed in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs explaining about the new Bill.

I am sure, there are shortcomings and I am sure that we cannot satisfy everyone with regard to this Bill; but I think we need to stop building this narrative in which you are saying that the Government is trying to suppress the Tamils and because of that, the Tamils are leaving the country. If you look, Hon. Deputy Speaker, even the Sinhalese are leaving the country. That is because of the economic condition in the country - [Interruption] Yes. So, there are other reasons why people are leaving. You are not talking about that but you are only talking about one aspect of that.

As far as memorialization is concerned, people are entirely allowed to commemorate their dead ones. There is no issue in that. If one of my siblings, my brother or somebody from my family had died, I do have a right to commemorate him and I will stand with you in order for protecting that particular right. But we also have to understand that in 2011, as the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam also said, the LTTE was gazetted as a terrorist organization. But, if these commemorations are being used to advocate and to reignite the activities of terrorism, then arrest has to be done. The only law which is prevailing at this time in order to arrest them is the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act. So, I do not want to argue since I was not there to witness

2501 2502

[ ]

2023 05

the nature of activities that took place. From the reports that I have been given and from what I have been told, they were commemorating the LTTE which is a proscribed terrorist organization. So, I think we should stop building this narrative saying that if any arrest has been done, it is entirely the innocent Tamils, so on and so forth. But if any injustice has been done, it is also the duty of the Government to correct it.

Thank you.

Secondly, about the cake. I have seen the photo of the cake. There was no photo of Prabhakaran on it and the person who sold the cake had been arrested. Then, the student who went with his father had been arrested. There were no flags which had anything to do with the LTTE at all in Batticaloa. The photo you showed was taken in Jaffna. In my Motion, I have not said anything about Jaffna; I have mentioned about the incidents in Batticaloa.

Hon. Minister, you cannot tell the people in this country how they have to commemorate their dead. If

2511 2512

they have to commemorate their dead the way you want them to, what I am saying is- [Interruption.] After this point, there is nothing else to be raised and I will wind up, Sir. - [Interruption.] Hon.
