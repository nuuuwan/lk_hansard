[3.13 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, for the opportunity to say a few words on this Adjournment Motion on the Throne Speech made by the President yesterday in this House. I am saying Throne Speech because in the printed document of his Speech, the English version actually states Throne Speech; the Sinhala and the Tamil versions do not have it, but the English version states Throne Speech. Knowing the President as I do, he, probably, would have drafted his Speech in English first and he must have thought that he was actually making a Throne Speech. Those who translated it into Sinhala and Tamil knew better than to

191 192

call it anything like that and those titles state Policy Statement by the Hon. President. But, the English version betrays what the President has in mind or who he thinks he is for him to say Throne Speech.

In this Speech, the President deals with people who criticize the various acts and policies of the Government and says that when they come into office, they continue with that, that they do not act any differently. He criticizes them quite strongly in his Throne Speech, but I would like to remind him that he is also doing the same thing. In 1996, it is said that the United National Party, at its Convention, resolved to abolish the Executive Presidential System and that was a position they have held onto until now or said to be their official position. In the last Parliament, when we had the Constitutional Assembly, when this issue of Executive Presidency came up, the President, who was Prime Minister then, quite categorically said that that was the UNPs stand, that they were for the abolition of the Executive Presidency. But, now that he is the Executive President, we do not see or hear anything about abolishing the Executive Presidency.

In point of fact, when the Twenty First Amendment to the Constitution was passed, what was presented to the country was that the powers of the Executive President were being curtailed. The Eighteenth Amendment enhanced them; the Twentieth Amendment enhanced them. So, it was said, We are going back to the Nineteenth Amendment and the powers of the Executive Presidency are being curtailed. But, none of the Executive powers of the President have been curtailed. I said that at the Debate on the Twenty First Amendment also. So, that was a fraud on the people because what was presented to be the Amendment did not achieve that, and the President happily carries on as the Executive President with full Executive powers.

Although the UNPs stated policy is abolition of the Executive Presidency, he has made two Throne Speeches and has not said that he will abolish the Executive Presidency.

There is one matter that I want to deal with in the short time I have today and that is to do with the Tamil national question. In fact, the President has dealt with it quite categorically. He has said the right things except one important thing, which I will come to in a moment. He has dealt with it at pages 13 onwards in the English version of his Speech. There, he has said that the Hon. R. Sampanthan and he came to this House in 1977, that several attempts had been made to resolve the ethnic issue and had not been successful, but, he says, We wish to succeed this time. But, he does not say how he wishes to succeed, except to say that the several issues he has highlighted will be dealt with, particularly that of land, military-held land. We are not satisfied with what he has said here nor what has happened on the ground. What he has said here is that he will have discussions with the military and we saw that happening in the Jaffna Kachcheri recently when he came over. He was almost at the mercy of the military asking them, almost pleading them, Are you able to release some more land? He did not behave like the Executive President.

But, on the other issue of determining forest areas and areas for wildlife, archaeology et cetera - he dealt with the issue of forests there - he says, We will go back to the 1985 map and that is most welcome. The only question is, when will he go back to the 1985 map? It must be done immediately. If there is a policy decision taken by the Cabinet - we are told that that is the policy decision of the Cabinet - it must be immediately done. You have the 1985 map. So, you do not need to do anything in between and have to just go back to the 1985 map. It requires just one day. So, we are waiting to see when that is going to happen.

Then, his Speech has just one small paragraph with regard to the Office on Missing Persons. The issue of missing persons is a very serious issue. In our discussions with the President, we have told him that. Even the Report of the LLRC - Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission - your own, the Governments own Commission which was appointed by President Mahinda Rajapaksa soon after the end of the war and which gave its Report on 31st March, 2011, states that many persons surrendered to the security forces in the last few days of the war and that over 3,000 who surrendered as such have gone missing. How can people go missing like that, in their thousands? After establishing an Office on Missing Persons - we supported that legislation - not one single case has been investigated to find out what happened to the persons who surrendered. What happened? It is not enough to say that they are no more. How did it come to that stage? If you surrendered to the security forces, how can you go missing?

Thereafter, he dealt with the issue of devolution of power in his Speech. There are five issues that we identified when we had talks with the Government and I must say that in the Hon. President's Throne Speech, he has dealt with all those five matters. But, with regard to the police powers, he merely says - there is a short, one-sentence paragraph at page 16 of his Speech - that there is no change. We do not understand what that means. Is he saying that there is not going to be any change, that the status quo will remain or is he saying that there would not be any change to what is in the Constitution? If there would be no change to what is in the Constitution, then the police powers must be devolved. So, he left it ambiguous, I suspect, deliberately.

The matter I want to end with is that he says maximum devolution of power within a Unitary State. You cannot have maximum devolution of power within a Unitary State. The President knows that more than anyone else. The President campaigned on the platform of a federal State in 2005 when he contested for Executive Presidency. In the last Parliament, when he was Chairman of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly, he very specifically said that he stands for a federal State. Now, he has done a summersault and says within a Unitary State, with a capital U and a capital S, signifying that the scheme of Government will be unitary. And he ends by saying, I will not allow separation of the country. We are not asking for a separation of the country; we are for a united, undivided, even an indivisible country.

193 194

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am concluding, Sir.

Do not divide the country, but share power in a meaningful way. Maximum devolution of power cannot happen in a unitary model. Therefore, we reject this Throne Speech on that account alone.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 10 .
