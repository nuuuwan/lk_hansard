, that the time has come for the people to stand up, for all of us to stand up and take a principled stand on what we believe in. Cricket is close to our lives; it is close to our hearts. Let us take an admirable stand to separate the differences we have - they may be ideological, they may be political or they may be any of the others - but, on Sri Lankan cricket, to come together to protect and develop it. Let us ensure that the hidden talents of the youth in the rural and the urban areas of our country are given a chance to blossom. Let us make a united effort, a strong effort, a single-minded effort amongst all the 225 of us to give out the clear indication, the message to those who are corrupt, incompetent, decrepit and who are raping the Sri Lanka Cricket saying, "You have stayed so far, but from today onwards, you will not survive."

They must invoke that due process. Even in the case of money withdrawal, there is no provision to stop that. To stop that, you have to follow the legal process: you have to go to court and get an order from court, restraining the withdrwal of money. That is a basic concept of law, which everybody should know. Otherwise, they must get advice from a good lawyer. So, I am giving all these free advices to you, no problem.

Sir, I would like to propose this as a solution to go forward. I would suggest that we immediately bring in a new constitution, which has already been proposed by the Committee headed by Justice K. T Chitrasiri. That Committee was appointed by the Hon. Minister some time ago. We need a new Act of Parliament. We can do this within a month. We have the example of South Africa, which had a similar problem. They wrote to the ICC and they are working on it. We, too, need to move quickly. On the 24th of August, speaking in this House, I urged that this constitution be adopted immediately. As per the proposed constitution, the Board of Directors shall comprise of eight Appointed Directors and ten Elected Directors and there would be a Nominations Committee comprising of the Secretary to the Ministry of Sports, the President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the President of the Bar Association, the Chairperson of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, the Chairperson of the Sri Lanka Institute of Directors and the Chairperson of CIMA Sri Lanka. They would be the

1831 1832

[ ]

2023 09

nominees and that constitution specifically states that they must be people with a good moral standing. And, there is a term limitation: they can serve only for four years and for two terms. Then, among the Elected Directors, there would be only five cricket club nominees, not 140 and one each from the Players' Association, the School Cricket Association, the Womens Cricket Association, the Umpires' Association and the Coaches' Association. This election could be conducted in a transparent way.

Then, provisions for disqualification are also important. As per that constitution, you do not qualify to be appointed or nominated if you are or become a Member of Parliament, a member of a provincial council, a member of a local authority or a director, employee or an office-bearer of any other member organization. That is absolutely important. Transparency has to be improved. Reports and accounts must be made public. Therefore, we should go down this trail.

In conclusion, I would like to say that we do not want to politically interfere in sports. Parliamentarians' role is only monitoring, accountability and transparency. The Sri Lanka Cricket is not a private organization, as claimed by certain officials of it; it is a national organization. Therefore, I call upon the Minister to act swiftly and bring in this Act to Parliament. We, as the Opposition, will support the Government in cleaning up cricket and giving back cricket to the Sri Lankan public. I thank you, Sir, for the time given.

school cricket.

As regards the school cricket, there are sports teachers, but they are not properly trained. So, the Sri Lanka Cricket can look into this matter and train those teachers under a training programme so that they, in turn, could train their students.

Another popular sport in our area is Kabaddi. The Al-Madeena Sports Club in Nintavur has one of the best Kabaddi players in the country and he plays for the National Team. In fact, these children do not have proper facilities. They do not have a ground to play and they go and train on the beach. They do not have a sports complex or a mat. Yet, they are the champions of the Eastern Province and some of them are also playing for the National Team. So, this is the situation with regard to sports in our area. If I had more time, I could have pointed out many things about sports in our area.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is up. ( ) (The Hon. Faizal Cassim) Give me a few seconds more, Sir.

After restructuring the Sri Lanka Cricket, I hope - as I said, there are 53 hardball cricket clubs in the coastal belt - it would develop cricket and that we also would have more chances to enter into national cricket.

Thank you.

I am asking the Hon. Minister to recognize the plantation sector youths also who are doing very well in cricket. But, they have recognized only one, Muttiah Muralitharan, when they needed to win the World Cup. But, there are also a lot of Muttiah Muralitharans in the upcountry. But, they are not being recognized. Cricket clubs in the plantation areas are not registered or recognized by the Sri Lanka Cricket. Why? Here, we are talking about millions and millions of money. They have robbed millions and millions of money, but the innocent people who had been affected by earthslips in the Haputale area in my District are still in camps. See how this money that belongs to Sri Lanka, is being misused? The people in the plantation sector have sacrificed their lives for this country for the last 200 years, for five

generations! But, they are not being recognized. I am very sorry to say that. Therefore, I am requesting the Hon. Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs to inform the Sri Lanka Cricket or to the new board, if one would be appointed, to recognize the plantation youths.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is up. ( ) (The Hon. Vadivel Suresh) Please give me one more minute, Hon. Presiding Member.

, . Sir, in Madulsima in the Badulla District, there is an estate called Roeberry Estate. It is located 100 kilometres away from Badulla and about 225 kilometres away from Colombo. There are no proper roads leading to that estate. School children and pregnant mothers walk about 20 kilometres to take their children to school. Early in the morning, 3, 4 . money . . - humanely - .

Therefore, I am requesting you to consider all these things. Then only we can see whether the Sri Lanka Cricket is working properly. They cannot ignore the plantation sector.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. B.Y.G. Rathnasekara. You have eight minutes.

Hon. Presiding Member, the entire nation knows that the Sri Lanka Cricket is totally corrupt. But, some sections are trying to protect and safeguard the Sri Lanka Cricket. We cannot allow that. In the recent past, the Sri Lanka Cricket has brought disrepute to sports in our country. I would say that the power-hungry and the fame-hungry people within the corridors have brought cricket to the level where it is now through corruption, mismanagement, misuse of administrative funds and wastage of money on legal battles to safeguard their positions and even against the Hon. Minister. Almost Rs. 59 million has been spent on legal matters, out of which Rs. 30 million was against the Minister!

Sir, the Sri Lanka Cricket became a laughing matter when people who know nothing about cricket or sports were appointed or elected to that. As you know, a massive amount - US Dollars 119,000, which is close to 40 million Sri Lankan Rupees - has been spent as payments for the coaching staff monthly. US Dollars 72,000, which is about Rs. 24 million, has been paid to the Head Coach, the Consultant Coach, the Assistant Coach and the Fielding Coach. Also, Sir, there are two physiotherapists and they are paid US Dollars 17,000, which is about Rs. 6 million. Then, the task managers are paid US Dollars 30,000, which is about Rs. 10 million. Totally, about Sri Lankan Rs. 40 million is paid per month. Sir, in these circumstances, I just want to ask as to what the progress they have made and what the results we have got.

1875 1876

2023 09

The Sri Lankan Cricket Team had to play the Qualifiers in order to enter into the World Cup. At present, we are in danger of losing our place in the ICC Champions Trophy as well. I just want to say that the Sri Lanka Cricket and its Selection Committee should take the full responsibility for the failures of the Sri Lankan Cricket Team at the recently concluded Asia Cup, the ongoing Cricket World Cup as well as for the low rankings in all three formats of cricket. We are at the lowest level in T20, Test Cricket and ODIs as well. As you know, during the T20 World Cup, 2022, US Dollars 67 million was spent on travelling purposes of the Sri Lanka Cricket officials. So, there are lots of corruption within the Sri Lanka Cricket. Therefore, I would say that there should be a concrete constitution, not just for cricket, but for all sports because that is the only way we can wipe out corruption in sports.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is up now. . ( . ) (The Hon. M. Udayakumar) Sir, I am just finishing up.

Finally, I would say, a few years back, Sri Lanka was on top in cricket: we won the Cricket World Cup; we won the T20 World Cup; we were the winners of the ICC Champions Trophy. Also, we had so many record-holders such as Muttiah Muralitharan, Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene, Lasith Malinga and Sanath Jayasuriya. Now, we do not have any permanent players, youngsters or even experienced players at that. There is a very big vacuum within the cricket team. Money is just being wasted unwantedly by the Sri Lanka Cricket without it being used for the benefit of cricket or cricketers in our country.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The Hon. Weerasumana Weerasinghe. You have eight minutes.
