The trust reposed in the respondents was not a higher principle or epithet unique to their offices. Public trust is an inherent responsibility bestowed on all officers who exercise powers which emanate from the sovereignty of the People.'

We all have powers which emanate from the sovereignty of the people. The judgment further held, I quote:

Therefore, as public officers, the respondents were obliged, at all times, to act in a manner which honoured the trust reposed in them. We are of the view that by the actions, omissions, decisions and conduct hereinbefore identified to have demonstrably contributed to the economic crisis and we are of the view that the 2nd, 2A, 28th, 29th, 30th, 31st, 32nd, 32A and 38th respondents had violated the Public Trust reposed in them and we hold that they were in breach of the fundamental right to equal protection of the law ordained by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

These petitioners both in applications SC FR 195/2022 and SC FR 212/2022 have invoked the fundamental rights jurisdiction of this Court in the interest of the public. We note that none of the petitioners are claiming any loss had impacted on the petitioners on an individual basis but their assertion is as a result of the conduct of the respondents the entire citizenry had to undergo hardships which could have been avoided. In the circumstances aforesaid, we are of the view that it would not be appropriate to order the respondents to pay compensation to the petitioners and as such we are not inclined to order compensation. We order however that each petitioner in both applications would be entitled to costs in sum of rupees 150,000.00 each."

"It may be noted that a violation of a Fundamental Right is not tantamount to a conviction before a court of law. The Supreme Court has determined that the standard of proof in Fundamental Rights Applications is usually expressed as involving the preponderance of probability. The standard of proof for a conviction before a court of law is beyond reasonable doubt. The Supreme Court has also determined that the award of compensation in a Fundamental Rights Application amount to an acknowledgement of regret and a solatium for the hurt caused by the violation of a fundamental right and not as a punishment for duty, disregarded or authority abused. (Saman vs Leeladasa 1989 1 SLR 1).

Accordingly, any steps that may be taken with regard to criminal or civil liability in pursuance to the aforesaid judgment should be in accordance with the applicable law and procedure established thereunder.

For ease of reference the judgment of the Supreme Court in SC/FR/195/2022 and SC/FR/212/2022 can be found on the Supreme Court website

(Dr.) Susil Premajayantha, Attorney-at-Law) As an eminent lawyer, could you explain the checks and balances of the Judiciary and that of the Executive? Now, you answer.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The three institutions have checks and balances on each other. The point that the Hon. President made was that the Constitutional Council was part of the Executive; he said that. That is wrong. It may appear under that Chapter but the Constitutional Council can never be part of the Executive.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Susil Premajayantha, Attorney-at-Law) That is your interpretation. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, not my interpretation - () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Susil Premajayantha, Attorney-at-Law) But, it comes under that Chapter. That is what I am pointing out.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Hon. Speaker is the Chair of the Constitutional Council; it can never be a part of the Executive.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Susil Premajayantha, Attorney-at-Law) No, no. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) If the Hon. Speaker is the Chair of the Constitutional Council, it is part of the legislative structure and not part of the Executive. So, being a part of the legislative structure, that is, checks and balances on the Executive.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Susil Premajayantha, Attorney-at-Law) Checks and balances of the Executive is done by Parliament, not by the particular Council.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) But, the Speaker is the Chair. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Susil Premajayantha, Attorney-at-Law) No, that is not done by that particular Council. That is your interpretation and this is my view.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is wrong. The Speaker being the Chair, how can the Constitutional Council be part of the Executive?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Susil Premajayantha, Attorney-at-Law) No, you are talking something else. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. (Dr.) Premajayantha, since this is the Committee Stage, I am not trying to interrupt you. What I said was this. The Constitutional Council was set up not to be a rubber-stamp body. - [Interruption] Please, let me finish. The Constitutional Council was set up to do checks and balances on the actions of the Executive. Previously, who made the appointments to the Supreme Court? Who did that? Please tell me.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Susil Premajayantha, Attorney-at-Law) Earlier?

81 82

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Yes. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Susil Premajayantha, Attorney-at-Law) Prior to this Constitutional Amendment? ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Yes. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Susil Premajayantha, Attorney-at-Law) The President.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Yes, the President. So, now, on the power of the President to appoint members to the Judiciary, be it to the Court of Appeal or to the Supreme Court, there is a restriction, a constraint. That has to go through the Constitutional Council and should receive its consent or assent. Previously, the President had total or full power to appoint the judges and now, that power is checked and balanced by the Constitutional Council. He does not have the unimpeded power and authority to make a single appointment. That is what I was saying and I stand by that.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Susil Premajayantha, Attorney-at-Law) But, my position is different. Providing checks and balances on the Executive is the duty of Parliament. Still, who is the appointing authority of the judges? Who is the appointing authority of the members of the independent Commissions? It is still the President. Constitutional Council . ; .

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. You have 15 minutes.

[12.49 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, for the time allotted to speak a few words on these Heads of expenditure. We have had an interesting Debate so far with the Hon. President also participating in it.

One of the institutions under consideration is the Constitutional Council. Many things have been said today, back and forth, about the Constitutional Council, but I want to raise a more fundamental issue. There is a vacancy in the Constitutional Council; all ten members have not been appointed. That is a very serious issue. It is a serious issue for us because we were entitled to nominate a member and at such a meeting held, I proposed the name of a senior Parliamentarian, the Hon. Dharmalingam Sithadthan, to be that member in the Constitutional Council. But, to date, he has not been appointed to the Constitutional Council. We have raised this many a time. The Leader of the Opposition has raised it in Parliament, at the Party Leaders Meeting and the Hon. Speaker has also clearly said that it is our right. In fact, the others who were claiming to have a right to nominate a member are all Members of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna. The General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna has written to the Speaker and said that they are Members of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna. In fact, if they are not Members of the SLPP, they cannot be Members of Parliament. So, they cannot claim to be the ones who have the right to nominate this member to the Constitutional Council. But, this is not just a technicality. By this, the third largest party in Parliament and the second largest party in the Opposition has been deprived of their right to participate in the deliberations of the Constitutional Council.

And what has that resulted in? The President has been saying from the time he took over as Prime Minister and then, as President that he will resolve the Tamil national question. He had three All-party Conferences, one last year and two this year, for that very purpose. But, he or even this House is unable to resolve this one issue. This is a no-brainer. You keep us out of the Constitutional Council and then you talk about resolving the Tamil national question in a just manner. How can you do that? You cannot even fill that vacancy. This matter had come into sharp focus a few days ago. There

87 88

[ () ]

2023 22

is a deadlock situation in the Constitutional Council - everybody knows about that - when one seat is still vacant. If that had been filled, there would not have been a deadlock. So, the country must know that while you all wax eloquent saying all are equal, everyone in the country will have representation, in a body like the Constitutional Council, which is a very important body, you still deprive us of a place. And, how can you face anyone and claim this is governance in the right way? So, today, I am raising this as a serious issue, not just as filling of a vacancy in the Constitutional Council, but as a serious national issue. Our complaint for several decades has been that we have been left out of the national life of this country.

Being kept out of the Constitutional Council is another reflection, another example of that, which is continuing to date. In 1972, when the first Republican Constitution was enacted, you called it an autochthonous Constitution, but we were left out in the cold. Every single fundamental Resolution that was passed, was passed with a majority vote and incidentally, it is Hon. Dharmalingam Sithadthans father, Mr. V. Dharmalingam, the then MP of the Federal Party, the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi, who moved amendments to those fundamental Resolutions. Every one of those Resolutions was defeated by 84:16, 82:13, by majoritarian votes, and that is how we went out, how it became necessary for our party to join hands with the All Ceylon Tamil Congress and the CWC and start the Tamil United Front in 1976. That is what led to the Vaddukoddai Resolution. All that we said was, If you cannot accommodate us, cannot give us our due place, then let us go. Why are you holding onto us? We will go our own way. That is what led to a three-decade-old war. But, you are still doing that; even today, you are doing that. For more than a year, you have kept us out of the Constitutional Council. It is our right. I do not think I will want to say this in this House anymore. We are not beggars in this county to come begging you to give us this and that. We are a people; we are a people with a heritage. We have lived in this country as long as anybody else has lived in this country. So, if you think that because of your superior numbers you can trample upon our rights, you are mistaken, you are totally mistaken. We will not cow down to such efforts. Majoritarian rule, we will not accept; till the last person lives in this country, we will not accept that.

This week is an important week. This is a week in which we honour the dead, who fought for us. I am not hesitant to say it in that way. Why did they fight for us? Because we were thrown out of the national life. There was no other way for us. Things went wrong and we are not in that mode anymore. We have expressly said, we are willing to live within one, united, undivided and indivisible country. We are yet willing to. But then, how is that being reciprocated? It is up to you; you have to decide. You cannot just sing us along all the time. And it is important while the relatives and others in the North and the East remember their dead that I say this in this House: do not take us for granted. The superior number does not make you right. Superior numbers often make you wrong, because you think you can bulldoze your way with your numbers. That is what you do in this House also.

I must put something else also right. Today also, the Hon. President said that the Leader of the Opposition was invited to form a Government and he did not do that and that is a violation of public trust. That is wrong; he is wrong. The Hon. President was wrong on many fronts today. When he described the Constitutional Council as part of the Executive, he was wrong. You do not have a part of the Executive which the Hon. Speaker presides. That is part of the legislative structure.

He was wrong because the entire Opposition had agreed on something at that point in time. There was a document, a national plan, which had been formulated by the Bar Association of Sri Lanka and which gave certain timelines to the then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa so that he would go out gracefully, the Executive Presidency would be abolished and if he agreed to that, then the Leader of the Opposition would take over as Prime Minister. That was the agreement. We, as a party, were agreed to that; the Jathika Jana Balawegaya was agreed to that; the SJB was agreed to that and the Hon. President, then as a single Member in Parliament, was also agreed to that, but he violated that. That is why, when he took over as Prime Minister, I was the first person in this House to tell him that that was shameful conduct. He was very upset over that, but it was, in fact, shameful conduct by him. It is he who breached the agreement that the whole Opposition had taken together and as a single Member, ran and took that office; for a mess of pottage, he violated that agreement. I am not defending the Leader of the Opposition, but I think it is time, even after a lapse of one full year, that I put the record right. So, there was that agreement and the Hon. President violated it because he saw a crack in the door - he was opportunistic - he put his foot in, got in there and then became the Executive President of this country. The UNP under him, in 1996, in Hambantota had passed a resolution to abolish the Executive Presidency, but now, there is no talk about that.

Violation of public trust is a very serious matter. The reply the Hon. President gave today amounts to nothing. If you have violated public trust and that is the pronouncement of the highest court in the country, those persons who had been named have no moral right to sit in this House anymore. In another place, in a mature democracy, they would have resigned. In another place where they value democracy, where they value the rule of law, those persons who were found to have violated public trust would have resigned the next day, but not the Rajapaksas. They do not care two hoots whether it is public trust or whatever they had violated. It is only their family and the loot they had taken from this country that they are concerned about. They can remain in that way, but they will have to face the serious ire of the citizens of this country, if they do not, even at this point in time, respect the rule of law, accept responsibility and bow out of this House. They have no right to continue as Representatives of the people in this House. There is only one persons here, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, and he must resign. If he has any semblance of a sense of dignity and if he respects the rule of law and democracy, he must probably resign and accept responsibility.

The Hon. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, I remember, at the Budget Debate in 2015, spoke volumes of the fact that the then President Maithreepala Sirisena's expenditure, when compared to his predecessor's, was almost half. But, that is not what we see today. The Hon. President's expenditure is far more than what was there in last year's Budget. So, we see a huge shift in his perspective even with regard to allocations for expenditure.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) () . 1 .

Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Speaker will now take the Chair.

Whereupon THE HON. PREMNATH C. DOLAWATTE left the Chair, and THE DEPUTY SPEAKER [THE HON. AJITH RAJAPAKSE] took the Chair.

[1.05 p.m.] () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) Hon. Chairman, today, we are discussing the Votes of the President, the independent Commissions as well as the Votes of many other institutions.

There were so many other matters raised during this Discussion, especially the matters raised by the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran, Presidents Counsel. He was very critical about the speech made by the Hon. President in Parliament today. During 2015 to 2019, when the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe was Prime Minister, everything he did was admired and praised by the Hon. Sumanthiran. But, when he could not get the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe on the track he expected him to be, he has become serious and a critic of the President's actions. Anyway, Hon. Member, that is your right in this democratic country.

Hon. Sumanthiran, you were making some allegations or complaints about appointments to the Constitutional Council. As you are aware, when we enacted the Ninteenth Amendment to the Constitution on 28th April, 2015, we ensured that the Constitutional Council shall be represented by all communities, that all the pluralistic features of the society would be taken into consideration and that there would be no lacuna; we ensured that the

rights of every community are guaranteed through all these processes. Thereafter, unfortunately, as you said, there was an intervention with the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution. But, I think within a period of one year, we were able to reverse it; you all supported us and we introduce the Twenty First Amendment to the Constitution. That was passed with 179 votes and one against. In that also, we ensured that when members are appointed to the Constitutional Council, all the political parties in Parliament are well-represented.

Then, I would like to draw your attention to Article 41A. (1)(f) of the Constitution. It states, I quote:

one Member of Parliament nominated by agreement of the Members of Parliament other than those representing the Government and those belonging to the political party or independent group to which the Leader of the Opposition belongs, and appointed by the President.

Then, the general criterion is given in Article 41A. (4) thereof, which states, I quote:

in nominating the five persons referred to in sub-paragraph (e) of paragraph (1), the Prime Minister, the Speaker and the Leader of the Opposition or the Members of Parliament, as the case may be, shall ensure that the Council reflects the pluralistic character of Sri Lankan society, including professional and social diversity.

Therefore, the constitutional provision that all the persons are treated equally and all the communities are well-represented is ensured without any failure not only in Parliament, but in the Constitutional Council, too. Then, there are similar provisions when it comes to independent Commissions also; in appointment of members for every Commission, similar provisions are provided in the Constitution.

Now, the appointment under the Article 41A. (1)(f) of the Constitution is the issue.

With regard to that, I must draw your attention, Hon. Chairman - I think you must bring this to the notice of the Hon. Speaker as well - to Article 41A.(3), which states, I quote:

It shall be the duty of the Speaker to ensure that nominations for appointments under sub-paragraph (e) or sub-paragraph (f) of paragraph (1) are made, whenever an occasion for such nomination arises.

So, it categorically states, It shall be the duty of the Speaker And, we have no other better provision to make in the Constitution. The Hon. Speaker, being the main person in this House and who is responsible for the smooth functioning of it, has been made the Chairman of the Constitutional Council as well; he acts in dual capacity. At the same time, we have entrusted that power and authority on the Hon. Speaker to ensure that nominations are made. Now, it has been complained that there has been a serious lapse in making one of the appointments. That is wrong, we concede. We also concede that the Hon. Speaker must act now itself and that he must rectify this situation. It is bad for Parliament also. It is really not a duty or an obligation on the part of

2023 22

the Government. If there is a duty on the part of the Government, certainly, we will intervene and will take responsibility. But here, it is a responsibility on the part of the Hon. Speaker and he must take a decision because a period of one year without making the appointment is a long period. We never expected this kind of situation when we introduced those provisions to the Constitution and the provisions have to be complied with. Therefore, we will make representations today to the Hon. Speaker. There may be some dispute or conflict over the appointment among two groups, but either way, he has to take a decision. We cannot tell him, You decide it this way or the other way, but he must take a decision. I also agree and concede that the TNA, as a numerically smaller party, must have their representation in the Constitutional Council.

Then, Sir, let me move on to the Committee Stage Discussion of the Budget.

[3.37 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, unlike the previous speaker [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

who spent his entire political life selling the interests of the Tamil people in return for the crumbs that fell off the majoritarian head table, I take this opportunity to bow my head to the great heroes who sacrificed their lives so that the Tamil people could live with their rights and achieve their aspirations, at least, for future generations.

Having said that, Sir, I also wish to, before I move onto the substantive part of my speech, refer to some comments made by the President this morning with regard to public trust. He went on to try and ridicule the Hon. Leader of the Opposition by stating that the Leader of the Opposition, by not coming forward to take up the prime ministership and the position of Head of Government when President Gotabaya Rajapaksa invited him to, was in breach of public trust. I do not know which side of the bed the President woke up from today, but certainly, his common sense seems to have ditched him today because he has forgotten, Sir, that he became President because public trust had been lost in the previous Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and thereafter, in the previous President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. It is because public trust had been lost and not because of any other part of the Constitution coming into play that they had to resign and run. So, public trust actually worked contrary to, technically, the law even and that same lack of public trust was prevalent in Parliament, Sir, and the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed President by that Parliament which lacked public trust. So, though he tried to ridicule the Leader of the Opposition saying that his not accepting leadership at that time was a breach of public trust, it was the complete opposite, Sir. Credit must be given to the Leader of the Opposition for refusing to act against public trust in a situation where the public had lost confidence in Parliament, where the public was demanding that this Parliament they had elected two years ago was redundant, not representative and was insisting that public trust be reposed once again in Parliament in the form of holding a General Election. So, obviously, President Wickremesinghe has got a bad start today.

His Vote is also being discussed at this Committee Stage Discussion. I think these are all signs of times to come, Sir. It is a slippery slope that he has stepped on to and he is slipping down very fast. It is unfortunate because no one doubts the experience President Wickremesinge has. He could have, in fact, served this

country in a legitimate way by allowing an election, calling for an election, having the people elect a Parliament which they could then say is representative and through that process, maybe, if he had an opportunity to play a leading role, then, certainly, he would be credible. Unfortunately, he chose a different path.

Today, Sir, out of the Heads that are being discussed during the Committee Stage, I wish to specifically talk about the Human Rights Commission. I say this because at the last Budget, too, I intervened and made the point that the Human Rights Commissions credibility, since the last General Election, has been at its lowest. Last year, we particularly took offence and raised objection to the previous Chairman of the Commission visiting the North, particularly Jaffna, meeting with members of the families of the disappeared and various other sections of the civil society there and then, coming out with a statement which was supposed to have been representative of the discussions the Commission had had in the North and recommended a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. That was the complete opposite. The statement also spoke of people being willing to not pursue criminal justice as part of accountability and transitional justice. Those observations were a complete misrepresentation to what the people, in fact, had told the Commission when the Commission came and visited the North. This year, too, Sir, the Commission, unfortunately, is doing no better. You know that for us, particularly the Tamil people in the North and the East who constantly have to protest against the Government, the military and the oppression that we face on a daily basis, the military and the police form a part of that oppressive structure. So, more often than not, Sir, it is those who we expect justice from and those who we expect to hold up the rule of law that are in breach of it when it comes to the Tamil people. Under those circumstances, we are desperate because we do not know who to go to and invariably, we have to choose the Human Rights Commission because we are hoping out of hope that that Commission would act independently. So, it is because of that expectation that, under structures which exist within the country, at least the Human Rights Commission might have some sort of semblance of impartiality, credibility and independence that we also expressed our disappointment with regard to their visit last year and coming out with that statement.

This year, Sir, the Hon. Selvarajah Kajendren of our party, who is seated next to me, was taking part in a protest in Thaiyiddy against an illegal viharaya that has been built on a private land. When he was protesting, the police came and surrounded him. They did not arrest him, but he was under siege like what is happening in Gaza. He is a diabetic. So, when food was brought to him so that he could maintain his sugar levels, the police arrested the person who brought food, Theepan Thileeshan, who is our organizer for the Jaffna District.

Then, his lawyer, Mr. Kanagaratnam Sugash, came to the site, introduced himself as the lawyer and wanted to speak to the Hon. Selvarajah Kajendren to find out what the situation was. He, too, was arrested despite the fact that he identified himself as a lawyer. Several others,

137 138

some members of the public, who tried to intervene were arrested as well. In total, over eight persons were arrested. We, subsequently, went and made complaints to the Human Rights Commission with regard to that incident. Whilst this incident was going on and illegal arrests were taking place, we had made complaints to the Human Rights Commission and the person in charge of the Commission in Jaffna visited the vicinity. When he was visiting the place and taking notes, he was threatened and was filmed. When he objected thereafter, he was almost manhandled. Then, he left the vicinity. Subsequently, the police had complained to the Human Rights Commission and the file with regard to the incident that was being investigated by the Commission has now been transferred to Colombo and nothing has happened. Nothing has happened!

There are several other incidents such as this. With regard to my own illegal arrest in Maruthankerny, I made a complaint to the Human Rights Commission. Again, nothing has happened. So, there are several other incidents such as this. These are high-profile incidents, Sir, which were widely and nationally covered on TV and in the newspapers. If Members of Parliament, political party members and publicly very well-known civil society activists can be treated in this way simply because the police makes a completely false complaint about an individual working in the Commission, if files are being taken away, they are not being investigated and nothing comes of it, then one has to ask, What is the purpose of this Commission? Where is the independence of the Commission? So, as far as we are concerned, Sir, Sri Lanka is already being laughed upon. You have report after report coming up in the UN Human Rights Council which basically state that Sri Lankas judicial structure is so badly corrupted because of the ethnic conflict, that it is not able to carry out an independent investigation on any matter that has to do with the ethnic conflict.

So, under those circumstances, at the very least, if the Human Rights Commission cannot be allowed or is not allowed to act in an independent way, then it becomes imperative that every right-thinking Member who called for an international investigation, who called for a ceasefire when it came to Gaza and who said that there was genocide taking place in Gaza must look at what happened and what is happening in Sri Lanka even now and understand that the aggrieved party, the Tamil people, cannot expect justice from within. And, if that is the case, then at least till such time public trust is reposed in the institutions of this country and if justice is to prevail, then we are forced to look outside and that is, in fact, what we are doing, Sir. I expect that all right-thinking Members of this House would understand the gravity of the situation we are faced with and if we are to, at some point, come out of this conflict and seriously try and approach some form of reconciliation and if Members belonging to the Sinhala community, both opposite and on this side, do not realize the path they are choosing and the sort of political culture they are, at the moment, adhering to, it will never lead to solutions.

Thank you, Sir.
