. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker)

[12.20 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Deputy Speaker, from among the four late Hon. Members of this august Assembly, whose Votes of Condolence we have taken up today, I would start with the late Hon. (Mrs.) Larine Perera who entered Parliament in the year 2001, I believe. As all of us have seen, usually, many ladies who have entered Parliament did so after the demise of their near and dear, either a husband, a brother or someone in the family. But, as for the Hon. (Mrs.) Larine Perera, by the time she entered Parliament, she was already quite experienced, in that, she was a chairman of a local authority, thereafter entered the North-Western Provincial Council and was also someone who

had the experience as a minister in that Provincial Council, having been the minister in charge of fisheries, womens affairs and social welfare. It is seen from her career that she had also contributed immensely towards many social activities in the entire Catholic belt, as we call it, from Negombo up to Puttalam. Though she represented the Wennappuwa area, she is fondly remembered for the many development activities towards which she had made immense contribution.

She had also been someone who had encouraged sports activities, in that, she had served as the President of the Wennappuwa Football League as well as the Vice President of the National Football Association. Therefore, she had been a multifaceted personality who had contributed immensely to the people of the area. And, we have always known her as a mother figure in this House, had been a very soft-spoken person, but she would always be there to assist anyone who required her assistance.

Moreover, if we are to talk about her famous husband, the late Hon. Festus Perera, who was a towering figure, not simply by his own physical stature but also because of his immense involvement with the United National Party from 1965 onwards as a Parliamentarian, he adorned many important ministerial portfolios from fisheries to public administration, home affairs and power and energy as well. I remember a time when both the late Hon. M.H.M. Ashraff, my late leader, and I went to see him about certain power-sharing issues between the Central Government and the provincial councils. He said, Ashraff, I have my wife in the Provincial Council and I am in the Central Government. I know these difficulties. There are times when we both argue at home about what powers we should share among ourselves. So, this is a matter that I know of like the back of my hand. I know what issues are to tackle". Those are nostalgic memories we get when we think of personalities of the calibre of the Hon. (Mrs.) Larine Perera on this day when we remember her. And, no less a person than the Hon. Niroshan Perera, being her son and such an able, clever and young political leader who have been serving the country, had been chosen by the current President when he was Prime Minister in the last regime to have him under his wings as the State Minister in charge of a subject he was handling, as the State Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, So, she was the mother of such an able politician and her family has made a long-cherished contribution to the Catholic belt, as I said before. Sir, let me pay my respects to her.

Along with that, may I say a few words about the late Hon. Reginold Cooray, who was also a very colourful and entertaining politician. As the Hon. (Mrs.) Geetha Kumarasinghe mentioned a while ago, he was a very good person who could render songs to the enjoyment of all of us when we gathered at any public event. He was also a person who had traversed the spectrum of different political parties in the country. He started his political career as a JVP activist, went on to become a member of the Western Provincial Council as a member of the Sri Lanka Mahajana Party, of which the late Vijaya Kumaratunga was the leader, contesting under the United

1251 1252

[ ]

2023 23

Socialist Alliance and subsequently, joined the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. He had also been a Parliamentarian several times from 1994 onwards, I believe. Since then - that is the year I also entered Parliament - we had been very close friends. We had been on many foreign trips with Parliamentary delegations. I will always remember him as an entertaining politician who had such rare talent.

He was also a very good orator, both in English and Sinhala. He could also fluently speak Tamil and that was one of his special qualifications as a Sinhala politician. Therefore, he was rewarded by former President Maithreepala Sirisena to be the Governor of the Northern Province. He served with distinction as Governor as well with his immense knowledge gained as the Chief Minister of the Western Province. Even many Muslims in the Western Province would remember him as somebody who had immensely helped the Muslim schools not only in the Kalutara District but also both in the Colombo and Gampaha Districts in the Western Province since he was the Minister of Education along with his Chief Ministry. Sir, I would add my tributes to the late Hon. Reginold Cooray, too.

Then, I would move on to the late Hon. Buddhika Kurukularatne, who was also another colourful politician who had been known as a media personality as well as a writer of several books. He was somebody who had been, even long after his Parliamentary career had ceased, a regular visitor to the Parliament Library. I have had occasion to meet with him several times and he was person who would share interesting anecdotes of both his legal career as well as the Parliamentary career with the young and upcoming Parliamentarians like us, whenever we were able to meet at the Parliament Library. There have been many interesting comments made about the late Hon. Buddhika Kurukularatne and he would be remembered as an able and a very simple politician who had served his people well during his career as a Parliamentarian in this country.

Having said that, Sir, may I say a few words in Tamil regarding the late Hon. Muthu Sivalingam.

Sir, I would just like to say a few words in English, offering my condolences to the family of the late Hon. Reginold Cooray, who was a former Chief Minister of the Western Province and a former Governor of the Central

1265 1266

Province, even though for a short while. My father shared a very close relationship with him. I have not had the pleasure and honour of working with him, but I offer my condolences to his family.

Likewise, I would also like to offer my condolences to the Hon. Member Niroshan Perara on the loss of his mother, the late Hon. (Mrs.) Larine Perera. Her husband, the late Hon. Festus Perera, had worked with my great grandfather very closely. We understand at the end of the day, that the loss of a person is something that cannot be simplified, especially the loss of a mother. Sir, I would like to offer my condolences to her family, too.

Similarly, I would like to offer my condolences on the death of the Hon. Buddhika Kurukularatne to his family. At the same time, I would like to offer my condolences to the family of the late Hon. Muthu Sivalingam as well, who was our Party's President.

. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . [3.07 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Presiding Member, First, I want to express my thoughts on the life of the late Hon. (Mrs.) Larine Perera, who had been known as someone associated with the Puttalam District, particularly with Wennappuwa and the wife of a longstanding Minister who also held many different portfolios, the late Hon. Festus Perera.

My first connection to this family actually started in Washington, DC when I was a young banker working in a

consultancy company there. I met Nishani Perera, who is an economist and was also working as a consultant in that company, and that association goes back a long time and I still remember that. Subsequently, I heard that she is the daughter of the Hon. Festus Perera and the Hon. (Mrs.) Larine Perera. Then, of course as time went by, I became a politician and met Niroshan Perera, an Electronic Engineer, who returned to the country to serve her. Subsequently, he, too, entered the Sri Lanka Parliament and we, Niroshan and myself, became friends. We have also common interests and have been going after corruption while we had been in the Opposition earlier, then, when we were in Government and we still continue to work on that.

The Hon. (Mrs.) Larine Perera first entered a local government authority. You often find family members of politicians - their wives, husbands, uncles or aunts - entering into politics subsequent to their death. But, that was not the case with the Hon. (Mrs.) Larine Perera. First, she actually entered into local government politics and after that, the North-western Provincial Council, which she served for a considerable period of time, for more than a decade, not just as a provincial councilor, but also as a Minister in the Provincial Council holding two important portfolios: one was, womens affairs and the other was, fisheries because, after all, she represented an area in which the fisheries industry was dominant.

Sir, it is very interesting what one Member of Parliament mentioned today, what the Hon. Festus Perera said when that Hon. Member visited him. At that time, the Hon. (Mrs.) Larine Perera was in the Provincial Council and the Hon. Festus Perera was in the Central Government and he had said that, at home, they often argued about devolution of power, who should be doing what. I think it is very interesting because it is a political argument they had had and to have an argument like that at home would have been very interesting. Anyway, my point is that she had her own ideas, entered the political arena with her own strength and subsequently, became a Member of Parliament for nearly a decade, from 2001 to 2010, representing the Puttalam District.

The late Hon. (Mrs.) Larine Perera particularly focused on womens empowerment. I think that was a great thing to focus on at the time she entered into politics and today, we could be proud that largely women in Sri Lanka lead in education, whether it be the O/Ls, the A/Ls, university education or professional education. Also, she was able to particularly focus on income generation for women in her district and things like that. Then, she did a lot of social work and particularly helped the fishing community to basically improve their income.

Sir, finally, I would like to say this. We heard many things being said about her political career. I would like to say that a persons character is not evidenced only in what he or she has achieved in his or her career or in politics. The Hon. (Mrs.) Larine Perera has left behind two children. Proverbs 22:6 in the Scriptures state, Train up a child in the way he should go: And when he is old, he will not depart from it. Today, there is a lot of emphasis on qualifications. Nishani and Niroshan are

1295 1296

[ ]

2023 23

qualified, there is no question about that. But, really, training up should be focused on having integrity, learning what is right and wrong and empathy for others. I think Nishani and Niroshan stand out as a great example of the Hon. (Mrs.) Larine Perera's real achievements in bringing them up and what she has left behind for her family. Therefore, she could be proud of what she had actually accomplished and I would say that to her grandchild, she would certainly be a huge challenge.

May her soul rest in peace!

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .
