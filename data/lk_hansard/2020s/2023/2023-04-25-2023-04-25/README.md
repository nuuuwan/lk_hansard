Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms - both are in this House - you all show yourselves as champions of reconciliation to the world.

Sir, in this House, since 10 o' clock this morning, various Members have been raising various issues and asking questions.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs and Hon. Minister of Justice - both are here - you are telling the world that you all are the champions of reconciliation. Very recently, you all concluded a very joyful tour to South Africa to

1687 1688

[ ]

1013 1

study about the TRC. - [Interruption] Hon. Ali Sabry, you can point your hand towards me and say whatever you want.

Sir, in this Chamber, since 10.00 a.m., various Members of this House were allowed to raise their issues and concerns when their names were not even in the list of Question for Oral Answers. Representing the North and the East - I got the highest number of preferential votes from my party in the Batticaloa District - I have to point out a very sensitive issue that our people face day-to-day, which is not even connected to our political solution. The Provincial Councils are not functioning and the Governor for the Eastern Province is taking decisions in terms of transport, which are affecting our people. So, all I wanted to do was to ask a question from the Hon. Minister in charge of transport. He has now walked out. So, there is no point in asking that question here. As soon as I was on my feet to ask that question, the Deputy Speaker told me that that is an insensitive issue and also that only sensitive issues were discussed earlier. For him, it may not be a sensitive issue because it is concerning the people of the Batticaloa District. There are 50,000 passengers who use those three ferries and there is an issue with regard to those, which is the only thing I wanted to clarify to the Minister concerned and ask whether he could instruct the Provincial Council to let those ferries function as normal. As soon as I got up or was on my feet to say that, the Hon. Deputy Speaker cut the mike off and I was told to sit down because that was not a sensitive issue, maybe, for him. If it was something that happened in Hambantota, maybe, it would be sensitive for him.

My biggest concern is, a Cabinet Minister, one of your Colleagues, called me a "terrorist". He called me a "kotiya"; then he called me a "Jathiwadiya". In this Parliament, am I unable able to raise my peoples concerns when the relevant Minister is here? As soon as I mentioned about his tour to South Africa, the Hon. Ali Sabry, Minister of Foreign Affairs made a gesture with his hand towards me as his reaction. I can show that gesture you made back to you. But at the time you made it, the cameras were not on you and people would not see it. That is how he reacted; as soon as I mentioned about South Africa, he said, "Tch!" That may be your position, Hon. Minister, but that is not our position. If you think my raising my peoples issues in this House is equivalent to being a terrorist, I will gladly be a "kotiya". " " . , '' '' . , '' , ! . []

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) ... .

... ( ... - ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC - Minister of Foreign Affairs) Sir, I just want a minute.

We do not call ourselves champions. We are here for equality; we stand by that. I do not raise issues relating only to Muslims in Parliament; I raise issues relating to Sri Lankans. That is how I act. - [Interruption] I do not care for you. I raise issues of Sri Lankans. That is my priority. My priority is Sri Lanka. This country can be brought forward only if we speak in one voice as Sri Lankans. If you talk only about your race, your religion and your people, we will never reach that.

I do not call myself a champion; you call yourself a champion. - [Interruption.]

The other matter is, we never go on jolly trips. For three days, from 7 o clock till 9 o clock, I had almost 12 meetings. We went there to find solutions to the long-lasting problems.

You only have one problem. You blast everybody; you criticize everything. Give me a single solution you have provided. You are a mark of division. You want to continue on the same - [Interruption.] In 2010, from which party did you contest? - [Interruption.] From which party did you contest? After the war, you were in the Rajapaksa camp. You lost; you were rejected. After that, you took up communalism and now you are a communalist. I endorse what they are saying, you are a communal politician. But, I am not a communal politician. - [Interruption.] You lost, man. You contested from the Rajapaksa camp and lost; you were rejected. After that, you took up communal politics. You are a

PRIVATE MEMBERS' BILLS

() PROVINCIAL COUNCILS ELECTIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I move, That leave be granted to introduce a Bill to amend the Provincial Councils Elections Act, No. 2 of 1988.

. This Private Members Bill is to repeal the Amendment that was brought in 2017 to that Act.

Since the Prime Minister is also here, I would like to say that the Select Committee to Identify Appropriate Reforms of the Election Laws and the Electoral System and to Recommend Necessary Amendments chaired by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena submitted its Report on the 22nd June, 2022. At page 6 of that Report, the very first observation is this, I quote:

The Provincial Council Election which has been stalled for more than three years negates the democratic rights of the people.

Also, Recommendation No. 1 (b) says this, I quote:

As the Committee was in agreement to hold the election under the Proportional Representation System that existed prior to the enactment of Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Act, No. 17 of 2017, your Committee recommends that suitable legislation be enacted enabling the Provincial Council Election to be conducted under the Proportional Representation System, initially, until legislation is drafted for a mixed election system So, this is a Bill brought in accordance with the recommendations of the Select Committee chaired by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena that I am presenting.

Sir, I am mentioning this Kurundur Malai issue and according to the Code of Conduct, I am making a disclosure that I have an interest in the matter. In that, I appear for two Members of Parliament and another former provincial council member in the Supreme Court in a Fundamental Rights Application - SC (FR) Application No. 186/2021. That is still pending in court. Several organizations have made applications for intervention and as a result, that had got delayed. Now, it is fixed for support on the 05th of June in the Supreme Court on top of the list.

While that matter is coming for support on top of the list in the Supreme Court, I got an invitation from the Department of Archaeology stating that there is an event which is to take place at that site on the 19th of May, 2023 at 2.30 p.m. On the conclusion of excavation and conservation work, this area is to be bestowed to the Department of Archaeology. That is an ancient Hindu shrine which was destroyed by thousands of soldiers - we have pictures - led by the Hon. Vidura Wickramanayaka,

[ . [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

who went there, broke the trident that the Hindus worshipped and threw it into the shrubs. There is a case pending. When there is a case pending in court, it is a

custom, a tradition, a done thing for the State to hold its hand. But, what are you doing? You are having a ceremony and you have the gall to invite me for that event!

What is this I have here with me? This is the logo of the Department of Archaeology. The Department of Archaeology is best understood when one looks at its logo. So, this is the official logo of the Department of Archaeology. What does it have? It has a dagoba and a dharmachakra. It looks like the logo of the Ministry of Buddhasasana. Why does the Department of Archaeology have a logo depicting one religion? That shows what this Department is protecting and what it is determined to destroy.

There was another incident. Again, I have to disclose it because I appeared for that case as a lawyer in the Vavuniya Magistrate's Court yesterday. In Vedukunari Malai, several Hindu worshiping idols were destroyed. The Department of Archaeology initially tried to prevent worshippers from going there and also two or three years ago, they filed several cases. All that was resisted and they could not stop the worshippers. So, unidentified persons in jeeps, wearing shorts, went and destroyed -

( - ) (The Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera- Minister of Agriculture) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes, Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) What is the point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera) . . . .

Sir, this is a very serious issue. This is why, as I said, today there is a hartal. It is an action not of non-cooperation with the Government, but where we will be forced to declare and defy the law as a civil protest, court arrest and fill your prisons by thousands of people. We will not resort to violence, I will assure you that. But, non-violent means that we will resist. Do not ever think that we are a people who could be pushed over, who could be trampled upon. We will not stand that.

2 ( - ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella - Minister of Health) Hon. Presiding Member -

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes, Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella?

2 ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Hon. Member, I think you will have to bring a Substantive Motion and then discuss this. There is no point in levelling this allegation when the Minister concerned is not here. I totally agree that if you have a grievance, you have all the right to express it. But, it must be addressed in a certain manner, of which you know better; I think you should know it better being a lawyer,

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Sumanthiran, please wind up, making your final comments.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I am thankful to the two Hon. Ministers for their interventions, for expressing their concerns as well and saying that we must discuss it.

All what I am saying is, we have raised this a number of times in this House with the Minister. The Minister leads this. Today, it has come to the point of the entire two provinces being shut down. I am telling you with all responsibility that we will defy the law next. Therefore, before it is too late, I am asking the two responsible Ministers present here today to take this up at the Cabinet to change your direction. Do not continue in this racist direction this Government is travelling at the moment.

Thank you.
