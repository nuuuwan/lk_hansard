, , . . . , Daily Mirror lead news :

Corruption taints recruitment for Korean, Israeli jobs.

SL loses job opportunities as applicants cant pay exorbitant charges.

There are complaints about agents of politicians charging more for selecting people for new employment opportunities.

, . 10,000 - - . , we have to be sensitive at a time like this. .

This is a very insensitive thing to do. It also has an impact on our security as well as economic implications. That is why I am raising this issue. In the past also, when the Hon. Dilan Perera was Minister of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare, there were recruitments made. The recruits were given military training in Diyatalawa before sending to Israel because they had to work in farms which had been vacated by the poor Gaza residents. Now, these people are going to be forcibly sent there and their security is not assured.

Yesterday, I was at a diplomatic function, where there were several Arab diplomats. They were also bemused at this decision and ridiculing this. See the timing of this! We do not have to listen to Arab diplomats, but all those Arab countries provide lakhs and lakhs of jobs for us. See the timing of trying to send Sri Lankans to work in such a place! You can earn foreign exchange, but the timing is bad. In fact, I told the Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment yesterday that this is a very insensitive thing to do at a time like this.

Talking about our defence forces, several of our defence top brass do not get visas to travel to the USA and various other western countries due to the allegations of human rights violations, war crimes and all sorts of things. But, what happens to Israeli generals? They will get visas for having killed children, old people and women and for having bombed hospitals. In thousands, the Israeli generals are killing people. What about visas for them? They will be happily travelling about; they will even be dual citizens with the American citizenship. Here, I am not trying to justify our actions. If there were any war crimes in our country, well, those should be dealt with. Even the Hon. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, in an interview, had said that if there is to be a hybrid mechanism, we could select a few of our own judges as well to work with some foreign judges.

, . , ,

279 280

? . .

Therefore, you must be sensitive to an issue like this. In fact, yesterday, several Arab diplomats were sharing their surprise and regret about what we are doing, forgetting the atrocities that is happening in the Occupied Palestinian Territories today.

Having said that, Sir, since I have very limited time, I would like to quote another news from the Daily Mirror of 17.11.2023, as the Votes of the Ministry of Public Security is also being discussed today. It sates, I quote;

Former Government sabotaged Easter Sunday attacks probe, retired Senior DIG alleges.

Ex DIG Ravi Seneviratne said his team was taken off the case when Mr. Rajapaksa took office six months after the bombings.

He said over the months that followed, 22 more officers were removed from the investigation.

A retired Senior DIG has shed new light on claims that the former Sri Lankan government may have colluded with a terrorist group for political gain, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of people, including Australians, in the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings.

This reported an interview Mr. Ravi Seneviratne had given to the ABC Australia. Investigations have brought this out. We also recently took up this issue relating to the "Channel 4" exposures. The President had said earlier that he would get the Scotland Yard to come and inquire into the Easter Sunday attacks. He now talks about another Select Committee. But, we have sufficient evidence already exposed in this country; those matters had been gone into. What do you do now? Poor DIG Ravi Seneviratne, that day, had met with an accident down the Duplication Road. Yesterday, I raised this matter in the Sectoral Oversight Committee on National Security also. That is a bailable offence; he had knocked two vehicles. The IGP himself admitted that despite his talking to the OIC, he was remanded.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) But, there is a question of ethnic diversity. - [Interruption]

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) I certainly do agree. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Therefore, it is only proper that the Hon. Dharmalingam Sithadthan's name be adopted by the Speaker.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) This is not a matter for the Government; we have nothing to do with it. This is a matter for parties other than the two main parties. Whatever it is, the appointment has still not been made. It is useless asking me; I do not appoint them. . . . .

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Yes, but the TNA, as one such party, has proposed a name. - [Interruption] But, the TNA is not one of the main parties.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) But, it is a question of who the nominee should be. Some other parties have also asked for it.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) What other party, Hon. President?

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) You ask them. I am not a Member. I only know what was told to me. The Hon. Leader of Opposition will know. This is an issue that you all have to sort out among yourselves.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) We have proposed a name. The Hon. Speaker has to appoint him.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) I have nothing to do with it. The Government has not made any nominations. ; . , ?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) blame . . .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) , . . , . . - [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes, Hon. Leader of the Opposition? ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. President, I was not here. I was at the Committee on Parliamentary Business, which was discussing two issues. As soon as I heard that you had made some queries, I came here to provide a reply, but I need to know what the issue is. What is the issue, please?

285 286

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) I said I do not know, but you should know better, since you are a member of the Constitutional Coucil, as to why the small party representative is not on the Constitutional Council yet. From what was told to me, there is a dispute between the smaller parties as to who their representative should be. I said I have no objection to the Hon. Dharmalingam Sithadthan. we can always -

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) As far as I am aware, the Hon. Speaker had made a query from the TNA as to who the person who has their consensus. That is, the Hon. Sithadthan. We are also of the opinion that the Hon. Sithadthan has to be appointed, but the Hon. Speaker has had a problem in coming to a decision. That has nothing at all to do with the Opposition, the SJB or the SJB Alliance.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) I am not talking about the SJB. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) I am just trying to clarify this to you. So, I think this is a matter which you should get clarified from the Hon. Speaker. If the Deputy Secretary-General or the Assistant Secretary-General so pleases, a message could be sent for the Hon. Speaker to come to the Chamber and clarify. He himself can verify what I am saying because we are also of the opinion that the Hon. Sithadthan must be appointed.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Like you, we are also of the view that it should be held. But apparently, there is a problem between these different groups. The Hon. Sithadthan is present here. He can tell you what it is. Among your own ranks, not the SJB, but beyond that, there are issues. There is nothing I can do about it. If I had the power, I would appoint the Hon. Sithadthan.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. President, I am sure the Hon. Sithadthan - he is here on the Floor of this House - knows very well how we have supported his candidature and also his appointment. Similar to you, if I also had the power, I would also appoint the Hon. Sithadthan, but we are not empowered to do that. So, what I would recommend to you, Hon. President, is to please instruct the Chair to make a request for the Hon. Speaker to come to the House and clarify. He will be able to better clarify the situation.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) I cannot. Let him make a statement later.

The problem is, you all recognize the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris and his group as a party. So, the moment you recognize them as a party, that group also makes a claim. They are not a party. You may ask the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa about that. So, you all went and recognized them. They should not have had front-row seats; they should have been behind that. You gave them front-row seats; you all are working together; you all now have an agreement also to contest together. I have no problem with that. But, if you all did not give them front-row seats, the Hon. Sithadthan would be in the Constitutional Council now. So, what can I do? ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. President, I am absolutely amazed at your ignorance. If you are telling me that we have the power as an Opposition to recognize parties - that is a duty bestowed on the Hon. Speaker, not on the Leader of the Opposition - I am amazed at your ignorance about Parliamentary activities. - [Interruption.] Please, I have not finished.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Okay. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Also, Hon. President, for your information, the parties in the Opposition are not given the responsibility of allocating seats. We do not do that; that is not our job. And, recognition of parties and their separate identities is the prerogative of the Hon. Speaker, not of the Leader of the Opposition.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, I accept the fact that the Hon. Speaker has to allocate seats. But, generally, the practice has been, before the Hon. Speaker allocates seats on the Opposition side, they ask both the Government and the Opposition in instances like this. I thought you all had agreed. I am sorry that you all had not agreed. Then, you are agreed with the former President. So, we all can ask that they should not be given front-row seats. You do not agree; we do not agree. So, why should we give them front-row seats? The Hon. Sithadthan also agrees that they should not be given front-row seats. So, it is recorded here that both sides have agreed that that group cannot be given front-row seats. Therefore, a copy of this can be given to the Hon. Speaker tomorrow. - [Interruption.]

287 288

2023 23

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. President, please do not attempt to put words into my mouth, okay? It is not a matter of us agreeing, you agreeing or whatever. It is the prerogative of the Hon. Speaker; the Hon. Speaker is bestowed with the responsibility of recognizing political parties. - [Interruption.] I am sorry, there are some who are here and who are very familiar with the "Medamulana sanskruthiya", not with the Westminster "sanskruthiya". - [Interruption.] Please ask your "golayas" to be quiet, Hon. President.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) These are not my "golayas". - [Interruption.] Ah, my "golaya" is there.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) We were giving you a hearing; we were quiet . - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) , . ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) So, we were quiet. This is not the "Medamulana sanskruthiya" or "Medamulana sampradaya". This is Westminster "sampradaya". I was giving you a hearing, Hon. President, without interrupting. Please ask your surrogates and your political cohorts to keep quiet. Your political slaves, they are enslaved.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) So, do you not accept the fact that they should not be given front-row seats? Do you accept that fact? I thought you were against them being given front-row seats because you said that you were not for it. So, tell us whether you are for or against it. That is all we want to know.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. President, whether we are in the front, whether we are in the back or whether we are in the middle, all

that is decided by the people of the country; it is peoples sovereignty. So, let us go for elections. - [Interruption.] Let us go for elections and then the people will decide whether we are in the front, in the middle, in the back or wherever, whether we are in the Government or in the Opposition. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) That was a group elected hanging onto the coat-tails or the "satakaya" of the former President; without that, they would not have been elected. So, they are part of the SLPP. Now, they have gone to that side. So, it is not a question of elections. They could come back here. Or otherwise, they should resign and say, We are going for elections. I suppose you would agree with me that they are not entitled to front-row seats.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. President, then, the theory that you are expounding should also be applicable to the SJB Members of Parliament who went to your side.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Yes. So, why do you not - ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) If you are saying so, if you are saying that those who contested from the "Satakaya" should resign, what about the SJBers who crossed the Floor and joined you? Should they also resign? Please answer that.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Let me answer that. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Okay. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) They crossed over and now, you have sacked them and have filed action. If the court says that they have been lawfully sacked, then, their seats would become vacant. But, on the other hand, if the court says that they had not been lawfully sacked and that you all are still members of the UNP, then you have to come and join me. - [Interruption.]

289 290

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) There is nothing called "have", Hon. President.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) I am saying that there are two ways. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. President, you are not an "elective dictatorship", in Lord Hailshams words.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) I am not a dictatorship. But, you are still a member of the UNP.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. President, I have to tell you with respect that the people who are operating the mikes and the video cameras are not acting impartially. I know that you are not of that opinion. Please, instruct these officials to make sure that the videography is done in the proper order because I watch these. It is very unfair. Please, do not be prejudicial, partial and discriminatory.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Hon. Presiding Member, I agree with him. Have the camera all the time on him and do not have it on me! - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. President, - ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) I have given you the camera. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. President, this is not the UNP Working Committee. Do not twist words. I never said that. So, do not twist my words.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) No, I did not twist your words. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Do not misinterpret what I say. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) I am making a request, that all the cameras should be on you all the time. Now, they have turned them on me. They should not do it; they should turn them on you.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. President, Hon. Leader of the Opposition, please come back to the Debate. You are wasting time.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. Presiding Member, I do not think the Hon. State Minister who spoke now understood an iota of what I said. I sympathize with him.

Sir, I am just stating this to the Hon. President. Hon. President, under "The Constitutional Council" in the Constitution , Article 41A. (1) (f) states, I quote: "one Member of Parliament nominated by agreement of the Members of Parliament other than those representing the Government and those belonging to the political party or independent group to which the Leader of the Opposition belongs,...."

So, there is absolutely no role for the Leader of the Opposition in choosing that member and when the TNA chose the Hon. Sithadthan - I hope the Hon. Sithadthan is able to confirm what I say - I actually called and congratulated him on his appointment. And, at each Constitutional Council Meeting, I had emphasized to the Hon. Speaker that the Hon. Sithadthan should be appointed. Also, if it is proper, I will get those Minutes of the meetings of the Constitutional Council tabled here for your information and perusal, Hon. President,

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) I am not interested in the Minutes of the Council. All I can say is, let us cut this short; we need not argue any more. Tomorrow, I will ask the Prime Minister to tell the Speaker that both sides have agreed that the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris and all cannot sit in the front row. The moment they go and sit in the back row, then, everything else falls into place. Both sides have agreed on that and they cannot sit in the front row.

. . rose.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes, Hon. Leader of the Opposition? ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. Presiding Member, I rise to make some clarifications about a series of statements which were made on the Floor of the House by the Hon. President in my absence and it is only now that I ascertained the basic details of his statements.

Sir, the Hon. President stated on the Floor of this House that the Constitutional Council had failed to approve the appointment of the IGP and also of certain judges. , . . .

, , , . I would like to remind of the fact that the Constitutional Council is not the Working Committee of the United National Party, which merely functions according to the whims and fancies of its leadership. . 3 - 6 - . , . , . Twice, we made the relevant appointment according to the request of the Hon. President; we gave two extensions, each three months' duration. But, we also made an unequivocal statement that the next appointment the President makes - that is, his third attempt at appointing an Inspector General of Police - should be a permanent appointment. So, it is the Hon. Presidents failure to make that appointment which has created this uncertain situation. . . . ,

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

; it is incumbent upon the Hon. President to utter the truth with regard of the appointment of the IGP.

Then, he goes on to say that the Constitutional Council has failed to make the relevant appointments to the Judiciary. But, I would like to empower the Presidents knowledge with details of what happened when he was Prime Minister of the country. When the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya was the Speaker, there were so many occasions where judges were not appointed because there were disagreements within the Constitutional Council and they even had secret votes at that time. . . . , - Constitutional Council - .

I totally, absolutely, vehemently reject the Presidents contention that the current Constitutional Council cannot make up its mind regarding appointments. Of course, we can make up our minds, but we are not at the behest and call of the President. We are not an institution which is a scarecrow in the middle of a paddy field;

309 310

, . We have independence; we have autonomy. ; . , .

. . , . , .

. . . , * .

Sir, I table all the Minutes of the Constitutional Council which confirm the fact that I have persisted in my attempt to persuade the Hon. Speaker to appoint the Hon. Dharmalingam Sithadthan as a member of the Constitutional Council. - - . , . It is very unfortunate that the President so decided to come to the Floor of the House at a time when I was absent due to my participation not in some other activity, but in the Committee on Parliamentary Business.

So, Sir, I want to place all these facts before this august Assembly. We, in the Constitutional Council, are discharging our duties in a proper manner. We will appoint an Inspector General of Police who is qualified and suited, and will make that decision according to constitutionality and the law of the land. We cannot approve requests made by the President, which are illegal; , . , , . , , . , , , .

Sir, I would invite the President to come to Parliament each and every day early in the morning so that we could always have a very cordial discussion about the prevailing national issues. But, I want to say one thing. He, as the Executive of the country, cannot dictate to the Legislature and we will not allow that.; he cannot come and impose his will. We will stand up to protect the democratic rights of all 22 million living in our country and we will protect the rights of all three institutions of democracy, the tripartite system: the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam. You have 13 minutes.

[2.44 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I think it should be 14 minutes, Hon. Presiding Member.

Sir, just two weeks ago, this House debated an Adjournment Motion, unanimously calling for a ceasefire in Gaza in the Middle East and for a negotiated solution to the Israel-Palestine Conflict. Subsequently, there was a letter that was circulated amongst all Members of Parliament and over two-thirds of the Members, whoever the letter was circulated to, including all the leaders seated in the front rows on both sides, signed that letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, which very clearly stated that what is happening in Gaza is genocide. Both in the Adjournment Debate which took place here as well as in that letter, a description of the gravity of the events that were taking place in Gaza was very clearly listed. If you go through that list, Sir, every single matter that was raised to justify the charge of genocide took place on this Island, too, in the North and the East exactly 15 years ago. And, that is why every single Tamil party which represents the North and the East, except for those lackeys who belong to the Government, makes the charge of genocide committed against the Tamil people and naturally, the tool that was used to commit those crimes happens to be the three forces and the police. So, it is in that backdrop, Sir, I would like you to consider the matters that we are raising.

Today, there is no war; today, there is no armed conflict. But, despite that fact and also despite the fact that Sri Lanka is broke, bankrupt and is unable to repay its debt, we continue to spend astronomically. This year alone, the defence expenditure is 11 per cent of the Budget and for public security, it is 3.6 per cent. These are all declared values. In total, it is 14.6 per cent. For health, this year, it is only 10.6 per cent and for education, it is 6.2 per cent of the Budget. A country which is broke, if it wants to come out of this economic crisis, needs to produce and export. Let us take the sectors which are crucial for production and export, sectors like industries, agriculture and fisheries. For industries, it is only 0.2 per cent; for agriculture, it is 2.6 per cent and for fisheries, it is the lowest, 0.18 per cent. We are an island and despite that, it is only 0.18 per cent they have allocated for the fisheries sector.

So, clearly, given the dire situation that the country faces, such an astronomical amount, technically speaking in todays context, should not be wasted in the form of defence because there is nothing to justify it. So, why is it being done? That is the question that must be asked, Sir, why is it being done? The reason we were told, whilst the LTTE was prevalent, was terrorism, the need to fight terrorism and that there cannot be any negotiations with the LTTE because they had taken up arms. Today, no arms! Despite that, if you are making these sorts of allocations, it can mean only one thing and that is, you are not prepared to recognize the rights of the Tamil people; on the contrary, you want to trample upon their

345 346

rights, deny their rights and their due place. So, by carrying on doing that, you know that you will keep making enemies, you know that that population will be hostile and for that reason, you need to maintain carrying out your racist agenda of dismantling the existence of the North and the East on a Tamil identity basis, and to sinhalize the North and the East, you need an oppressive structure, a structure that can continue to make the people of the North and the East subservient.

There is no freedom in the North and the East. The way the police behaves towards us in the South is the complete opposite to the way they behave towards us in the North and the East. So, it is institutionalized; the anti-Tamilness and the anti-minoritiness are institutionalized in order to keep those who want their rights recognized, subservient, oppressed and quiet. And it is for that reason, Sir, this is being done.

I was just looking at the Recurrent Expenditure for defence. It is an exorbitant amount! Last year, Verit Research has carried out a research, where, they say, 48 per cent of the salaries was for defence and public security, together; of the entire expenditure on salaries in the entire Island, 48 per cent was defence-related. Can you justify that? And I will tell you why that is happening, Sir. On the one hand, you have done nothing to empower the people of the North and the East economically. Despite the fact that in 2009 when the war came to an end, they were 30 years behind economically, you have done nothing to empower them. You did nothing; not only the present Government, but even the 2015 Government did nothing. So, you keep them pauperized, those people become desperate and then, what do you do? Then, your counter-insurgency is to somehow absorb them into your own salary scheme. What salary scheme? Your defence salary scheme. That is happening and it is systematic.

Take a good example. You have the CSD. The CSD, in the North, employs Montessori school teachers. They pay them over Rs. 30,000 a month and the same primary school teachers under the Ministry of Education are only paid an allowance of Rs. 6,000 a month. So, it is systematic, those people are forced to move into the military, they are forced to come into that arm. Is there a choice, Sir? Rs. 30,000 and Rs. 6,000. Which will any right thinking person, given the circumstances of this country and the economic situation, choose? The same thing is happening with regard to businesses: the shops, markets and salons. The military is competing with ordinary people. At DCC meetings in the North and the East, the military is chosen to construct buildings. Why? Should the civilians not be given the contracts? No, a heavily subsidised military competes. There is no competition. An ordinary civilian cannot compete with that and the contract goes to the military again. So, where is the income? How are people going to survive? You are deliberately doing it. You pauperize the people to a point where they are forced to leave the country, they are forced to leave their sources of income.

Take the fisher-folk. Sir, if you go to the coasts of the North and the East, almost every two kilometres, you have a naval checkpoint or a naval base; almost every two to three kilometres, you have one through the entire coast. The Navy's presence is massive, obviously because of the coastal area of the North and the East. But, what do they do? Are they securing the seas? No. Foreign fisher-folk come by trawlers to literally one kilometre from the coastline, destroying the Tamil fishermen's assets. Nothing is done! Thousands of ships will come and once in a while, maybe, once a month, five or six trawlers will be taken in and then released. When we raised this matter at the DCC meeting - the Minister of Fisheries is the Chairman of the DCC in Jaffna - in the presence of the Navy Commander, he replies, "The Navy is frightened to confront them because they are large in numbers". Then why the hell are they present in the coasts of the North and the East? At the very least, if you cannot make sure that the people of the North and the East can go out to fish safely, why are you oppressively occupying the coasts of the North and the East? No, it is not that they are frightened, it is deliberate; it is deliberately done! On the one hand, you oust people from their lands, take over their lands and you push them back. By that way you make people give up their livelihood, take over their prime property on the coast. And on the other, you destroy their assets. You allow people to come and destroy their assets so that they cannot survive in the North and the East, where fishing and agriculture comprise the two main sources of income. You are deliberately creating situations, where these people become pauperised.

Sir, it is for this reason and for all those other reasons that we continue to say that when a force has committed genocide and when we know it, there is no way that we can accept that force to be present at the very least till accountability takes place, till we know that those individuals who are there present in front of us are not criminals so that we know that our children are safe and that they will not get raped like the way they got raped before. That is the reason why we repeatedly say that we want accountability and it will never happen within this country. It will never happen because the system is that, your agenda is that. You need it to carry out your agenda, and it is only through an international mechanism that this situation could be addressed.

Finally, Sir, I am saying - I said it the last time also and I am not saying this to upset people or to make people angry - that the Ministry of Defence is the single most hated Ministry by the Tamil people.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) If I am saying that, even 15 years after the war if that remains the sentiment, then you must understand how serious your conduct is. Unless you understand and

347 348

2023 23

address those concerns, Sri Lanka will continue to be pauperized because you are in this place fundamentally because of the ethnic conflict and you will never be able to get out of that rut unless you deal with the fundamental reasons for that conflict.

Thank you, Sir.

[3.25 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Okay.

Hon. Presiding Member, today, we are discussing the Votes of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of

Public Security. It is a Discussion on their Votes and it is not to be confused with our admiration for the armed forces. I have been listening to a number of speeches made here and there is no doubt about our admiration for those who have sacrificed their lives to protect the civilians of this country.

Sir, Budget Debates are not to look at the history, but particularly to look at the future. While looking at the future, many things have been said in this Discussion, of which some were to do with the human capital in all the forces versus technology, that technology needs to be used. It is true of agriculture, it is true of the armed forces and of anything, that the use of technology and reducing human resources is the way forward. There were questions about using defence forces for civilian works. It is not that they just do the work, but it is also an issue for their dignity. There were also issues about education and training the civilian population on defence matters. So, the list goes on and on and on. I am not really going to go into all that. Instead, I want to say that you really need defence, but you also need unity in a country. We heard some of the speakers talk about that, too. That is, the rule of law is the biggest defence a small island country like ours could have.

I heard the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa, MP, on the 20th of November, referring to a verdict given by Sri Lanka's Supreme Court. He questioned the right of the petitioners to challenge Government policy in court. I think it was really hilarious to hear that. The verdict that was given a week ago by the Supreme Court was a holistic verdict. It is the most important judgment that has been given since the 1978 Constitution came into being in this country. The online report of the EconomyNext of 04th of April, 2021 quotes Dr. P.B. Jayasundara as saying, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa knew revenue will be lost by tax cuts but he considered it an investment, and an 8 per cent tax rate slashed from 15 per cent, will remain unchanged for 5-years. Then, Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe declared much earlier in May and August that the Government slashed taxes regardless of IMF advice and disregarded Central Banks warning of the urgent need to seek IMF assistance. Now, we all know the consequences of that: rampant inflation, sky-high interest rates, exchange rate going completely out of control and the Foreign Exchange Reserves going down from US Dollars 7.6 billion to US Dollars 155 million in August, 2021. So, the question the petitioners raised before court was, who is actually responsible for this? On that, Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya, Justice Buwaneka Aluwihare, Justice Vijith Malalgoda, Justice Murdu Fernando and Justice Priyantha Jayawardena declared a 4:1 verdict. They took up two cases - SC FR No. 212/2022 and SC FR No. 195/2022 - from petitioners and heard them together. In June, 2022, the Fundamental Rights petitions on who is responsible for the current economic crisis were filed in the Supreme Court. Former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, former Minister of Finance Basil Rajapaksa, former Governor of the Central Bank Ajith Nivard Cabraal and former Secretary to the Treasury S.R.

357 358

Attygalle were among the 13 Respondents in this case. The petitions listed the allegations as reduction in government revenue, failure to reverse illegal taxes, failure to take remedial measures immediately, devaluation of the Sri Lanka Rupee, the sovereign debt going sky high and inability to reduce it and refusal to seek assistance from the IMF until the crisis has exacerbated.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Order, please! .

, [ ] .

, , [ ] .

Whereupon THE HON. WEERASUMANA WEERASINGHE left the Chair, and DEPUTY SPEAKER [THE HON. AJITH RAJAPAKSE] took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Chairman, the Petitioners made it absolutely clear that they do not challenge the policy of the Government in those proceedings; it was stated to Court.

The Judgment runs into 200-odd pages. The conduct impugned in these proceedings includes illegal, arbitrary, unreasonable or capricious Executive and/or administrative actions and/or inactions. Such actions and/or inactions arise from the implementation of arbitrary and/or capricious decisions, by the Executive and/or administrative branches of the Government. It impugned and breached the public trust reposed in them. Acute shortages in essentials such as fuel and gas, food and medicine and prolonged power cuts became the regular pattern of life. Long queues for fuel and gas brought severe hardships to the entire society and led to many deaths. This is why these Petitioners went to the Supreme Court in the public interest. Such a breakdown ultimately led to the collapse of public order and the complete undermining of the rule of law. That is why the legally elected President was pushed out, had to flee the country and resign only subsequently. Therefore, in a landmark Judgment, the Supreme Court on November 14 held that former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa, former Governors of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Prof. W.D. Lakshman and Ajith Nivard Cabraal, former Secretary to the Treasury S.R. Attygalle and many others including former Secretary to the President, Dr. P.B. Jayasundera violated public trust and breached Article 12(1) of the Constitution in their administration of the economy, leading to the current economic crisis in the country.

Sir, we have some lessons to learn. That is, the public officials have a responsibility to discharge their duties in the best interest of the public. The Respondents were bestowed high power to uphold public trust - it is also the duty of all of us in this Chamber - and were duty-bound to discharge duties according to directives of the Constitution. They cannot shirk their responsibility by merely stating that the decisions they took were policy decisions. It was clear that the Respondents did not act and take all measures to remedy the situation in the public interest. The public trust reposed in them was not a higher one and is bestowed on all public officials and therefore, they were obliged to act in a responsible manner. Actions, omissions, decisions and conduct of the Respondents directly contributed to the economic crisis.

There is a right to equality of the Directive Principles, which guarantee protection from arbitrary exercise of power. It requires State authorities to ensure that their conduct does not breach public trust and the public resources placed in their custody are protected, preserved and are not used for political and personal benefits. The exercise of discretionary powers should be guided by the Directive Principles recognized by the Constitution. The rule of law is not only rights and equality, but it is also about functionality and efficiency for sustainable economic growth. Merely because the decisions are concerned with economic policies, that does not mean that the Court has no jurisdiction over them. So, the right to equality is guaranteed by the Constitution under Article 12(1): "All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal protection of the law." Article 27(1) of the Constitution requires the President and the Cabinet of Ministers, in the governance of Sri Lanka, to be guided by the Directive Principles stated in the law. This is what they had actually failed in.

There are questions that are being asked. The Judgment underscores that no one is above the law. Just because, now, the verdict is against only one sitting Member of Parliament, we also would not be treated differently when it comes to the law. It could also be the President of the country. He has immunity only while he holds office. He cannot beat or murder his wife and then think that he could escape from it and nor can any public servant. That is, only for a period of time. Once the immunity is lost, they would be held responsible. The Judgment clearly states that those named had breached public trust. Therefore, it raises the question as to how they could remain in Parliament, representing the public. It is natural that that is asked. The civilian organizations also go further and ask how those who had been named in the Judgment continue to receive benefits and be in this House. That is another question, Sir, which should be posed, for those who have held the highest office in this country, particularly those who had become President of this country, whether it is actually suitable to come back to Parliament. We all know that once you have held the highest office, whether it be in the armed forces - the Navy, the Police or the Air Force - or in a public-quoted company, you do not make your way back into those

359 360

[ ]

2023 23

institutions again. So, there are questions that are being raised with regard to the law and ethics of doing that. Therefore, we must not use our Privileges in Parliament to undermine the verdicts given by the Supreme Court of the country just because, again, its "Members of Parliament".

Thank you, Sir, for the time given.
