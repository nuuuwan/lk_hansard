asked the Minister of Health:

(a) Will he inform this House - (i) separately, the total number of COVID-19 dead bodies buried at the Government-designated COVID-19 burial site at Oddamawaddi during the period from 2019-2022; (ii) separately, the breakdown of the aforesaid dead bodies according to their age, gender, ethnicity, religion and province/district of residence; (iii) the basis upon which the Government selected Oddamawaddi as the burial site of the COVID-19 dead bodies; and

(iv) whether the Government made any attempt to select any other site/s other than Oddamawaddi as the Government-designated COVID-19 burial site/s, using the same basis and criteria as Oddamawaddi?

() 0 ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Minister, you mentioned that there was a special Presidential Task Force that had been appointed to decide on this issue pertaining to the burial and cremation of COVID-19 dead bodies. It is well known that a professor attached to the Faculty of Applied Sciences of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura had been in the forefront in this issue of viruses spreading through groundwater and that led to a large number of bodies of Muslims as well as non-Muslims, as you have said in your reply, being taken to a far off place in Oddamawadi for burial based on that unscientific, irrational and racist policy. So, do you agree now, since it is scientifically proven and various epidemiologists and virologists have confirmed, that no virus can spread through groundwater? It is because viruses do not survive without a living body. Once a man is dead, viruses are also dead; they cannot survive in cells. Therefore, do you agree that the Government was misled purposely by a group of racist professionals who were appointed to that Task Force?

2 ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Hon. Member, I was not the Minister of Health, but only a member of the Special Committee on COVID-19 Control as the Minister of Mass Media at that point of time.

But, I was involved in this entire affair. Obviously, the people who are involved in that particular profession will have to be taken seriously and given the opportunity to express their views on such occasions. I totally agree with you that that was a case where even the professionals were making mistake after mistake and dramatic mistakes at that. So, I do not want to associate myself with that decision, but I may even mention this.

You said some of the professionals, but no, most of the professionals were in favour of the WHO decision. But, there was one who held a different view, Prof. Meththika Vithanage, who was the first one to join the aragalaya and start shouting slogans of being non-racial and non-racist. So, I think there is a controversy and how you deal with it is a different matter. And, I will fail in my duty if I do not reveal what exactly happened. Prof. Meththika Vithanage put her foot down and said that she will even resign if that was not adhered to because she was the professor in charge of that particular discipline.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) My second Supplementary Question, Sir, is this. I thank the Hon. Minister for having accepted that fact and he named that particular professor, though I did not want to name the person. You named the person. -[Interruption] Yes, that is good. Now that you agree that it is a wrong pretext upon which that decision was taken, where large numbers of people have been traumatized, racially profiled and have been subjected to so much of trauma, they will be entitled to sue the said expert.

The Hon. (Mrs.) Pavithradevi Wanniarachchi was the Minister then and several times when we pleaded with her, she also passed the ball on to the Expert Committee.

2 ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) No, I must say that she did not pass the ball to them. As the Minister - she is a lawyer by profession and to my knowledge, she is not an expert in that particular field - she needed to take their advice. You would do the same thing; you have to get some advice from the professionals of the said discipline.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Sir, I have not finished my Question. The Government had hand-picked certain experts who were so racist in their attitude and that is how this whole thing happened. We pleaded with the Government to at least change the expert because all the other experts were against it.

2 ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) I am sorry, I cannot prescribe to your view; while respecting it, I would not want to be a party to the statement that you made. However, I would also agree with no reservation that that was a complete misleading by the so-called "professionals" in that particular discipline.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) My third Supplementary Question, Sir, - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Third Question? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) I have one more Question. Sir, with your permission, - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) But, it would be unfair to go for a third Question. Okay, you go head.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Minister, anyway, you are partly admitting the mistakes of the Government. Be that as it may, what I am saying is, now that that has been accepted in Parliament as a wrong decision, will the Government pay compensation to the victims, for having made their families to suffer and undergo trauma? More than 3,000 people -

2 ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) You are wrong, I only explained what exactly happened. So, it is up to you, if it is a wrong decision, to decide what course of action you should pursue.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) What I am saying is, not only did they take the bodies to Oddamawadi, a far-off place, but there were also army contingents stationed there, there was army escort, so much of State money was wasted and the people who wanted to go to that burial ground to pay their last respects were restricted to only two people. They traumatized the entire families. So, all those families are bound to file action for the trauma they have been subjected to so unreasonably and in a racist manner. Do you agree?

2 ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) I have to put the record straight. Not only the family members of the deceased Muslims and others, whose bodies were taken to those faraway places, but even on certain cremations held in Colombo, only two people were allowed. So, it applied not only to the Muslims, but to the rest as well.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you very much.

2 we had to convince the IMF why we did not implement those. So, all those issues had to be overcome by this Government. The only thing I want to remind the Opposition is that we had gone to the IMF 16 times and whenever we came back, whatever agreements we had reached with them or the guarantees or the pledges made had not been placed before Parliament for debate or approval. So, this is the first time it is happening, Hon. Kiriella. The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe has placed the Agreement before the House and it is a national decision that all the Members have to take. I hope that all the Members will support it.

Thank you.

2 0 0 Sir, there were three major factors in my opinion. First is the debt which we have inherited over a long period of time. Since we have been graduating from a low-income country to a middle-income country, debt came at a higher premium. Then, the repayments were coming up, but we were not ready for it. 2 2 2 0 0 2

[12.16 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Hon. Deputy Speaker, I am glad to follow the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs. When you listen to his speech, it is as if he has woken from a deep slumber having been a part of an administration which has made this country go into a sovereign default for the first time in our history.

Now, we have ultimately been able to somehow successfully negotiate an Extended Fund Facility programme. That is an important milestone, none of us disagree with that. The IMF endorsement is certainly going to restore confidence in our country on its path to recovery. So, in reaching that milestone, of course, we would be required to address the fundamental weaknesses in our financial system and the monetary network. What is more important is not the money we are getting, but ultimately what the programme will unlock as far as the country is concerned in order for us to borrow again to meet the essential needs of the country.

With this improved sentiment, we are now witnessing a reducing pace in inflation and it is important for us to continue on this path. When you look at some in this House, you would see that it has become very fashionable to vilify the IMF and this kind of crackpots

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

are keeping on heaping blame on the IMF. But here, I would like to, along with every citizen of Sri Lanka, thank the IMF, its Managing Director, the Co-Heads of the Sri Lanka staff team, the IMF Resident Representative in Sri Lanka and all other members of the IMF Staff Team for tirelessly working around the clock to provide Sri Lanka the much needed EFF, being the platform to enable Sri Lanka to come out of the economic problems we have got into.

The IMF has only identified the issues, being the Programme Objectives, which need to be addressed for Sri Lanka to get out of this perilous situation. The solution to achieve the Objectives are proposals by the Government of Sri Lanka and not those imposed on the Government by the IMF. Sir, the Government of Sri Lanka including the Finance Minister, the President, in this House have misrepresented on numerous occasions, portraying that these are proposals of the IMF and made the IMF the monster in the room. I am not convinced that the proposals of the authorities - the Government of Sri Lanka and its bureaucrats - are the optimum solution to address the issues identified by the IMF, which will lead Sri Lanka achieving the objectives laid down in the Extended Fund Facility that has now been granted. This conclusion of mine is based on the high risk assigned by the IMF Staff Team itself based on the Medium-term Risk Analysis given in page 63 of the IMF Country Report in relation to the programme succeeding, as envisaged.

I will touch on four main areas and they are, Tax Policy Reforms under the theme Fiscal Consolidation", Energy pricing under the theme Fiscal Consolidation, Autonomous Central Bank under the theme Restoring Price Stability and Rebuilding External Buffers and finally, Governance under the theme Reducing Corruption Vulnerabilities.

On Tax Policy Reforms, Sri Lankas tax to GDP ratio is 7.3 per cent, being the lowest in the world. This is an abysmal position compared to other nations. The IMF staff team has rightly identified the reasons for the weak tax performance being, one, low tax rates, two, narrow tax network and three, low collection efficiency. While I agree that the tax rates have to be increased, the elephant in the room is the narrow tax net and the low collection efficiency, which are interlinked and clothed with corruption.

The majority of Sri Lankas elite do not pay taxes. Therefore, a robust tax mechanism has to be developed to bring these evaders into the tax net, to tax this group of people. That should have been the paramount motive. And, this was the ideal opportunity to bring those evaders into the tax net and once again, we are allowing them, like always, out of the equation, targetting only the middle and the lower-middle income groups to widen the tax net. Those evaders do not keep their monies under the mattress. All their monies are in deposit accounts with banks and non-bank financial institutions. So, this was the ideal opportunity to withhold a higher percentage as tax, say about 20 per cent, and integrate the Inland Revenue RAMIS system with the systems operated by the withholding agents to ensure these taxes are paid to the Inland Revenue Department under the respective Taxpayer Identification Numbers, thus side-stepping the involvement of officials in that Department to record taxes received in an ad hoc manner. This exercise alone, even in the short term, would have provided three times the revenue projected based on the currently implemented system. This would have enabled the Inland Revenue Department to have on record a database of potential evaders and pursue them to pay up in the following years. Based on the current interest rate environment where interest rates have more than doubled, even the people in the lower rungs of society would not have complained, as their take-home post-withholding would still have been more than what they would have got before the crisis.

Sir, one of the vulnerabilities identified by the IMF Staff Team which would contribute to this programme failing is large shocks. The current backdrop of professionals and middle-income earners protesting on the streets is a recipe for a large shock to the detriment of the Programme objectives. The authorities opting to bring the middle and lower-middle income earners into the tax net whilst leaving an opening for the evaders to continue to evade paying taxes is a demonstration of the corrupt mindset and the agenda-based policy formulation of the current Government. Therefore, this is a clear demonstration of the corruption prevalent within the system, which, I hope, the IMFs Governance Diagnostic Mission will focus and contain.

Sir, like on Tax Reform, Energy Pricing solution of the Government was again targetted at groups in the lower rungs of the economy. Here too, the narrative of the Government of Sri Lanka was, the pricing formula was imposed by the IMF and the monster in the room shown

2285 2286

was the IMF. Quite conversely, the IMFs Energy Price Programme objective was to have a cost-recovery-based pricing structure. However, the Governments formulation of the cost-recovery pricing structure was seriously flawed. Sir, the Government of Sri Lanka did not consider an important component of the electricity cost, which being the cost of hydroelectricity. Hydroelectricity generated at Rs. 2.00 per unit is a national asset and every household in Sri Lanka has an equal claim on this national asset. Based on the flawed pricing formula, the Government of Sri Lanka has arbitrarily forfeited the low-consumption households equal claim to hydroelectricity for the benefit of the high-consumption users. That disgruntled group of people is another recipe for a large shock, the IMF Report highlights, which could contribute to this programme failing.

Then, the matter of an independent Central Bank. We are here today debating the IMF Extended Fund Facility Programme because we had a failed Central Bank run by politicians and political cronies. An independent Central Bank is paramount. Therefore, we now have a new Central Bank Bill which has been tabled. Does the new Central Bank Bill give independence to the Central Bank? The language in the Bill in relation to the autonomy of the Central Bank may portray its autonomy but then, you have to carefully look at how the appointments are going to be made. Take the appointment of the Governor. Practically, Ranil Wickremesinghe the Minister recommends to Ranil Wickremesinghe the President and subject to the approval of the Constitutional Council controlled by Ranil Wickremesinghe, Ranil Wickremesinghe the President shall appoint the Governor!

Is that independence? Every other appointment is going to be made in a similar manner. This was alluded to even by the former Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy in a recent discussion, that there are issues regarding the appointment of officials to the Central Bank. Therefore, these things have to be carefully looked at. On governance issues also, I can talk at length.

Since this is an essential situation in which we have no other option but to agree to these conditionalities that have been imposed, it is important for us to continue in that path, if we are to go for recovery. With those comments, Sir, I conclude.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) 2 2 0 9 0

you that there are a lot of things that we have to do to recover from the crisis we are in and to go for growth.

You see, the primary deficit anticipated was Rs. 56 billion minus, but for first quarter of 2023, we have achieved a surplus of Rs. 48 billion. I do agree with you and I know that you want to vote in favour of the Resolution also. But, do not create unnecessary anticipations when the Government has not made a decision. If we have made a decision, we would have informed of that. We have been transparent right throughout. Could you tell me a single instance where we have not been transparent when it came to the IMF matter? We have always been transparent. So, when we make a decision, we will be transparent, we will present it to Parliament and we will inform you all. That will happen. So, on local debt restructuring, it is not fair for you to come and table the Working Paper. Nothing has been finalized officially, I am telling you with responsibility.

to happen to the Central Bank holdings, but not anything beyond that. So, what I am telling you is, do not do this, do not play around with this.

) 2 ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silv I am not playing around. ( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) Of course, you are playing around when you come and tell all the unwanted things here, which are very sensitive. You know these are very sensitive matters.

) 2 ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) So, let me answer. Sir, let me answer. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes, Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva? ) 2 ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) I know the debt treatment. You have Rs. 4 trillion in Treasury Bills. Of the Rs. 4 trillion - [Interruption] Let me speak. Of the Rs. 4 trillion, 65 per cent is with the Central Bank. You are only going to treat the Central Bank debt in Treasury Bills. But, in Treasury Bonds, you have Rs. 9 trillion. Of the Rs. 9 trillion, 45 per cent is held by banks, 43 per cent is held by the EPF and 9 per cent is held by insurance companies and others. I am not saying that you are going to have a haircut on them. All what I am saying is this. I will repeat what you say: A voluntary domestic debt optimization operation without coercion is envisaged. Sri Lankan Government and its advisers will initiate consultations with major T-Bond holders to gauge options and constraints. That is all what I am saying. And, with regard to the timeline, you say that you will implement it in May. That is what I am saying.

( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) Hon. Member, that is not what you said before. After I explained only, you are now reading it. What you mentioned was wrong! What you said was, the Government of Sri Lanka has taken a decision on the debt treatment policy. But, we have not. Where does it say that? It gives all the figures; 2 presentation 0 ? 2 ?
