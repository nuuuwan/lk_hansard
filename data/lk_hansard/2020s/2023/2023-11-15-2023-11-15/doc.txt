asked the Minister of Transport and Highways:

(a) Is he aware that -

(i) carpeting and developing of the Gammana Road which is about 1.5 km, in Bandaragama Divisional Secretary's Division, No. 668 Aluthgama Grama Niladhari Division, commenced under the programme of carpeting 100,000 km of rural roads but was discontinued midway about six months ago;

(ii) that the tar and concrete parts of the road were removed and only an ABC layer was placed in places and due to the rain, the ABC layer has also washed away and now, it is so dilapidated that travelling is almost impossible; and

(iii) that Kalutara Provincial Road Development Authority has sent an estimate to place a layer of tar on that road as a temporary solution until carpeting?

(b) Accordingly, will he inform this House as to whether the above road would be repaired quickly using a temporary layer of tar?

We have not been updated on the restructuring talks between Sri Lanka and China other than to say that there is an agreement with the Exim Bank of China. We are aware that Lazard is unable to share the details of this agreement without the consent of the Chinese Government. Has such consent been obtained? Have the Paris Club, mainly Japan, and India agreed to the China Exim Bank deal? What about the ISB holders? Their ad hoc group has made a proposal to the Government of Sri Lanka on adding on a debt instrument called a macro-linked bond - MLB - to the proposed exchange Bond series, replacing the existing defaulted Bonds. That is, to give them further benefit if Sri Lanka overperforms on its GDP growth projections. Let it be known, I am repeating, let it be know, if anyone is to be overcompensated, that group must be those who took the biggest beating in this whole restructuring exercise and they are the workers, whose EPF was the hardest hit. So, we urge the authorities not to bind any future administration to an unfair deal with the ISB holders. The days of this Government are numbered. So, please be transparent in any deal you enter in to so that we all are on the same page.

) ( - ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe - State Minister of Finance) Hon. Member, what are you quoting from? ) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) It is I who say that; I am saying that. I am asking you not to enter into a deal without everyone being in the same page because your days are numbered.

Sir, the Budget set aside Rs. 3,000 billion the day before yesterday - that is roughly US Dollars 9 billion - as new debt. Some have misunderstood this as a new borrowing. As we understand, it is only an accounting treatment, but - this is the catch, Sir - the important point

is, it indicates the haircut of the ISBs and that is 30 per cent of the outstanding US Dollars 2.5 billion stock of defaulted ISBs. That is certainly not sufficient;we are telling you, a 30 per cent haircut is not sufficient and if you are going to add a macro-linked Bond to that, that would be a sweet deal that no one can even expect! Talking about those vulture investors already up on the deal with booked profits, having purchased the Bonds for next to nothing, a further question arising from yesterday's Supreme Court decision is, who are the beneficial owners of those Bonds? Who are the beneficial owners of the US Dollar 500 million Bond? This was referred to in yesterday's Supreme Court judgment. And, who are the true owners of the Hamilton Reserve Banks US Dollars 250 million Bond? Who owns them? Who are they? Are any of those people who were named yesterday in court the beneficial owners of those funds?

( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) Sir, I just want to point out one matter. Of course, to certain other points you made, Hon. Member, I will reply when I speak on the Budget.

When you were speaking on external debt restructuring, while sitting here and listening, I got the impression that you were trying to aggravate the speculations that are being spoken of. Hon. Member, all the details which were to be shared are being shared now. The external debt restructuring discussions and engagements are taking place very positively.

I also want to give another assurance to you. The Hon. President gave an assurance to all creditors in writing, saying that when the resolution on external debt restructuring is finalized, our treatment will be comparable. That is the principle we are negotiating on. So, I hope you will understand that. Again, whatever that needs to be shared has been shared. Please appreciate the fact that we have dealt with the most difficult part, the part of external debt restructuring, and we are very confident that we will come to a final resolution.

Also, you were very sensitive in your speech; . .

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) . . . . .

I appreciate your point, Hon. State Minister. But, there are two issues. One is, we do not know whether Lazard has shared the deal that you all have basically entered into with China and the Paris Club. That information, we do not have. If you say that it has been shared - maybe, that is confidential information to you - we are happy. In fact, as a political party, we have been urging China, India and the Paris Club to come to an agreement. We do not want this countrys debt negotiations to go on and on; we want them to be completed. So, if there is anything that we can do as a political party, we are more than happy to do it.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) The other issue, Hon. State Minister, is the macro-linked bond on the ISBs. That is where the issue comes up. All what I am saying is, you cannot give the ISB holders a much sweeter deal than what others are getting. That is all what I want to tell you. You can reply during your speech,.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva, you are talking about a very sensitive matter. I have very clearly expressed the fact that our treatment is going to be comparable. So, to be comparable to one party and not to be comparable to the other party is not our policy. Whether it be the ISB holders or external debts, it will be a very comparable treatment.

[12.07 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, for the opportunity to speak at the Second Reading of the Budget that has been presented to this House by the Hon. President as Minister of Finance.

Whenever I spoke on the Second Reading of the Budget, if it was the President who held the portfolio of Finance, I have consistently raised my objection to that fact and I must place my objection today also; I have done that since 2010. The reason is, the Constitution states that public finance is a matter that is entirely in the preserve of Parliament. Therefore, I take the view that it is only a Member of Parliament who is accountable to Parliament in that way and who must hold the portfolio of finance. The Hon. President is not a Member of Parliament, although he can attend Parliament and answer questions. Therefore, I take the view that the chief of the Executive, who is not a member of the Legislature, should not hold that post.

Having said that, I want to start by welcoming some of the Proposals that have been made. For instance, we welcome the increase in the monthly Cost of Living Allowance of public sector employees and pensioners. Although insufficient, it is a welcome increase. Also, the increase in the monthly allowance for persons with disabilities, elderly citizens and kidney patients is most welcome. Then, for compensation for missing persons, there was a large sum allocated several years ago, but that was not spent. There is already an amount in the Appropriation Bill, but over and beyond that, the Hon. President, in his Speech said, is allocating a further sum to expedite the payment.

Then, providing land ownership to farmers. Yes, it is a very salutary Proposal and we welcome that. The development of the fisheries industry in the northern region, a long felt need, has also found mention among the Budget Proposals and we welcome that. The construction of houses for internally displaced persons, initiating preliminary work for the water supply project in Jaffna and all of these Proposals in the Budget, we welcome. However, it is one thing to have these Proposals and quite another to see them realized. So, that is why we have reacted with scepticism when even those welcome Proposals are mentioned.

497 498

2023 15

We and several agencies have tracked the progress made on Budget Proposals. The Committee on Public Finance has been specially tasked to do this. Between the years 2015 and 2019, I had the honour of chairing that Committee and we started that process, but often came up against a blank wall because there was no information available. And, I must say that the current Chair, the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva, is also taking a lot of effort to track their progress to see whether previous years Budget Proposals have been implemented and to what percentage they have actually been realized. With regard to only 8 per cent of last years Budget Proposals, there is even some progress at all. A stupendous 68 per cent has no information at all! Then, how can we be satisfied or be happy that some progressive Proposals had been made? So, they amount to just words and I urge the Chair of the Committee on Public Finance to sit at least once a month and summon officials to disclose to that Committee the progress made on each of these Proposals; it must be a continuous assessment process. If not, Parliament cannot actually exercise those powers over public finance and those words in the Constitution will also become mere words like that in the Budget Proposals. So, now, for that to have some meaning - in the full House, we will not be able to do that - that we have a Committee on Public Finance, I think it would be appropriate to have regular meetings - at least once a month - to assess the progress of all of those Proposals that have been made.

I must say that the revenue Proposals are wholly unrealistic and it is not this year alone that it is happening. If this is a trend, then we must know that those are unrealistic. Even in the past years, we have found that it is a habit to make an overestimation of revenue and an underestimation of expenses. That is the way you show, at the Budget Proposals' time at least, a smaller deficit, knowing all too well that that is a false figure and that deficit is actually much larger or several times more. So, the revenue Proposals are wholly unrealistic. Even now, the reason for the increase in the VAT percentage is said to be that revenue has not been collected as envisaged.

So, we knew that well before. How did we know that? Because revenue has never been collected as anticipated or disclosed in the revenue Proposal. So, we know that. Now, that is being said as the reason for burdening the entire population with a VAT rate increase. If the Department of Inland Revenue properly collected taxes from those who are obliged to pay taxes, we obviously would not be in this state. That is why, in the Governance Diagnostics Report, the IMF has correctly pointed to the revenue collection authorities - the Sri Lanka Customs and the Department of Inland Revenue - as being severely corrupt, the high officials being corrupt. My only grouse with that Report is that they left the political masters out of it. In fact, the revenue collection authorities are shielded and protected by the political masters in office, who are more corrupt than those officials themselves. That is the reason why the country went into bankruptcy.

There is also a heavy disparity in allocations. Defence continues to be a high expenditure. We are said to have the 17th largest army in the world. For a small country such as ours, just see the size of the army itself. I can

understand that at a time when it was, perhaps, necessary. But, 14 or 15 years after the internal strife ended, there does not seem to have been any effort made to demobilize the armed forces; that has not happened at all. So, we keep pumping money into a sector that is not necessary to be maintained in the current context.

Then, with regard to corruption, the Supreme Court delivered a 265-page judgment yesterday, a most welcome judgment. Unfortunately, it is a majority judgment; one judge, for reasons he had stated, had dissented. So, it is a 4-1 judgment holding the then President, Ministers of Finance who held that portfolio, the successive Governors of the Central Bank, Secretary to the Treasury, Adviser to the President, one member of the Monetary Board and the Monetary Board itself responsible for the collapse of the economy. Now, I want to recount a particular series of events. The adviser to that President, Dr. P.B. Jayasundara, was found guilty by the Supreme Court in the case Vasudeva Nanayakkara vs K.N. Choksy. Here, I must disclose my interest in the matter because I was the counsel who appeared for the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara. Dr. Jayasundara was found guilty and was fined Rs. 500,000 at that time by the Supreme Court; he paid the fine. He was also told that he cannot hold public office thereafter. He gave an affidavit to court stating that he would not hold any public office thereafter.

Then, there was a change in the office of the Chief Justice and the new Chief Justice - [Interruption.] The Hon. Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms is asking me to name the person. I will name him; I will tell his name. It is not wrong to name him. The new Chief Justice Asoka de Silva constituted a court, to which Dr. P.B. Jayasundera made an application to withdraw his affidavit. Why? Because the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa insisted that Dr. P.B. Jayasundera and Dr. P.B. Jayasundera alone must be appointed Secretary to the Treasury. As counsel for the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, I objected to that. One day, almost the full court - ten judges sat and one judge was unavailable - sat and then, a seven-judge Bench allowed it with there being one dissenter. Justice Shiranee Tilakawardane wrote a dissenting judgment, a dissenting order and the others allowed it and he was appointed Secretary to the Treasury. That Chief Justice who allowed it at the time, the day after his retirement, became the Legal Adviser to the then President. So, corruption in high places is demonstrated by this just one example.

Then, the Supreme Court again finds that President, his two brothers, Dr. P.B. Jayasundera and others responsible for the collapse of the economy. There is one thing that the court has not done and which they should have done. In the Easter Sunday bombing case, for failure to prevent the attack, a former President and several others were asked to pay hundreds of million in compensation. But, under yesterdays judgment, those who have been found guilty and responsible for the economy collapsing in this country do not have to pay any compensation. The court says, The petitioners did not ask for compensation. No, the Court could have granted a just and an equitable relief. Surely, the

499 500

Rajapaksa brothers have enough money to pay the 22 million people in this country! Surely, if a compensation has been ordered, all the money that is parked outside the country can be brought. The Hon. Minister of Justice himself said several people have parked their money outside the country. So, it can be brought back and the countrys economy can be revived just on that alone! The countrys economy collapsed because public money has been stolen by that President,

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] his brothers and several others who worked with them; they have taken money out of the country. What the Supreme Court should have done is to order them to pay a compensation for every citizen of this country and bring that money into the Treasury. That would have seen the revival of this countrys economy.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I am concluding.

This is not the end. Perhaps due to the nature of the proceedings in the Supreme Court, that is what the court has held. But, I am sure that, now, we must start a recovery process from those who have been held responsible by the Supreme Court and every citizen of this country is entitled to make that claim, to ask them to bring the money back and make this economy stand back again.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) ( ) . 20 .

[3.19 p.m.]

. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) I thank the Chair for giving me this opportunity to speak.

I had pointed out in my speech during the Budget Debate last year as to how the amounts spent on the military had steadily increased since 1961. I had also pointed out that the spending had increased despite the war coming to an end in 2009. This year, too, the estimated expenditure for so-called defence has increased.

Instead of removing weapons from the hands of the members of the armed forces and helping them to reintegrate as civilians into society, the successive post-war Governments have spent large sums of public money on them and wish to continue to do so. If there is fear of allowing weapon-trained personnel into the society, a process akin to the DDR - Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration, process would support ex-military combatants to become active participants in the peace process. Disarmament, demobilization and reintegration lay the groundwork for safeguarding and sustaining the communities to which these individuals return, while building capacity for long-term peace, security and development. In situations where it is too early or not possible to carry out disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes, the UN supports community violence reduction programmes which lead to the right conditions for political processes to progress and armed militia to disband. Those can also run in parallel to DDR programmes, complementing them and addressing the needs of communities in parallel to those of ex-military men. There has been no discussion at all about reduction of the numbers in the military. Of the 331,000 soldiers, at least 200,000 are stationed in the North and the East. Successive Sri Lankan Governments have not considered reduction of these armed forces at all.

I should like to point out today that such ever-increasing expenditure in defence is not accidental. It is reflective of the ethnocratic mindset of the successive Sri Lankan governments, of which the present Government is no exception. Let me explain. A significant statement was made by an international expert from Israel by the name of Professor Yiftachel a few years ago when he participated in our International Land Grabbing Conference. He formulated, over two decades ago, the theory of ethnocratic regimes. He did research into the nature of land grabbing taking place against Tamils and Muslims in Sri Lanka by the successive Sinhala majority governments and came to the conclusion that Sri Lanka too, like Israel, is an ethnocratic regime. Ethnocracy is a type of political structure in which the State apparatus is controlled by a dominant ethnic group to further its interests, power and resources. Since the Sinhala Members formed the majority in Parliament from the time of Independence, the Sinhalese leaders have been scheming and planning against the Tamils to drive them initially out of the regions they had occupied in Sinhala majority areas during British times and now continue, by several ways, to take control of areas within the traditional homelands of the Tamils and drive out the locals bent on denting the erstwhile demographic ambience of the Tamil-speaking North and East. The idea seems to be to set up a monoethnic and religious structure in Sri Lanka so that the Sinhala Buddhists could control the entire country continuously. They forget that the North and the East are the historical homelands of the Tamils and the Sinhalese have no right to foist their hegemony over the Tamil-speaking majority in the North and East. The Tamil language has been spoken in the Island for over 3,000 years according to evidence unearthed in recent times. The Sinhala language came into use only about 1,400 years ago. Its first book of grammar, "Sidath Sangarawa", was brought out only in the 13th Century AD.

Normally, ethnocratic regimes indulge in genocide. It has been true in Sri Lanka, too, after Independence. I brought up the Genocide Resolution in the Northern Provincial Council on the 10th of February, 2015 when I was Chief Minister, Northern Province and it was unanimously adopted by the members. Probably in consequence of the passing of that Resolution, the successive ethnocratic regimes at the Centre in Sri Lanka, thereafter, decided no more provincial councils in this country.

From 2018 or so, there have been no provincial councils functioning in this country not only in the Tamil-speaking North and the East, but also in all other provinces. Now, a centralized Sinhala-majority Government governs the Tamil-majority North and East with the help of an occupied stationary military under a Unitary Constitution. Even though the majority in the seven southern provinces have been Sinhalese-speaking, the majority in the North and the East, from time immemorial, have been Tamil-speaking. The instrument of aggression in the North and the East, today, continues to be the military. Through the occupation of the North and the East by the military even 14 years after the

conclusion of the war, the Government of Sri Lanka continues its multi-pronged Sinhalization efforts in the North and the East through the use of State-aided Sinhala settlements,irrigation schemes, economic marginalization, land expropriation by Sri Lankan State bodies, Buddhistization and repression of memorialization of important Tamil events. When considered against the broader context of decades of State-driven demographic shifts, we find that the successive Sri Lankan Governments have been reengineering the demographics in the North and the East of Sri Lanka with clear political implications. The systematic and strategic alteration of the demographics in the North and the East is designed to destroy the Tamil concept of a homeland in the North and the East and permanently diminish Tamil democratic representation from the region.

The Budget Speech, the other day, was very openly centralized in its approach. Forgetting, deliberately or otherwise, that there was a Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution in place, the periphery was made subservient and asked to carry out the dictates of the Centre. In Proposal 58 of the English version of the Budget Speech, this is what is said, I quote:

I propose to consider Provincial Councils as special spending units for budgetary purposes. Accordingly, the Chief Secretaries of Provincial Councils should act as the Chief Accounting Officers, as practiced by Secretaries to other line ministries. The Provincial Council is responsible to the Parliament for the money spent for budget purposes.

When preparing the Budget based on the Sustainable Development Goals, the necessary guidelines have been issued to fulfill the above goals to all ministries, departments and institutions, and they should act in accordance with those guidelines.

Obviously, the idea seems to be to make the provincial administration a department of the Centre! Then, in Proposal 59, under the heading Provincial Revenue, the President says thus, I quote:

I propose that the revenue collected from the provincial councils should not be limited to cover recurrent expenses but should also be used as capital expenditure for the development of the province. However, in order to avoid the practical difficulties of suddenly changing the ongoing process, I propose to only use 50 per cent of the provincial council income from the year 2025 as recurrent expenses and to use the additional income as capital expenditure.

Clearly the Centre now wants to use the provincial administration to carry out its bidding. I do not know if the Finance Minister consulted the Finance Commission appointed under the Article 154R of the Constitution and obtained their consent before he prepared the above-said Proposal 59. Also, I doubt Provincial Council Elections will take place in the near future.

All the talk about power sharing with the provincial councils in the fields of agriculture, tourism and so on is simply decentralization by the Centre to get its programme implemented in the peripheral areas. The Government is not interested in power sharing; the

Government does not want to share power with the provinces, especially the Tamil-speaking provinces. The provinces would not be allowed to think or act outside the programme of work earmarked for the provinces by the Centre. This is where the ethnocratic thinking of the Centre would affect the North and the East, which are unlike the other seven provinces.

Under the heading Decentralized Budget, in Proposal 12 of the English version of the Budget Speech appears thus, I quote:

Due to the difficult situation in the country and the lack of funds under the decentralized budget programme in the past, regional development programmes could not be implemented. As these programmes were temporarily suspended, public representatives could not contribute to the rural development activities. We will recommence the decentralized budget programme. I will provide Rs. 11,250 million through the district coordination committees for this purpose. This programme will be implemented under the supervision of the Department of National Planning using a methodical and standard approach.

Under the decentralized budget, where monies were distributed to the Hon. Members of Parliament of the respective provinces, quite a large slice of the monies that were sent were returned back to the Government, unutilized. But, in the Northern Provincial Council, of which I was the Chief Minister, every cent was put to good use. The fact that the Budget Speech refers to District Coordination Committees and not to provincial councils lets the cat out of the bag: the Government does not want to conduct the Provincial Council Elections in the near future.

The Hon. President not so long ago, before he went abroad, promised to set up a committee to investigate into areas where the Centre had trespassed into the provincial arena. He promised to allow the committee to suggest draft statutes in areas where the provinces have been given exclusive or concurrent powers by the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. He has conveniently forgotten his obligation.

A President cum Finance Minister who is openly interested in using the provinces to play second fiddle to the Centre cannot be expected to either hold the Provincial Council Elections or the Local Government Elections in the near future or enhance the powers of the periphery.

The Budget has been a disappointment to the people of the North and the East, Sir.

Thank you.

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan) I am asking you, as the Chair now, are you maintaining the Quorum or dismissing that?

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) With regard to the Quorum, there has been a decision by the Parliamentary Business Committee.

[3.44 p.m.]

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan) Okay. That, you have to announce. There are only two Members in the Opposition side and one just finished speaking and he will leave the Chamber. Normally, that is what happens. Then, there will be only one Member left, who is due to speak. So what are we doing here? The Opposition and the ruling party are supposed to debate, agree and discuss national events and nationally important issues. . . . ? . . ? .

and I will say that in English: "I say that in the long years to come not only will the people of this island but of the world, wherever the bird of freedom chirps in human hearts, look back to what we have done and they will say 'do not despair, do not yield to violence and tyranny, march straight forward' " That is our destiny. Who said those words? Sir Winston Churchill said that on 08th May, 1945 when Germany unconditionally surrendered to democracy.

Today, before a House empty of the Opposition and the ruling party, we are debating the future of this country. What are we debating? We are debating how a farmer in Mirissa, a farmer in Mullaitivu, a fisherman in Hambantota and a chena cultivator from Batticaloa can live together and rebuild this nation. Fundamental economics have to be readjusted. I will not talk about education now as it will be discussed on the 05th of December, 2023 and I invite the Opposition Members to participate in that.

Then, I want to defuse and reject some of the things that the Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran uttered in this House. The first half of his speech was complete bunkum. He brought upon a theory of ethnocentrism. Who has ethnocentric ideas? Who try to divide this country on the basis of language and ethnicity? I was the Governor soon after him, ruling that same province. I ask him to come for a debate. He ran away when I asked him to stay back. I respected him all these times for his learned legal understanding, but when it comes to politics, I would say, let us debate because I am a student of political science. I

was the Governor in the Northern Province soon after him. People in the Northern Province will talk about it.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is up. Please wind up now.

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan) I know. Hon. Presiding Member, I am not quarrelling with you. Yes, time is up, not for me, but for this nation; time is up for this State!
