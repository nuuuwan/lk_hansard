F/03/2023 PRIVILEGE: LETTER NO. F/03/2023 ISSUED BY

CHAIRMAN OF ELECTION COMMISSION

) ( - ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe - State Minister of Finance) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I request your permission to raise a Question regarding breach of Privileges of the Hon. Members of Parliament.

549 550

As you are aware, the Hon. Premnath C. Dolawatte raised a Question of Privilege in Parliament regarding the Interim Order on Case No. SC/FRA/69/2023.

The letter bearing No. F/03/2023 dated 08 March, 2023 submitted by the Chairman of the Election Commission on the same subject to the Hon. Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies has further breached the Privileges of the Hon. Members of this House. The Hon. Speaker has accepted the Question of breach of Privileges raised by Hon. Premnath C. Dolawatte and presented it to the Committee on Ethics and Privileges. It is a serious offence to implement the Interim Order of the aforesaid case before hearing the said matter and making a decision at the Committee.

Tabling* the letter of the Chairman of the Election Commission, I request the Hon Deputy Speaker to refer this matter, too, to the Committee on Ethics and Privileges to conduct an inquiry. Further, raising this Privilege matter, I request the Hon. Deputy Speaker to advise all relevant authorities not to proceed further or take any action on the said matter until the Committee on Ethics and Privileges concludes its inquiry.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Jeevan Thondaman) Okay, I will take your word for it. . " ; '' ; ; " . . . , , ? .

Hon. Presiding Member, I would like to say just one last thing in terms of food security and self-sufficiency. For decades, those terms were thrown about without any substance as to how to achieve them. Food security is not achieved by producing every food item you need and self-sufficiency is also not achieved by producing every good you want to consume. We have noticed that there is always a comparison between Sri Lanka and Singapore, that we need to make Sri Lanka a Singapore and whatnot. I would like to remind everyone that, today, Singapore is ranked number one in the world for food security, but it produces no food of its own. Singapore is also the biggest exporter of oil, and yet, they do not produce any oil of their own. So, the lesson we have to take from that is, how to use the resources we have rather than trying to portray a picture that is not true.

Because I am short of time, I would like to say just this. We have to understand that Sri Lanka is a country filled with a diverse group of people; there are people from different sections of society in different parts of the country who speak different languages, worship different gods, who have different sexual orientations and whatnot. But, at the end of the day, they all are protected by the Constitution of Sri Lanka, which is why the President and the Cabinet have proposed the Gender Equality and Womens Empowerment Bill, through which a lot of diverse changes would be seen across the board because given the current situation, we are not in a position to leave anyone behind.

Also, there is one more thing that needs to be noted. Despite all the issues that are faced right now, we cannot dive into anarchy. Diving into anarchy, the main factors promoted are discrimination, racism and hatred.

However, I would like to ask the cooperation of all the Members in this House, including the Opposition even though they choose not to give it.

Once again, I would like to thank you for the opportunity given.

Today, we have also been talking about the postponement of the Local Authorities Election. We know that the Election Commission has already announced that the election should be held on the 25th of April. It should have been before the 19th of March, but there have been several attempts by this Government to postpone it and the latest one was to say that there was not enough funding or money for the election. The Election Commission had asked for only Rs. 4.5 billion. The Governments expenditure per day, I repeat, per day, is about three times that. When the Special Commodity Levy on the import of sugar was reduced, in just a few weeks, the loss of revenue for the Government, according to the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, was Rs. 15.9 billion! But, only Rs. 4.5 billion is required for this election. Therefore, I am saying this is really an affront.

Now, the latest trick that has been pulled is, we had the Hon. Premnath C. Dolawatte, Member of Parliament, coming and saying, I wish to bring to your notice a breach of Powers and Privileges of Parliament arising from the Interim Order made on Friday, 03rd March, 2023, in the Supreme Court Case SC (FR) Application

649 650

No. 69/2023. It was really shocking that the Hon. Dolawatta could bring this up in Parliament and say that it is a breach of Privilege! It is absolutely shocking that such things could actually happen!

Constitutionalism requires a legal and political culture and durable institutions. The legal fraternity in Sri Lanka needs to fulfil its obligations while those of us, the elected Members of Parliament, should look at building the political culture and ensuring a democratic culture. In South Asia, including in Sri Lanka, the strength and vibrancy of institutions such as the party system, the bureaucracy, the Judiciary and the media are partly the result of the long experience with universal adult franchise and a competitive political process. Sri Lanka has inherited those. Those are our strength. Notwithstanding the periodic challenges in Asia - we have had insurrections, coups d'tat or subversion of constitutional values and sometimes, the ruling elite actually interfering with the constitutional process - because our institutions are strong, we have stood up to those. Even in Pakistan and Bangladesh, where there has been a break in constitutional continuity, somehow or other, those values have prevailed.

Furthermore, civil society participation through human rights groups and social action organizations, journalists and lawyers has also helped that process.

I want to say that the civil society participation is legitimate in a democracy. Therefore, we must remember that constitutional innovation is no longer the sole monopoly of law professionals or party leaders and everyone, including the President and the Prime Minister, should recognize that. The civil society also has an expanding role on the frontiers of fundamental rights.

Finally in closing, I would say even to our friendly countries who uphold the principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, you must look beyond individuals and the fear of geopolitical pressures to ensure that values of individual and fundamental rights are upheld. If not, Sri Lanka would deteriorate into a conflict, which we have seen happening every 20 to 25 years, and we need to avoid that. Therefore, elections must be held on time and it is not the prerogative of the Executive to decide that and the Judiciary has every right to say what it has to say. Do not try to make a conflict between Parliament and the Judiciary.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . . 99 .

[4.15 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) Hon. Presiding Member, we are in a very dangerous situation in this country in terms of democracy. As Lord Henry John Temple's famous quote states, in politics, there are no permanent friends or permanent enemies, but only permanent interests. Sir, this Parliament is a prime example of that. If Lord Henry John Temple was alive today, he would probably do a case study on how politicians and political parties behave when they are at a crucial juncture in terms of maintaining or obtaining power, which leads me to another quote that states, Power tends to corrupt; absolute power corrupts absolutely.

Sir, I started my speech by saying that we are in a very dangerous situation in this country. So, we need to hold elections. This Debate, for these two days, has been conducted with the Hon. Members of the Opposition and the Government joining in and expressing their ideas and with the Opposition trying to convince the Government to hold the Local Government Election, which should have been conducted a year ago. It was last year that the election for the Pradeshiya Sabhas, urban councils and municipal councils should have been held. But, the Government used its power and postponed the election by one year, maybe, rightly so, using the Constitution and the powers that are vested with the Minister. And, it would have been before yesterday that that election should have been held. But, we did not hold the election, much to the relief of the Government MPs and Ministers. So, like I said, it is a very dangerous situation to be in. For the first time in the history of this country, one of the fundamental rights of the people, the right to vote or cast their franchise, has been subverted. There is a conspiracy by the Government not to hold this election.

Sir, this country has faced many a hard time in the past, starting from 1970/71, where the JVP had a near coup d'tat in this country and thousands of people were killed, but elections were held. In 1974, again we faced such a situation and in 1977, because the Government failed to hold elections at the right time, the United National Party swept to power obtaining more than a two-thirds majority.

Sir, I urge the Government, at this moment in time, to hold the elections that are due. Let people express their views. The Election for the Pradeshiya Sabhas, urban councils and the municipal councils has to be held. I remind this House that we should have had the elections for the provincial councils, too, five years ago; the Provincial Council Elections were also not held. I am not here to point a finger and say that the Goverment at that time did not conduct them. Whatever the excuse was, from the three tiers of elected institutions in this country, two have not had elections for the last so many years. Therefore, Sir, we must conduct those elections.

We saw today another attempt by a Government Minister to postpone the election, using the Privileges of

the House and the MPs and saying that the Supreme Court has violated the Privileges of this House. Again, that is a very dangerous path this Government has taken.

I urge the House to work together. I am one Member of Parliament who, from 2021, has urged this House to work together.

The Government and the Opposition have to work together in these crises - the economic crisis, the social crisis and the political crisis; we have to work together. But, unfortunately, Sir, that plea has not been heeded to in this House. We still play politics and as a consequence of the politics we are playing, the people of this country suffer.

Now, I will wind up because my time is up. Sir, I remind this House of what happened in the late 2010 when there came up the Arab Spring, of what happened in Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Syria and Bahrain. Gaddafi was chased off; Hosni Mubarak was chased off. Then, the Arab Spring spread to Morocco and other countries also. First, the people of Tunisia wanted democracy; they wanted a change. So, I urge the Government once again, please conduct this election and let the peoples voice be heard, let democracy prevail and whatever the outcome is, let this country move forward, let this country heal. We would support the economic proposal put forward by the Hon. President because, the people of this country know, we, too, support the IMF initiative.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) Because the time is up, I will wind up now. Thank you for the time given, Sir.

I once again urge the Government and the Hon. President to hold the election and settle this issue, once and for all.

The Committee has further stated that any effort to take away the rights and the voice of the people of Sri Lanka is undeniably undemocratic and a direct violation of Sri Lankans rights.

[4.36 p.m.] ) ) ( () - ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Suren Raghavan - State Minister of Higher Education) Hon. Presiding Member, it is indeed with deeply complexed and compounded feelings that I stand up to address this august but almost empty House, I suppose because we are debating on democracy or the nuances of deepening democracy in this country.

Speaking in English, he was saying that we live in a dangerous time. Yes, we live in a dangerous time, I agree with you, because we are divided, because you do not agree with the Government and because we do not have a common agenda for Sri Lanka. That is why this is the most dangerous time to live in, Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake. Therefore, I tell you, come, I am willing to give the portfolio of State Minister of Higher Education to you, if you want a portfolio. Come back, I am willing to become an MP again. This is not a game of power; this is about our collective effort for the future of Sri Lanka.

Therefore, I would urge and even beg anybody who believes in democracy, particularly, those who think that they are "buddhimath" to join us in this effort.
