. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Speaker, I seek a clarification. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Sumanthiran?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir.

Hon. Minister, is there a way out by delaying the effective date of those Regulations? From the interaction I have had with the students, I learnt that all they are saying is, Give us a little more time. They also realize, as even the Venerable Thero who asked the Question conceded, that Medicine and some other subjects are taught in English. It goes more for Law because 85 to 95 per cent of our law is only in English. And, as you said, it creates a division between lawyers who are proficient in English and those who are not, and those who are not proficient in English are not able to really practise because almost the entire body of law is in English. Even on the Statues we have in Sinhala and Tamil, the interpretations given by the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal and those reports are only in English. So, it is very difficult for anybody to practise.

My question is, is it possible, when you bring these Regulations, to delay the effective date and then, find some way of increasing the proficiency of English particularly for those who practise law?

Thank you. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) Hon. Speaker, I appreciate the suggestion made by the Hon. Member and I also hold the same view. In fact, I have written two letters to the Chairman of the Council of Legal Education proposing to delay the implementation of these rules for a period of three years. I believe, Sir, that that is the most practical way of resolving this issue without going for a confrontation. Even this morning, I made a request to the honourable Chief Justice, the Chairman of the Council of Legal Education, explaining that that would be the easiest way of resolving this issue without having debates and going for a confrontation because any debate or confrontation is not good for the Council of Legal Education, the Sri Lanka Law College or for the legal profession. So, I will make another attempt to resolve it as the Hon. Member suggested.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam. You have nine minutes.

[1.33 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, we are debating todays Notification and Regulations at a time when the country has seen an unprecedented economic calamity, where the country has been pauperized and the people have lost all their savings. In that backdrop, the Government is forced to negotiate with its lenders as well as the IMF in order to try and reach agreements to bring the country out of this mess.

Under these circumstances, Sir, the President has also taken great pains to project an image where he, as the President, is also a unifying force. He has been trying to project that image by announcing, during the last Budget

267 268

Debate and thereafter, that he is also going to take on reconciliation, whereby the problems of all ethnic nationalities - the Tamils, the Muslims, the upcountry Tamils - and groups who have had grievances with regard to the way this State has been formed over the last 70-odd years would be resolved. In that spirit, he called upon an All-Party Conference and been projecting this image of being a peacemaker. So, whilst this image of peacemaking is being projected, Sir, there is also the complete opposite happening on the ground, and I want to give you three current examples of how theTamil people in the North and the East are having their existence and their identity destroyed whilst the President goes out and gives this image that he wants to solve the long-standing ethnic conflict.

My Colleague, the Hon. Selvarajah Kajendren, and I have been getting reports, Sir, that an archaeological site that was identified way back in 1933 under the British was being "rebuilt". When those complaints came, we went to the particular area and checked. As we suspected, the military, with the officers of the Department of Archaeology, was doing something in a clandestine way. The matter was taken before court and court ruled that that site must be preserved, must not be touched and no building must be done. So, there is a court Order. Despite that, Sir, just last week, when my Hon. Friend and I visited the site, a totally new Buddhist vihara has been built there. In 1933, Kurunthurmalai was first identified as an archaeological reserve. That is exactly how it was named, an "archaeological reserve"; almost 77 acres were identified as "an archaeological reserve". Then in October, 2020, we had a letter by the Department of Archaeology, asking the Survey Department to go and measure that site and during the months of November and December, 2020, for the first time, the Survey Department goes to that area and carries out a survey. After the survey, the surveyor, for the first time, identifies that site as the site of Kurundi Viharaya, a surveyor, not the Department of Archaeology. He writes that back to the Department of Archaeology. The Department had not sent people to come and have a dig so as to find out, in fact, what that archaeological reserve is. Before the Department of Archaeology can even commence its work, the Survey Department has the expertise to identify that as Kurundi Viharaya.

Ever since then, Sir, the identity of that place has been called into question. We have gone before court, we have got a court Order preventing anything being built there and despite that, we now have a new Buddhist viharaya in an ancient worship site the Tamils have been worshipping for centuries. Our problem is not that, if, in fact, it was a Buddhist ancient site, it should not be recognized as such. We believe that there were also Tamils who were Buddhists; it is part of our own history. So, if that was, in fact, an ancient Buddhist worship site, it must be protected. But, where there are no Buddhists, instead of maintaining it as an archaeological site, to build a Buddhist viharaya is very clearly having very sinister motives of colonizing that area. That is one example, Sir, which is in Mullaitivu.

A second example, Sir, is regarding the livestock grazing lands in Batticaloa, the district adjoining yours, where in Mayilathamadu and Mathavanai, thousands of acres of lands had been identified as grazing lands by the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government in 2010 through a Cabinet Paper and that Cabinet Paper had been approved. In fact, the last time I spoke about this, when this matter first cropped up, I gave the particulars of the Cabinet Paper that was approved. Now, what has been happening is that the Maduru Oya Right Bank Development Scheme is underway and for the development of the Right Bank, that entire grazing area of the Batticaloa District, which the Tamil and Muslim people used, is being ethnically cleansed. People from the Polonnaruwa District are being brought over to do corn cultivation as the first round and now, with the Maduru Oya Right Bank Development Scheme, those Tamil and Muslim people have been asked to leave; they are being threatened. So, when they use forest areas to graze their livestock, the Forest Department arrests them and files cases against them simply because they are allowing their livestock to graze in those areas. Those people there are becoming disenfranchised and are forced to leave their existence at a time when people are finding it impossible to make ends meet. So, this is the sort of racist policies that are being pursued at a time when the President is trying to project to the whole world that he is a peacemaker.

Finally, I want to conclude by referring to something that is going on in the Jaffna District. The fishermen of the Jaffna District in the North are again under assault. Why? First, it was over sea cucumber farming. The Fisheries Minister has handed over sea cucumber farming licences to his cronies; nobody knows who they are. One such person has two, three fields of sea cucumber farming in the sea, in the lagoon and by doing so, Sir, the local fishermen are completely disenfranchised; they are unable to do their fishing. This same process of pauperizing the fishermen, who already have been suffering due to the war, where they had bans on fishing for 30-odd years, is happening in a different way, where the same Minister is now proposing foreigners to come into the Northern and the Eastern Waters and fish. The proposal is to allow them three times a week, to start off with, to come and fish. We condemn this!

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. Please wind up. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) If you look at the pattern, Sir, it is attacking the very existence of those people. All of this, first, goes towards their identity and then, towards their economy. Disenfranchisement is a process by which this Government proposes to ethnically cleanse those areas so that they could carry out their racist colonization project.

So, it is in this backdrop, Sir, that this country goes with a begging bowl asking for money from the international community. The foreign countries and

269 270

entities which are hoping to help Sri Lanka must make it a condition that the monies and the help they give to get this country out of this mess is not used to pursue what is very clearly a racist agenda. Thank you, Sir.

We have, at least now, managed to get the green light from the IMF and that is due to a lot of sacrifices. We all, everyone in this country - every woman, every child, every man, every religious person and every ethnic group - have sacrificed to get the green light and help from the IMF. But, I have to very clearly say that it does not mean that just because we get money from the IMF, the country is going to be okay. The country is not going to be okay, if we are going to do the same mistakes over and over again without curbing corruption and abuse. Therefore, we have to stop corruption, abuse, cheating and mismanagement and have to change this system. This is a punishment as well as a good lesson for Sri Lanka. We have never been in this sort of situation for the last 75 years; we have never been a bankrupt nation. But, for some reasons, we have to face this situation and we know what those reasons are: obviously, bad management and bad decision-making.

There is no national policy on any sector in this country. Especially when it comes to the economy, there is no national policy, which is a must. So, at least now, we have to change this system. This is what we are watching being demanded by the people on the streets; people on the streets are asking for a system change. That is what happened on the 09th of May, 2022. It was a system change that they wanted; they did not want an election. No one on the streets was asking for a local government election and the country is also not ready to pay another 8,711 local government members an allowance, a salary or wage. The taxpayer of this country cannot afford it. So, this has to come to an end and a change has to be made. We all have to get together and make that change.

271 272

We are one nation, it does not matter who we are or to which party, which colour, which religion or which ethnic group we belong. It is time that we all get together and rebuild this country. At the moment - this country was on its knees - however, the Hon. President has managed to get it on one foot and we need to get it on both its feet; again, we have to get back on our feet.

This year is a very important year for Sri Lanka because Sri Lanka, as a bankrupt country, needs to regain what it lost. We need to give the people of this country what they need. They do not need taxes; they do not want to stand in queues anymore and we need to supply them with electricity constantly as a Government. To fulfil all these, we need to, first, get on our feet again. We got a green light from the IMF today, that they are willing to help us to get on our feet. However, if we sabotage all those efforts by getting on to the streets and protesting for no reason, then, we are going to be a nation which would be in a sorry state and which is never going to stand on its feet. That is why I urge everyone in this House to, putting aside our differences and party politics, get together and start rebuilding this nation. We should become a proud nation again and it is possible; there is nothing impossible. If there is a will, there is always a way to make sure that we get on our feet again.

2022 Special GST - Special Goods and Services Tax - . . , . , Special GST . . , , . . , , . . .

Sir, today, I have basically presented amendments to two Acts: one is, the Special Commodity Levy Act and the other is, the Value Added Tax Act. Those two taxes are at the sole discretion of the Minister of Finance; he does not even need Cabinet approval to adjust them. He can just decide to reduce them. The most recent adjustment was in October, 2020 when the Special Commodity Levy on sugar was at Rs. 50 per kilogramme and in one night, he reduced it to 25 cents. In one night! And, the loss due to that, according to the Secretary to the Treasury who was called to Parliament just three-and-a-half months later, in February, 2021 and questioned, was Rs. 15.9 billion. If you take the loss up to December, 2021, it would come up to Rs. 59 billion! What a huge sum of money! We are arguing whether the Government has Rs. 4.5 billion to spend on the local government election. What kind of crap are we talking about the finances needed? So, that is what he had done.

In 2022, the Government tried to introduce a Special Goods and Services Tax - GST - Bill. They brought it to Parliament and we went to the Supreme Court. The Court said, You cannot do this. I will conclude my speech by quoting from the Determination of the Supreme Court very quickly.

Thus, by empowering the Minister in the manner provided in clauses 2 and 3, the Parliament distinctively and manifestly loses control over public finance and unconstitutionally alienates such power to the Minister. In the circumstances, this Court holds that clauses 2,3 and 4 individually and collectively amount to an infringement of Article 148 of the Constitution read with Article 76, and by virtue of such infringement violates Article 4 read with Article 3 of the Constitution.

So, that was completely against the Constitution. Therefore, I am saying that the SCL and the VAT must be amended so that Parliament decides when to increase or reduce taxes.

Thank you, Sir, for the time given. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . You have eleven minutes.

[2.55 p.m] () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) First of all, let me wish all ladies a happy Womens Day! Of course, many things were said about the way in which this country treats its women. I agree, there needs to be greater recognition of women of all strata of society and I think we all should get together to improve their situation, get more women into the workforce and their maximum participation in this countrys development.

Today, a bunch of Regulations is to be approved. I just want to mention that some of them have been brought under the Colombo Port City Economic Commission Act, on which we all worked together. I would like to recognize CodeGen Innovations as the very first company to have registered at the Colombo Port City Economic Zone, which is a creditable. I congratulate Dr. Harsha Subasinghe and his entire team for having taken that bold step. Harsha and I had multiple conversations over the last so many years about the frustration spread not just in his company but in the fields where professionals work. The high income taxes charged are something that a lot of companies which export services, software and so on are complaining about. I asked him once, What is the starting salary of a software engineer? He said that it is somewhere between US Dollars 800 to 1,200 per month. Even if you start, let us say, at US Dollars 1,000, you will earn Rs. 350,000 a month and at Rs. 308,000, the highest margin of the tax bracket, you are already hammered 36 per cent. Even with such a situation, instead of moving companies out, I think what companies like CodeGen Innovations have shown is that there are ways, alternate solutions within Sri Lankas jurisdiction. So, I wish more entrepreneurs and businessmen would think about Port City as an alternate location for their headquarters to be established so that they could perhaps enjoy whatever tax arbitrage they could get legally.

What we really need to do is to create an economy that is adding more value than it is now.

Moving on to innovations, I heard many Members of Parliament who spoke today talking about lack of

291 292

investments. I heard the Hon. Dilum Amunugama, who is in charge of the BOI and the Port City, saying, "Look, we need to bring in investors and make it easier for them to operate". That is true, but it does not just happen; speaking in Parliament does not mean that investors are going to come in. You need to really look at the nuts and bolts, where the legal and regulatory blocks are and how you are going to change policy.

Sir, one must realize that in the last 30 years or so, Sri Lanka has actually become a much closed economy than it was earlier. With President Ranasinghe Premadasa's apparel factories programme which had momentum up to about 1999, Sri Lanka's trade openness index was around 80, which went up from about 40 prior to the first economic liberalization in 1977. How we measure trade openness, Sir, is, we add imports and exports and divide it by Gross National Product. That gives you an index number. It would get higher and higher, if you are more open. But, what has happened since around 1999 or 2000 is that this index number has fallen again from 80, actually 89, to around 40. So, without any political prejudice, if you take it as a measure and look at the trade openness of this country, you would see that actually ours is one of the more closed countries in the world currently because that index is back to about 40. So, you need to import and export because this country's long-term growth is going to depend upon how open we become. We have to open our minds; we have to open our borders; we have to break down the walls and build bridges because, otherwise, we will never be able to get out of this balance of payment crisis.

I heard the Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka saying a little while ago that the imports have basically shrunk and that is the reason why there is a surplus in the trade account. He is absolutely right. Actually, what is happening is, by forcing imports to be restricted by way of regulations and also particularly by increasing interest rates, you have crushed demand. What has happened is, the economy has shrunk and it is continuing to shrink. In a shrinking economy, companies are closing down, jobs are being lost and unemployment is increasing. You can be a little optimistic that things have gotten a little better. I am not denying the fact that things have gotten a little better, but that does not necessarily mean that this is a solution for the medium to long-term. Sir, in order to create jobs in this country and to increase exports, we also have to open our imports. So, closing imports and opening exports is not a realistic solution because they are both two sides of the same coin.

Today, the IMF agreement seems to be pretty much finalized with statement from Ms. Kristalina Georgieva to the effect "We are pleased. We are happy for the people of Sri Lanka." I just noted down the dates on which we urged the then Government to go to the IMF; first, on 18th November, 2020 and then on 10th December, 2020, 27th February, 2021, 23rd June, 2021, 21st September, 2021, and on 11th December, 2021, we urged them to go to the IMF. But, they did not, that is another story, and if they did, probably, they would still be in office, their homes

would still be standing and this calamity would not have occurred. That is bygone and I do not want to go into that. But, I am glad that finally sense has prevailed and currently, we are trying to negotiate this Extended Fund Facility. Anyway, I must warn you that this is only the first step. If we think that all the problems are now resolved and we all can bask in that glory, that is not going to be the case because this is the first hurdle and the next and the more important one is to get debt restructuring done. Debt restructuring is a complicated thing and that is where all the reforms need to be undertaken. I heard the Hon. President saying yesterday, "Look, you know we have to pay six billion dollars a year in loans and we cannot pay it if this deal falls through. Then, I am not responsible but you people will be because I am going to bring it to Parliament and get you to agree or disagree." So, it is either my way or the highway.

I disagree with the Hon. President. I would tell him, No, Sir, you should not do it like that because we do not know what is in that Agreement. The best option, I think, that is available to you is to, at least now, table that document . Now that you have got the Agreement, table it. Ideally, the place this conversation or discussion should have taken place is at the Committee on Public Finance. I do not want to go into that matter; what happened to that is not something I want to talk about today. Nevertheless, through the Committee on Public Finance there must be a real robust debate on that. Questions must be asked. When we asked about the tax revisions at the Committee, that is not because we were anti-Government or because we were going to sabotage this countrys economy, but because we are also elected Members of Parliament representing thousands and millions of people and that since it is their prerogative to ask those questions, it is our responsibility, on behalf of them, to ask those questions. Therefore, do not take it in the wrong way. And, there must be a robust debate on that Agreement because unless we are able to continue with the reforms, we may not end up where we expect to go.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) I will finish in a minute, Sir.

I just want to take one example, Zambia. In July of last year, Kristalina Georgieva tweeted that she was very happy and pleased that the Chinese have agreed on financial assurances to Zambia, just like she did today with regard to Sri Lanka. But today, still, Zambia has not been able to crack the debt restructuring deal. That is because there has not been an agreement as to what kind of restructuring needs to happen, whether there is going to be a haircut, a Net Present Value Reduction or some sort of re-profiling. So, it is not very easy. Also, in the same breath, one must ask, What are the International

293 294

[ ()

2023 08

Sovereign Bond Holders asking about?" Are they asking about a domestic debt restructure or not? So, these are complex questions that should not be taken up in a "take it or leave it" context. The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe, the much respected Colleague of ours, is here and I want to tell you, Hon. Semasinghe, do not do it like the way you are planning to, perhaps in a "take it or leave it" or "have it my way or the highway" context. You said, "Wait till we sign the Agreement and then, we will have a discussion". So, I urge you to do that. - [Interruption.] I am finishing up, Hon. Semasinghe, and then, you can reply. So, I urge you to have a discussion on that.

We are for the people of this country; we are not trying to sabotage this effort and we are pleased that you are finally working out a programme with the IMF. We did tell you to do so earlier. That is another matter. But, let us work together to resolve all these matters on behalf of the people of Sri Lanka.

Thank you very much. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe - State Minister of Finance) On what you commented, Hon. Member, I would like to say that we have not told anybody to take it or leave it; that is not the policy of the Government. We will negotiate. Of course, you know what debt treatment is. With regard to the point you brought up on restructuring, I would like to say that, of course, our advisers are in the process of negotiating with all our creditors and we have promised that we will be very transparent and everybody will get equal treatment. So, we will continue with our policy and once the IMF Board approves the Agreement, we will certainly table it and you can have a debate on that. But, before that, we have explained, we are not in a position to table the Staff-level Agreement because there are changes still being made. Once all those changes take place and once the Board approves it, we will certainly table it in Parliament and we can have a debate on that. We will make sure that not only for the 48-month period, but even beyond that, how we are going to go forward is explained.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) With your permission, Sir, I seek a clarification. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Only if the Hon. State Minister wishes a reply. ( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) Go ahead, Hon. Member. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Thank you.

Hon. State Minister, what I am asking is, are you saying that there is still room to debate and negotiate with the Opposition and the people on the streets, perhaps, on taxes? Is there room or are you saying that it has been finalized? That is why I said, take it or leave it.

( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) It is very clear that we are not in a position to make any adjustments right now. First of all, we have to get the economy back on track and make sure that it stabilizes.

So, until the economy stabilizes, no changes will be entertained; we cannot entertain any changes just because a certain category of people take to the streets. Because of that, we can neither jeopardize the entire economy of Sri Lanka nor disturb this negotiation process. You should appreciate the fact that Sri Lanka is now well recognized globally; we have put our house in order and that is being appreciated and recognized. So, we are not in a position to do any adjustments right now until the economy stabilizes. Therefore, all the citizens have to get together and make sure that we support each other to stabilize the economy. Once the economy is stabilized, we can debate, discuss, propose any other ideas to the IMF, consult them and make sure that we have this transparent process going on. - [Interruption]

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes, Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan?

() ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Suren Raghavan - State Minister of Higher Education) Sir, I just want to reiterate what the Hon. State Minister said. To my learned Friend on the Opposition side, I would like to say that Zimbabwe is a good example, but we must understand why Zimbabwe is facing that situation today. That is exactly because the Opposition of Zimbabwe did not allow the country to go through that process and if you all are also going to bring about that same situation here, I would say very sympathetically to Mother Lanka -

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) I do not want this to go into a debate. Thank you very much.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. I just need ten seconds. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes, Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva?

295 296

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) I did not mean Zimbabwe; I meant Zambia. Zimbabwe and Zambia are two different countries. - [Interruption]

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Again, let us not go into a debate.

Next, the Hon. Nalin Fernando.

The world becomes a universal family in the truest sense of the word in situations where each others identities are understood, respected and permitted. The international community, whilst deploring the invasion and forcible occupation of Ukraine in the strongest possible terms, extends its fullest support to rise against such invasion and for the victory of the freedom struggle of the Ukrainian people.

However, a diametrically-opposed policy is evident today in regard to Palestine. For over a period of 70 years, the land of Palestine has been subject to barbaric military capture and suppression. People have been deprived of the right to self-rule as well as fundamental human rights. Today, Palestine is facing brutish expansionism which destroys lives, demolishes properties, spreads naked terror and forcibly occupies the land under a rule of racial bigotry.

Even the land recognized by the United Nations and the international community for an independent Palestine State is being forcibly occupied by the Zionist Israeli Government. The process of constructing unauthorized constructions and settlements therein by the occupier has gathered momentum, which goes hand in hand with brutal suppression. The latest to fall prey to the State-sponsored terror campaign of illegal settlers is the Huwara village. Bringing the whole process to a culmination, the Finance Minister of Israel claims that Huwara village should be wiped out from the world map. The United States and the European Union have condemned this statement.

The global community should exert pressure rather than confining itself to mere words to uphold the freedom and dignity of Palestinian people and exercising veto power against the implementation of decisions taken throughout history by the United Nations should come to an end.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, I expect the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs to answer the following Questions:

1. Does the Government of Sri Lanka, too, condemn these illegal, cruel processes in the same way these torturous acts, suppression and expansionism perpetrated by the right-wing administration of Israel and its allies have been condemned by world leaders?

2. Does the Government acknowledge that all the support towards the victory of the Palestine liberation struggle should be further extended to the fullest without diverting from the stand of Sri Lanka with historical commitment for the prolonged struggle of the Palestinians for freedom and the right to autonomy?

"Hashiloach" :

"The "two-state" model has led Israel to a dead end. It has brought a sense of despair of ending the conflict, and a turn to "managing" it as a cruel and eternal decree of fate. The alternative to this is a new readiness of Israeli society to win the conflict, rather than merely managing it- a victory founded on the understanding that there is no room in the Land of Israel for two conflicting national movements."

Hon. Deputy Speaker, Sri Lanka maintains a consistent policy on the Palestinian cause and extends unwavering support for Palestine in the multilateral fora. The President of Sri Lanka, on 24th November, 2022, in his message on the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People reaffirmed Sri Lanka's position and called on the international community and all parties concerned to make renewed efforts to achieve a lasting solution, including through an early implementation of the United Nations General Assembly Resolutions on a two-State solution based on the 1967 borders. Sir, I table* the President's Message as Annex I.

When I myself addressed the General Debate of the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly on 24th September, 2022 in New York, I reiterated Sri Lanka's long-standing position on the Palestinian issue, adding that Sri Lanka recognizes the legitimate security concerns of both Palestinian and Israeli people and urgent resolution of the matter on the basis of the UN Resolution on the attainment of the two-State solution.

Then, at the 51st Session of the Human Rights Council, under Item No.7 - the General Debate on the human rights situation in Palestine and other occupied Arab territories, Sri Lanka made a Statement on 30th

September, 2022, highlighting that the repetition of the cycle of violence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory can only be ended with a genuine political effort for a negotiated solution to end the conflict. Sir, I table** that statement as Annex II.

Sri Lanka reiterated its commitment to supporting a negotiated settlement in line with the internationally agreed parameters of two States living side by side on the basis of the 1967 borders, which is the key to achieve long-term security, peace and prosperity. We call all sides to refrain from rhetoric and provocative acts.

Sri Lanka believes that efforts should be redoubled to make peace a reality in the lives of the Palestinians and also for the betterment of the peace-loving Israelis, not the extremists. Until everyone is safe, no one will be safe. Therefore, disproportionate use of power and suppression of legitimate rights of any people or a community would only escalate further tension and create a situation where security of both Palestinians and Israelis are threatened with the possibility of escalating it to the other regions. Therefore, Sri Lanka urges all parties to act with restraint, respect human rights and act in a manner which advances humanity. The international community also has a huge responsibility in promoting the UN Resolutions without double standards and acting towards attaining long-lasting peace in the region on the basis of the Resolutions mentioned earlier: that is, the two-State solution based on the 1967 borders.

The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya, State Minister of Foreign Affairs, assured Sri Lankas unwavering support for the Palestinian cause to His Excellency Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian National Authority, during the Fifth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries held in Doha on the 6th of March, 2023.

Sir, may I now quote President Ranil Wickremesinghes Message on the 24th of November, 2022, on the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People.

On this auspicious occasion to commemorate the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, I reaffirm Sri Lankas steadfast solidarity with the Government and people of Palestine.

For more than seven decades, there has been a long struggle to find a just and peaceful solution to the situation in Palestine.

Sri Lanka while continuing to support the sovereign, independent State of Palestine, calls on the international community and all parties concerned to make renewed efforts to achieve a lasting solution, including through the early implementation of the United Nations General Assembly Resolutions on a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders.

On behalf of the Government and people of Sri Lanka, I take the opportunity on this felicitous instance, to extend sincere best wishes to the Government and people of Palestine.

In view of that, yes, we condemn the senseless acts of violence and disproportionate use of force. We will stand by the people of Palestine and will continue to stand with the Palestinian cause until a peaceful and a durable solution is achieved and Palestinian rights are attained.
