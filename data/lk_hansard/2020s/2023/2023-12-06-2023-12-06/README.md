PERSONAL EXPLANATION BY

HON. G.G. PONNAMBALAM

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I thank you, Hon. Speaker, for allotting me time to make a Personal Explanation under Standing Order No. 27(8) with regard to a Ministerial Statement made by the Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms on the 04th of December, 2023.

In the Ministerial Statement, Sir, he made references to a speech I had made the previous day during the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms, where I raised about the declaration of a moratorium on the Prevention of Terrorism Act way back in 2015 when the Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe himself was Minister of Justice. The Minister had gone to Geneva along with the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, the then Minister of Foreign Affairs, where they had made those commitments on behalf of the Sri Lankan Government to an international body and the international community, in general.

It is on that basis, Sir, my entire speech was made. When the Government itself has declared a moratorium on the implementation of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and stated that the commemorations of the dead LTTE members could happen, provided that the LTTE is not glorified and there is no political objective, the police have gone to the Magistrate's Courts in the North and the East on several occasions and sought bans on those commemoration events, and except for the Mutur Magistrate, all other Magistrates in the North and the East had allowed the commemoration to take place, provided that LTTE paraphernalia were not used. Despite that, the police had gone on to arrest ten individuals in Batticaloa including the Tamil National People's Front's organizer for Batticaloa, who did not even take part in the commemoration. He was not only prevented from taking part in the commemoration, but had also been arrested and they have all been detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

Sir, you know that under the PTA, there is no provision for bail. All of this happened not because they breached any law or did anything, but simply because the police was using the opportunity to file the matter under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. So, my entire speech was based on the fact that when the Government's policy is to maintain a moratorium on the Prevention of Terrorism Act and when the Government has, in fact, stated that people could commemorate their dead, for the police to act in this manner is completely wrong and that as the Minister responsible for announcing that moratorium, he must intervene. That was my speech. There was no personal reference to the Hon. Minister or a personal attack on anybody, but merely commenting on one of the policies declared by the Government and that it should be implemented.

Sir, the Hon. Minister had made that Ministerial Statement - actually, it was not a Ministerial Statement that he made, but, if at all, a matter of Privilege - with regard to an article that appeared in the "Sunday Times", which makes reference to the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of his Ministry and about the Hon. Sumanthiran's speech during that Discussion. He tried to correct whatever positions that the Hon. Sumanthiran had taken, which the newspaper had reported, and then, went on to pull my name into that Ministerial Statement. In a very derogatory way, he stated that I am a racist, that I make racist speeches in this House, that he knew my father, who was a famous lawyer, in his words, and was a progressive and that my

2547 2548

late grandfather, the late Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam, who was a former Member of the State Council as well as a famous lawyer, was a racist.

The proof of calling him a racist was apparently a speech made by the late Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam in Gampola where he was supposed to have made certain references to the Sinhala people, which were very demeaning, and that was the only example he points out for the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam being a racist. Then, he goes on to state, Sir, that G.G. Ponnambalam, who was a racist, had no problems in going against the Tamil People when it suited him and the example he points to is that under the D.S. Senanayake Government, in order for G.G. Ponnambalam to gain a ministerial portfolio, he supported, in his words, the Indo-Sri Lanka Citizenship Law, which effectively disenfranchised 690,000 up-country Tamil citizens of this country. Sir, the Hon. Minister of Justice clearly does not know the law because there is no "Indo-Sri Lanka Citizenship Act". There was the Ceylon Citizenship Act, No. 18 of 1948 and that was the Act which disenfranchised the up-country Tamils of this country. That Act, Sir, I have here with me and I table* it.

How it disenfranchised the up-country Tamils is that it laid conditions that every individual who wishes to gain citizenship of Ceylon have to go back two generations and show residency in order to gain that citizenship; those were the qualifications in order to gain citizenship. Naturally, the up-country Tamil community could not go back two generations in order to prove citizenship and as a result, they lost their citizenship.

Sir, when that Act was passed in 1948, the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam and the All Ceylon Tamil Congress were seated in the Opposition; they had not joined the Government. In fact, the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam voted against that Act; the Ceylon Citizenship Act, No. 18 of 1948, which disenfranchised the up-country Tamils, was voted against by my grandfather. Who says that, Sir? He was none other than my grandfathers arch-enemy, who was also a former Member and a Leader of the Opposition in this House, the Hon. A. Amirthalingam. On page 37 of a Chapter he had written in the 25th Silver Jubilee Publication of the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi - of the Federal Party - he says this, I quote:

" , .. . . .. . ... ."

That is what the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalams arch-enemy admits in his own words in the Chapter he wrote for the Federal Partys - Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kadchis - Silver Jubilee Publication, which I also table* before Parliament.

Sir, thereafter, the D.S. Senanayake Government requested the All Ceylon Tamil Congress to join it because they did not want that Government to be purely a Sinhala Government, and negotiations commenced.

One of the conditions that the All Ceylon Tamil Congress put forward for joining the Government was the repeal of Ceylon Citizenship Act and, in the course of those negotiations, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was also involved and eventually, Prime Minister D. S. Senanayake agreed to bring in a new Act - the Indian and Pakistani Residents (Citizenship) Act, No. 3 of 1949 - to give citizenship to the Up-country Tamils who had lost it by the previous Ceylon Citizenship Act. In the course of those negotiations to bring in the Act, the conditions were altered. The Government wished to bring in a condition to show consecutive residency of ten years in order to qualify for citizenship. But, through negotiations, it was brought down to a level with an individual having to show ten years and family members having to show seven years' residency. That, too, was negotiated. The Tamil parties and Jawaharlal Nehru wanted it brought down to five years for both categories, but Prime Minister D. S. Senanayake refused and Jawaharlal Nehru then advised all Tamil parties to support that law and make sure that that law was passed because at least 85 per cent of those up-country Tamils who had lost their citizenship would gain it. And, it was on that advice, Sir, that my late grandfather, the Hon. G. G. Ponnambalam, and the All Ceylon Tamil Congress voted for the second law - the Indian and Pakistani Residents (Citizenship) Act, No. 3 of 1949 - which, in fact, was brought to give them citizenship and which allowed the late Hon. Savumiamoorthy Thondamam also to become a Member of this House and gain citizenship of Sri Lanka. So, it is that law the All Ceylon Tamil Congress and the late Hon. G. G. Ponnambalam supported. So, Sir, the Minister of Justice has misled this House and I would go further to say that he has lied to this House about another former Member, who is not here and who is unable to defend himself.

Then, Sir, he goes on to state that my Colleague, the

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] is a murderer and has murdered thousands of people. This is not an ordinary person who is making these allegations, Sir; it is supposedly a responsible Minister and that, too, a Minister of Justice! At least, he has a duty to bring to this House the list of people the [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] is supposed to have murdered.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) If he has stopped, Sir, I might have been able to continue. But then, being a Member of this House is like casting pearls before swine to him.

Thereafter, Sir, you had a situation where the Hon. Minister makes these allegations. I am saying with utmost responsibility, Sir, that those are blatant untruths that he is making and that he should resign! He is not fit to be a Minister of Justice for being able to come to this House and make derogatory, defamatory and downright untruths, statement, against another Hon. Member without a Substantive Motion. At the very least, he should know what the Standing Orders are. Thereafter, Sir, he says that we had political motives to go to the Eastern Province, taking people in busloads to make commemorations in the Eastern Province. We never took busloads. I went to the East because I am a Member of Parliament and a leader of a political party. When the people in the East were terrified that when they go to commemorate they might get arrested and harassed, they asked me to come, like they have asked other Members of the other parties to come and help them, and it is on that basis, Sir, that I went.

Sir, then the Minister of Justice went on to show certain photographs. He had shown photographs of people wearing T-shirts with the LTTE leaders face on the front

and the LTTE symbol at the back and also certain other photographs. None of those photographs were taken in the East, Sir; they were taken in the North.

And, only one or two individuals were dressed in that way. In the course of my speech or in the course of the Hon. Sumanthirans speech, none of us spoke of or spoke against the investigations against those individuals. We spoke of the complete, en masse, harassment of the people who were given the green light to go and commemorate their dead. And, I told the Hon. Minister of Justice that we have no objections to those individuals, who were seen in the photographs, being investigated on, but asked him to not to do it under the PTA because the PTA is something that he himself has stated to the international community that they will observe a moratorium on. Now, he says, Sir, that because it is the law of the country, he cannot interfere. But, it was a decision made by him, as the Minister of Justice, to state to the international community that they will not implement that law.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member, please wind up.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I am winding up, Sir.

It is on that basis, Sir, that I made those references to him and stated that he must personally intervene. And, he says that the police must be allowed to do their job by themselves; the Attorney-General must be allowed to do his job by himself and the courts must be allowed to do their job by themselves without any interference and that as the Minister of Justice, he must not interfere. That,Sir, I am prepared to accept, if it was somebody else other than the Hon. Minister of Justice who said that because this same Minister of Justice, on the 27th of October, 2019, had given an interview to the Sunday Observer, which reported, I quote:

Rajapakshe claimed that as Justice Minister, he had actively involved himself in an investigation run by the Attorney-Generals Department, in order to prevent Gotabaya Rajapaksas arrest in the Avant Garde floating armoury case.

Hon. Speaker, he had given evidence before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on Political Victimization and he says this. I am quoting it, though it is a translation. He says, I acted fast and contacted the President, Prime Minister and the former IGP and pointed out to them that the move to arrest Gotabaya Rajapaksa should be stopped immediately. I told then it was also bad for the Government to resort to such action. The move was stopped.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member, you have taken five minutes more. Please wind up.

2551 2552

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, that is something he should not have done; that is interference. But, when the Government has taken a policy decision to declare a moratorium on the Prevention of Terrorism Act, not to direct the police to not act under that law is what is wrong and it is a derogation of his duty.

Thank you. , ( () - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC - Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms)

. . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) The Hon. Member just finished. Yes, Hon. Minister of Justice?

( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) I am thankful to you, Hon. Speaker, for the opportunity.

The other day, I made certain references to the speeches made by a few Members of Parliament including the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam, in which speech there were some references to the PTA. What he said is correct: when we formed our "Y ahapalana" Government in January, 2015, we declared a moratorium on the PTA - Prevention of Terrorism Act. Having declared a moratorium on the PTA, we said that we would replace it with a new law with much more humane features. We also considered amendments to certain Sections of the PTA, especially the one on admissibility of confession statements for the purpose of conviction without independent evidence. Thereafter, we drafted a new law - the Counter Terrorism Bill. It was presented to Parliament. and some parties challenged that in the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court gave its Determination.

At a time when it was about to be passed, what happed was, on the 25th of April, 2019, the Easter Sunday attack took place. In a situation like that - whether it be this Government or that Government or this President or that President is immaterial - where there was terrorist activity, they had to protect the people and the country. So, that Government re-enforced that law. Still, investigations are going on against some people. Over 80 people have been accused and there are 42 indictments in High Courts regarding the Easter Sunday attack.

In the meantime, we drafted a new law just to replace the PTA and it was gazetted. Then, there were so many requests made by many parties - organizations, political parties and the international community - regarding certain provisions of the Bill. Then, we, as a democratic Government, withdrew it; we agreed to redraft it after taking into consideration all their views. Then, we redrafted it. Sir, before that new Bill was gazetted, I published it in all the newspapers so that anyone who was interested in making any representations regarding it could do so. I allocated three days for it, but none of you all made any representations. We gave an opportunity to the whole world, but who took that opportunity? Sir, there were only four groups who made representations. One group consisted of students of law faculties of the universities and there were two other NGOs and a trade union. Thereafter, we had a lengthy dialogue with the diplomatic corps - the Ambassadors and High Commissioners. All those agreed that we have incorporated the relevant provisions. What is wrong with it?

But, my question, Hon. Ponnambalam, was much more than what you explained. The Hon. Sumanthiran is the one who always advocated that the PTA should be abolished completely. But, by that Hon. Member who is asking not to implement the PTA and to abolish that in toto, there was a complaint that a group attempted to kill him on a contract. So, those five people were arrested under the PTA and had been detained for a long period.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Minister, would you wind up, please? ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) I am winding up, Sir.

So, why did we do that? One of our Hon. Members of Parliament was to be killed on a contract. Because of the skill of our intelligence services and the Army, the killing of your Colleague and my Colleague, the Hon. Sumanthiran, was prevented. Now, there are five accused, a case of prosecution, evidence is being led and the High Court is hearing the case. When there is an attempt on your life or your community, you say that we should implement the PTA, but if criminals or terrorists kill other innocent people, that we should not implement it. Sir, can you accept that position? Can that be accepted by Parliament? Can that be accepted by courts? Sir, I agree that we all are human beings. So, even if it is a terrorist who had been killed, his kith and kin have a right to commemorate him; nobody is opposing it. But, when they use the names of prohibited terrorist organizations -

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Shall we take this up on another day?

2553 2554

2023 06

( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) Give me only one more minute, Sir.

When they were doing that with symbols of a prohibited terrorist organization and their flags, the police had acted upon it. What can I do? I do not give any directions. Nobody should give any directions; that is the duty of the police. Of course, if they have done something wrong, certainly, we will attend to that.

Thank you very much, Sir.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) . . rose.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member, please! We should not get into a debate now.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Give me just one minute. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I have given you enough time. - [Interruption.] The Hon. Rishad Bathiudeen is waiting for his turn to raise a Personal Explanation. Take only one minute and finish it off.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Minister, even on that day when I spoke on the Votes of your Ministry, I made it very clear, that if there is a calamity or a major attack that has taken place, which justifies the use of the PTA despite its draconian nature, that is different. Here, what is happening is, when the Government says that commemorations can take place and when the Magistrates have said that commemorations can take place, the police are in violation of those decisions acting under the PTA when the PTA is supposed to be under a moratorium, and I asked you, only in that backdrop, to intervene. I am not talking about anything else. So, please do not mislead this House. You are trying to make out that I am trying to call for a complete moratorium, if, in case, some major attack had taken place. That is not what I said. So, the Hon. Minister must not mislead this House like that.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you, Hon. Member.

The Hon. Rishad Bathiudeen, please.

2023 06

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon.Chairman, before the Hon. Gayantha Karunatilleka moves the Cut, I want to raise this very important matter. I am also quite desolated at what happened on that day and subsequently, the Hon. Minister of Justice and the Hon. Rishad Bathiudeen had been raising certain issues.

Sir, the Privilege of a Member of Parliament is untrammelled and we have to protect it. But, in the guise of Privilege, when you take up an issue about another institution of the State, there are certain limitations; we have to be very careful. There are a variety of issues which have to be taken up here because the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act gives you the power to conduct affairs in Parliament the way you want. But, similarly, the judges also must be able to conduct their affairs with freedom. This very issue of recusal of judges, it was I, as a Member of Parliament and as a Colleague of the Hon. Rishad Bathiudeen, who originally took up, asking why they, one after the other, are recusing themselves. At that time, I did not go to criticize anybody, but said that the Chief Justice should, before nominating the judge, ask him whether he would be having any impediment in hearing the case because that was a sensitive political matter. We sympathized with the Hon. Rishad Bathiudeen at that time; we also felt that his incarceration for such a long time on a very trivial issue or on a trumped-up charge is not a done thing and that is why we stood up for him. But, now, being privy to what the Hon. Minister of Justice told me and what a very leading lawyer in Hulftsdorp, who is virtually a legend in Hulftsdorp and who happens to be my senior as well, told me yesterday - he is thoroughly upset about the issue the Hon. Rishad Bathiudeen had been talking about, having called the judge - I must say this. Sir, there are so many Presidents Counsels here. The former President is also a lawyer who had practised in courts. You know, there is nothing wrong in lawyers calling judges. On a court sitting day, if they have personal difficulties, they do call; there is such a convention. But, they do not go and advise them to give judgments in a particular way. If that is done, it is wrong. In that case, if that happens, the judges have all the right to recuse themselves. But, here, the issue is related to that particular legend. I do not want to name him. The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe knows, I have been his junior. The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe had been a junior to another senior Muslim lawyer, who is also a relative of mine now. But, these legends reputations are also getting tarnished when you talk about them calling judges and when that happens to be from the same community, it will create a further problem.

I am sure, Hon. Chairman, in permitting a matter of Privilege to be raised, first, you should examine the script of that particular Hon. Member. Now, he is even saying that the judges phone records must be examined. That is going beyond the limit. You see, this House has certain limitations. The Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa knows that when I was Minister of Justice, there was an incident in the Mannar Court. The then Chief Justice called me. The

Hon. (Mrs.) Shirani Bandaranayake was the then Chief Justice and she was thoroughly disturbed about that. The Mannar Court was being stoned and there were accusations made. Then, His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa called me as Minister of Justice and told me not to raise that issue in Parliament.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Now, this is going to be another debate. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Sir, these things had happened in the past also. So, these Members' behaving so ruthlessly and trying to hold allegations against sitting judges is a very dirty thing to do and this should be avoided. Senior lawyers names are being dragged into this. This is very unfair.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Please, stop now. That is enough.

Hon. Gayantha Karunatilleka, you made a mistake. You have given your opportunity to somebody else for nothing. Okay, you go ahead now.

One of the most important things in marketing is, if you want to market something, you have to have the product right. But, how often do we concentrate on developing the product of Sri Lanka? Look at the Ministers, look at the officials who are there in the Officials' Box. What are they doing? More often than not, they are not concentrating on the marketing aspect. It is very rarely that they travel around the country and see how the product could be improved. , , , . , .

Sir, I do not want to speak much about the Ministry of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs because it is absolutely useless. He is a

agenda. Despite whatever we say, he will continue with it. Also he had said, "If that is your view, I have no problem". So, there is no point in wasting our time speaking about it.

Hon. Minister in charge of tourism, I have a small concern. There is a Research Paper that was published in 2019 about the income of the Ministry of Tourism. It states that in 2018/19, the Sri Lankan Government did a survey on 5,033 tourists. It is based on that that we came to the figure of how much a tourist should spend per night in this country. I think compared to our neighbours including Thailand, Indonesia where Bali is, India, Vietnam and Nepal, the amount that a tourist should spend a night in Sri Lanka is much higher; it is much higher than that of other countries.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , .

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) . 2 ?

It is US Dollars 168. That is a very high estimate. Therefore, I think you need to seriously look into this estimate because your calculations are done based on that. I will table* this Research Paper so that if you are interested, you can have a look at it.

Then, also there are concerns about the minimum room rate of hotels in Colombo. There is another Research Paper on that, which I will also table.*

You can have a look at both and if you are interested, you can do something about it.

Hon. Minister, very recently, I was in Paris. When I was in Paris, I came to know that if a tourist stays within the city or in a congested area, the municipality charges

him a tax. But, all the tourists who come to Sri Lanka use all the resources and the subsidized services like transports, railways et cetera that Sri Lankans also enjoy free of charge.

Then, in Pasikuda in the Batticaloa District, there is a complaint that solar panel systems do not work. There is also a problem with crocodiles. The Governor has proposed to create a crocodile park there.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , .

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Therefore, please consider and allocate some resources for that.

Also, moving on to the subject of land, - LRC - .

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Order, please! . . . Accordingly, Parliament resumed. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) ?

( ) (Hon. Members) Aye.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , .

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Hon. Presiding Member, I will wind up after raising a few more matters.

In terms of land, we have many issues in Batticaloa. I think all the Hon. Members, irrespective of their districts, raised land issues, which is precisely why land powers should be fully devolved. Hon. Minister, you cannot handle all these land issues on your own. There are so many land issues. As I said, in terms of Batticaloa, there are many land issues. Therefore, I would urge you to set a date just for Batticaloa to discuss the issues regarding deeds and all that. I do not want to mention all that in this House now.

Sir, there is one final matter relating to tourism in Batticaloa. Hon. Minister, I would like to ask you to allocate some time to have a discussion with Mr. Mathan, Chairman of the Eastern Province Tourism Bureau and also another gentleman called Mr. Niroshan from Batticaloa on how tourism could be improved there because the only sudda or the white-skinned fellow in Batticaloa right now is me; there are no other suddas. So, we need to address that issue, too, Hon. Minister.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 3 .

( ( - ) (The Hon. Harin Fernando - Minister of Tourism and Lands and Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs) Sir, I want to reply to the question raised by the Hon. Shanakiyan Rasamanickam on how our statistics are arrived at. Hon. Rasamanickam, what you said was correct. Actually, it was five years ago that those estimates were done. But, now, we are using a new system called Tourism Satellite Account - TSA. We just launched it last week with the support of the UNWTO and the Central Bank. So, we will have the correct, exact figure of how much a tourist spends per night. I believe that, normally, it is around US Dollars 200, but definitely, we need to increase it to about US Dollars 400 to earn more. Now, we have a strategy, which we are trying to roll out within the next two years. Anyway, I will explain that in my speech.

highest income earner . . . point . tourist average spending per night minimum hotel room rate statistics .

I also have the statistics. Actually, there is a 16 per cent drop because of the minimum room rate, but the revenue has increased by 25 per cent. So, there was a give and take and a reason why we had that minimum room rate. But, the Hon. President wants it to be removed very soon. Until the market got settled is the reason why we had that minimum rate. So, we will not continue it for a long period.

We have a serious problem of retaining staff. The staff, after getting a six months service certificate, go abroad and then, finding staff again is a bit of a challenge for us. So, we have to keep their service charge and also get them a good income. Then, the moratorium is also coming to an end so that they will have to start paying their loans. So, those were the real factors which affected the tourism sector. We listened to the Hotels Association of Sri Lanka and we increased the minimum rate; it was not because we wanted it increased, but at the request of the Hotels Association. Now, it is only 100 Dollars. If we do no charge US Dollars 100 for a room at a five-star hotel, we cannot compete with Bangkok and Malaysia because the number of hotel rooms in Sri Lanka is quite limited and there is also a monopoly.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) . . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . ( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Hon. Minister, your point about the minimum room rate being US Dollars 100 is before tax. So, with taxes and everything, it comes to about US Dollars 162. Also, there is a different market for conventions and exhibitions that come up. So, we are killing a market. I agree that I am not the Minister and that I do not have the statistics readily as you do. But, there is a problem because that US Dollars 162 rate is only for hotels within the municipality limits, within the Colombo City limits. For hotels just outside those limits, it does not apply. Even the other hotels - only the star-rated hotels are stuck with this rate - within the Colombo City limits, where backpackers stay, are still doing what they want. So, there is a problem, but I am glad that the President is looking into it. So, there is no further debate on that.

( ) (The Hon. Harin Fernando) Thank you very much, Hon. Member, for your concern. Sir, I think he actually got the picture right.

So, we had to listen to both sides - the DMCs want to play with it as the market progresses, but the Hotels Association was actually finding it difficult to cope with. At the recently concluded AGM of the Hotels Association of Sri Lanka, the President was the Chief Guest and there, he made a clear remark that he is looking at removing it and allowing the market forces to keep running it. But, we just wanted to have some stability for a short period of time. And, I say again and again - Shangri-La is selling their rooms at US Dollars 180 and they do not have a problem with their occupancy - that hotels can sell at any rate they want, depending on their marketing strategies.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) They got a freehold land. ( ) (The Hon. Harin Fernando) That is true.
