( ) (The Hon. Kanchana Wijesekera) Hon. Member, we will re-evaluate the situation in Vavuniya and Mannar. There are a lot of projects which are being undertaken in those districts as well. Up to now, there has been only one Regional Office looking into all the grievances of the area. So, we will evaluate the situation again and if there is a need to have more engineers allocated to the area, we will allocate them. Also, we will see whether we can have an online system to produce the applications so that those could be expedited.

IMPACT OF ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL STRUGGLE OF WORLD POWERS ON SRI LANKA: STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS

... ( ) ( ... - ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC - Minister of Foreign Affairs) Hon. Deputy Speaker, this is in respect of the Question raised under Standing Order 27(2) on the 22nd of June, 2023 by the Hon. (Ven.) Athuraliye Rathana Thero, Member of Parliament, regarding a group of people from the United States visiting Sri Lanka. This is my Answer after consulting all the relevant agencies.

Sir, while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is the link between foreign countries/ entities/ institutions and the Ministries/ departments/ institutions in Sri Lanka, it is not the focal point for the subject areas that come under the purview of the MCC Agreement. It is noted that an expert committee was appointed by the Cabinet in December, 2019 to review the MCC Agreement and the final report was handed over to the former President in June, 2020.

The proposed SOFA is an agreement between the United States and Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the Line Ministry in this regard is the Ministry of Defence and the information required may be obtained from the Ministry of Defence.

ACSA is also an agreement that comes under the Ministry of Defence. The relevant Line Ministry in this regard is the Ministry of Defence and further information may be obtained from the Ministry of Defence.

Therefore, it is appropriate to ask from the relevant Line Ministry, the Ministry of Defence, regarding the re-implementation of those agreements and their current status and the purposes.

I am aware that two aircraft belonging to the United States Air Force arrived at the Katunayake Bandaranaike International Airport in the afternoon of 14th February, 2023. According to the information provided by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation and the Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) (Pvt.) Limited, they had officially entered the country. Those two planes had arrived at the Katunayake Bandaranaike International Airport under numbers RCH 230/99212A and RCH 231/00215A. I further mention that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had done only the necessary diplomatic clearances for the C 130 aircraft to fly to Sri Lanka.

The Chairman of the Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) (Pvt.) Limited has informed that the names, passport numbers and visa numbers of the people who came on the said two aircraft can be obtained from the Department of Immigration and Emigration. Further, the Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) (Pvt.) Limited has informed my Ministry that they are not aware of the facts as to which organization in the United States the said group belongs and responsible for, the parties of which organization in Sri Lanka bearing what responsibilities they had met with and what matters and agreements were discussed at those meetings.

Therefore, some of these questions seem to be referred to the wrong Ministry. So, based on the evidence we gathered and the information acquired from different agencies, this is the Answer I can provide to the Question raised by the Hon. (Ven.) Athuraliye Rathana Thero on the 22nd of June, 2023.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Jayantha Weerasinghe, PC) Sir, since the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and the Hon. Kabir Hashim are here, I think it is my duty to highlight this. I do not know whether you saw this article, Hon. Leader of the Opposition, written by Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka and appearing in today's Daily FT. It contains some derogatory remarks about the SJB. I do not approve of this and I want to send this to you. It has a photograph of the Hon. Kabir Hashim and underneath it asks, Kabir: Ranils or Sajiths economist? This little part, I cannot approve and I am sending it to you so that you can see it for yourself. The article states, I quote:

Senior member of the SJBs Economic Policy Unit, Kabir Hashim, MP, is the prime author of an important new piece on economic policy which makes no mention of the SJB, Sajith or President Premadasa, names Ranil three times, merely reiterates his policy and endorses...

Judging by the article, the SJB doesnt exist .

I want to send this to you, Hon. Leader of the Opposition. I thought it is my duty to highlight this since that part is derogatory of you and the Hon. Kabir Hashim.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) . . rose.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. Deputy Speaker, it is nice to know that the Hon. Member opposite is very keen on SJB politics and it also points in the direction of a whole-hearted recognition on the part of this Parliament that the SJB is the alternative government and that we are about to assume power with the blessings of the Sri Lankan people.

As far as the SJBs economic policies and principles are concerned, those are not dictated according to the visions and practices of former leaders, present leaders and potential future leaders. Our economic policy is determined through a rationale decision-making process which looks at the past, present and future challenges that Sri Lanka faced and will face. So, we, as a political party, do not subscribe to the type of low-grade decision-making that is prevalent in Sri Lankan political system. We rather go by a data-based, science-based, evidence-based approach in formulating our economic policy. Not at its mere formulation, but ,certainly, we also have to look at its practical implementation according to a time schedule. Also, we are focusing on another important aspect of governance, which is lacking in our country. That is, monitoring and evaluation, feedback and how we readjust our policies according to the strengths and weaknesses and the follow-up of the policy process. So, I want to reiterate to you that the SJB policies are not dictated by the theories and practices of the past political leaders, political theoreticians and economists, but rather it is an appreciation of all the attributes and faults of various approaches and the designing of our own approach, which is primarily a middle-of-the-path and a social, democratic approach which basically combines the wealth creation aspect of capitalism, capitalism with a human face, and which also understands the anomalies of capitalism and the various divisions that capitalism creates. Through the adoption of social democratic policies, we try to alleviate the grievances of the less well-off in the society. We look at justice and fairness in terms of redistribution of income and wealth. So, that is the basic synopsis of our economic policy.

So, it is good that various theoreticians and observers write this type of articles. We read those articles, take in what should be absorbed and reject those which should be rejected. Also, there is freedom of speech and freedom of

493 494

writing, but at the end of the day, SJB's economic policies will be rational, grassroots-based and will encompass the whole country. Also, we will have a national approach irrespective of ethnicity, religion, caste, creed, economic and social groupings. Those traditional divisions have been one contributory factor for Sri Lankas bankruptcy.

SOCIO-ECONOMIC ISSUES FACED BY PLANTATION

COMMUNITY [11.15 a.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mano Ganesan) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I move,

"Recent and past reports submitted and surveys conducted by Central Bank of Sri Lanka, World Bank, UN World Food Programme, UN Food and Agriculture Organization, International Committee of the Red Cross and the UN Special Rapporteur on modern forms of slavery, Tomoya Obokata have identified the planation residents as the most underprivileged, marginalized, vulnerable community in Sri Lanka. Furthermore, the current economic crisis has pushed the segment at the worst levels in respect of poverty, food insecurity and malnutrition in the country.

The hill country Tamil Sri Lankan community within which, plantation segment exists, completes 200 years in Sri Lanka since 1823. The lives of plantation community remain almost the same in all three eras, i.e., the first 125 years under British Raj, the second 24 years in independent, but dominion Ceylon and third and current 51 years in the Republic of Sri Lanka. The only visible change is from white British Raj to Brown Plantation Raj. It is nothing, but shameful modern slavery that exists in the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

Plantation segment has become the most marginalized group in the country registering lower measures on almost all human development indices compared to every other community in the country. The contemporary forms of modern slavery in Sri Lankan plantations are forcing the said people to live with undignified, inhumane and degrading living conditions such as inadequate health and social care, malnutrition, worst infant and maternal mortalities, poverty, overburden on women, child labour, poor work conditions, longer hours of work with less payment, unfair daily wage system at large plantations managed by private companies, State plantations......."

That is, RPCs and the State plantations directly under you, Hon. Minister of Plantation Industries.

505 506

".........and privately-owned smallholdings, forced to be employed in domestic work with physical, verbal and sexual harassment and abuse, higher levels of exploitation and discrimination. Police authorities....."

, . .

"........ are joining hands with plantation managements in addressing their issues of general oppression, unequal access to education and substandard quality of education, high dropouts of students from schools, limited access to justice and remedies with language barriers,....."

. , . .

".......denial of land rights for habitation and livelihood ration on par with rest of the citizens.

We, as the legitimate Representatives of the particular people, call upon the Government and our fellow legislators....."

That is, on both sides.

".....to join hands beyond political and ethnic divides to uplift the socio-economic status of the planation people within the hill country Tamil Sri Lankan community with special action based on affirmative principles guided by Buddhist teachings. What we anticipate is not sympathy, but justice. ....."

, , .

"We wanted to be full citizens of Sri Lanka within the Sri Lankan national mainstream!"

. , ; we are not fully-fledged citizens.

"We demand bringing in estate settlements under the purview of Sri Lankan State public administrative system and national mainstream by demarcation of adequate GN divisions and DS divisions in the plantation areas on par with other rural areas and assuring equitable access to decentralized governance and welfare services of State institutions at village, divisional and district levels that enable transformation from workers - tied to plantation employers - to fully-fledged citizens. We also demand demarcation and establishment of new Pradeshiya Sabhas in the plantation areas with population ratio on par with the rest of the country."

The two external entities whom we hold answerable for our tragedy are, India and the UK.

Sir, we are not talking to India regarding our political demands. Those, we will take up with the Government of Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan political leadership. But, we demand their support for our socio-economic and cultural upliftment. Now, India, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is realizing their moral obligation and responsibility towards our people. Modi Ji has announced assistance amounting to Indian Rupees 750 million towards this end. That is, in addition to the US Dollars 4

billion the Government of India has provided to Sri Lanka. Thank you, India; thank you, Modi Ji.

Now, we call upon the Government of UK to take a lead from India. The UK Government brought us to this country in 1823 and now, we have completed 200 years being here. I will be happy if the Government of Great Britain give assistance in Sterling Pounds to our people. I am making this appeal on the Floor of this House. I hope the Acting British High Commissioner Lisa Whanstall, who is learning Sinhala and Tamil right now, will put forward this appeal to her Government in London. , , , obligation , responsibility . , . Indian Rupees 750 million . Sterling Pounds . , .

As I said earlier, we do not want sympathy; we want justice. ; ! , . . . . .

I made a tweet. This is what it stated: We welcome the UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Sachin Tendulkar, a lovable legend. Mr. Ambassador, ...." - I was addressing Sachin Tendulkar - "......Sri Lanka, also known as Ceylon, is famous for two subjects. One is, Sri Lanka cricket and the other one is 'Ceylon Tea'. You are on both. Please pay your attention to the most vulnerable, underprivileged and marginalized children of Sri Lankan plantations, where the world-famous Ceylon Tea is produced.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes, Hon. Jeevan Thondaman? ( ) (The Hon. Jeevan Thondaman) Sir, give me just one minute.

Sir, I was waiting, out of respect, to let the Hon. Member finish because I know he usually screams a lot. I do not want him to scream and waste his time.

Just to give you an update, on 19th January, 2023, I took over as the Cabinet Minister of Estate Infrastructure Development. So, I am sitting here as Minister. The Hon. Ramesh Pathirana has to answer many of his questions. However, I just need to give him two clarifications, the first clarification being on the ten perches to be provided to the workers. Initially, in 2021, we passed a Cabinet Paper to provide ten perches to each worker, but, unfortunately, the companies, as usual, do not go ahead with that much like in the Rs. 1,000 wage issue. However, the Hon. Ramesh Pathirana, I believe, starting from last month, had instructed the companies to provide the ten perches, as promised. That is clarification number one.

Number two is, the JEDB issue is something which we are also concerned about. I am not just talking about the issue of land and all that, but also about the workers and their EPF and ETF outstanding, which has been a long-standing issue. All of us have spoken about it. Right now, what we are trying to do is to work out a mechanism with the Government to see whether any assets of the JEDB and the Ministry of Plantation Industries could be utilized in order to settle these outstanding amounts. So, rather than getting worked up, you can just ask us. Those are the things which have already been done.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage, you may commence your speech now.

( ) (The Hon. Jeevan Thondaman) Yes, I am also talking about single houses. We have proof and we had submitted it to Parliament. - [Interruption] Could you let me finish? So, 44,000 houses have been built, out of which 4,000 houses had been built during the former Government with Indian aid, plus another 10,000 built in 2017, if I am not mistaken. So, this is the situation. Earlier, an Hon. Member mentioned that the houses built in Monaragala are incomplete. Because those houses are incomplete, we have to funnel money and make sure that they are completed. I am not saying that it was anybodys fault. There was mismanagement and we are trying to rectify it. So, it is not 25,000 houses as you mentioned, but 44,000.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you, Hon. Minister.

. ( . ) (The Hon. M. Udayakumar) Hon. Minister, it may be 25,000 or 44,000 houses, but I am talking about single houses. What I am saying is, our community has totally been discriminated against throughout, from 1975. I am not blaming anyone. I am only saying that throughout, maybe since 75 years ago or from 1972 or 1977, whatever it is, we have been discriminated against. I am saying that over and over again.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Now, you have only 10 minutes.

[4.13 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, last week, there was a procession which commenced from Mannar and which was going to finish up in Matale to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the up-country Tamil people coming to Sri Lanka. Another procession took place in Jaffna also. When I took part in that procession, one individual walked up to me and asked, At least now, are you, on behalf of your party and your grandfather, willing to apologize to the up-country Tamils for disenfranchising them in 1948? Sir, whilst that question posed to me hurt me quite a bit, I thought I will take the opportunity today to state our position on that matter because, very clearly, the up-country Tamil people are represented quite well. Today, the Hon. Mano Ganesan brought in this Adjournment Motion and it was seconded by the Hon. (Dr.) V. Radhakrishnan. So, I do not think I need to speak on behalf of those people; they have their own Representatives, who are very eloquent in doing that. Therefore, I wish to put the record straight with regard to where our party stands on the question of disenfranchisement which took place 75 years ago.

As you know, Sir, the Act that disenfranchised the up-country Tamils was the Ceylon Citizenship Act, No. 18 of 1948. When that Act was brought in, it disenfranchised the up-country Tamils because the conditionalities that were introduced into the Act in order to claim citizenship or qualify for citizenship were such that a person had to go back two generations to qualify. Naturally, the up-country Tamils failed to establish their residences with regard to their grandparents and great grandparents and, as a result, lost citizenship. That was the practical way in which their citizenship lost. Now, Sir, quite categorically, we would like to put on record that the Ceylon Citizenship Act, No. 18 of 1948 was opposed by the All Ceylon Tamil Congress. We were not in government; we were seated in the Opposition and we opposed it. At that time, the All Ceylon Tamil Congress was united; there was no split within the party and my grandfather, the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam, the party's Deputy Leader, the Hon. S.J.V. Chelvanayakam, and all others opposed that Act. So, the Act that literally disenfranchised the up-country Tamils was opposed by the All Ceylon Tamil Congress and we had no party to play in that disenfranchisement. But, of course, soon after Independence, Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake wanted to have a multiethnic Government and he approached the All Ceylon Tamil Congress to join the Government. When negotiations commenced, we put, as a condition, that the Ceylon Citizenship Act, No. 18 of 1948 must be repealed because of this grave injustice that happened to the Tamil people and in the course of those negotiations, Prime Minister Shri Jawaharlal Nehru was also asked to intervene.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam. You have ten minutes.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Out of the 14 minutes allocated?

So, negotiations commenced and eventually, Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake agreed that whilst he would not repeal the Ceylon Citizenship Act, he would bring in a new Act: the Indian and Pakistani Residents (Citizenship) Act, No. 03 of 1949. He said that he would bring it. That Act, to a great extent, reduced the conditionalities on claiming citizenship, and the demand from the Tamil parties, not only from the All Ceylon Tamil Congress but also from the Ceylon Workers' Congress - CWC - led by the Hon. Saumyamoorthy Thondaman, the up-country leader, was that the condition should be made five years' residency because that is the condition that normally applies to any person who goes to another country. If you can show your residency for five years in a country, then you are entitled to apply for its citizenship; unless you get disqualified by certain other extraneous matters, you ought to get citizenship. However, Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake did not agree to that, but agreed to only ten years. That is, to show that one was present and resident in Sri Lanka for ten years prior to that particular date of the Act coming into force. Despite that, the Tamil parties and Prime Minister Shri Jawaharlal Nehru continued to bargain and eventually, they managed to succeed in getting the Government to agree for individuals to show ten years' residency and for those who were married to show seven years' residency. That Act would have effectively meant that, at least, 85 per cent of the up-country Tamils, if they had applied under that Act, would have qualified for citizenship.

Unfortunately, the All Ceylon Tamil Congress split and the Hon. S. J. V. Chelvanayakam broke away and joined the CWC at that time. Then, the up-country Tamil leaders and the Hon. S. J. V. Chelvanayakam insisted that a five-year term of residency should be the condition to qualify for citizenship and asked the Tamil people, since the Act refused to agree on the five-year term of residency, to boycott it. The Indian and Pakistani Residents (Citizenship) Act, No. 03 of 1949 was going to be in force only for two years. Within those two years, everybody needed to apply. For the first one-and-a-half years of those two years after that Act was passed, the boycott was on. Only in the last six months, everybody realized that the Hon. D.S. Senanayake was not going to back down and they called off the boycott. In fact, the Hon. Saumyamoorthy Thondaman formally became a citizen of this country through the Indian and Pakistani Residents (Citizenship) Act, No. 03 of 1949. So, Sir, the tragedy is that when 85 per cent of the up-country Tamils, who lost their citizenship under the Ceylon Citizenship Act, could have obtained their citizenship under the Indian and Pakistani Residents (Citizenship) Act, ultimately, because of the boycott, only about 15 per cent were able to gain citizenship. The remaining 85 per cent were stateless and it was that 85 per cent of people who were sought to be dealt with under the Sirima-Shastri Pact, which effectively meant that half of that 85 per cent who were stateless was to be repatriated to India.

To those people who criticize the All Ceylon Tamil Congress, I would like to say that the All Ceylon Tamil Congress supported and voted for the second law, that is,

the Indian and Pakistani Residents (Citizenship) Act, No. 03 of 1949, which was brought to bring back citizenship. We did not support the Ceylon Citizenship Act, which disenfranchised the up-country Tamils; we opposed that. So, Sir, if the argument is that 85 per cent victory is, in fact, not a victory unless it is 100 per cent, then, I am willing to whole-heartedly apologize to the up-country Tamils. Unreservedly, I am willing to apologize if the 85 per cent victory is, in fact, not a victory and that it has to be 100 per cent or nothing else. Since the All Ceylon Tamil Congress supported a law that would have given 85 per cent of those disenfranchised citizenship, if that is wrong, I am certainly willing to unreservedly apologize.

But the question is, those very same people who accuse us of betraying the up-country Tamils, for supporting the Indian and Pakistani Residents (Citizenship) Act, No. 3 of 1949 had no qualms in supporting the Sirima-Shastri Pact, which evicted a half of the up-country Tamil population from this country.

( ) (The Hon. Mano Ganesan) More than a half. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Yes, more than a half. That Act evicted them to a country they knew nothing about. They might be Tamils of recent Indian origin, but as far as they were all concerned, Sri Lanka was their home; they were born here and they knew no other place.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please conclude. Your time is up.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) If that eviction could be supported by those who accuse us, then, they must also apologize because it is a bigger betrayal to support the Sirima-Shastri Pact than to support the Indian and Pakistani Residents (Citizenship) Act.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Therefore, Sir, I wish to state wholeheartedly that, as far as the Tamil National Peoples Front is concerned, our view is quite categorical: we will unreservedly support every single step taken on behalf of the up-country Tamils, there will be no conditionalities applied to support whatever steps taken by either side of this House

on behalf of the up-country Tamils and we will continue to work closely with everybody in that regard.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. Sarathi Dushmantha. You have six minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Jeevan Thondaman) Hon. member, I would like to give you a clarification regarding the matter of postal addresses. That is something which has been up for debate for quite some time. Now, we are having discussions with the Hon. Minister of Plantation Industries and tomorrow, we would bring it up with the President as well. We are trying to come up with a mechanism where the beneficiaries of Indian houses will be issued with numbers such as IH/1, IH/2, IH/3 and the line rooms will be numbered as L/1, L/2, L/3 and so on. The only issue in this is, what we are to do about the temporary sheds that are there. So, that is the only mechanism we need to figure out. I just wanted to let you know about that mechanism.

( ) (The Hon. Sarathi Dushmantha) I am grateful to you for clarifying. Thank you very much, Hon. Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya. You have eight minutes.

[4.31 p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya - State Minister of Foreign Affairs) Hon. Presiding Member, at the outset, let me thank you for giving me eight minutes to express my ideas on this matter, and I am also glad that I am getting to speak while you are presiding the House.

I think the undertone of this Debate in Parliament today is that everyone is agreeable that we need to do more for the estate sector. I also think that with the young Minister, hopefully, we should be able to get things on the right track. I am of the view that this is a timely Debate, especially in the context of the President's Special Statement yesterday, that we need to make amends and have a new approach in this country.

If you look at the estate sector, everybody agrees that most of the downtrodden people are from the estate sector. So, I do agree that it is essential that those people in the estate sector are allocated a certain extent of land, utilizing which, maybe, they could have access to some form of capital in order to start a business. Therefore, that kind of approach is absolutely necessary. I also think that we need to look at this problem on a bigger scale.

Today, I came to Parliament from my residence and before I came, I was watching the CNN, going through the events which took place in Niger. Then, while I was Googling, I came across the statement made by the Italian Prime Minister against the French President, in which she talks of neocolonialism, showing a picture of a small kid working, maybe, at a uranium mine or a gold mine and who does not have the basic necessities. In her accusation, she further says that France, nonetheless, is benefitting and what is happening as a result of that is, the Africans are trying to migrate to Europe. Therefore, she says that it is not the way forward and her solution is that you need to enrich the people in Africa so that they will stay behind in Africa.

I think, sometimes, our society has looked at the plantation sector also in that manner, in the sense that the plantation sector contributes to the national economy and if the plantation sector is reformed immediately or in a short period of time, what will happen to the national economy?

But, I think we have to stop looking at that issue from that perspective. I think what we are doing to the estate workers is, in a way, similar to what France, as per the Italian Prime Minister, is doing to the children in Africa. So, we need to look afresh at the way forward.

Before me, my Colleague from the Kegalle District spoke so eloquently about the issues pertaining to the estate sector. Sir, let me give you just one example. In the Dehiowita Education Zone, there are 63 Tamil schools! I think, apart from the North, the East and the Central Province, that is the highest concentration of Tamil schools in Sri Lanka. But, I am ashamed to say that in the Kegalle District, we do not have a single Tamil-medium school which has a science stream for Advanced Level. So, as a result, those students have to find schools elsewhere, in Nuwara Eliya or in other areas. Therefore, I think what we need to do is to have some form of affirmative action, targeting the estate sector, maybe, spanning a 10-year period, where we could pay attention to the education system and more attention to the health system and try to uplift the economy of the people.

( ) (The Hon. Mano Ganesan) Hon. State Minister, with regard to the Dehiowita Education Zone, I have good news for you. In the Dehiowita Tamil Maha Vidyalaya, we are constructing a science laboratory with the support of a Canadian NGO and an event in that regard was held recently in Colombo, at which the Canadian High Commissioner and the NGO officials participated. So, that is a good news for you.

( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) That is great news and I thank the Hon. Member for his initiatives. But, my point is that we should not take cases one by one, but must have a master plan spanning for about 10 years. We can be quite happy about individual support, contributing to the estate sector, but I feel that until a certain amount of affirmative action is taken on the estate sector, whereby their livelihood - [Interruption]. Yes, I know and I thank you once again, Hon. Member. But, real concrete action needs to be taken in that regard. If not, my feeling, too, is that it is kind of a modern form of slavery that we have in the estates.

I know that with regard to the estate sector, all the people are arguing about paying them Rs. 1,000 a day and all that. But, for example if you take Kegalle, how many days does it rain there? Every time when it rains, those people cannot go out and tap rubber and their income falls. So, it is a very vicious cycle. Also, there are other associated socioeconomic issues which we see more in the estate sector than in the rest of the country. For example, alcoholism. Of course, if people have to live such a life, they will be drawn to alcoholism. So, it is a vicious cycle, regarding which we need to take concrete steps. I think, certainly, every Member in this House is of the view that we need to pay special attention to the estate sector, particularly in view of what the Hon. President stated yesterday.

The President spoke about devolving power under the Thirteenth Amendment. I always say that we should not give power just to the periphery, but should also share power at the Centre. I think, with Thirteen plus, what the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa was talking about was sharing power at the Centre. We should not only look at the North-East issue, but, in the same light, we should also look at the issues of the estate sector and hopefully, we can have a meaningful progress if we all work together. Thank you.
