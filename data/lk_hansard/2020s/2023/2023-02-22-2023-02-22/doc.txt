we are debating about two Regulations under the Colombo Port City Economic Commission Act.

Now, to get this country out of its present economic mess - as you know, we have a debt crisis and it does not matter our going to the IMF; we need the IMF and we need to come to an agreement with them - ultimately, we would really have to get investments coming in. Even for the Port City, we need to have investments coming in. Sir, there is a factor that is not very publicly recognized. In investments, the factor that needs to be recognized is called country risk. It is not just about the law, it is not just about regulations, but it is about investors having confidence in a country, that law is actually being executed in that country. So, how do we attract investments? Country risk is about political stability, the rule of law and a stable financial environment in a country.

Now, a big conversation is going on among businessmen, in the business community and in the Chambers about the death of Dinesh Schaffter. Dinesh Schaffter came from a very reputed business family in this country. I saw the President of the country at the funeral of that individual because the President personally knows his family, a very reputed family. Businessmen would not publicly talk about it as they are not politicians, but if you create uncertainty among them, they would.

Some of them, with whom I have worked for 25 years, asked me, "Who is actually safe in this country?"

Therefore, we really need to look at this case. The JMO, first, gives a report on Mr. Schaffter's murder. The first report states that it looks like he had been strangled. The same JMO gives another report later saying, No, it may be that he had committed suicide. That is absolutely ridiculous, ridiculous, ridiculous! This murder inquiry must be conducted in a fair way. I am glad to say that I just saw in the media the other day that the Magistrate had said, I am appointing five JMOs to look into this matter. This needs to be looked into because if we do not get this right, I can tell you - it does not matter whatever rules we may bring in - Sri Lankan businessmen would talk to international investors. Investors from abroad do not come here to invest by talking to politicians like us. They talk to their counterparts here, the businessmen in this country. Therefore, our businessmen need to have confidence in our country to tell those investors, Come and invest your dollars here. We really know that we have to take cognizance of that fact.

On the day of the murder, Dinesh Schaffter spends one to one-and-a-half hours from 11.30 in the morning talking to his father Chandra Schaffter. At 1.00 o clock, he speaks to his brother Prakash, who heads Janashakthi Insurance PLC. At 1.30 p.m., he speaks to his other brother Ramesh Schaffter. At 2.00 o clock, he leaves his home after talking to his wife, saying that he is going to meet Brian Thomas; he names the person he was going to meet. Then, at 2.43 p.m., he sends a text message to Brian Thomas, stating that he was at the location and asks how long it would take him to get there. Then, at 2.43 p.m., another text message was sent saying, As instructed, I have deleted the previous messages although I do not understand why. [Interruption.]

) ) ( () - ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Suren Raghavan - State Minister of Higher Education) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. State Minister, what is the point of Order?

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan) Hon. Presiding Member, I do not want to disturb my Colleague on the other side. But, I think we all must respect that there is a court inquiry going on into this murder. We all are sad about this incident. So, giving full details of it under Parliamentary Privileges, I think, is a disrespect to the legal system in this country. Sir, I think you must take note of that. I would very kindly request the Hon. Member to avoid referring to the details of the incident with your own interpretation of that and leave the honourable court to decide.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I understand what the Hon. State Minister is saying. But, I want to tell the Hon. State Minister that justice must prevail in this country! Do not try to tell me about justice. - [Interruption.] Justice must prevail in this country! We are losing our young people in this country because the rule of law is not prevailing in this country - [Interruption.]

Sir, I want to say something further about the JMO who gave that Report. Actually, I am going to quote from this document I have here with me titled "Ethics - Decisions of the Professional Conduct Committee (PCC)" by the Sri Lanka Medical Council, SLMC.

It states, I quote:

(1) Inquiry into the complaint made by Mr. S.A. Rathnasena against Dr. M.N. Ruhul Haq (SLMC Reg: 15168)

I do not know any of these individuals. I am just reading it out to you. - [Interruption] It goes on to state, I quote:

The Professional Conduct Committee (PCC) has decided that commencing from the 20th of December, 2022 Dr. Ruhul Haq should be imposed a suspension for a period of eight (08) months

) ( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Suren Raghavan) Hon. Presiding Member, - ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes, Hon. State Minister? ) ( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Suren Raghavan) Sir, we have an eminent Professor of Law present in front of us on the opposite side. We cannot go on like this. Sir, you need to make a ruling on this. We need to do justice to Mr. Schaffter, yes, but there are also farmers who are getting killed due to various reasons. We need to do justice to them, too. The person you mentioned is also a friend of mine. That does not mean that we need to do extra justice to him. We need to have a fair justice system in this country, I stand with you on that. But, on this matter, we have a court case pending in this country. The Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs and former Minister of Justice is here. So, Sir, we cannot continue like this, deliberating on a court case under Privileges of Parliament. Therefore, I ask the Hon. Member very honourably to speak on the topic at hand or being debated.

Thank you ) .. ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Hon. Presiding Member, -

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes, Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris?

) .. ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Hon. Presiding Member, I do not think the sub judice principle can be invoked to prevent a candid discussion in Parliament about a matter which is the subject of very considerable interest in this country. The truth needs to be known. This involves a murder. And, I do not think we can take refuge behind the technicalities of sub judice to prevent my Friend, the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne, from bringing to the notice of this House certain circumstances which deserve the serious consideration, not only of Members of this House, but indeed the country at large. As he said, the truth needs to be known and we all have a duty to contribute towards ascertaining what really happened in this case.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you.

Hon. Eran Wickramaratne, you may continue. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Sir, I am now going to read the decision of the Professional Conduct Committee of the SLMC, not on Dinesh Schaffter, but on that JMO. It states, I quote:

The Professional Conduct Committee (PCC) has decided that commencing from the 20th of December, 2022 Dr. Ruhul Haq should be imposed a suspension for a period of eight (08) months from exercising his rights,...

This talks about the JMO. The SLMC has suspended him and he gives the report on the death of Dinesh Schaffter. The PCC continues to state, I quote:

...privileges and immunities conferred upon him by registration as a Medical Practitioner in terms of the provisions of the Disciplinary Regulations published in the Extraordinary Gazette Notification No. 757/7 dated 10th March, 1993 and Medical Ordinance, No. 26 of 1927 as amended.

This decision is dated 20th of December, 2022 and I would like to table* that.

Sir, I would like to further say that this is totally unacceptable. I am appealing to the President of the country, who knows these people personally, to look into that. This had happened under the rule of the new President Ranil Wickremesinghe. I am appealing to him, because he knows this situation, to restore confidence in

the business community. Please make sure that the law is properly implemented. How can a JMO suspended by the SLMC give a second report on the death of Mr. Schaffter, contradicting his first report? This is absolutely ridiculous! We have seen these things happening before. There have been lots of issues that have gone unresolved like this. Therefore, we cannot permit this situation to go on.

Sir, we need to build investor confidence.

) ) ( () - ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Suren Raghavan - State Minister of Higher Education) Hon. Presiding Member, I echo the statement by Martin Luther King who ostensibly said, Injustice anywhere is a hindrance to justice everywhere. I stand with the Hon. Member of the Opposition, who just spoke, on that.

Chandra Schaffter and his family are close to my family. But, it is sad to see a spiritual and a learned man like the previous speaker taking up a questionable death as a vehicle to critique the Government. We should not fall into that low level, if we have any understanding of humanity.
