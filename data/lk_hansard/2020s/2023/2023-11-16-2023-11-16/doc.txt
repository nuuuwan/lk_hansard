So, that was in Greece and so was it in Spain and Portugal. That was the model through which they came out of that situation after facing many difficulties with assistance of the international community and monetary institutions. , - - , .

, . , . , . The relief measures that have been announced now in the Budget include 1.3 million public sector employees and 700,000 pensioners. Also, the allocation for the "Aswesuma" programme will go up from Rs. 60 billion to Rs. 183 billion. So, we have increased that allocation for relief by three times. We have increased the allocation for relief to those sectors to ease their present cost of living, which has recorded an increase during the last two years. We accept that. All the reports have shown the difficulties the public is going through. That is why we need to cushion the impact on those sectors, the people who need relief and the people who are working. So, such sectors have been recognized and a massive allocation has been made through the Budget.

[3.59 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, I am pleased to follow the Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana, Minister of Industries and Minister of Health, who justified this Budget from the perspective of his political ideology and his commitment to this Government.

May I, at the outset, refer to what the President had said yesterday at the annual Post-Budget Forum organized by the "Daily FT" and the University of Colombo MBA Alumni Association. There, he had given a pragmatic perspective of the dynamic nature of the Budget, 2024, stressing its task as a flexible framework for the future rather than rigid estimates. Having said that, he also had taken a dig at our Colleague, the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne, who, opening the Budget Debate on behalf of the Opposition, mentioned that this Budget is a

"Disneyland Budget". For that, the President had responded yesterday saying, Yes, we were in the house of horror in Disneyland and I have just taken them out of it. That is a tongue-in-cheek statement by the President and if I am to use the same metaphor, I would respond saying, "Yes, the President is trying to take the entire country on a roller-coaster ride, in which you have ups and downs, steep climbs, deep falls as well as very harsh turns, with all of which this country and its people are made to feel that they are having a temporary exhilarating experience, but then once the wheels come off from the trains in the roller coaster, they all will have to face serious problems". When the wheels come off, those who have asked the people to get on the roller coaster may not be there; they would not ride the roller coaster. The President and his bureaucrats who have prepared this Budget may not be on the roller coaster, but the others, the poor people, would have finally suffered. To use the same metaphor, I would describe this simply as a roller-coaster ride giving a temporary exhilaration to themselves and nothing but that.

Then, I would also like to draw your attention to another reference by the President yesterday. He said, We are keeping our fingers crossed that there will be a ceasefire in Gaza, making it easier for the people of Gaza and the rest of us. The President, having made at least a cursory comment on that, must be congratulated for that particular stand of his. Also, I must comment on what the Prime Minister said this morning in Parliament about Israel's atrocities in the Gaza Strip. It is an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe the entire humanity is facing at the current times. Horrendous war crimes which amount to genocide are being committed in the Occupied Palestinian Territories by the Israel Defence Forces.

Way back in 2005, the United Nations adopted a principle called "R2P" - Responsibility to Protect.

The responsibility to protect was adopted as an international legal concept to enable the international community to intervene when a government ill-treats its own citizens, attacks its own people and commits horrendous crimes within their territory. Through this concept, the international community created the avenue to intervene, overstepping the principles of sovereignty. They also created a centre on international intervention and sovereignty to develop this concept and that concept was used by the western nations to send UN Peacekeeping Forces forcibly to Southern Sudan and to finally create South Sudan as an independent sovereign country and thereafter, to also intervene in Libya and Syria. And of course, previously, the interventions in Iraq could also be justified under the same principle. So, what they did was to destroy all these countries on the pretext of using the R2P - the Responsibility to Protect - principle. But, that very principle is not being used against Israel and that is the issue the Third World Countries are raising today. At least, our nation had the courage to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, but our great neighbour India, unfortunately - we must regret it - has not had the courage to do even that. Such is the influence of the western powers! They have virtually become slaves of the West even in the face of such

733 734

horrible atrocities being committed in the Occupied Territories of Palestine. Therefore, I would urge that our Government must go one step further and be in the forefront to gather the countries in the region and far beyond to put pressure on the United Nations and the UN Security Council to see that an immediate ceasefire is declared and that such horrible events would never be repeated.

Having said that, Sir, I must also refer to the detailed Budget Speech by the President. If you analyse the Budget and the Estimates, you would note that the budgeted revenue is Rs. 4.3 trillion. The Recurrent Expenditure, which is for consumption, alone is almost Rs. 5.4 trillion and the Capital Expenditure is a further Rs. 2.5 trillion, resulting in a total expenditure of Rs. 7.8 trillion! Sir, based on these numbers in the Budget, which was presented based on the Presidents commitment to follow the Samajeewikatha, balanced living, concept in the Vyagghapajja Sutta as professed by the Lord Buddha, the Presidents Budget Estimates are way off! What it translates to have a revenue of Rs. 4.3 trillion and a Recurrent Expenditure of almost Rs. 5.4 trillion, Sir, is, we have to borrow to finance consumption, which is totally against the very concept the President was trying to preach to this House.

Sir, in light of the Presidents elaborate rationalizing of the Samajeewikatha concept, as explained by Lord Buddha in the Vyagghapajja Sutta., let me say this about the expenditure estimates in the Budget, 2024.

The total expenditure estimated in the Budget being at Rs. 7 trillion compared to the Rs. 5.2 trillion in Budget, 2023, it is an increase of over 30 per cent! The expenses of the Presidential Secretariat for 2024 is expected to increase by a further 35 per cent while the estimated expenditure on education in the country is less than what was provided for in 2023, as a percentage of GDP. We have had various experts commenting that for a country to prosper, its education infrastructure needs to be improved. The Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathiranas father, the late Hon. (Dr.) Richard Pathirana, was one of our former Ministers of Education and Higher Education and even during his days, he had been lamenting that we must at least have 6 per cent of GDP allocated for education. But, this Government has barely allocated not even 2 per cent of GDP for education purposes. So, this is the sad state of affairs; this is the situation under the Hon. Presidents concept of Samajeewikatha. Or has he got any other Sutta to explain this concept? This is what I would wish to ask.

The next issue I want to highlight and address today is the impact of the Domestic Debt Optimization. Sir, when the Hon. President, as Minister of Finance, took this step to hit the private sector below the belt and ransack the poor workers of part of their future benefits under the DDO, he rejoiced that he had paved the way to conclude the debt restructuring. To date, Sir, none in this House, including yourself, is aware of the status quo of the debt restructuring. The President says in the Budget Speech

that he is expecting it to be completed by December. If it does not happen by December, God forbid, we will be in deeper trouble.

The saddest part of the assault on the bellies of the private sector EPF and ETF account holders is that a certain segment of the investment community made windfall gains because of the Domestic Debt Restructuring decision. Sir, I would like to ask the Hon. President, who is also the Finance Minister, to disclose to this House the quantum of profits made based on capital gains by the banking sector, the non-bank financial institutions, primary dealers and private investors out of their investments in Government Bonds as at the quarter ended June 2023, post assault on the superannuation funds. Also, I would like him to disclose to this House the quantum of tax paid by the banking sector, the non-bank financial institutions, primary dealers and private investors on the windfall capital gains which accrued to them due to the assault on the superannuation funds. This is in light of the Governor of the Central Bank telling us at the Committee on Public Finance that banking institutions pay over 40 per cent tax and therefore, they had to be too cautious about imposing more tax on them. It is only prudent that the Hon. Minister of Finance discloses to this House the quantum of tax collected in respect of the windfall capital gains made by those people. Sir, I have those numbers. It is very easy to compute. All these institutions publish their financials on a quarterly basis as a mandatory requirement. So, I am requesting the Hon. President as Minister of Finance to disclose to this august Assembly, which is responsible for the finance aspect of the country, the amount of gains those few people have made through the Domestic Debt Optimization programme of the Hon. President. I can tell you the amount of windfall capital gains made by this segment. It is beyond comprehension. The vibe in the capital markets, Sir, is that the Domestic Debt Optimization was the third and the largest bond scam! This is what people are thinking. So, Sir, the President, as Minister of Finance, can prove the market wrong by disclosing the numbers. If he has the courage, let him come out and give us the numbers because it is such a serious matter.

Now, look at what had happened in the sugar scam. Previously, we had this sugar scam where they brought down the tax from Rs. 50 to 25 cents per kilogram overnight and a few importers made a windfall out of it and a rough calculation of the windfall was said to be in the region of Rs. 16 billion. That was during the former Presidents time. Now, the current President does the opposite - the duty on import of sugar was increased from 25 cents to Rs. 50 overnight. That, again, enabled a select set of sugar importers - the Hon. State Minister of Finance is also coming to the House now and he also knows that; you cannot hide it - to make a windfall out of that overnight revision in duties on sugar imports.

The International Monetary Fund is now talking about the Governance Diagnostic Assessment Report. One of the important features of the Governance Diagnostic Assessment Report is to have a proper awareness about the corruption vulnerabilities and to address them.

735 736

[ ]

2023 16

Having promised the IMF that we are going to address our corruption vulnerabilities, we are repeatedly allowing a certain segment of people to act otherwise. One the one hand, under the DDO, you allowed the primary bondholders, the primary dealers, some of our private banks and financial institutions to make a windfall. Hon. State Minister, I call this the third Bond scam. It is a stupendous amount that all these people have made for themselves. So, this is the final result and you are talking about addressing corruption vulnerabilities. On the other hand, see what happened in the sugar scam. Also, take the other issue in the excise sector, the fake stickers on bottles of liquor. That was also exposed in the Committee on Ways and Means thanks to its Chairman Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka. Unless it was exposed there, I do not think the Government or the Excise Department would have been able to discover that type of fraud. Finally, you all have now happily presented a Budget, having totally ignored the serious corruption vulnerabilities that are still existing or continuing to exist. So, unless you address corruption vulnerabilities, there is no way in which you can turn around the country from the abysmal levels to which it has gone, particularly in managing our economy.

Various issues had been raised yesterday at a seminar by a variety of people. Also, there are certain good Proposals in the Budget. Agriculture modernization, fisheries, dairy industry, tourism and export-led manufacturing are all identified as priority development areas along with increased investment in renewable energy and universities.

All those proposals are good. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Okay, Sir.

Sometimes, these expenditure Proposals are very unrealistic. You look at establishing an airport in Hingurakgoda. Of course, it is important for us to have an airport in a place like Hingurakgoda; rather than in Mattala, an airport should have been built in Hingurakgoda. True enough, it is good for our tourism sector. Even yesterday, at the seminar, some in the tourism sector commented on that. I think Mr. Balendra had spoken on behalf of the tourism sector and applauded the Hon. President for having taken that step. But then, what about the second landing strip in the Katunayake Airport? The second runway in the Katunayake Airport is much more important and is a bigger priority than an airport in Hingurakgoda.

Then, last time also, in the Uva Wellassa University, you were trying to establish a medical faculty, saying that

you were allocating Rs. 200 million, whereas the existing Medical Faculty in the Sabaragamuwa University does not have a Professorial Unit. So, first, you have to address the shortcomings in the existing university system before you start new universities. Of course, I must congratulate the Hon. President for having taken some bold steps to bring in reforms in higher education. I have no time to speak in detail about those matters in todays Debate. I shall take them up at the Committee Stage Discussion on the Vote of the Ministry of Education.

Thank you very much, Sir. ( - ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe - State Minister of Finance) , - ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) , . .

Hon. Rauff Hakeem, you made several allegations. I do not want to reply to everything you raised, but as regards the specific note on the DDO, I deny your allegation and there was nothing -

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Give us the numbers. ( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) The numbers were given; the numbers were discussed at the Committee on Public Finance; the numbers were divulged to Parliament and the proposal itself, we debated. The problem is, the suggestion you were making was not considered. That was a different scenario altogether. You have all the right to propose anything. But, if we had not gone through the DDO, Hon. Rauff Hakeem, the country would have collapsed within 48 hours because it would not have paved way for us to go into a restructuring on external debt, which was very crucial for us. So, the DDO was as crucial as external debt restructuring. So, the point you were making regarding the DDO, I would not accept; I would deny that.

On the other hand, yes, there is a Governance Diagnostic Assessment Report from the IMF, which had been published by the Government. We are taking all the measures to ensure that steps are taken to mitigate corruption in the country.

737 738

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Presiding Member, just allow me to make a comment.

I am not at cross purposes with the entire DDO concept itself. But, there is this particular issue of the windfall profits made by the primary dealers, the banks and some of the financial institutions. That quantum is so large and that is why I call it the third Bond scam. Everybody is silent about it. So, why do you not, at least, land a super-tax on them, a super-tax on the monies they had made? Massive amounts had been made!

( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) Hon. Rauff Hakeem, that is your view. You have all the right to propose something. - [Interruption.] But, do you know - I am sure you are aware of it - when the DDO was presented to Parliament by the Government, everybody was happy with that and it was passed?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) But, we objected to that. ( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) Yes, you objected. You have been objecting to most of the things, not only you, specifically the team. So, let us work out matters and how we could strengthen the economy. If we had not gone through the DDO, with the situation we were facing, the countrys economy would have been in a catastrophe again.
