Hon. Speaker, I want to request the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the UN member countries, the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth of Nations, the United Nations Human Rights Council, our development partners - the IMF, the World Bank and the ADB - and the international community to persuade the President and the Government of Sri Lanka to conduct an independent investigation with foreign assistance into the Easter Sunday attacks. We also request the Prime Minister of India, the Hon. Narendra Modi, to provide assistance since India was the first country to warn us regarding the Easter Sunday attacks. Especially, the mystery surrounding a person code-named "Abu Hind" and also Sarah Jasmin should be resolved. We aim to show during the two-day Debate in Parliament that there is enough support in Parliament to conduct an independent investigation with foreign assistance so that justice for the Easter Sunday victims and others who were

injured would be assured and also the citizens of Sri Lanka can go forward in a peaceful environment.

2023 21

[4.40 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, for the opportunity to say a few words.

The previous speaker concluded by saying that there is "karma" and those who caused this carnage will suffer eventually. His words have already come true. The former President, who was supposed to have engineered this and come to power, was chased away by the people of this country from that seat in an unprecedented way. So, perhaps, karma does follow, according to the Hon. Member's belief.

Many people who said, We cannot allow any international investigation; that is a violation of the sovereignty of this country are now calling for an international investigation. That is also a turnaround. When we said an international investigation would be the only independent inquiry into the excesses that were said to have been committed during the civil war, many said, No, our Constitution does not allow it". The Constitution states nothing about that. In fact, the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms, when he was in the Opposition, presented a Private Members Bill, in which he provided for international judges to inquire into allegations against Superior Court Judges. He did not think that that was unconstitutional at that time. Many, today, do not think that that is unconstitutional; it is not unconstitutional. In any case, with regard to the civil war, there had been international inquires. There was the Panel of Experts and also the OISL inquiry and those Reports are available. The Government also agreed to a hybrid court in 2015 and later, resiled from that endorsement and said, We have a co-sponsorship and we are now withdrawing from it. I am reminding these matters because even in a matter where the State and another party were involved in a battle, the only possible independent inquiry could be an international one because the State was one side to the conflict. Of course, there had been many inquiries, as I said, but there has to be prosecution stemming from that.

Coming to the Easter bomb attack, when the Parliamentary Select Committee reported its findings in October, 2019, we very specifically pointed to what is being said now. Even in the Executive Summary, we raised the question as to whether this was done in order to create in the country a call for a strong leader with the Presidential Election due to happen later in the year. We said that because everything pointed towards that; there was no hard evidence, but all circumstantial evidence pointed towards that and now, that is slowly but surely being revealed.

I must say that today, again, many accept what the "Channel 4" has revealed with regard to the Easter bombings. The same "Channel 4", several years ago, put out two other documentaries called "Sri Lanka's Killing Fields" and "Sri Lanka's Killing Fields 2". Lots of things were said about the documentaries, but even those who

decried those are now basing their reliance on the documentary now released. We know that what it says is true because there are several instances that we are personally aware of, which fit in with the story that is being told in it.

Then, Sir, I want to refer to one matter. That is not altogether in the "Channel 4" revelation, but in Azad Maulanas voice recording and in his statement made to the OHCHR, he has revealed that. But, before doing that, I must make a disclosure in terms of Section 19 of "The Code of Conduct for Members of Parliament" about my involvement in some of these matters, as I have appeared for them. I appeared in the High Court of Batticaloa when the Hon. Sivanesathurai Santhirakanthan was granted bail; I appeared for the aggrieved party and objected to bail being granted in November, 2020. So, I had some involvement in the matter and I must disclose it in terms of Section 19 of "The Code of Conduct for Members of Parliament". I must also refer to Standing Order No. 83 (1), which states that the personal conduct of certain personalities, including judges, should not be subject to reference in a speech in Parliament. I am saying that because I am going to refer to some conduct of judges, but that is not personal conduct, in their official capacity. So, I am not violating any Standing Orders either.

Azad Maulana very clearly sets out how Pillayan was granted bail first and then released from that case. He mentions names of judges. Although I can mention the names of those judges here, I am not mentioning them for the sake of propriety. When a confession made by a co-accused was admitted in evidence by the High Court of Batticaloa, Moulana says there was a meeting, which he attended along with the judge, and it was planned that an appeal would be made and that judge would then dismiss that confession as inadmissible evidence, and that, in fact, happened! The name of the judge he mentions is the judge who gave that order. Incidentally, that judge, who is a Judge of the Supreme Court today - this is a very serious matter - was an accused in a bribery case a few years ago heard before the Magistrate's Court of Colombo. He was prevented from sitting as a judge during that time, but when Government changed, that charge before the Magistrate's Court was withdrawn. Later, he was promoted and now, he is a sitting Judge of the Supreme Court. Is this not a shocking thing that is happening in this country? Apparently, it was he who had a meeting planned and said, I will rule that that confession is inadmissible and the Attorney-General can thereafter say that there is no evidence to continue to prosecute Pillayan". The Attorney-General apparently objected to that - I must salute former Attorney-General Dappula de Livera for that - and he had mentioned about Deputy Solicitor General Madhawa Tennakoon also not wanting to accede to that request.

I know some of these to be true because I appeared in the High Court before a special judge. Azath Moulana says how that special judge came to be appointed because the judge who was sitting there had refused to comply with this and wanted a transfer and he was transferred out to Colombo. I know that he was transferred to Colombo. And, another judge who was sitting in Vavuniya at that

2771 2772

time was approached to do this and that judge, in order to get out of this difficult situation, had said, "The Parliamentarian who was killed, the Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham, was a Tamil Catholic and if a Hindu or a Muslim judge releases Pillayan, there will be a suspicion. So, let us find a Tamil Catholic judge". Then, he spoke to a Tamil Catholic judge and got him appointed to Batticaloa as a special judge to hear this bail application. That is how the matter was taken up in the Batticaloa High Court.

( ) (The Hon. Sivanesathurai Santhirakanthan) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , point of Order ?

( ) (The Hon. Sivanesathurai Santhirakanthan) .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is not a point of Order, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Sivanesathurai Santhirakanthan) , . .

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) It is not a point of Order. Hon. Sumanthiran, please continue.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I knew this would be raised. That is why I clarified it at the beginning. So, this is not a point of Order. - [Interruption.]

I appeared before the High Court in Batticaloa, before that special judge and objected to bail being granted and the judge was taken aback. - [Interruption.] He said that I had no status to appear. It is all a matter of record. - [Interruption.] It is all a matter of record and he adjourned proceedings, took about half an hours recess - probably

made some telephone calls - then came and said, Ah, okay, you make your submissions and still granted bail. That day, we could not leave the court room in Batticaloa because there were people lined up.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have one more minute. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir. - [Interruption.] There, Sir, he is still making a threat; he is making a threat now, again.

So, there were people lined up and we had to be given special protection to go out of the court room that day. The recent documentary on "Channel 4" shows how, when he came out, all that crowd was there to greet him because they knew he was coming out that day. All this had been planned. I am a witness to many of these things that happened and that is why I am placing it on record here. Everybody knows about Pillayan. Somebody has said that Pillayan is, very soon, going to publish a list of murders he had committed. Nobody cares about him, but I am concerned about the judges who are still serving and who had been a party to this great betrayal of the trust of the people.

Thank you.

Thank you for raising with us Sri Lankas request for an independent investigation into the Easter Sunday attacks. The bombings that took place on April 21, 2019, were both shocking and horrific, tragically claiming the lives of 269 people, including five U.S. citizens, and injuring hundreds of other innocent people. In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, and continuing to the present day, the U.S. government provided assistance in the investigation and prosecution of those responsible - to the point that the Department of Justice filed a criminal complaint in January 2021 against those deemed responsible for the deaths of U.S. citizens. In light of that, even as we stand ready to continue providing support to your government, it would not make sense for the United States to conduct an additional investigation into the attacks.

Let me repeat that, Sir, In light of that, even as we stand ready to continue providing support to your government, it would not make sense for the United States to conduct an additional investigation into the attacks. We received this email on the 07th of April, 2022 addressed to Ambassador Mahinda Samarasinghe. Sir, I table* that.

, Australian Federal Police ... 2022 21 :

"In response to your correspondence dated 29 March 2022, as to whether the AFP have any productions, pending reports or conclusions in relation to the 2019 Easter Sunday terrorist attack. I can advise that the AFP have completed all investigations in conjunction with Sri Lanka Police and provided reports and conclusions to those authorities. A summary of the actions undertaken by the AFP are as follows."
