Question No. 5 - 693/2023 - (1), the Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I know the Hon. Minister of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Facilities Development is not here. Anyway, I would like to bring up a matter of urgent interest to the attention of the Hon. Leader of the House because it could cause a major issue in Batticaloa. Sir, for the last three weeks - almost for 23 days with today - a protest has been going

on because a pasture land has been encroached upon and the livestock farmers are protesting against it. The paddy season is going to start within the next week and if the cattle there are not moved into that pasture land, there is going to be a huge conflict. I am not talking about a herd of cattle of about 20,000 or 40,000.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, thank you very much. But, you cannot ask questions beyond the subject matter of the Question.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Sir, because the relevant Minister is not here, let me, at least, bring this matter to the attention of the Hon. Leader of the House.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Anyway, be very brief about it. ( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Sir, I will be very brief.

Hon. Leader of the House, I would like to urge you to intervene in this matter because we are talking about a herd of 400,000 cattle. If the cattle are not taken to that pasture land, farmers cannot start the cultivation season. They have to start it between the 05th and the 15th based on the rain received. Therefore, we would like to urge the Government to stop the illegal encroachments and as a sign of protest, -

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . .

[4.07 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) Madam Presiding Member, today, we have a very important Debate on the Adjournment Motion presented by the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne. From morning, various MPs from both sides of the aisle spoke about the brain drain, presenting various data relating to that. Without going into great detail, all I can tell you is that that data is very scary; it is shocking. More than 10,000 professionals have left the country in the last few years! If you look at it, it is an increase of about 150 per cent.

The Hon. Sajith Premadasa spoke about the brain drain scenario in this country and how other countries, because of our situation, are having a brain gain. Madam, our people are very intelligent and capable. If they leave the country and go overseas, within a matter of years, they start doing very well. We see this in countries such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand and England. If our people go overseas, whatever ethnicity they belong to - they may be Sinhalese, Tamils, Burghers, Malays or Muslims - they start doing very well. But, why have our people not done well in this country? I think that is a fundamental question we must also ask ourselves.

We must also ask why our professionals and their kids are leaving this country and going overseas. What is the main cause? Is there one particular reason we can isolate and say, "This is the cause why they are leaving"? I listened to some of the speeches made today. Various MPs from both sides of the aisle, some juniors and some seniors, gave various reasons for it. My thinking is, our people - the younger generation, the seniors and the professionals - leave this country simply because they do not have any hope in this country any more. They do not have an iota of hope about their future. If they remain here, what are they going to do? If they let their kids to stay on here, what are they going to do? What would be their future? Could they find a job they would like to do here after studying so long and so hard? Or would they have to just make ends meet? Those are the questions that parents and kids ask today.

What is the cause for this hopelessness? Is it simply the ailing economy or is it just lack of opportunity? Is it because of the non-availability of jobs or even if there are

jobs, is it because of the very poor pay? Or is it due to the increasing cost of living? The gas prices are up; fuel prices are up; electricity bills are soaring; water bills are soaring; taxes are being increased; industries are falling down. Like I mentioned earlier, there is also lack of employment. Then, the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senarathne mentioned about the issues in the health sector. The health sector is also falling apart.

If you look at the history of this country, the past, in 1971, we had the JVP insurrection; in 1983, the start of the LTTE and again, a JVP insurrection in 1988-89 and LTTE atrocities in 1994. So, if we look at the statistics and the history, we can go on and on mentioning how things failed in this country at least once in every ten years. I am not going to delve into that any more, but the data is there and when you look at it, it is very depressing.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) I wish to inform you, Madam Presiding Member, that I get seven minutes from the time allotted to the Hon. S.M. Marikkar, and I have a text as well to prove it.

So, Madam Presiding Member, the question is, what do we need to do? If you look at the "Aswesuma" programme, it is an utter failure. People were queuing up, filling up appeals, protesting and asking for relief, but the Government did not act in time.

At the same time, the Government is bringing in Bills which are not favourable for democracy or good governance. If you look at the Online Safety Bill, it is an anti-social media Bill; . So, there is going to be lawlessness and lack of discipline. I also heard another Member of Parliament talking about discipline in this country. Madam Presiding Member, you know that this week, we have been having "Eval", the Evaluation Week, and you were a member of the panel discussion today. That was a conference held at the Galadari Hotel to share expertise from all over the country and the basic target we wanted to achieve through "Eval" is to bring in the Evaluation Bill. Madam, as you know, we were talking about the Evaluation Bill from 2018. I was the Chairman of the Subcommittee which drafted that Evaluation Bill. But, unfortunately, for the last so many years, we have not been able to bring in that Bill. My thinking is, if you have a proper process for monitoring and evaluation under a Monitoring and Evaluation Bill - yes, it is not an answer to all our problems - as a country which has declared itself bankrupt, especially in the future when projects are identified and money is allocated, we can identify projects which are good and bad for the country.

Madam Presiding Member, you heard the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Sajith Premadasa, declaring his

701 702

()

2023 06

support for monitoring and evaluation. So, during this Evaluation Week, we heard Mr. Sagala Ratnayaka, representing the Government, declaring that they are for monitoring and evaluation and also the Leader of Opposition declaring that he is also for it. We have built up support in Parliament to present a Monitoring and Evaluation Bill. However, the problem today is not the lack of political will, but the senior officers of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service; they are opposing it. When you ask them, "Why are you opposing it?", the reason they give is, "It will create more work for us to do, burden us further and also the cost will increase". The senior public servants are building kingdoms around them, trying to protect their jobs. But what they do not understand is, what they are committed to do is to protect this country and the future of this country.

Madam Presiding Member, I do not wish to talk any further since the time is limited.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have four more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) Okay, Madam.

So, we need to build up cross-party support and certainly, work together in terms of bringing in good Bills.

I will also tell you what is wrong with this Government. It is not a case of lack of political will. The problem is the President, on principle, wants to liberalize or open up the economy, but the majority of the Government MPs in Parliament and those in the Cabinet do not believe in that. So, where do we go from here? Will there be another aragalaya? I pray not, but if things continue in the same way, if there is no economic relief and if we are going to have continuous brain drain - professionals of this country are leaving for greener pastures - where will all that lead us as a country? So, what is the solution for this? It is my belief, Madam, that we must have a new system. We must bring back those professionals; we must bring in a new set of Members of Parliament who are committed to change this country around. If you do not bring about that new situation or have a new system in place very soon, I think, unfortunately, another "aragalaya" will start and the younger generation of this country will have no hope at all and they all will leave the country. Then, there would be a very unfortunate situation, but I do believe that this situation could be changed around, given the proper political leadership, the proper government leadership and even proper leadership at the district level. So, it is a hopeless situation that we have at present.

But, I do live in hope. As my father used to say, . . .
