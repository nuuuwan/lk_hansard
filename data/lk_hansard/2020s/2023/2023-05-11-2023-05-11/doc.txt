( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. You have 11 minutes.

[11.15 a.m.] .. : ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, for the opportunity to say a few words at this Debate on the disaster that befell this country two years ago when the "MV X-Press Pearl" caught fire and sank off the coast of Sri Lanka.

But, before I get to that point, I wish to remind ourselves, as has been done in the House since yesterday and today as well, that around this time last year, the country was going through an upheaval, an "aragalaya" and I heard moments ago the Chief Government Whip saying that they had nothing against the peaceful protesters, but only against those who resorted to violence and attacked Members of Parliament and others; he repeatedly said that he had no complaint against the peaceful protesters.

How did the peaceful protest that had been going on for more than a month become violent? That is a crucial question. What happened on the 09th of May, 2022? On the 09th of May, the protest was still peaceful until - I am glad the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is here in the House when I say this - those very people who had gathered at Temple Trees to meet him rushed after the meeting to the Galle Face and beat up the peaceful protesters. That is when the violence started, everyone knows that. The Members on the Government ranks are also saying that it was peaceful. President Ranil Wickremesinghe even tweeted around this time last year saying, "If the Government attacks peaceful protesters like this, I will stop helping the Government with regard to the economic recovery". So, all know that. But, to this day, no one of them have been apprehended except for one person, I believe, today or yesterday. So, that is when the violence started. There is no point in saying that there were political opponents who were behind the violence. That was counterviolence. After those goons were sent from the Temple Trees to go and attack the peaceful protesters, yes, there was some counterviolence. We condemn both. We have consistently condemned both. We have condemned the violence and we have also condemned the counterviolence, but it is important to note and have on record as to who started the violence.

At this Debate which discusses matters with regard to the ship disaster, I want to say one more thing. That whole "aragalaya" or the peaceful protest was to make changes. People were disgusted with what was happening in the country, the status quo with regard to political power and how that was being used. That is why they wanted the then incumbent President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to leave. The second request was for the Twentieth

431 432

[ ]

1013 22

Amendment to the Constitution to be repealed. Third, for the Executive Presidency to be abolished. I have heard many people, including the President, say that the peaceful protest was hijacked by some people. Maybe, it was hijacked or it seemed to have been hijacked at that time, but the real hijackers of the "aragalaya" are still in the Government led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

The whole peoples movement for change was hijacked and turned around with eyewash Amendments - the Twenty First Amendment, a mockery of the election of the President - and the same status quo continues. That is a hijacking of the peoples movement for change. And, I want to say this: that kind of action will not last. When a people decide that they want change, it will happen; it might take time, but it will happen.

Sir, with regard to this Debate - I should have started speaking at least an hour ago - it seems to me that some Members in the House are more concerned about saying that they were not responsible for what happened. One says, I am not responsible and the other says, No, you are responsible. This forum is being used to justify their little involvement in this whole thing. The disaster that has befallen this country as a result of this ship burning and sinking is far more than that. The environment of this country will take decades, if not another century, to recover from the damage it has caused. The plastic pellets that were released to the sea will take 500 to 1,000 years to dissolve. This is, perhaps, the greatest man-made environmental disaster that has happened to the country. But, here, all we are doing is, throwing a little mud at this one and then, that compliment being returned by him. That is what is happening.

With regard to the issue of the ship disaster itself, I want to say a few things. That is, the issue of legal action will not be affected by this Debate. So, I thank the Hon. Speaker for the decision made and the Party Leaders also for taking that decision. I must also put on record as a legal practitioner that when there is a choice of forum to be made and when you have more than one forum to which you can go for relief, there are various factors that come into consideration and all of that cannot be revealed. I agree with the Hon. Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms that there are certain issues which cannot be made public. It has been decided, for a good or a bad reason, that you go to the court in Singapore. I am glad about that because the court in Singapore is bound to be far more impartial and more professional. But, the question that arises is this. The Hon.Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam raised it yesterday and I want to raise it again today. In a matter such as this, in a commercial damages issue, you have no problem going to a foreign court. But, it is a very serious matter that when the victims of injustice, who, after 14 years, are still waiting for justice and have no confidence in the local process, ask for international involvement, you steadfastly refuse it. For what reason? You want to present a Bill to establish a TRC, a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Any TRC process must be victim-centred. That process cannot succeed or you cannot even start it without the victims being satisfied with it. And here, the victims are saying, All right, there

were two sides to the conflict. One side cannot decide, one side cannot control the proceedings; then, that is not independent. For the process to be independent, it must be impartial and if it is to be impartial, it must necessarily be international. So, I am raising that question again.

It is a shame that in this Parliament, some are talking about what was discussed then. What was discussed is totally immaterial. What matters is the order given. A very clear order had been given by the then Secretary of the Foreign Ministry to the Navy Commander to take that ship away. That was the final decision. If you want, you go and challenge that decision. That order was given by the then Secretary to

the Foreign Ministry. If you want to challenge the Secretary to the Foreign Ministry, challenge his Minister also. Who was the Minister at that time? The Minister was the current Prime Minister, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena. . . . . ? . , , . ? . , . ? ? ? ?

Finally, I would say, please, at least try to bring some dignity to this Parliament now. People have rejected this Parliament. People have rejected these people because of the way they are behaving and talking. So, let us change that. When the people outside are saying, All the 225 Members inside this Parliament are rogues, you are adding to that by just speculating and pointing fingers at innocent Members. Do not do that! By doing that, you are shaming yourselves.

Thank you very much. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) ( . : ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) , . , . . . . . , " , " . , , , - - . .

[5.14 p.m.]

: : ( - ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed - Minister of Environment) Hon. Presiding Member, thank you for the opportunity given to me to speak at this important Debate on the "X-Press Pearl" incident, which is the worst maritime disaster to have struck Sri Lanka. Almost after two years since the tragedy, we, the nature-loving Sri Lankans, are still deeply saddened and traumatized by the irreparable damage caused to our marine ecosystem and to the lives and livelihoods of the coastal communities by this disaster, which is one of the worst marine disasters in the world history.

The disaster has had a significant impact on Sri Lankas sensitive coastal environment, local communities

and the economy. Moreover, the event still continues to unfold and its active pollution generation phase will only come to a closure with the elimination of the risks from the wreck and the containers lost at sea.

This Debate is intended not to make another post-mortem on the incident, but to look beyond for a realistic and scientific damage assessment, recovery of the loss and damage in the form of compensation and to take all possible measures to avert such disasters in the future. The "MV X-Press Pearl" maritime disaster led to a number of discourses on the countrys maritime laws and policies, the response to the disaster and also on the medium-term to long-term impacts of the same. While the Government has taken various measures in this regard, many are pointing out the importance of going beyond the immediate measures. That is because the impacts of the incident have a great potential to affect the countrys marine ecosystem and the fisheries industry-based economy.

Madam, the "MV X-Press Pearl" disaster occurred on 25th May, 2021, when the Singapore-flagged container ship caught fire in Sri Lankan waters, North-west of Colombo releasing chemical fumes. The ship carried 1,486 containers with chemicals including those carrying more than 50 billion plastic pellets, low and high density polythene, methanol, sodium methoxide, nitric acid, urea, vinyl acetate, epoxy resin and lubricant oil. There were 81 potentially hazardous containers also, those carrying lithium-ion batteries, copper slags, lead ingots and electronic items which typically contain dangerous compounds. The Government of the Hon. President Ranil Wickremesinghe has realized the importance of assessing the exact and actual damage caused by the disaster and therefore, a decision was taken in March, this year by the Parliamentary Sectoral Oversight Committee on Environment, Natural Resources and Sustainable Development to re-summon the relevant parties to further review matters pertaining to the "MV X-Press Pearl" disaster, which included discussing and settling the legal matters, obtaining financial facilities for the scientific committee for its research and removing the legal obstacles to reach the ship for research.

The "MV X-Press Pearl" disaster entailed several forms of threats to the environment. While air pollution, which was created by the fire that erupted on the vessel, was the immediate threat, various forms of contents in the containers such as plastics and chemicals spilling into the sea was identified as a much bigger, long-term threat. In addition, a large quantity of various parts of the ship falling into the sea was also identified as a threat. The disaster was a multi-faceted and a complicated disaster which involved numerous environmental issues that could have significant long-term, medium-term and short-term consequences.

I will be failing in my duty as the Minister in charge of the environment if I do not recognize the commendable and efficient clean-up campaign of the plastic spill carried out by the armed forces despite the operational constraints such as the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions.

541 542

I take this opportunity to thank all of them profoundly for their hard work and restoring the affected areas, making them accessible to the public within a short period of time.

On the numerous impacts of the disaster, a study was conducted from October to December, 2021 to document the chemical contamination in the coastal waters from Negombo to Bentota by analysing, among others, the water samples, the biological samples and biotoxins. Biotoxins are chemical substances produced by bacteria, plants and fungi, which serve as a biological defence and poison. I would like to share some of the findings of the study, which are important in post-disaster recovery and in obtaining compensation.

First, let us take the environmental impacts. Looking at the disaster from an environmental impact point of view, the Report findings have revealed that the average pH of the coastal sites that were affected has decreased. Also, the average nitrate concertation in the affected coastal areas has revealed a rise in the nitrate concentrations. It is widely known that nitric acid and urea were being transported by the "MV X-Press Pearl" ship and the high nitrate levels in the coastal waters have been caused by the high nitrogen content released during the disaster. It is ironical that Sri Lanka had to face such an eventuality when the country has led the United Nations Environment Assembly - UNEA - with a Resolution on Sustainable Nitrogen Management and is also following the Colombo Declaration to halve nitrogen waste by 2030.

Then, the impact on the change in the COD - Chemical Oxygen Demand - which is the measure of the capacity of the water to consume oxygen during the decomposition of organic matter in the water. The COD of the immediate vicinity of the ship was exceptionally high, but the COD of the distant areas was relatively low. That reveals that the inorganic and organic compounds released by the ship have contaminated coastal water, leading to pollution.

In addition, the concentrations of chlorophyll-a, which allows plants, including algae, the process of photosynthesis, in the coastal belt were found to be the highest in areas near the disaster while the lowest was along the Bentota coastal belt. It shows that due to various resultant processes in the sea, the ecological balance in the marine water around the area where the "MV X-Press Pearl" ship sank has been threatened.

Madam, one of the most serious environmental problems posed by the disaster was the turtle deaths. According to the Department of Wildlife Conservation, 50 dead turtles had washed up on the beach as of 20th May, 2021 and soon after the disaster, there was an increase in the number of turtle deaths with 176 deaths on 30th June, 2021, 250 on 17th July, 2021, and 417 on 30th July, 2021.

On a continuous basis, carcasses were collected until upto five to six months after the disaster and 45 cetacean

carcasses were recorded on 17th July, 2021. Since the incident, 56 marine mammals including 48 dolphins and eight whales have washed up on the beach. However, it is important to highlight that the shipwreck and the lost containers pose a danger to marine wildlife due to potential chemical and oil pollution sources until they are recovered.

Furthermore, marine wildlife could be harmed by the ingestion of or entanglement with plastic pellets, polyester yarns and other debris from the incident. According to marine wildlife experts, plastic pellets may also pose a danger to turtle reproduction because their presence in nesting sites may alter sediment temperature, which is a critical factor in determining the sex of turtle offspring. The plastic spill occurred during the crucial nesting season of the turtles - from April to May - when their number in Sri Lankas coastal waters is at its highest.

Then, let us look at its economic and social impacts. The disasters impacts were not only environmental, but also social and economic. The disaster has had a significant impact on the incomes of particularly the Sri Lankan coastal fishing communities, whose livelihoods are dependent on the fishing grounds that were contaminated by the incidents pollution. The reduction in the supply of fish, shrip, crabs et cetera had significantly affected the Sri Lankan consumer overall. Furthermore, public fear of consuming contaminated fish exacerbated by a substantial increase in turtle and dolphin deaths harmed consumer confidence, particularly, in the early weeks of the incident. As a result, sales and consumption of seafood reduced across the country. In a country where seafood accounts for 70 per cent of its animal protein intake, this has significant implications on food security and could cause malnutrition.

Madam, in terms of the impact on the livelihoods, it was reported that due to various steps taken in the aftermath of the disaster, including restrictions on fishing activities in the surrounding areas, the livelihoods of 20,000 fishing families were affected, while those of many others, from net manufacturers to boat owners whose livelihoods depend on allied fishing activities, have also been affected. What is more, the impact on the surrounding population has been significant with estimates putting the number of fishermen affected at around 16,000. Damages to the fishing nets and gears also account in calculating the impact on the livelihood of the fishing community.

The "MV X-Press Pearl" fire has disrupted the fisheries supply chain from fishers to processors and to wholesalers to retail merchants. On the other hand, it increased the complexity of the fishing community in the existing structural economic and social imbalance because they are daily income earners. The coastal fishing community, which is one of the three sub-sectors of Sri Lankas fisheries sector, is the most vulnerable. The ability of a fishermans family to meet their basic needs is significantly impacted on by the loss of even a single day's income. Furthermore, most of those who work in this field have no other sources of income. The

543 544

cost of replacing nets and boat parts is very high and their loss can significantly impact on a fishermans earnings for the entire season. As a result, a wide range of people whose livelihoods depend on related fishing operations, from net manufacturers to boat owners, have been impacted differently. The "MV X-Press Pearl" container ship disaster harmed the fishery development in the affected areas and the economic and environmental damages incurred due to the disaster are enormous.

Then, compensation. With such far-reaching environmental, economic and social consequences created by the disaster, the Government has estimated that our compensation claim would amount to US Dollars 6.2 billion. Accordingly, the Government has already filed a compensation claim in Singapore and Cabinet approval has been granted to that effect. The Government believes that filing the compensation lawsuit in Singapore will result in a number of key advantages. Firstly, the defendants of the prospective litigation have a business presence in Singapore as companies domiciled in Singapore and as such, the enforceability of a judgment delivered in Singapore would be comparatively feasible against such parties.

Secondly, given Singapores status as an internationally recognized maritime hub with an advanced judicial system to handle complex maritime matters, Sri Lanka would be in a conducive position to attract international attention to the full extent on the impact and gravity of the irreversible contamination caused to Sri Lankas marine environment by the plastic nurdle pellets discharged from the "X-Press Pearl".

Moreover, in terms of the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims of 1976, a judgment delivered by any court of competent jurisdiction on the "X-Press Pearl" incident should be limited to British Sterling Pounds equivalent to 19.8 million Special Drawing Rights plus interest in respect of all claims. Therefore, a judgment delivered by any court eventually has to be enforced either in the jurisdiction of Singapore, where the ship owner is domiciled, or in the jurisdiction of London, where the insurer is domiciled. Madam, the Government is confident that an international court can provide the necessary compensation, which has been estimated by the expert committee to be around US Dollars 6.2 billion. In addition, there are four lawsuits related to the "MV X-Press Pearl" incident in Sri Lanka, out of which three have been filed by the public seeking compensation for the fishing community in the western coastline.

Then, prevention of marine disasters in the future. Now that Sri Lanka has gone ahead with the short-term

remedial counter measures, the ultimate real progress for Sri Lanka would be to emerge from this traumatic experience with a more resilient system for preventing and responding to future maritime disasters. This would require a multi-year initiative which would include, one, the development of a maritime disaster plan, building on the existing National Oil Spill Contingency Plan - NOSCP, two, strengthening the institutional basis for its implementation and three, a capacity building and training programme for all stakeholders.

Madam, an initiative of this scale depends on forging a solidarity coalition between the Government of Sri Lanka and its international friends and partners. Success will ultimately depend on coordinated action among diverse actors and therefore, it is important to have a designated mechanism to organize international support. That will result in reinforcing Sri Lankas efforts to consolidate its position as a global maritime and logistical hub while assuring greater protection of ocean health, fishery resources and Sri Lankas position in world trade.

In conclusion, I wish to appeal to my fellow Parliamentarians, particularly to those from the Opposition - unfortunately, no one is here - to be national-minded in our fight to ensure justice to our damaged ecosystem and to the affected communities of this country and request them not to disturb the fragile, delicate compensation process by strengthening the defendants. We know that in complex international lawsuits of this nature, the final amount of compensation that would be awarded would depend on the strength of evidence presented to support the claim. Therefore, I urge the Opposition not to behave in an irresponsible manner by divulging sensitive information pertaining to the case in Parliament and outside, which will result in weakening our claim. I, therefore, request all Members of the Opposition to act with restraint in this national cause and support the good work done by the Hon. President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Government in bringing justice for the worst maritime disaster in the history of Sri Lanka.

Thank you very much. , : . . Question put, and agreed to. .. 5.33, 2023 12 .. 9.30 : .
