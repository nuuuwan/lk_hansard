( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Sumanthiran? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir.

Hon. Minister, yesterday, there was a very serious issue in the Batticaloa District. You might have heard that when an inter-religious group went to the Mailaththamadu area, there was another group of people who stopped, detained and held them captive for six hours, taking their vehicle keys away and so on. It took the police four hours to get there later. There was a very tense situation. Then, the police had gone and dispersed them, but no one has been arrested or apprehended for doing that. There was also an attempted assault on a Hindu priest. So, it was a very serious situation that went on from 1.00 p.m. till about 7.00 p.m. yesterday. Hon. Minister, I wanted to draw your attention to that and ask the police to immediately take action against those who did this. It was an inter-religious, dignitaries' group that went there.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you, Hon. Member.

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) Hon. Member, do you want me to answer? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes.

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) About that incident, we also got to know. That place is about 40 kilometres away from the police station and whoever who went there had not informed anyone. They had just gone into the jungle area and started videoing and taking photographs of the people there. That is how this incident had started. Then, the people there had blocked them, taken their cameras and called the police and they were waiting for the police to come. I know that the Batticaloa Police Division had spoken to both parties over the phone when they were there. Both a father and a Buddhist priest who spoke to them had said, No, there is no issue. As soon as your police officers come, we will settle the matter and disperse. That is the report I got last evening while it was happening.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) .

The local guidelines had not been in line with the World Health Organizations Provisional Clinical Practice Guidelines on COVID-19 suspected and confirmed patients and its recommendations, particularly when it came to the disposal of dead bodies of COVID victims. You followed a totally different guideline based on the recommendations of an Expert Committee. Regarding that, there had been a controversy from the very outset, but all of which had totally been ignored. So, deviating from the Guidelines of the World Health Organization, you all adopted your own guidelines as against the entire international community and nowhere else was such a new procedure adopted. Therefore, would the Ministry of Health admit - this is in line with the question I asked last time - at least now, that it had violated the Guidelines of the World Health Organization or followed a different procedure by being misguided? At least against those who misguided the Health Ministry, you must take action.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Hon. Member, regarding both your questions on deviating from the accepted norms of the World Health Organization, I cannot comment right now. But, what I can comment right now is that the Expert Committee was appointed by the authorities who were handling the COVID issue at that point of time. So, whether you are challenging the Committee or the action taken by that Committee is another thing which we have to deal with separately. As far as the Ministry of Health is concerned, that Committee was appointed with due concern and I also believe that they have the right to do so. I can cite a few countries which have their own local health systems in place. So, as far as they are concerned, they have the right to appoint such committees. But, if you are questioning their activities and whatever recommendations they made, those have to be dealt with separately.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Minister, my question, repeatedly, is this. It had been openly admitted subsequently by several people and now, by your own Ministry officials.

You did give an undertaking that if there was an issue like this, you will conduct an internal inquiry. So, we just want you to go ahead and conduct that inquiry and make it public so that this matter could be put to rest.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) That is exactly what I said right now. At that point of time, I said I would do so, but I can tell you offhand that the position held or the decision of that particular group was legal because they had the right to do so. Whether the WHO had given its approval for that or whether it was contrary to the decision of any other international organization is another issue. As you have made a request saying that so many people have, from time to time, made various comments against what was set out at that point of time, let me look into it. I have already asked the DG to look into it and give us a report. But, I think I might have to appoint a better or rather a comprehensive committee to look into it because they were all professionals who were in the Expert Committee. I just do not want to decide over a decision those professionals had taken. But, I will certainly consider your request and appoint a very comprehensive and a competent committee to submit a report on that. I honestly do not know whether a committee could be appointed to go into a committee approved and appointed at that time and which made a commitment. So, I will have to seek legal advice on that before I make a serious commitment on this matter.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Minister, your own Prime Minister at that time, the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, also openly stated that the

1065 1066

2023 23

matter should be reconsidered, but that, too, was rejected. The authorities went ahead standing on a totally unscientific position. Nowhere else in the world was this procedure followed, which had caused a serious harm to the religious sensitivities of a community. Therefore, that even amounts to a virtual hate crime; it went to that extent. That is why some people are contemplating even legal action. Therefore, it is necessary for the Ministry of Health to be, at least, asked for a public apology. Why not, at least, ask for a public apology?

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Hon. Member, before asking for a public apology, first, you need to make an assessment to find out where it had gone wrong or whether that decision was contrary to the norms of the international community. As you know, I am extremely sensitive to this matter, not that I am averse to your proposal. I will definitely look into the possibility of appointing another committee on top of the Expert Committee. But, I need to get legal advice on that before I do it, because that Committee had been appointed under the patronage of the President as the Executive of the country. So, whether the Ministry has the right to appoint a separate committee to inquire into the Expert Committee which had been appointed by the Executive, I need to get legal advice on. I hope you will understand that, being a lawyer.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Minister, it has to be handled in a straightforward manner without beating around the bush.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) No, it is not a question of beating around the bush, certainly not. As you know, there is a legality involved with this matter. So, I cannot tell you certainly that it could be done. Being a lawyer, you should know that better than me.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Next, the Hon. Bandula Gunawardana. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Speaker, I wish to raise an important point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) What is it, Hon. Sumanthiran? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, yesterday, there was a serious violation of Standing Order No. 83. I wish to raise it now when the Hon. Speaker is in the Chair.

The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera, when he spoke yesterday, referred to the personal conduct of a judge, the Magistrate in Mullaitivu, and made very serious allegations, calling him a psychiatric patient, referring to his wife and so on. So, it is a violation of Standing Order No. 83, under which the personal conduct of a judge or anybody involved in the administration of justice cannot be a subject matter discussed without a Substantive Motion.

This is the second time he had done that. At the first time when he did that, there was a protest by the Bar Association. He cited a speech I made in this House, but that was very different; I criticized a special Determination and did not mention any judge by name. Determinations and judgments can be criticized, not only in this House but even outside and there is no contempt in that. But, what he had done, at both times, is, he had referred to the personal conduct of a judge. At the first time, he said How can a Tamil judge order me, a Sinhalese, who belongs to this country? Yesterday, in this House, he called that judge a psychiatric patient. So, it is not just a very serious violation of the Standing Order, but, I think, even relates to the ethical conduct of a Member of Parliament, and even the dignity of Parliament is being lowered.

I wish the Hon. Speaker to take stern action with regard to this matter. It must not only be expunged from Hansard - I think it must be expunged from Hansard - but beyond that, abusing Privilege in this House in this way must be sternly dealt with.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I will refer it to the relevant authorities and see what we could do about it.

We do not do much about increasing the number of tourists coming here; we do not do much about increasing our remittances. So, in what we should do organically, I wonder whether we have succeeded.

Sir, there are two areas. One is, our export development. There are a number of agencies which are dedicated to export development. For instance, in 1979 or so, under late President J.R. Jayewardene, we started Free Trade Zones. It was after us, that South Korea started Free Trade Zones, and where are we and where is South Korea today? Then, we have the BOI - the Board of Investment. By the trading community, Hon. Minister, the BOI is nicknamed as the Bunch of Idiots because the perception is so. There are so many other issues that they create for an investor.
