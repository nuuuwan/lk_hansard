Sir, I pose this to the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies, who is also the Hon. President. It is with regard to the issue of agreeing to DDR with ISB holders without resistance. It is necessary for the House to know whether the Government of Sri Lanka resisted the move of ISB holders to compel us on DDR, when it was not part and parcel of the IMF Agreement. Now, we observe that your Government is not only subservient to the IMF, but also to ISB holders or any individual creditors who enjoyed very high interest rates.

When ISB holders made the demand that we should carry out DDR, did we not ask our lawyers, Lazard, to intervene on our behalf to defer this request? If such steps were taken, we like documentary proof of the same to be tabled in this House. If we did not ask our lawyers to act in such a manner on our behalf to countermand the demand of ISB holders, why did we not, after paying handsome fees?

The Government of Sri Lanka appears to have colluded with ISB holders in order to effect DDR in its own interest and at the expense of the ETF, the EPF and other such funds and the State banks who were persuaded to pay a higher income tax of 50 per cent or something like that.

Therefore, we request the Hon. Minister or the State Minister to inform Parliament regarding the factual position.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) 07(0) : 0

' : ' " ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) :? () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) Hon. Chairman, we discussed this matter in detail - the remedies in the event of any injustice caused to an employee. For that, the general law is available. Therefore, in any of our Statutes, we have not entered separately the remedies they can seek. I think the Hon. Chandima Weerakkody was also present at the discussion with the Hon. Attorney-General and the Legal Draftsman. So, this has been brought on their advice.

( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Chairman, in this instance, this unit is a hybrid unit. Usually, any authority that is incorporated by an Act gets funds through Parliament. But in this instance, money is allocated through the Consolidated Fund. So, this is a hybrid arrangement. There can be a situation where a technical objection could be raised once an employee seeks relief at a Labour Tribunal. So, in order to avoid that, the Supreme Court Determination very clearly states that the employees are entitled to benefits that are not less favourable than the existing employee rights. I think in such circumstances, it is stated that definitely the integrity and the independence of officers would be assured.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) :?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) Hon. Chairman, I am not agreeable to it for the reason that the same argument was raised in the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court had given a clear direction on it. Secondly, in that event we go by the Hon. Members argument, then, in every Act, we will have to insert that when there is an injustice or a wrong thing done against an employee, they must have the right to go for fundamental rights cases, seek remedies under the writ jurisdiction or to go to a Labour Tribunal. For that, the general law is available and a clear assurance was given by Hon. Attorney-General that no prejudice would be caused. Therefore, I am not agreeable to it.

( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Chairman, the Supreme Court has gone into the Bill's constitutionality .But here -

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) We cannot go for an argument - [Interruption] ( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody, Attorney-at-Law) But here, we need to decide on policy. We must be in a position to look at it in a more progressive way so that the independence of this institution is maintained. So, I emphasize on the need to include this Amendment.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) That is what we have done earlier. Earlier also, there were reasonable allegations against the Commissions, that they were not independent. That is why we have made this Commission independent as far as their administration, the monetary control and also the investigations are concerned; in all three aspects, they are independent. That is why these rights have been given with regard to -

( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Chairman, in that event, is the Hon. Minister giving an undertaking that in case of a termination, the employee's right to go before the Labour Tribunal is guaranteed?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) In fact, Sir, that is an assurance given by our law. Therefore, my giving a personal assurance would not

2291 2292

2023 19

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) Which Cluase are you are referring to? ( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody, Attorney-at-Law) Clause 32(2). It is with regard to the grievance handling procedure.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) I cannot agree on anything further. ( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Chairman- - [Interruption] ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Your point has already been argued. He is not agreeable to that. - [Interruption]

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) You cannot argue because this is the Committee Stage. - [Interruption] That is true. We discussed this at length. I think the Hon. Leader of the Opposition was also present.

( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody, Attorney-at-Law) Sir, we are trying to guarantee the independence of this Commission. In order to achieve that, we must rest assured that the independence of the employees are guaranteed. So, when they do not have a grievance-handling mechanism within the setup, a higher officer can always dictate terms to a junior officer. You know what the culture that prevails in this country is. So, due to pressure, there can be -

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Anyway, if the Hon. Minister is adamant and say that there are other avenues available for this particular purpose, and if he is not agreeable, we cannot argue about it.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) Hon. Chairman, this argument was raised by some of the employees of the present Commission and the Supreme Court held that the way we have drafted is perfect. In addition to that, there were a few Amendments suggested by the Supreme Court. Therefore, Sir, I am bound by two rules. The first is, according to Article 78(3) of the Constitution, I cannot bring amendments outside the basic structure of the law which had been submitted. Secondly, I cannot go against the direction of the Supreme Court.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) Before that, Hon. Chairman, I want to bring to the notice of this House the tradition that has been maintained throughout in Parliament. At the Committee Stage, if there is an amendment proposed by any Hon. Member, the Hon. Minister can say whether the amendment is accepted or not. That is all. You cannot have an argument on that. The Second Reading of the Bill is over. Everybody agreed on that; without a Vote, we agreed on that and that was approved.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) That is exactly correct. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) So, why are we wasting time like this? - [Interruption]No, there cannot be an argument. You agreed on it. Otherwise, Parliament would never be able to pass a Bill.

( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody, Attorney-at-Law) Sir, we have not been allowed to submit all our Amendments.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, what is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. Chairman, the Hon. Member has the right to move the Amendment. Once the Amendment is moved in this House, the Hon. Minister has the freedom to say yes or no.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Yes. He has said, "no". ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) When the Hon. Member is not allowed to expressly declare his Amendment, how can the Hon. Minister say yes or no?

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) He was given enough time. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) No, he was not. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) He was given enough time to submit that. ( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Chairman, we submitted our Amendment. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) What your Amendment says is that the Labour Tribunal is powerful enough or -

( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody, Attorney-at-Law) No, that is not our Amendment. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) What happened was, instead of moving Amendments, he was making a speech. I also did not know that there was a third Amendment to be proposed.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) I do not want to distort the law, Hon. Chairman. When this goes to court, there must be clarity in law. You cannot confuse the whole legal system in the country. One must understand that. So, I am not agreeable to that.
