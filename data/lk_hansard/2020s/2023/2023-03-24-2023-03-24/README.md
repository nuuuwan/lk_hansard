, , . So, it is very clear that the IMF has changed its stance. When they came in last September, they said, to carry out the reforms, the Government should have a peoples mandate. In September, they said that. But, have they told the Government to seek a mandate? . , . , "IMF Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka Peter Breuer told reporters in Colombo that the political environment matters because the reforms need to be carried out". , "From the IMF's perspective, our arrangement is with the people of Sri Lanka'...." ; " , " . , . . 1993 . 1993-1994 . 1994 , 5 15 . .

[11.29 a.m.]

() ( () () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya) Hon. Presiding Member, listening to the Debate during the last couple of days both inside and outside Parliament regarding the IMF package, what appears is that the supporters of the IMF reform process seem to be asking the people of this country as well as the Hon. Members of Parliament to choose between democracy and the economy. It is an extremely false distinction that is being made as if somehow the economy is above everything else and the economy and the decisions about the economy are devoid of any kind of political significance or political meaning. We are being constantly told that, at this moment, the economy has to take priority and suspending democratic freedoms and democratic privileges is almost essential in order for these economic

reforms that are being proposed to take place. That is an extremely dangerous precedent and an approach that is being currently proposed. Implicit within this approach is a deep sense of elitism and arrogance, where the rulers of this country assume that they know what is best for the people of this country, that people of this country are ignorant, they are unable to make choices and decisions on their behalf keeping in mind what is in their best interest and that the rulers somehow have to take on the power to make those decisions on behalf of the people of this country. This, as you know, is completely anti-democratic and even within the proposed economic reforms, an extremely dangerous approach to take.

Within the IMF package, there are deep structural reforms that are being proposed, which need to be discussed and which need the peoples consent and mandate in order to be effectively implemented, if at all. For instance, there are tax reforms that are being proposed, which affect the different layers of the society in different ways. Controversial schemes of privatization, sale of national resources, spending cuts and reforms to social protection are also being proposed. Under reforms to social protection, there are reforms that are propsed with regard to the ways in which the poor are being identified and categorized; there are new measures, new criteria that are being introduced, over which people have had very little prior information and where the basic understanding seems to be that people will lie and manipulate the system in order to get benefits, completely ignoring the role of the political authority in politicising these kinds of systems for their own political benefits.

Spending cuts are also being proposed for the long-cherished institutions in this country in the sectors of health and education. In the education sector, today, without any kind of policy discussion and any written policy directives, already courses such as the engineering course offered by the Institute of Engineering Technology at Katunayake as well as other programmes offered, for instance, by the Vocational Training Authority and NAITA are now being advertised for arbitrarily decided course fees. None of these policies, none of these directives, none of these measures have been available for the public to discuss and to comment on; let alone the public, not even for Hon. Members of Parliament, they were available.

What we also need to keep in mind is that this Government or this President do not have a mandate to implement the kinds of reforms that are being proposed. That is why the democratic freedoms available under our Constitution and the democratic privileges enshrined in it have to be upheld at this moment because what the Government is proposing, what it is implementing is starkly different, diametrically different to the mandate on which this Government was elected.

This Government was elected on a platform that is drastically different to what is now being proposed. This Government was elected with a leader who was brought into power in a way in which he was contrasted with the current President, where the current President was categorized by the SLPP as the person responsible for the

1293 1294

crisis in the country. Today, they are singing hosannas in praise of that very same person who they held responsible for the crisis in this country. So, when the strategies and the approaches of the Government change so drastically, do the people of this country not have a right to express their views on the extremely different and the diametrically opposed reforms which the Government they elected is now planning to implement?

There are lessons from history and also global lessons about the dangers of imposing and forcing these kinds of reforms, these kinds of policy initiatives on people. There are plenty of examples from around the world about the social and political unrest that is generated or created when these kinds of reforms are imposed on people without their consent. We have seen countries which have faced similar economic crises, similar economic turmoil for years, for decades having to deal with political turmoil because of the way in which these kinds of structural reforms are imposed. That is why it is essential when countries propose these kinds of deep structural reforms which are necessary to get their people out of the kind of political and economic crisis we are facing that they come up with peoples consent, that they are supported with a peoples mandate. Rulers who think that they are above the people, that they can impose their will on people arbitrarily, very soon, will realize that the public view, the public court is much more powerful than the will of a few arrogant and elitist rulers. In that sense, at this moment, anyone who wishes well for this country, anyone who has the best interest of the people of this country will need to ensure the democratic freedoms, the democratic privileges enshrined in our Constitution and realize that those are equally important as the economic reforms that are being proposed.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 13 .

Hon. Presiding Member, may I begin my speech by wishing this country some prosperity at least with the advent of this holy month of Ramadan, which has started from today. Today happens to be a Friday and all of us have got to rush to our Jummah Prayers as well.

This IMF programme, Sir, is the seventeenth programme this country is entering into. Previously, sixteen times, we have gone either for an extended fund facility or a structural adjustment programme of the IMF. Sixteen times having been engaged with the IMF earlier, we have undergone this exercise of being in a merry-go-round. Going for reforms, thereafter again regressing from the reforms and then once again, in a crisis situation, running back to the IMF asking for their facilities, as I said, has been a merry-go-round. Now, once again, finally with this seventeenth attempt, will we succeed is the question. We have always been involved in some cosmetic compliance and whenever the crisis abates, we have been used to going back to business as usual. Now, we cannot afford to do this regressing from our undertakings anymore. We have gone rock bottom; the country had been declared bankrupt. So, with such an ignominy, we cannot afford once again to regress from the reform path we have set ourselves on.

Way back in September last year, the Staff-level Agreement was reached. From the Staff-level Agreement up to the IMF Board approval, there had been 200 days, within which we could have done many things. I even fault the IMF for not doing enough to bring substantial pressure to achieve more than what we have achieved up to now. Whatever the Government has chosen to do with their discredited majority in Parliament with an experienced politician as the President, we had managed to use the jackboots of our armed forces and the Police to prevent agitations, demonstrations, thwart strikes and have also managed to heap more hardship on the working population in this country. With the Rs. 100,000 threshold for taxable income, we have broadened our tax net, we say, but the IMF programme speaks about a wealth tax, a property tax, all of which we are now putting off for 2025 and beyond. So, we are leaving the rich class out of this, giving them some more breathing space. Now, this is what is being contested by the working population in this country.

We must remember that this governance diagnostic exercise the IMF is trying to undertake for the first time in an Asian country is a very ambitious initiative.

But, are we prepared to be truthfully engaging in that exercise? The President gave us an undertaking that he is going to bring in the new anti-corruption legislation very soon to Parliament. The anti-corruption legislation alone would not do, but that legislation must have provision for non-conviction-based property seizure arrangements. Otherwise, if we go to court and try to get warrants or to have all the monies stacked away in accounts outside the country brought back, it is not going to happen. But, what have we done? There was one of the senior executives of the SriLankan Airlines who was convicted in a British

court. Then, we also had one of our diplomats in the United States convicted for a similar offense. Have we, at least, filed any action in our local courts against them? No. So, what are we talking about anti-corruption initiatives in the country? Therefore, there is much to be done.

Today, the newspapers state that, now, we have lined up various State-owned enterprises to be sold and a restructuring unit under the Ministry of Finance has been set up. The SriLankan Airlines including SriLankan Catering is one such SOE. The Hon. Minister concerned is here. SriLankan Catering, of course, might fetch something, but the SriLankan Airlines may not fetch even fifty cents on a dollar due to the way our airline has been run down, but better late than never. Let us make sure that, at least, our landing rights to important destinations are protected; let us make sure that our expatriate population, who are sending dollars to this country, have proper connections to Colombo from the capitals where they are working, in the Middle East and beyond; let us ensure that those destinations from which large numbers of tourists are coming to this country are intact and then, give it over to somebody to be run. It is better late than never. But the only thing is, we cannot expect much, not even fifty cents on a dollar, as I told you. The Hon. Minister concerned is much aware of this and of course, he is trying to do various things. But, I am told that there are challenges to whatever little reforms he did. Now, the licence to land international flights on the Batticaloa International Airport runway is to be cancelled by the Civil Aviation Authority. So, our domestic airports are in a mess. Then, we have the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport, another ambitious project which is a virtual white elephant. The Hambantota International Port, too, has not been used to its potential. So, such difficulties, we are facing. Then, we also have the Sri Lanka Telecom, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Limited, the Hotel Developers Lanka Limited, the Grand Hyatt Colombo, the Litro Gas Lanka Limited including Litro Gas Terminals (Pvt) Limited and the Lanka Hospitals to be restructured.

There was much of hullabaloo in this Chamber a day or two ago about the Cabinet decision to sell the shares of the Sri Lanka Telecom and the Lanka Hospitals. In my opinion, the IMF should have insisted that all of this be done before they take the Board decision; I go as far as that. I do not subscribe to the view that some Members on this side of the aisle of the House expressed, as to why sell the profitable ones. Those are the low-hanging fruit, those are the ones that we can easily sell right away. So, let us sell them and at least create some primary balance in our books. That is what is necessary for us to do. Therefore, let us not regress from the reform path once again. Sixteen times, we have pulled wool over the eyes of the IMF. The IMF also must be faulted for not putting enough pressure on reforms. They should have put substantial pressure to do much more than what has already been done. That is my opinion.

Then, take the new Central Bank of Sri Lanka Bill. That is again pulling wool over the eyes of the IMF, in my opinion. Political interference is to be abolished in the running of the affairs of the Central Bank. Various people

1311 1312

have already looked at the new Bill. What is the new Bill going to do? We are going to pack the two important decision-making bodies with that responsibility; instead of the Monetary Board, we are to create two different entities - one is the Governing Board and the other is the Monetary Policy Board. Under this Bill, we have a situation where the Minister of Finance recommends the Governor and the other members of the Governing Board as well as of the Monetary Policy Board to the President. Now, see the current situation: Ranil Wickremesinghe recommends to Ranil Wickremesinghe. Is that independence? The Finance Minister is Ranil Wickremesinghe and the President is Ranil Wickremesinghe. So, Ranil Wickremesinghe recommends to Ranil Wickremesinghe and Ranil Wickremesinghe puts it on to the Constitutional Council, which is again having a majority of the discredited Government benchers. So, that is again a foregone conclusion that those names would get approved and finally, we would have another setup where political manipulation of the Central Bank could take place. There are various other matters which I would like to deal with when that Bill comes before the House. I think the Opposition must move some amendments to make sure that this exercise of bringing in a new Central Bank of Sri Lanka Bill will not end up in that way. To the credit of the Hon. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, I must say that the two other previous occasions when an attempt to introduce a new Central Bank of Sri Lanka Bill was made were also during his tenure. Other governments did not even care because they wanted to control the Central Bank, but he made the attempt twice earlier, once in 2004 and subsequently, once again, in 2016. But, they did not come to fruition because by the time we got it before the Cabinet, elections were announced.

So, Sir, let us make sure, at least now, that we do not regress from the reform path that has been set for us by the IMF. The IMF, too, must take some responsibility for not using their bargaining power before their Board decision was taken, to see that more of those assets are sold and that things are made much easier for the people of this country rather than taxing the poor people, the working class, in this country and allowing the capitalists to get away from their obligations.

Thank you.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Jeevan Thondaman - Minister of Water Suply and Estate Infrastructure Development) Hon. Presiding Member, if the Hon. Harshana Rajakaruna was there, he would have given me at least an extra three, four minutes.

Before I start my speech on today's topic, I think I need to educate the Hon. Member who spoke before me. If you look at the events that took place during the past one year, you would have noticed that the Opposition was quite vocal that the IMF Agreement would not come about, the fuel issue is not going to be over, the electricity issue is not going to be over and fortunately, the Hon. President proved them wrong. Also, one more instance I would like to point out. Now, since the IMF has come on board, certain Hon. Members of the Opposition - I am not going to put that stain on all the Hon. Members - lose their sense of decorum and tend to bring up the past, to be more specific, the Bond scam allegation. I think we need to look at that with a bit of common sense because one thing the Hon. Member who just walked out did not realize is that the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, in fact, contested the elections with the current President and the allegation that was levelled took place two years prior to that. Anyway, I think we should stop misleading people with false narratives and should actually talk about what is at stake right now.

For the first time in our modern history, if you actually go through it, you would have noticed that we faced an unprecedented economic crisis without fuel, electricity and more so, we defaulted on our debt for the first time. Apart from that, I do not think we had known any such economic misery like the one in 2022 and I do not want to waste time speaking about how we removed the two-kilometre fuel queues and all that, but would rather speak about how we came to this situation, to begin with. Despite my being a Member of the Cabinet, despite my being in the ruling party benches, I think it is my duty to be truthful to the people, which is why I would honestly like to say that the reason why we are in this mess is because of the continuous lies fed to the people by politicians for a long period of time. Well, they promised the people heaven and all the subsidies that came with it, but what they did not tell the people is that they are stealing right from under their feet. So, when that has been the case and due to continuous politically favourable decisions, we landed ourselves in this mess.

I think we also have to realize that, for decades, we have been drowning in a mountain of debt which has been growing bigger every year to fund a lifestyle we could not afford and the leaders of this country also sold a lie to the people that the job of the Government was to provide for everything. Whether it was electricity, gas, fuel or even an airline, politicians spread a myth that it was the Governments duty to provide for those services

1345 1346

and not the private sector. You know that the once proud and profitable private companies were nationalized or taken over by the Government specifically under the lie that those belonged to the people. That is when our downfall actually began, which even includes the tea estates.

Many in this country will actually be surprised to learn that until the 1970s, electricity, fuel and gas were provided by private companies. LP gas pipes ran underground straight into peoples homes and consumers could choose between several fuel suppliers for their vehicles. In most countries, national debt is paid off through taxation, but, in our case, as everyone is aware, in December, 2019, Sri Lanka slashed taxes. Most of those tax cuts benefitted the rich and the wealthy, but unfortunately, not the poor. With absolutely no tax revenue to fund losses, we funded the mega losses of the government-owned enterprises by borrowing money and when we could not borrow any more, we started printing money. I think everybody has to recognize the fact that this country is not a country that was built on its own wealth but rather on the wealth of other countries, especially through loans which were not feasible and to be more specific, through debt traps, on vanity projects and on projects which provided us with zero to nothing returns. You know that there is only so much of fraud and waste that a system can take and eventually, it will collapse.

Many people would blame the former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa for the failure of this country. But, I think everybody knows the truth, yet they are just afraid to say it because the reality of the matter is, we were going towards an economic collapse inevitably, it was going to happen. The former Government just accelerated it; that is the only difference. Because we were not running a sustainable economy and more so, due to the losses our State-owned enterprises were making, it was unbearable for the country to go ahead with.

Over the last several months, President Ranil Wickremesinghe and his interim Government have taken steps to correct the mistakes of the past and bring a semblance of normalcy to our country. Today, we no longer live in darkness due to power cuts or spend several hours in a queue waiting for fuel. Taxes have been increased so that the wealthiest 20 per cent of this country pays their fair share and the rich support the poor as we navigate through the roughest seas we have endured. Interest rates have been increased so that you can cushion yourself against price rises through higher savings rates and end the culture of spending by borrowing.

I understand the hurt and pain the people face due to higher food prices, higher electricity costs and higher fuel prices, which is honestly a result of the course correction the Government is doing right now. I am truly sorry, but I promise the people that we are doing everything possible to ease their pain and mitigate the impact of such hard times.

The Government has secured over Rs. 80 billion in support for a new social safety net programme, which will provide direct cash transfers for those in difficult situations. We have given the deadline of 31st March for everyone to enroll into the new system. Already, closer to 3.3 million families have enrolled. I think one other issue must also be recognized. I represent the people from the upcountry, to be specific. The people of the upcountry have always faced an issue: though they are entitled for Samurdhi, they do not receive it. When we dived into the issue to find out as to why they do not receive the Samurdhi payments, we found out that it was simply because of the Samurdhi Officers. When it comes to a marginalized community, they can be taken advantage of in any way whatsoever. Those officers have been negligent in their job and the Samurdhi benefits have gone to their friends and families, which is why we believe the 31st March deadline of implementing the new system would be beneficial to those who have missed out Samurdhi benefits.

As everyone is aware, we have also brought in a new law relating to the Central Bank and we are committed to making the Central Bank more independent, though there are different opinions amongst the Members of the Opposition as well as the Members of the ruling party that the Central Bank should not be independent. But, I am sorry to say that for a healthy economy, the Central Bank must be independent so that nobody could infiltrated it, print trillions of rupees and bankrupt our country again.

Apart from that, we are revising our investment and trade laws not only to make Sri Lanka a better place to invest in, but also to form closer trade ties with both our partners in the region and the world. For a long time, we were sold a myth that trade was bad and that freer and open trade took away jobs. In return, we built up barriers which gave mega profits for rich industrialists while consumers paid high prices for poor quality goods. Anti-trade practices reduced this figure by half, to nearly 20 per cent. If you look at our economic framework 23 years ago, our exports were close to 40 per cent. Unfortunately, right now, as I mentioned earlier, due to our anti-trade practices, we have halved that number to 20 per cent, the figure I was talking about. Instead of growth being fueled by trade with true wealth being created, Sri Lanka followed a policy of growth through debt, which is extremely unhealthy because we were borrowing, as I mentioned earlier, for projects like empty airports and towers that generate no real income whatsoever.

Today, we have realized that the only way to generate true, substantial wealth for our people is through trading with the world. After all, it is our export industry which came to our countrys rescue when, to be fair, the politicians plundered the last remaining dollar. But, trade is not just exports; it is also imports. Both exports and imports are equally important and essential to create wealth; they both are two sides of the same coin. When you block one, you also block the other. We have finally realized this and are committed to deeper economic integration with our regional partners to fully achieve our economic potential.

I would also like to say that as we open up our borders and recommit ourselves to the world, we will also dismantle the monopolies that have robbed the people of so much. Not so long ago, Sri Lanka had fair trade practices. But, we cannot say the same right now. For example, our telecommunication sector. There is no reason why our electricity, gas or fuel suppliers must all be from government-owned, loss-making businesses. People deserve better and cheaper options with the choice to buy from the best service at the best available price.

As we move out of this crisis and look towards a better country, we will continue to face challenges along the way.

There are many who benefitted from the old system of Government-run businesses, especially from the loss-making ones. Governments are not meant to run businesses or run airlines. Unfortunately, what we have seen in our tragic economic past is that whenever the Government had decided that running the airline was a job of the public sector, it is only the rich who could go on a holiday. It did not enhance the economy, nor did it fuel the growth of this country. Health, education, infrastructure and basic services are necessities the Government must provide to the people. As the President said, it is not the job of the Government to run businesses and enterprises. We have, in fact, stunted the growth of the private sector because of our mismanagement.

I would also like to say that the economic reforms you will see in the coming months will also be closely tied to social reforms. There is no economic progress without social progress. I think we have to understand that Sri Lanka, as a country, has a diverse fabric of people.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, you have two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Jeevan Thondaman) I need five more minutes, Sir.

Sir, Sri Lanka has a diverse fabric of people and regardless of their caste, creed, religion, the language they speak, their sexual orientation and gender, they all must be protected under the Constitution. But, that is not the case right now, which is quite unfortunate. For decades, many of our countrys politicians had kept us in the dark about the progress happening around the world. They sold us lies, that Sri Lankans lived better here than anywhere else. While the world moved forward, we still stayed back and today, we are facing the brunt of it. If I have to be more specific, we, in fact, borrowed money from Bangladesh to realize that the world has moved on and left us far behind.

Recently, as everyone is aware, the Cabinet approved the National Policy on Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment. That Policy sets out the Governments commitment to non-discrimination and empowerment of women and sexual and gender minorities. In a country

where more than a half of our population are women, it is sad that only 5 per cent of the Representatives of Parliament are women. I think we should take a page from the UAE because 50 per cent of their Parliament is women. I think it is only fair to increase their representation because you need two lungs to breathe; you cannot breathe with just one lung.

Also, another interesting fact that I must point out is, the Government is also committed to establishing the Social Justice Commission. Its aim is to address the historic injustices caused such as the injustice done even to my community, where we were stripped of our civic rights.

In the interests of time, I will just shorten my speech. I just have to say that regardless of all that has happened right now, we have to look at how we are going to move forward. In terms of the plantation community, we are going for a wage hike with or without the companies' support. If the companies are willing to come on board and support, we will definitely have a productivity-driven model and without their support, we will go to the Wages Board.

I would also like to say that we have started a special programme to promote agro-entrepreneurship among the youth in the plantations. Also, I noted that the Hon. Premnath C. Dolawatte has presented a Private Members Bill to repeal and replace Sections 365 and 365A of the Penal Code and that has received the certification of the Attorney-General and has been published in the Gazette.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, you have three additional minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Jeevan Thondaman) I just need one minute, Sir. I am almost done; I will finish.

I would like to say that my party wholeheartedly supports that Bill. I feel we should put it to Parliament and give some breathing space, do some sort of justice to those people who have been protesting for so long.

Lastly - this would be the last matter, Sir - I would also like to say that, yesterday, the esteemed Members of the Opposition such as the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva and the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne joined us for a meeting with the World Bank Representative and I would like to mention here what the World Bank Representative mentioned to them. The World Bank Representative clearly mentioned that he is from Lebanon and currently, an old man, but the economic crisis which had started in his country started when he was a child and he begged us not to underestimate our economic crisis, which is why I would like to ask the Opposition once again - the President has requested it three times till now - to come on board and support us to get the economy back on track and reset the future for the generations to come.

Thank you so much.

() ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Suren Raghavan - State Minister of Higher Education) Hon. Presiding Member, it has been customary for a speaker who speaks in the latter part of the day to eventually speak to an empty House. I think the contract between State-democracy and Parliament needs to be questioned here. Why are we speaking to only four Hon. Members from the Opposition and two from the ruling party? We can have this conversation even at tea. The Party Leaders and especially the Opposition, which demanded for a three-day Debate on the IMF rescue package, should have at least had the moral courtesy to get this Debate deepened so that our citizens would get a good analysis of the direction this country is about to take off.

I am glad that the last speaker spoke on education. , , . , . 1978 16 - - . . . We say in English that the race has finished and we have to start a new race.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) An applied economist.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan) Thank you, Hon. Member. Maybe, because that comes from my discipline in political science. There is no separation between the science of how we govern ourselves, which is generally called political science, and the way a country is economically managed.

Today is the third day after this country made this achievement to overcome the historical economic crisis. 100 . , . . , , , . , . . 1977 , 1996 . - 30 - , .

They talk about the quality of the hotel they are going to stay that weekend and what kind of drinks they would share. That is not the type of discussion we have had about 20 to 25 years ago. We would talk about the universities we want to enter, under which professor we would want to do our research, how - in fact, our dream was to go to the Peradeniya University because it was considered the highest seat of higher education in this country - to befriend a Kandyan girl and settle down in Peradeniya. But now, times have changed and who changed it? Obviously, the world forces which are beyond us. Those have forced us and commanded us to adopt our nationality, our market and our lifestyles according to the boardrooms of those multinationals and those manufacturer nations. That is the reality one cannot escape from.

Countries such as Japan, while manufacturing, have held their traditional ways of life. How did they do that? Countries which are traditionally Marxist, Maoist like China have completely given parts of their society into manufacturers slave labour. I must ask for forgiveness from them if I am wrong, but that is the reality. An underpaid army of people in China are tied factory workers producing things to the consuming West. I think we need to look at these examples and select some system which could be made ours.

Sir, I am reading these days about how Vietnam was facing this situation. Nobody in this House or an outsider could fathom the strategic warfare mounted by the

Vietnamese heroes against the so-called American imperialism. One study revealed that a similar number of bombs dropped in the entire World War II or more were dropped on Vietnam, but the Vietnamese people, under the great leadership of Ho Chi Minh, stood against the attack because they wanted to protect their lifestyle, their lands, their nation and the future of Vietnam. Where does that nation, which strategically faught that war with such commitment, stand today?

Last year alone, Vietnams foreign investments had been nearly US Dollars 20 billion, out of which, surprisingly or unsurprisingly, US Dollars 7 billion came from America. Major American companies including 3M and FedEx have gone and invested in Vietnam. I am not an economist, but I would like to call our economists inside this House and outside to study these models. These models are examples and we do not have to reinvent the wheel, the learning curve has already been established so that Sri Lanka could learn.

The IMF bailout, US Dollars 2.9 billion, would be issued in eight equal proportions with one tranche amounting to US Dollars 390 million, which is half the amount we spend on crude oil monthly! I was told by the Ministry officials that we spend nearly US Dollars 500 million monthly on crude oil that is needed. All that put together, it comes to about US Dollars 6 billion a year, which is almost equivalent to the amount the nearly one million labourers from Sri Lanka working in the Middle East remit a year. Therefore, these IMF Funds should be used wisely and also the question as to how we can cut down the economic haemorrhages we have traditionally been facing should be asked.
