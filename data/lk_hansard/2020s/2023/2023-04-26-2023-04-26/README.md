Let me read out those in English. We have taken nine prior actions we agreed to and we are qualified under those. The prior actions under Fiscal Consolidation are, Cabinet approval of revenue measures to support fiscal consolidation during 2023 in line with programme parameters; Parliamentary approval of a revised 2022 Budget that is in line with programme parameters and submission of Appropriation Bill, 2023 which is in line with programme parameters to Parliament.

Then, the actions under Fiscal Structural Reforms include, Cabinet approval to automate monthly retail fuel price adjustment as prescribed by the 2018 fuel pricing formula to achieve cost recovery and Cabinet approval to automate semi-annual cost-recovery based electricity price adjustment.

The actions under Multiple Pillars are, Cabinet approval of the new Central Bank Act with amendments from the Bill submitted to Parliament in November, 2019 in consultation with IMF staff. That has already been done and now, we have to pass the Bill in Parliament.

The prior actions under Financial Stability include, Cabinet approval of the Banking (Special Provisions) Act to strengthen key elements of the CBSLs crisis management powers and hiring of an independent firm by the CBSL to conduct banking sector diagnostic exercise based on Terms of Reference and timeline established in consultation with IMF staff.

Lastly, the action under Price Stability is, increase policy interest rates by 100 basis points to ensure forward-looking real policy rates on a firmly upward path.

Next, I would like to inform the House of the proposed Quantitative Performance Criteria and Indicative Targets. Under that, the Central Government primary balance for the year 2022 was minus Rs. 895 billion. By end December, 2023, we want to make it minus Rs. 209 billion. The net Official International Reserves were at minus US Dollars 3,540 million in 2022. By end December, 2023, we want it to be minus US Dollars 1,592 million. The net credit to the Government of the CBSL was Rs. 2,834 billion in 2022 and it should be Rs. 2,740 billion by end-December this year. If we take the stock of expenditure arrears of the Central Government in 2022, it was Rs. 60 billion and it was proposed to be reduced to Rs. 30 billion by end-March, 2023.

Then, if we move on to proposed QPCs and ITs, the Central Government tax revenue (floor) in 2022 was Rs. 1,751 billion and the indicative target for end-March, 2023 was Rs. 650 billion. I must say that we have fallen short in some areas like the Sri Lanka Customs because actually, the imports have been reduced, but on the other hand, we have increased direct taxation. The target for the Central Government tax revenue by the end of this year is

Rs. 2,940 billion. Then, the social spending by the Central Government in 2022 was Rs. 142 billion and the propsed target is Rs. 187 billion by the end of 2023. The ceiling for Treasury guarantees was Rs. 1,159 billion last year and it will go up to Rs. 1,700 billion by the end of this year.

Then, I would like to read out to you the Structural Benchmarks required for macroeconomic adjustments:

01. Parliamentary approval of the new Central Bank Act, the Bill on which will be presented to Parliament next month; 02. Completion of the asset quality review component of bank diagnostic exercise for the two largest State-owned banks and the three largest private sector banks; 03. Parliamentary approval of the welfare benefit payment scheme and the application of the new eligibility criteria to identify low-income families for receiving welfare benefit payments by end of May, 2023; 04. Cabinet approval of a comprehensive strategy to restructure the balance sheets of the CEB, CPC, SriLankan Airlines and the RDA by end-June, 2023; 05. . Cabinet approval of a full revision of the Banking

Act by end-June, 2023; 06. Enact new anti-corruption legislation to harmonize it with the United Nations Convention against Corruption, pending comprehensive asset recovery provisions by end-June, 2023. This is, the new anti-corruption legislation; 07. Cabinet approval of revenue measures to support fiscal consolidation during 2024 by end of July, 2023; 08. Development of a roadmap by the CBSL for addressing banking system capital and foreign exchange liquidity shortfalls and intervening in banks assessed to be non-viable by end of July, 2023; 09. Completion of the rollout of the ITMIS, expanding its coverage to all 220 heads by end of September, 2023; 10. Publication of the report of an IMF-led governance diagnostic technical assistance mission to assess Sri Lankas anti-corruption framework by end of September, 2023; 11. Submission of the 2024 Appropriation Bill to Parliament for the First Reading by end of October, 2023; 12. Determination by the Ministry of Finance of the size, timing, instruments and terms and conditions for potential government recapitalization of viable banks which are unable to close capital shortfalls from private sources by end of October, 2023; 13. Parliamentary approval of the 2024 Appropriation Act and the spending allocations in line with programme parameters by end of December, 2023;

1849 1850

14. Submission of a new Public Finance Management Law that will authorize the budget formulation process, roles and responsibilities of relevant agencies and information and accountability requirements to Parliament by end of December, 2023;

15. Improve the Bulk Supply Transaction Account to accurately measure the electricity subsidy, and start using it to determine the cost-recovery based electricity tariff and government transfer requirement by end of December, 2023;

16. Parliament approval of a full revision of the Banking Act by end of December, 2023;

17. Set retail fuel prices to their cost-recovery levels with monthly formula-based adjustments and compensate the CPC for providing any fuel subsidies with on-budget transfers, which will be continuous;

18. Adjust the end-user electricity tariff schedule to its cost-recovery with semi-annual formula-based adjustments on a forward-looking basis in January and July each year, which will, again, be continuous; and

19. Achieving debt sustainability:

Then, Next Steps: Achieving Debt Sustainability. The targets to be achieved are,

Debt stock: Public debt should decline to

below 95 per cent of GDP by 2032;

Post-programme gross financing needs: average annual gross financing needs of the Central Government during 2027 to 2032 should remain below 13 per cent of GDP, compared to the 34.6 per cent of GDP in 2022;

Post-programme foreign exchange debt service: annual foreign exchange debt service of the Central Government should remain below 4.5 per cent of GDP in each year over 2027 to 2032, compared to the 9.4 per cent in 2022;

Programme financing gaps: debt service

reduction during 2023 to 2027 should be sufficient to close external financing gaps. Under staffs baseline scenario, US Dollars 17 billion in debt service reduction is required including the arrears accumulated in 2022.

So, we are trying to get a US Dollars 17 billion debt service reduction. - [Interruption.] That is right. So, do you want it or not? Are we going in for debt structuring? We cannot manage without debt restructuring. That is what I want to make clear to all the Hon. Members.

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Charitha Herath) Sir, my name was mentioned by the Hon. State Minister. So, you have to give me at least a few seconds to clarify that. This system adopted in this House is not correct. He is a State Minister and he has all the right to speak. So, he took three minutes to answer me, but you are not giving me at least a few seconds to answer him, which is not correct. Anyway, you keep your time, but this is not the correct way.
