But, if we are to attract high-end tourists, one thing that has to be provided is domestic air transportation. To go to Trincomalee, it takes a long time; it takes at least five to six hours. So, domestic air transportation is something that we need to look at seriously, if we are to improve tourism in Sri Lanka. The China Bay Airport would be ideal for that and could be developed as a domestic airport, which we are looking into and have been discussing about with a few airlines. That would be one way we could attract high-end tourists. I would say that that area should not be a seasonal destination, but a year-round tourist destination. Specially, there are some good brands like Uga Jungle Beach, which is a high-end hotel. Also, there are a few more investors who are looking into it and we are quite certain that investments will take come in. We are hoping to have an investment forum targeting Trincomalee. Hon. Member, rest assured that if lands are acquired, we will provide people with alternative lands. We have been working with the GAs in that area.

It is an overall issue arisen due to the economic situation that people are leaving the country; it is not related only to the activities of the health sector, I must say. Also, there are so many other contributory factors to it. At one point, it happened during the 1970-77 period due to some other economic situation and the professionals did the same thing. As one solution to that, President J.R. Jayewardene brought private medical faculties and you know what happened to those. Now, four new medical faculties are coming up. I have given approval for those. My office was surrounded by some people and I spoke to them and said that if we do not do it now, it would never happen. I know these are very unpopular decisions at present, but one day, they will say that that is the only way. If our MBBS Degree is recognized to that extent, why do we not attract students from the region, produce doctors and take them in so that their shortage would be addressed? One way you can address the shortage is to increase the number of faculties - the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris will vouch for that - and the other is to allow private medical colleges because, at present, there is a huge drain of foreign exchange. I think 90 per cent of the students who are being educated outside Sri Lanka have taken money to those countries without declaring it to the Treasury or the Central Bank; they pay in different ways rather than going through the proper channels. That is how they do it and there is a huge drain of foreign exchange.

257 258

I must also say that there are 3,000 medical students - we have done a survey - who have received their medical degrees from outside Sri Lanka and who are not allowed to sit for the Act 16 Examination. That is one of the reasons why we need to change the law, not to repeal it, but, at least, to bring in some Amendments. If you read the Ferguson magazine or the Time magazine, you can find the best 1,000 universities in the world. I asked those students to be allowed to sit for that exam, if they have qualified from one of those best 1,000 universities. There is a rule that they must register with the Sri Lanka Medical Council to practise here. If they were educated at the Cambridge University, the Yale University or the Princeton University, would they come back and register here? They would not register; they would never do that. So, should we not bring in the type of amendments which allow them to come back here after graduating?

Then, they have also said that we cannot have any satellites here. In Malaysia, they have a branch of the Monash University and they are now trying to bring in a branch of the Princeton University. So, all our children are going there and in the final year, they will go to the United States or Australia. Would they not? So, we need to face the reality and take certain action to ensure that we have a sufficient number of medical officers, that we are not short of medical officers. There are students who have got 3 As but are still unable to get into a medical faculty. That is, after increasing the number of medical faculties to 13. During President Mahinda Rajapaksas period, we had about four or five new medical faculties opened. I think you, Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, were also involved in establishing some of them. So, that is the only way. But, that is not sufficient. We will also have to allow private medical colleges to come up. We have allowed it to happen in all other spheres, in all other disciplines such as law, accounting, designing et cetera, except in the medical field. I am sure that the standards will have to be set out and we will have to maintain those standards.

The other thing is, whether we should allow their money to be invested abroad. We are giving it out now only to the Government. Speaking about investments, should we allow part of that money to be invested abroad? I think we should. As the situation improves - these are the savings of the people of the country - we will allow the money to be even invested abroad. Let us discuss it. . .
