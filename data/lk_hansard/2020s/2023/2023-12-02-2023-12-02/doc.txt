, when the Committee on Ethics and Privileges recommends something, the House is never divided on that. So, here, we are now running into a difficulty with the House being divided on an issue, regarding which the Committee on Ethics and Privileges has submitted a

Motion. It has never happened before; I hope that it has not happened before. The Committee on Ethics and Privileges is the supreme body, now, headed by a former Speaker. Sir, we should not run the risk of going for a Division. Therefore, it is only proper that you postpone the decision, then the Committee on Ethics and Privileges and the other Committee meet together and come to a compromise so that we will have an undivided Parliament deciding on a Privilege issue.

The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Athukorala also spoke about the Government Analysts Department and it is one of the reasons why there are law's delays. In 2015, with the assistance of the Korean Government - with aid from KOICA - we established two new laboratories: one is a DNA laboratory - till then, we did not have a DNA laboratory - and the other is a digital forensic laboratory. There were eight laboratories and together with those two new laboratories, there are ten now and all the ten laboratories were upgraded to the ISO standards.

In 2015, the rate of issuing reports on samples referred to the Government Analysts Department was around 68 per cent, but at the end of 2017 - the Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Athukorala knows about it - it was 100 per cent. Normally, they get around 2,000 samples a month and within that month itself, they issue the reports. But, during the last few years, there were issues like the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic crisis and there were a lot of difficulties for them to purchase chemicals because some of the chemicals were not available in the market during the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, that problem has been sorted out but, as you said, still we have another huge problem.

[.. 12.02] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Chairman, often, when I have spoken on the Votes of the Ministry of Justice, I have likened the Hon. Minister of Justice in this country to the Minister of Ports and Shipping of Afghanistan.

Sir, I read yesterday that Pastor Jerome Fernando had been arrested and also remanded and the Magistrate had made certain comments while remanding him. While Sumanarathana Thero from Batticaloa has been making speeches openly, saying that he will cut Tamil people to pieces, he has not been arrested; he has not been remanded. He is considered to be above the law. So, this is the curse of this country and I think the Hon. Minister of Justice must be ashamed to call himself "Minister of Justice." If you held another portfolio, you can just pass off, but how dare you call yourself the "Minister of Justice" in this country when there is no justice? So blatantly, discrimination is apparent and I think it must be a burden to you to go around the world calling yourself the Minister of Justice of Sri Lanka.

In this House, there were questions that have been raised. These are fundamental issues. This House has freedom of speech, everyone knows that. Not only this House, but Parliaments the world over have that privilege and that is given for a reason; without exception, Parliaments around the world have that privilege. It is wrong to say that someone here is speaking under "cover of Privilege". No, that is a wrong phrase. It is not "cover of Privilege"; he is using his Privilege because the law has given him that Privilege. Historically and universally, that is a privilege given for a very good reason and when that is used, it is wrong to say somebody is taking cover behind Privilege. This is a fundamental issue. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition raised it today; the Hon. Chief Opposition Whip also raised it today. At first sight, any application made to court must be dismissed without even a hearing. That is how the comity relationship between the three organs of government must be maintained. Otherwise, Sections 3 and 4 of the Parliamentary (Powers and Privileges) Act will become useless, if lawyers and

other parties have to appear before court and argue and convince judges that they have no jurisdiction. I mean, this a blatantly fundamental position which ought not to be entertained, but that does not seem to be the situation in this country anymore, that expressions in this House are being challenged. I do not want to go into the specific cases because then, we ourselves will be violating tradition, the principles of sub judice and all that. So, I do not want to do that, but it is a worrying factor. This is certainly a matter that must worry all of us as to the relationship between these organs of government.

Now, Sir, I want to move onto something that happened in this House on the 24th and 26th of November. On the 24nd of November, the Hon. President came into this House and read from some Determinations of the Supreme Court and asserted that the Constitutional Council is part of the Executive. Then, I spoke that day soon after his speech, but he thought it best that he did not remain in the House when I spoke and left. Two days later in an afternoon, he comes into the Chamber here when I was not here, replies me and then, leaves again. When the Hon. Leader of the Opposition asked him to stay, he gets up and goes away.

What did he say? He said the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution had established the Constitutional Council as part of the Executive. That is wrong. He said that at that time, he, the Hon. K.N. Choksy and Hon. Karu Jayasuriya drafted that law. That is also wrong. It was at the insistence of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna at that time, in 2001, that it was brought in. He was talking about something else; he was talking about the aborted Eighteenth and the Nineteenth Amendments, which were never passed in this House and which he, during his tenure as Prime Minister, brought to clip the wings of the Executive President at that time. He was reading from the Determinations on those, claiming that they were part of the Determination on the Seventeenth Amendment. He even said that "the Hon. Sumanthiran appeared in the case for the Centre for Policy Alternatives". I was bemused because in 2001, I was not in the country; I was reading for my Masters Degree elsewhere.

Having looked at the documents, I would like to say that this is what the Determination on the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution states. Chief Justice Sarath N. Silvas Bench gave that Determination. I am reading from the Decisions of the Supreme Court on Parliamentary Bills (1991-2003), which is a publication of the Parliament. I am saying all this to show that I am reading from an authoritative text, unlike the President. In page 250 of the Volume of Decisions between 1991 and 2003, it states that the Constitutional Council is being established and, I quote:

In that respect the provisions relating to the establishment and functions of the Constitutional Council is the core of the Seventeenth Amendment. These provisions are contained as noted above in the new Chapter VIIA ...

And, that is where the Leader of the House was also wrong. On that very day, he rose in this House and said that the Constitutional Council appears under the same Chapter, "The Executive." That is wrong. There is a new

1927 1928

Chapter created. The Executive is Chapter VII and a new Chapter VIIA was created. Sui generis organization, the Constitutional Council is neither a part of the Executive nor a part of the Legislature. On that day, I made an intervention. I did not say it was part of the Legislature; I said it was part of the legislative structure and that is what the Determination on the Seventeenth Amendment also says, I later found out. It further states, I quote:

These provisions are contained as noted above in the new Chapter VIIA with Articles 41A to 41H. The Council is essentially a body that comes within the aegis of Parliament with the Speaker as its Chairman...

So, it states "with the Speaker as its Chairman". That is why it is part of the legislative structure. The Speaker is the Chairman and the body, always, has met in Parliament. But, that does not make it part of the Legislature, in the strict two senses of the word.

In the part which the Hon. President quoted, which is actually from the Determination on the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution and appears at page 306 of the same Volume, there is a statement that it is the Executive power. The reason for that is this. The Minister of Justice, the Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, and I also appeared in this case on the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution Bill and I distinctly remember your submissions, Hon. Minister, in the Supreme Court then, which were primarily aimed at the language. I remember you saying, This is bad English. How can this be part of our Constitution?, something which the President claims he and the Hon. Choksy drafted, hurriedly drafted, perhaps. It goes on to state, I quote:

The Constitutional Council established under the 17th Amendment, is part of the Executive and is attributed executive power.

That is for the reason that they were considering the rules which were to be made part of the Constitution for the Constitutional Council.

The Constitutional Council determinations were sought to be taken away from the jurisdiction of the Court and were sought to be made immune from judicial proceedings. It is in that context that the Court said, This is the exercise of Executive power by the President. Restrictions are placed on his exercise of Executive power and therefore, those decisions must be subject to judicial power; it is the exercise of Executive power that is sought to be restricted". So, that is what we have been saying, that it is the checks and balances on the Executive power by a body that is separate from the Executive, that is separate from the Legislature, but is under the egis of Parliament. Now, unfortunately, these have to be placed on record because, otherwise, those go unchallenged. Some people asked me, Are these the more important things in the country today? Well, perhaps not, but when the President comes here and says what he wants, puts forward half-baked arguments when nobody is here to challenge what he says and then he gets up and walks away, it is important that we put him right.

Then, the same Determination states, I quote:

The Constitutional Council, as pointed out earlier is established by the 17th Amendment. The proposed Amendment enables the Council to exercise legislative power,

Why? Because they can make rules; it is subsidiary legislation, no doubt, and they said that it must have the approval of Parliament, but it is something of the legislative power because they can make subsidiary legislation by means of rules.

Now, with regard to the Executives power, which has been curtailed by the Constitutional Council, that must have some meaning. The Seventeenth Amendment was brought for good governance, the Determination recognizes that. It was sought to be taken away by the Eighteenth Amendment, brought back by the Nineteenth Amendment, taken away again by the Twentieth Amendment and brought back by the Twenty-first Amendment with a lot of fanfare, saying "we are bringing this back". But, you cannot say "we have brought back the checks and balances on the President" while the President behaves as though there are no checks and balances, that he is a be-all and end-all of all and that his nomination must be accepted. To say I will make only one nomination and it must be accepted is wrong. That is not the intention of Parliament when it enacted these Amendments three times over to curtail the untrammelled power of the Executive President and that must be noted because, now, we have come into a situation of another crisis of governance. This has an implication on economic recovery as well. This has also been highlighted even by the IMF. The President

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

is the one who is violating the Constitution, and saying it for the second time in this House in less than a month, this is intentional violation of the Constitution, an offence for which he can be Impeached.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

Sir, with regard to Privilege, I want to again put this on record. Standing Order No. 83.(1) only prohibits the personal conduct of various persons, including judges, from being matters of reference in this House. Previously, the Standing Order said the conduct. That was changed. Previous Standing Order No. 78 said that "the conduct" cannot be a subject matter of discussion; now, that has been restricted to personal conduct. That is with a good reason. It is this House which gives judges the judicial power. In fact, the judicial power is exercised by Parliament through courts and to that extent, Parliament has an obligation. It is true that for the Judiciary to act independently, we must restrain ourselves. We do not discuss matters sub judice; we do not discuss judges personal conduct, but we, certainly, can discuss the official conduct of judges, and not only here, but even outside, we can subject the decisions of courts to scrutiny and criticize them.

1929 1930

That must be there for a vibrant democracy, but it must be exercised with caution so that the independence of the Judiciary is not affected. These balances seem to be coming under attack and to that extent, I want to ask the Hon. Minister of Justice, who is a member of both organs, in a sense - he is a member of the Inner Bar, a very Senior Presidents Counsel and now, a part of the Executive, occupying the position of Minister of Justice - to ensure that we continue to maintain this balance carefully, not allowing one to step on the toes of the other. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) , point of Order ?

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) , , - notice - . . , . notice , dismiss . The Judges of the lower court filed an application to exclude them from this very high tax regime. The court dismissed the case even without noticing the Inland Revenue Department. dismiss . , , . .

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) Hon. Chairman, I am not going to talk about that case because that is a matter of sub judice, but everybody knows that legal principle. The court also has to follow the rule of audi alteram partem. If the other party was not heard, the Hon. Sumanthiran himself went and argued in so many cases, audi alteram partem.

The Hon. Sumanthiran said that the President comes to Parliament, says whatever he wants and goes back. That is true. When the President wants to say something, he comes to the Chamber from this door on the Government side, says whatever he wants and goes back. Similarly, when the Hon. Sumanthiran wants to say something, he comes from that door on the Opposition side, says whatever he wants and goes back. So, what is wrong with that?

My concern is that the Hon. Sumanthiran said that I must be ashamed to be the Minister of Justice in this country. Certainly, if it came from a mediocre person, I would not be surprised or would not talk about it. But,it came from a senior Presidents Counsel like the Hon. Sumanthiran. It is rather shameful for you, Hon. Sumanthiran, to make a comment of that nature and you cited three examples. One is that the Magistrate of the Northern Province had issued an Order not to have rallies or protests and as a result, the police have arrested some people. You yourself know what the role of the Minister of Justice is. Has this House, by any statute, given power to the Minister of Justice to overrule a magistrates order?

Then, you mentioned about a monks story, where has made some hate speeches. Can the Minister of Justice go and arrest him? If anybody is affected by that, it is his duty to go and make a complaint to the police so that the police could act upon it.

Also, on the privilege issue, Sir, I did not speak for any side. Normally, when you file a case, you do not go to the judge; parties are not allowed to have access to the judge. You first go to the registrar. Then, the registrar has to accept the plaint or the petition. After that, he has to give a number and then only he will send it to the judge. That has been the inveterate practice during the last two centuries in this country. Thereafter, of course, when the other party appears, they are entitled to take up any objection; they can even ask the notice to be recalled. In how many cases has the Hon. Sumanthiran appeared and made such applications? You know that and I also know that; we have enough experiences. But, we have to be truthful in this House.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) On the application of the PTA, the Government has made a determination. So, why have they been arrested under the PTA?

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) This is not about the determination. We were talking about this privilege issue.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) But, I am asking about the other matter, as to why the Government is not making a direction that the police should not use the PTA.

I actually want to draw your attention to the very critical situation we are facing in terms of the Judiciary, justice and democracy in this country, the role of the Judiciary at this moment and how important it is. I think we all agree that for a country or for a democratic society to function effectively, not only do the various organs of the State or the pillars of democracy need to function effectively, but they also need to be seen legitimate by the people. There should be a level of trust between the people and the various organs of the State. A social contract between the various organs of the State and the people is a necessary element in governing. There is an unwritten social contract between the various organs or institutions of the State and the people and some level of trust that that social contract would be respected and protected. In that sense, the trust the people have placed in the institutions of justice or the Judiciary is critical. There needs to be some trust that those institutions would function impartially, independently and that they would act in the interest of the people. The problem today is that the trust the people have in the organs of the State have deteriorated to a critical level. Today, the situation we have is actually a distortion of that social contract, a distortion of the trust that the people have and a manipulation of that trust.

This is a country which faced a momentous uprising led by the citizens as a reaction to the arrogant and insensitive actions of a wildly popular, elected

Government. Within two years, they completely managed to destroy the trust the people had placed in that Government. The bottom line was that the institutions that were expected to take care of the people and to protect the people essentially failed. Rather, those institutions were manipulated or made to function in the interest of those in power. This is what forced the people to take to the streets; this is what forced the people to demand that those elected Representatives leave their positions. But, what is more critical is that what happened thereafter.

What happened thereafter was that the Constitution, the laws and the institutions of power were used by those in power to realign themselves, to protect themselves and to completely ignore the voice and the demands that the people had made at that moment. What we have today as a result is a total distortion of justice and fair play and a normalization of illegitimacy. For a society to function effectively and for a government to govern, legitimacy is the key; it is critical. Without that legitimacy and the trust of the people in the government, that they will work on their behalf, there can be no hope either for justice or fair play.

Today, all the organs of the State are being used to justify this distorted state of affairs that is currently there in the country. We have Government Ministers who accuse each other of corruption in Parliament and who also accuse the Judiciary of being biased. The Hon. Minister of Justice himself spoke in Parliament about huge levels of corruption. Hon. Minister, I recall one instance where you spoke about the "X-Press Pearl" disaster. You made those statements here in Parliament, but nothing has happened. Then, former Minister of Sports and Youth made serious allegations against the Judiciary. All of that goes to erode even the minimal trust that the people have in the judicial system.

The Hon. President, [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

as has been talked about here, has made all kinds of statements and claims, which have really damaged those institutions. For instance, take his attitude towards the Local Authorities Election, which the independent Election Commission declared. The Hon. President came to Parliament and said that he did not know what election was being talked about because no election had been declared. When the Judiciary, in a Determination, ordered that that election must take place and that the money approved by Parliament for that must be allocated, that did not happen. The Executive

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

ignores the Determination of the Supreme Court. The Hon. President

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

1939 1940

claims in various speeches that the people of this country do not want elections, that that is not the priority of the people, indirectly attempting to influence the Judiciary. Then, he comes to Parliament and claims that the Constitutional Council is an extension of the Executive power. He continues to make these kinds of wild and very irresponsible claims constantly, undermining the independence of the Judiciary and the role of the Judiciary in protecting the people of this country and standing by their interests.

If you look at Parliament and its legislative functions, we had passed Constitutional Amendments - the Seventeenth Amendment, the Eighteenth Amendment, the Nineteenth Amendment, the Twentieth Amendment and the Twenty First Amendment -each of which is a contradiction of the previous Amendment. There are Hon. Members of Parliament who have raised their hands to pass each of those Amendments. Let us take one Amendment in particular which has come into focus today, the Amendment preventing dual citizens from being elected to Parliament or having a position of authority within the Legislature. That came into the Constitution through one Amendment, was removed by another and has come back into it; the Amendment itself was reversed, re-imposed and again reversed. Today, there is a current sitting MP whose citizenship status is being challenged, which is a serious matter. If any Hon. Member of Parliament cannot prove his or her citizenship and his or her citizenship is challenged by another citizen of this country, that is a serious matter. The Supreme Court has recently delivered a verdict, naming one of those dual citizens as culpable for the economic crisis that the country has experienced and as responsible for the suffering the people of this country have undergone. Then, what is the accountability that this Parliament has on matters that had been determined by the Judiciary?

If you look at the Bills that keep coming before us, there is a pattern where priority is given to those Bills which really seek to suppress the voice of the people and the freedoms of the people. The Prevention of Terrorism Act continues to be applied even after this very Government, some years ago, declared a moratorium on it. The Counter Terrorism Bill, which the Government put forward, was challenged, withdrawn and now, almost the same Bill is going to be presented again. Then, there is also the Online Safety Bill and several other Bills, which I do not have time to go into.

Whose interest are these Bills really represent? It seems as if the main mandate of the Government in power right now is to somehow remain in power at all cost. Can there be a more dangerous situation than this? It is in this context, where this Government has demonstrated over and over again its utter and total contempt of the law, the Constitution, any kind of ethics, moral obligations, justice and of any interest in safeguarding the interests of the people and that it is willing to go to any length, that the role of the Judiciary is critical. We are rapidly approaching a point of no return, where there is potentially a complete breakdown of all we hold sacred in

this country. It is in this context that the majority of citizens of this country is turning to the Judiciary, placing their hope on the Judiciary to uphold public trust, to protect the public and to act in the interest of the public. To rise above the political power plays of this Government, the Judiciary cannot, at this point, let the people of this country down.

, . , - - . .

, . , - Determination - .

It states, I quote:

.... As firmly laid down in the Determination of the Divisional Bench of Seven Judges of this Court in regard to the constitutionality of the proposed 19th Amendment to the Constitution (2002 3 SLR page 85) the principle enunciated in Articles 3 and 4 of our Constitution is that the respective organs of Government, the Legislature, the Executive, and the Judiciary are reposed power as custodians for the time being to be exercised for the people.

It has been firmly stated in several judgments of this Court that the Rule of Law is the basis of our Constitution [....] If there is one principle that runs through the entire fabric of the Constitution, it is the principle of the Rule of Law and under the Constitution, it is the judiciary which is entrusted with the task of keeping every organ of the State within the limits of the law and thereby making the Rule of Law meaningful and effective

As it is essential to the maintenance of the rule of law that every organ of the State must act within the limits of its power and carry out the duty imposed upon it in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and the law, the Court cannot close its eyes and allow the actions of the State or the Public Authority go unchecked in its operations, in the public interest.

That is the argument we advanced on the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution . I think you were reading out from the 2022 Determination. I also appeared for one of the parties that intervened and that was our own argument.

Hon. Presiding Member, before I begin my speech on the Votes of the Ministry of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms, I wish to take a few minutes of my allotted time to declare that I shall wear this shawl as a symbol of this House's determination to express our solidarity with the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who are being ruthlessly subjected to the most horrifying, collective punishment on the pretext of a retaliatory war

1973 1974

202] 02

against the Hamas for what happened on the 07th of October, 2023. Sir, 157 Members of this Parliament signed a memorandum, calling upon the Secretary-General of the United Nations to immediately call a halt to that horrendous war, which is not a war between two equal parties and is such a disproportionate war. After the temporary pause for a few days, yesterday, the genocidal Israeli defence forces have once again resumed bombarding several areas occupied by the hapless civilian population of Palestine.

The international community is unable to call a halt to this terrible carnage, which is nothing but a war on innocent children, women and the elderly. It has not spared hospitals, doctors, nurses and humanitarian workers; even journalists have been murdered. The death toll is reaching almost 20,000 and the majority of them are children. It has already killed more than 150 UN staff members working in those Occupied Territories. As a matter of fact, the UN Secretary-General says that in its entire history, it is the highest number of UN staff members who had died in a conflict area. Sir, what is more ironic is, the day we went to hand over our memorandum to the UN Office here, they themselves had flown their flags at half-mast to signify their sorrow for their colleagues who had been killed while on duty in the Occupied Territories of Palestine during this war. After Rwanda and Bosnia, we heard the world leaders say, "Never again will we permit such a genocide". But, we are now witnessing how hollow that pledge is. The amnesia of the Western World in the wake of horrible war crimes and the apartheid practised in Occupied Palestinian Territories cannot be tolerated indefinitely. Today, I saw that Her Excellency Julie Chung, the American Ambassador here, has, in a Twitter handle, commented about the manner in which this Government is using the PTA to arrest people in the North. But, what is more important is for her to also equally look at how the Israeli defence forces are arresting innocent Palestinian children and women who have not been involved in conflict and are incarcerating them for days and days on end! Even when some of them were released recently during the exchange of prisoners, the Israeli defence forces were going and telling each Palestinian household, "You are not to celebrate it. You are not to have any function. You are not to enjoy the return of your dear ones". Such is the brutality of the Israeli State.

Therefore, Sir, it is important to tell those western countries and their allies that they do not have the moral right to preach to the rest of the world about rules-based international order, the Geneva conventions and whatnot when they have deliberately encouraged and endorsed those horrible war crimes.

Sir, there, we are witnessing hunger or starvation as a weapon of war, denying them water and sanitation, depriving them of food, medical supplies and continuously bombarding a hapless population living in what is called the largest "open-air prison" in the world. If this is not genocide, what is genocide? If this is not war crimes, what in the world are war crimes is what we are asking. Therefore, we are aghast and disgusted against the double standards of the West!

Sir, I, therefore, solemnly say that I shall continue to wear this shawl in this House as a token of my solidarity with the Palestinian struggle, unless and until a permanent ceasefire is declared. That, Sir, is the least we could do for our brothers and sisters who are dying and being subjected to all sorts of horrible crimes in the Occupied Territories of Palestine. Long live Palestine! Also, I must thank my dear Friend, the Hon. Dilan Perera, who is in the House now and who made a similar speech yesterday in support of the struggle of the Palestinians for their liberation.

I think I have a very short time left. How many minutes more do I have, Sir?

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) You have five more minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Within those five minutes, , . . . , .

, , . , , , . , . . , . , .

Then, I must refer to, since the Hon. Minister also intervened and replied, the matter raised by the Hon. (Dr.) Kavinda Heshan Jayawardhana regarding the Easter Sunday attacks. I also would like to refer to the same opinion poll that was published in the Daily Mirror yesterday. It states, I quote:

Over 50% of Lankans say local political forces behind Easter Sunday attacks: Survey

1975 1976

This survey, which is a very reliable survey, in my opinion, also states, I quote:

Only 8 per cent believed that it was carried out without the involvement of local political forces

Only 8 per cent believed that and more than 50 per cent of the country believed otherwise. That is a sample survey, but yet, quite a reliable survey and that is why it is very important for us to revisit the investigations. It is true, there had been 40-odd cases that had been filed.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Sir, I will take about two, three minutes from the Hon. Kiriella's time. He told me to.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) Ah, yes. Sir, it is given. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Sir, he is a Colleague of mine from the Kandy District. So, he will be very generous.

Now, Sir, what the country thinks regarding those attacks is quite apparent from this poll. Therefore, it is important for us to allay these fears and suspicions that have arisen. Particularly, the Catholic community led by the Cardinal, the Catholic Bishops' Conference and various others has spoken ad nauseam about this. But, now, what is important is this. There had been some new evidence that had emerged. Some may dismiss what had been revealed by "Channel 4". My Friend, Mr. Pillayan, is seated behind. He had also alleged to have been involved in it; that is what one of his own colleagues had said. My Friend is supposed to have gone and made a statement. But, there must be some detailed investigation done into what had already been revealed.

Then, there have been other issues regarding intelligence operatives, who have been prevented from giving evidence or whose statements have been prevented from being collected. All of that will shed some new light, if at all. You can forget about the cases that have already been filed. But, I genuinely feel that if the Attorney-Generals Department had been a little more probing even with regard to those cases that had been filed - against the entire lot, they had gone and filed charges - certain people among them could have been made crown witnesses to further shed light on this matter because they have much more valuable evidence. I am not going to name people. I have been very carefully examining court records and the evidence that had already

been recorded, but since those are pending cases and as a former Minister of Justice, I cannot be talking about those here. It would be unfair. But then, whether the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney-General - this is a very important thing - has been properly exercised or whether they have just been listening to the investigation officers and have been closing files is an issue. You cannot do that. They have the prosecutorial discretion to see whether there was anything suspicious and certain matters have to be further investigated to see whether there had been some other hidden hands behind this. Almost half or more than half of the country is believing that there was a political involvement. It is not for us to right away accuse Mr. Pillayan or anybody else, but then, rightfully, investigate these matters.

Why did they go and arrest Mr. Shani Abeysekara, who was a CID Officer and was investigating into this? Then, why did they arrest Mr. Hejaaz Hizbullah? They said that Hejaaz Hizbullah is the . Now, he is in the process of getting acquitted. . , . I think you will have to allay the suspicions among the people. Today, more than half of the country is believing that there was a political conspiracy, that it has not come out of nowhere. Therefore, with those matters also in mind, please see that a fresh investigation is conducted into this matter because it has gone to Geneva. So, it is going to be much more contested in Geneva in the coming few months.

Having said that, Sir, I conclude my speech. Thank you.

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) Sir, since the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella is very generous, I am taking five minutes off his time just to reply to this matter. I hope you have no objection to that, Hon. Kiriella. - [Interruption.] Sir, there is no problem and I will just clarify this matter.

[4.28 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, I would like to start my comments referring to one matter since the Hon. State Minister of Justice and Prison Affairs is here. As you know, as Tamil Members of Parliament, we visit the prisons quite a bit and meet with the Tamil political prisoners. In the course of those meetings, we also talk to the prison officials and of late, those officials, who total to about 6,000, have been pleading with us to urge the Government to consider them, with regard to salaries and allowances, on par with the those in the Sri Lanka Police. I think those in the Sri Lanka Police, because of this economic crisis, are getting almost 40 per cent of their salary as incentives or allowances, which is not being made available to the prison authorities. So, I urge you to consider their request because the job they do is as important as what is done by the police and since it is also not a large number, but only 6,000. So, again, I ask you to consider their request.

The other matters I want to raise, of course, directly come under the Hon. Minister, but I presume that I can brief you, Hon. State Minister, on those, too. As you know, there is a total of 14 Tamil detainees arreasted under the PTA, of whom nine are convicted prisoners. Among them, there are five individuals - Selvarajah Kirubakaran, Thambiah Pragash, Nadesan Kugathasan, Shanmugalingam Sooriyakumar and Thangavel Nomalan - Hon. State Minister, whose cases are still going on. Those five individuals have about three or four cases going on and all the others are convicted and are serving their sentences. If we take those five individuals, Selvarajah Kirubakaran has three cases and with regard to two cases, he had already been granted bail, but in the third case, for some reason, the authorities had come up and objected to bail on the basis that they have some intelligence reports that he might recreate the LTTE. That is preposterous, in which case, he would not have been granted bail in the previous two cases as well. Therefore, there must be some consistency. They are individuals who had almost served their sentence time in other cases and are waiting for their trials to finish. And, in the case of Mr. Kirubakaran, his confession had been rejected by the previous courts. After that rejection of confession and after the previous cases coming to an end, the Attorney-Generals Department has now gone and filed new indictments based on that same confession. I think those are extremely unfair, Sir. In fact, last year during the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Justice also, I raised this matter, but nothing has happened so far. I sincerely appeal to the Hon. Minister and you, Hon. State Minister, to intervene with regard to these five individuals and grant them bail. There is no reason why they should not be granted bail when everybody else is being granted bail.

Then, with regard to the convicted prisoners, I appeal to you to understand that they had been convicted under the PTA. We all reject the PTA. Your Government and even the Hon. Minister have raised about the PTA. -

2011 2012

[Interruption] Thank you, Hon. Minister. The Hon. Minister made commitments on that in 2015 when he went to Geneva with the late Hon. Mangala Samaraweera. It was during your tenure as Minister of Justice at that time that the Government of Sri Lanka made commitments that they would create a moratorium on the application of the PTA.

So, when we ourselves, in principle, accept that the PTA is a draconian law, is not suitable and in almost all cases, creates injustice, then it is only fair that those convicted prisoners who have already served quite a number of years of their sentences be, in fact, released. Therefore, I appeal to you to look at that as a matter of urgency and also to seriously consider bail being granted to those five individuals, about whom I mentioned and who had other cases where bail had already been granted. So, there is no reason why they should not be granted bail with regard to the cases that are outstanding.

The next matter, Sir, is something that the Hon. Sithadthan also mentioned, but he did not mention the entire number. Under the PTA, despite the fact that the Governments official position is that they would not use the PTA, the police continue to bring charges under B Reports. As you know, Sir, the Governments position is that people are entitled to remember their dead; that is their official position. The President, the Hon. Minister and others also have stated it, the proviso being that they must not commemorate as the LTTE, that they must not project it as an LTTE function. As a result, people have tried to go and attend those various commemorations. The police, particularly those in the Eastern Province and not in the North, had arrested ten individuals on the basis of their taking part or in some way, organizing those commemorations, out of whom two individuals, Mr. K. Kumararaja and K. Janojan, father and son, are members of our own party. All the courts in Batticaloa, when the police approached them to get a ban on the commemorations, refused to give a ban. They said that commemorating the dead is a fundamental right enshrined under the Constitution and that people are entitled to do it, provided that there is no LTTE paraphernalia being projected, that the LTTE is not being projected during those events. So, there was no LTTE being projected; everybody went there to commemorate the dead. Despite that, when those two individuals went for that, they were turned back. The police refused to allow them to commemorate the dead at the cemeteries, where those former cadres were buried or cremated, and they had to turn back.

So, they, along with the vehicle which took some red and yellow flags, which are the general flags for Tamil nationalism - our party also has red and yellow and there is no LTTE in that - were turned back. They were told that they cannot commemorate. Then, when they were turned back and when they were going, the police stopped them halfway through and took the person who was driving that vehicle, in which they took those flags to tie at the commemoration, to the police station. So, my two party members who had hired that poor fellow also went

to the police station and ultimately, they all had been charged under the PTA. For what? For doing something that the Government said we could do, for doing something that the court said we could do, but what the police, for some reason, think is connected to the LTTE. That is just completely unfair, completely unfair! Then, among the arrested were Newton Thanushan, a young 19-year old gentleman who is waiting to do his A/Ls in coming January, the son and his father Anthony Newton. All what those two individuals did was, they provided the sound system for that commemoration, nothing else and they have been charged under the PTA. They were hired; they had nothing to do with even organizing the process. The individual who drove the vehicle, S. Navajeevan, has also been charged under the PTA. Then, P. Mosesvaran is an individual who was working in the Sunshine Bakery as a cashier. Some lady had come and bought a cake and on that cake the name Prabhakaran had been written and the police had gone and charged her under the PTA for having a cake with the name Prabhakaran written on it. Then, they had proceeded to go and arrest the cashier also. Are these cases coming under the PTA, Hon. Minister? It is thoroughly being abused. This is police terrorism that is happening; they are deliberately using the PTA to terrorize the population. That is it; there is nothing PTA about these. What is the terrorism in buying a cake with Prabhakaran written on it, for Gods sake? Then, there was an old gentleman who belongs to a political party with which some of these TNA Members are in coalition. He is one Nagalingan Sangarapillai who belongs to the Jananayaga Poraligal Party and he had provided some food and dry rations to the parents of former LTTE cadres who had died and some needy people. Simply because he provided some food and dry rations to the parents and family members who are struggling in todays economic situation and whose breadwinners and children are no more and had died as cadres of the LTTE, he is charged under the PTA. I mean, what on earth is going on?

Then, we had a case last month where two former Presidents and a former Finance Minister had been ruled as being the people who bankrupted this country.

Let us say that, eventually, they are found guilty, put in prison, the whole world condemns them and this country also condemns them for bankrupting the country. If there are sections of the public who still believe that they are leaders for whatever they did, are still people of value, they want to support them and that they want to identify themselves with the Rajapaksas, does that make those people criminals? If the Rajapaksas are found guilty tomorrow and are sent to the gallows, does it mean that you cannot go and talk to Mrs. Rajapaksa? Does it mean that you cannot go and talk to their family? Does it mean that you cannot go and invite them to your house? What is the meaning of this? What sort of principles are you propagating here? But, that is what is happening; that is exactly what is happening - you are condemned.

This Government says that they sent former LTTE cadres for rehabilitation and brought them back into the society. If members of the public try to give employment to them or try to help them, they also would be charged.

2013 2014

. .

202] 02

So, people are frightened to give them employment. Those former cadres are suffering. When members of the public like us, who feel that they have a duty to help those people because they are pauperized, try to help them, if we are being charged under the PTA on the false allegation that we are trying to regroup the LTTE, on what basis can we do that? Therefore, you, Hon. Minister, have to intervene in this because the police are not going to do it. For whatever reason, they are hell bent on abusing these laws. Either it is due to political interference coming from above or the police have just no idea about this assurance given with regard to the PTA and are adamant to abuse these laws. So, you must intervene. These are political decisions that must be taken at the highest level and directives that must come from above and those people must be released. Also, you must make sure that those police officers know that under no circumstances could they use the PTA because you have given assurances, you, personally, to the international community. It is not about whether the international community has double standards. Of course, they do and we are not bothered about them. It is you, as Minister of Justice previously, who gave those assurances. So, we have to stick by our own standards and you, more than anybody else, Hon. Minister, have a duty to make sure that this law is not applied in this way. I thank you, Sir.

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) Hon. Presiding Member, I want to respond.

Hon. Member, it is correct, as you said, that it is we who made the commitments and assured in January, 2015 that we would not enforce the PTA . In fact, during my tenure, it was not enforced. But, subsequently, when the Easter Sunday attack took place - I was not in the then Government - the Government in power had to make use of it since it was the law available and in fact, under the PTA, they had taken a lot of measures, not only to apprehend the culprits, but also to stop further crimes and damages from being done. Further crimes could be committed when communal issues are raised by various people, that we do not know where the end would be.

At the same time, we were dedicated and committed and through other legislations, we established the Office on Missing Persons - OMP - and the Office for Reparations. Then, the Bill to set up the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation would be presented, but it was in operation. If not for the Easter Sunday attack, whatever Government that was in power could have brought in the new Bill. That Bill had been challenged in the Supreme Court and there was a Determination and after all that clearance, it could have been passed. Anyway, due to that incident, that was hampered.

Later on, when the present Government assumed responsibility in May, last year, we drafted a new Bill - of course, certain principles which had been there in the earlier Counter Terrorism Bill have also been included in that - and gazetted it. When it was gazetted, there were

many representations from Tamil political parties, Muslim political parties, other political parties, trade unions and even from the diplomatic corps. They pointed out that certain clauses are not acceptable, as they are against some democratic norms and principles. We listened to them, agreed with them and then, cancelled the Bill that was gazetted by us. Later, we redrafted it after discussing again with all the stakeholders, including the High Commissioners and Ambassadors. Ultimately, we agreed on a final draft and that is what we have gazetted now. Still, if anybody has any concerns - Parliament is the body which makes laws - we can discuss.

Then, regarding to the other incident the Hon. Member brought up - I may not be referring to the same person you mentioned - I asked from the police. Though the Hon. Member said that it was not a commemoration for the revival of the LTTE and that it had no connection with the LTTE, the police have forwarded some photographs to me. According to those, on the front side of their t-shirts, Prabhakarans photo is there and on the back, the LTTE flag is printed. These may not be photos of the commemorations in the Eastern Province, but in the Northern Province. Hon. Member, we are trying to rebuild relations among all the communities. When some small groups, some extremists or fundamentalists, create issues like this, it is very difficult to have any reconciliation.

You know that by 2015, there were over 350 detainees under the PTA and with the assistance of the Hon. Attorney General, we released a large number of detainees. Thereafter, to hear out cases of detainees with serious charges under the PTA and conclude them, we made arrangement to establish two separate High Courts, one in Colombo and one in Anuradhapura. In fact, within a period of one and a half years or two years, they could have finished those cases very easily because there were not more than 100 cases. I also checked the progress of those courts from time to time. On most days, what had happened was that the lawyers had come and asked for future dates.

Therefore, during that period they could not conclude those cases, but with all that, now it has come down to less than 20 cases altogether of convicted and remand prisoners.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Nine had been convicted. ) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) Nine convicted and eleven others, I think.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) No, nine convicted and five others.

2015 2016

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) Sir, with regard to the other prisoners also - I think the Hon. Jayantha Weerasinghe explained it - we would take action under the sentencing policy we are going to bring in to Parliament. Some have been detained for longer periods than their sentences. A person's sentence commences from the date his sentence is confirmed either by the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court. So, the legal system itself is faulty; that is wrong. Now, we are trying to correct it. I think had it been corrected earlier, a lot of people would have been released. I am hopeful that I would be able to bring in that Bill and get it passed very soon, maybe, in January or February next year.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Minister, I am grateful for your comments. You will certainly have our cooperation with regard to those amendments you hope to bring in so that we could take the period the prisoners have been in remand also into consideration.

Those photographs of incidents where people were wearing T-shirts with the LTTE symbol and the LTTE leaders face, the police can certainly look into. We are not asking them not to, but those are not things which should be charged under the PTA, Hon. Minister. The PTA is the most draconian law. Wearing a T-shirt with such a photo, surely, is not a reason for them to be charged under the PTA. There are various other laws you can use. I can say with utmost responsibility that none of these happened in the Eastern Province. The ten individuals I was talking about had no involvement in any of this even. The incidents were relating to people who simply went to commemorate the dead, people who had helped with regard to organizing those events or providing a sound system and transport being charged under the PTA. Can you even justify that? There is a big difference, Hon. Minister, than to an occasion where you all, as a responsible Government, have to act in terms of the PTA in case some major catastrophe or some major incident happens. But, this is a case where the Governments policy and the Magistrates Court Order have been that people could commemorate their dead. It is the police that had been violating and abusing it very clearly.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, the time is very limited.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) So, that is what I am asking you to intervene in, Hon. Minister. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, Hon. A.L.M. Athaullah. You have eleven minutes.
