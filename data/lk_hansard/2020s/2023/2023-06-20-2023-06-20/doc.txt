RELEASE OF WASTEWATER INTO KELANI RIVER:

asked the Minister of Environment:

(a) Will he inform this House -

(i) the number of factories established around

the Kelani River;

(ii) whether he is aware that the wastewater

discharged from those factories are released into that river;

(iii) whether a test has been conducted in

relation to the damages caused to the water of the Kelani River by such wastewater; and

(iv) the measures that have been adopted to

prevent the release of wastewater into the Kelani River?

(b) If not, why? ( - ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed - Minister of Environment) Hon. Speaker, the Answer is as follows:

(a) (i) The Central Environmental Authority has reported that 734 factories in the Colombo District and 466 factories in the Gampaha District are located within 500 metres of the buffer zone of the Kelani River, as per the survey conducted in the year 2020 regarding factories established close to the Kelani River.

(ii) The Central Environmental Authority has reported that the dirty water discharged from factories existing close to the Kelani River is released after purifying up to the extent specified by the standards on release of water into internal water-bodies in accordance with Gazette Notification No. 2264/17 dated 27.01.2022.

(iii) The Central Environmental Authority has reported that water quality tests have been conducted regularly since 2003 up until now with regard to the quality of water of the Kelani River.

The Central Environmental Authority has reported that water samples are collected from 17 locations, which include 11 places on the mainstream between the point where the Kelani River originates and the place where it enters the sea and six places in its tributaries, once in every two months and subjected to analysis along physical, chemical and microbiological parameters. This task used to be carried out once a month from 2003 to 2021 and it was limited to once in two months due to the increase of prices of fuel as well chemical substances necessary for analytical activities, which occurred in the year 2022. The Central Environmental Authority has reported that the samples obtained enable a clear exposition regarding the impact caused to the water of the river by the wastewater discharged from factories and released into it and that according to the findings of the analyses conducted so far, releasing of purified industrial wastewater into the Kelani River has caused no impact on the quality of the water of the Kelani River. The Central Environmental Authority has reported that analytical data has revealed that some impact is caused to the quality of the water of the river at certain places due to factors such as pollution caused by domestic wastewater/faecal waste and disposal of waste that occurs on either side of the River. It has also been reported that in addition to the systematic analysing

of water in the river, the Central Environmental Authority works towards periodically analysing wastewater discharged from factories located on either side of the Kelani River through its laboratory and where an instance of non-compliance to conditions of the environmental protection licence is disclosed, the Authority ensures that the conditions consistent with the relevant standards are maintained by directing the industrialists to take necessary steps to keep the conditions consistent with the relevant standards and in instances where such non-compliance persists, the Authority makes arrangements to put a stop to the release of wastewater into the Kelani River as well as to take necessary legal measures. As reported by the Central Environmental Authority, the activities carried out for the surveillance of factories located on either side of the Kelani River and analysing water of the Kelani River have been in operation under a programme initiated by the Central Environmental Authority and the National Water Supply and Drainage Board in the year 2023. It has been reported that the follow-up scrutiny activities on the 91 selected factories have been completed by now and that the technical instructions necessary for industrialists have to be issued.

(iv) The Central Environmental Authority has reported that pollution of water is controlled by ensuring that wastewater discharged from factories are purified before release in accordance with the specified standards through the environmental protection licence system and measures are taken to prevent the quality of water of the Kelani River from reaching a hazardous level.

In addition, as reported by the Central Environmental Authority, the wastewater released into the Kelani River is regulated by constant surveillance of factories close to the Kelani River and by obtaining analytical reports on wastewater released into the Kelani River after purification.

(b) Does not arise.

( ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed) Hon. Member, as reported by the CEA, they have taken all the measures to prevent any type of hazardous wastewater discharge into the river. Of course, as the Hon. Member asked, if there is any new system to be adopted or introduced, we would very much welcome that. Also, we will have a meeting with the Hon. Members to see what are the specific areas that should be addressed.

Hon. Prime Minister, since the Acting Minister of Finance is also here, I need just one clarification. This morning, when the Public Finance Committee Report on the Parliamentary Budget Office Bill was submitted, it was stated that the Committee raised the issue of Clause 37, that the time frame of 14 days for submission of the draft estimate of expenditure was not sufficient. I see that you have addressed it in the Committee Stage Amendments . In that particular Amendment, you have used the phrase "Budget Call Circular" issued by the Department of National Budget. But, what is "Budget Call Circular" is not defined anywhere, either in the Bill or in the proposed Committee Stage Amendments. Therefore, I think there is a lacuna there and that you might have to look at that.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you.

Next, the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne. Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Speaker will now take the Chair.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, I wish to place this question before the Hon. Acting Minister of Finance. I would like to refer to the recent announcements made at the Colombo Stock Exchange with regard to the Peoples Leasing Company and their plans to acquire a 33 per cent stake in First Capital Holdings. That acquisition has raised significant concerns and questions about the investment rationale and the structuring of the transaction.

Sir, at a time when people are taking a lot of beating, undergoing a lot of hardships and the Government is imposing restrictions on the people, the Government being transparent in it activities, in how it conducts itself is imperative and important. That is why I am raising this question, not with any malice.

First and foremost, it is important to note that the Janashakthi Limited currently holds an 83 per cent stake in First Capital Holdings PLC. With the Peoples Leasing Companys acquisition of a 33 per cent stake, the Janashakthi Limited will retain a controlling stake of 50 per cent in First Capital Holdings. This leads us to the question as to why the Peoples Leasing Company has chosen to acquire a 33 per cent stake and trigger a mandatory offer. The first impression raised doubts whether the mandatory offer was triggered to provide exit liquidity to the Janashakthi Limited shareholders. By triggering the mandatory offer, the Peoples Leasing Company's stake in First Capital Holdings is likely to increase to around 40 per cent, resulting in an increased cash outlay closer to Rs. 5.5 billion. This raises concerns about the investment rationale behind purchasing a 33 per cent stake and requires a further clarification. Given this, I would like to pose the following questions to the Hon. Acting Minister of Finance.

The first is, is it the intention of the Board of the Peoples Leasing Company to increase this stake to over 50 per cent and make the First Capital Holdings a subsidiary of the Peoples Leasing Company? If so, are there any provisions for the purchase of additional First Capital Holdings' shares in the future? This House needs to know that. Is there a call option with a pre-agreed price to facilitate this arrangement? The Peoples Leasing Companys owning Company, the Peoples Bank, has a primary dealership. So, how will this transaction add value?

The second is, considering the current Government policy of restructuring and divesting holdings in State-owned enterprises, it is essential to understand why the Peoples Leasing Company is deviating from this policy. This deviation requires justification and clarification from the Board of the PLC.

The third one is, when due diligence was done, were there any concerns raised regarding First Capital Holdings exposure to Treasury Bonds and Treasury Bills, given the yet to be finalized domestic debt optimization framework? How was the potential financial impact of domestic debt optimization on First Capital Holdings accounted for? If domestic debt optimization affects First Capitals profitability, will the purchase

consideration paid by the Peoples Leasing Company to First Capital Holdings be subject to variation? Why is the transaction being carried out prior to the finalization of the domestic debt optimization framework? Would it not be prudent to wait until the framework is finalized to eliminate the uncertainty regarding the financial impacts?

The fourth question is this. To assess the risk associated with First Capital Holdings Treasury Bills and Bonds portfolio, it is crucial to understand the scenario analysis conducted and reviewed by the Board of the Peoples Leasing Company. Have they thoroughly considered the possibility of maturity extensions and coupon reductions on these Holdings? If so, we request further details be provided to this august Parliament.

Considering the potential financial implications of domestic debt optimization on both PLC and the Peoples Bank, fifthly, it is essential to inquire whether a scenario analysis has been performed to determine if these institutions require a capital infusion to meet the minimum capital adequacy requirement.

Lastly, given the current negative credit growth and the potential for increased private sector credit growth when interest rates decrease and economic activity improves, would it not be wise for the Peoples Leasing Company management to retain their current excess liquidity instead of utilizing it for the acquisition of a minority stake in First Capital Holdings?

This approach would ensure maintenance of capital adequacy requirements in post-DDO and provide the necessary funding to facilitate credit growth in the second half of 2023 when economic activity picks up again.

Therefore, the acquisition of a 33 per cent stake in First Capital Holdings by the People's Leasing Company raises legitimate concerns regarding the investment rationale, the structure of the transaction and the potential financial implications arising from the Domestic Debt Optimization process. I urge the Hon. Acting Minister of Finance to provide answers to Parliament on those questions and to ensure transparency in the decision-making process. Safeguarding financial stability of State-owned enterprises and protecting public funds must be our utmost priority.

Sir, the Parliamentary Budget Office Bill has been long overdue and long outstanding. Actually, it is a great victory for the people in the aragalaya, who spoke about wanting new systems and new tools that would ensure more transparency and accountability. So, we are happy that the Government has brought this in. We thank the Hon. President for pushing it forward.

Hon. Acting Minister of Finance, you spoke about accountability and all that, but there is a big difference between the laws you all bring in and the way you all act. That is our main problem. The Opposition, you said, make some baseless allegations. Our allegations are not baseless; we are giving you proof. The problem is, you all do not give sufficient answers.

773 774

The role of the Legislature is changing with Parliaments playing a more active role in Budget matters, especially in developing countries. For promoting good governance and fiscal transparency, the Legislatures active engagement in the Budget process becomes essential. I would like to recommend that in addition to the Parliamentary Budget Office providing a Budget analysis, independent advice to Parliamentarians and policy costing to Party Leaders and MPs, they also focus on the following. As you said, you all will add it up in the rules and regulations.

It would be good for the Parliamentary Budget Office to assist MPs to indulge in a pre-Budget discussion sufficiently, early before the Budget itself so that they are also engaged in the Budget process.

Our practice in Sri Lanka has been for the Ministry of Finance to submit a three-year, medium-term expenditure framework with the Budget. I recommend that we propose a medium-term budgetary framework for three years to be submitted to the Parliamentary Budget Office with every Budget so that the MPs could look at the progress and the path ahead and how they could make necessary changes, if necessary.

The global scenario in all aspects, including government and politics, is changing and if we, as a country, do not adopt modern tools and techniques, we will not be able to compete in our region with our neighbours.

Governments are challenged to respond to the urgent needs of citizens and to be more accountable to them. All over the world, the public is putting governments under heavy pressure to show that they are providing good value for money and results. That is what we, too, have to do as politicians.

Governments and the public sector need to modernize. There are new tools that are required to perform and achieve outcomes and goals and to get results. Managing for Development Results is one such tool that has been used, which typically involves many phases such as articulating and agreeing on objectives, selecting Key Performance Indicators, setting targets, monitoring performances and analysing and reporting on results against targets. Countries like Malaysia have adopted performance-based budgeting years ago and has even moved to outcome-based budgeting. These are progressive steps that we need to take as a country.

The concept of Managing for Development Results has been adopted gradually in Sri Lanka since the 1990s. But, Manufacturing for Development Results is a change management that emphasizes a shift in focus from inputs, activities and outputs to outcomes and impacts. It promotes the concept of Accountability for Results. Management for Development Results is an essential aspect of good governance to improve development efficiency and effectiveness, transparency, accountability and informed decision-making.

Further, the Government of Sri Lanka became a signatory to the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness in March, 2005 and is committed to institutionalize the Management for Development Results Government-wide. But sadly, in 2007 or 2008, the Rajapaksa regime scrapped the Ministry of Plan Implementation altogether, under which Management for Development Results programme was launched. The Monitoring and Evaluation Framework for Sri Lanka that was being developed at that time was put on the back burner until today. Those tools, which we needed and which should have prevented this country from going bankrupt, were thrown aside by the Rajapaksa regime.

Globally, monitoring and evaluation has expanded as a key tool of government with many uses such as decision-making, organizational learning, knowledge-based programme improvement, policy development, impact/outcome assessment, accountability and performance audit itself. It is a powerful tool used widely by the governments across the world. I am the Chair of the Global Parliamentarians Forum for Evaluation. We, in 2018, got 78 Parliaments to come to Sri Lanka. We held the international conference EvalColombo and decided on the Colombo Declaration for every Parliament to adopt evaluation as a policy, to have a national evaluation policy for each parliament. Through our Parliamentarians' Forum, we established a National Evaluation Policy here in Sri Lanka and in many Parliaments. The Global Parliamentarians' Forum was involved in promoting such evaluation policies in Nepal, the Philippines and in Kyrgyzstan.

In 2019, we had the Select Committee to Study and Report to Parliament its Recommendations to Ensure National Evaluation Capacity in Sri Lanka under the leadership of the then Deputy Speaker, the Hon. Ananda Kumarasiri, and we developed a draft National Evaluation Policy, which is now ready for presentation to Parliament. Sir, it is also your duty to push that forward and I have urged the Hon. President, too, to take it up at the Cabinet and bring a Bill to Parliament for approval. I have also spoken to the Hon. Shehan Semasinghe. Hon. Acting Minister, it will be a great honour for you to bring in the National Evaluation Policy because it is a critical tool that we need to further account for transparency and accountability in this House.

In 2019, we proposed to have a Standing Committee on Monitoring and Evaluation. The purpose was, for Parliament to engage with the national development initiatives at their inception, during implementation and after the completion of the initiatives. Mid, end and post-evaluation provide opportunities to understand the progress of the initiatives, the outcomes and lessons learnt from the implementation of an initiative. Lessons learnt from ongoing and post-initiatives provide valuable information to improve the designs of future interventions. Evaluation, thus, provides the means to engage, at all times, in all stages of a development intervention. Therefore, it becomes a critical tool for us.

In 2019, few progressive Members of Parliament who formed the Sri Lanka Parliamentary Forum for

775 776

[ ]

2023 20

Evaluation together proposed to set up a Standing Committee on Monitoring and Evaluation to bring a draft Bill on National Evaluation Policy to Parliament. But, today, I believe we do not need a Standing Committee on Evaluation. Instead, I propose to the President, the Acting Minister of Finance, the Hon. Shehan Semasinghe who is present here, the Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya and the Chair of the Committee on Public Finance, the Hon (Dr.) Harsha De Silva, to include a monitoring and evaluation unit within the Budget Office we are going to approve today.

Then, we will strengthen it and will be able to make sure that we would achieve those targets we are talking about, what you mentioned about transparency and accountability.

I can easily justify why that monitoring and evaluation unit should be there. A Cabinet Paper was submitted by the Hon. President on the 18th of November, 2022 - Hon. Shehan Semasinghe, you would have seen it because you would have been in that Cabinet - on a report issued by the Department of Project Management and Monitoring. There, he shows that out of the public projects that were initiated in this country since 2011 - there had been 260 major public projects - only 12 per cent has been successful and 88 per cent has been a failure. That means, out of the 260 major projects, 30 projects have been successful while 230 projects have failed. Remember, those are mostly loan-funded projects and the amount of public funds allocated for those projects was Rs. 5.8 trillion! That means, if you take 88 per cent of them as a failure,over Rs. 4 trillion worth of failed projects. Imagine that happening in a bankrupt country and the amount of money that would have been wasted!

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) I will finish, Sir.

Also, a monitoring and evaluation unit in the Parliamentary Budget Office could review any ongoing public sector project or any new project proposal and could work with the Department of Project Management and Monitoring as a partner or a secretariat, commission project evaluations, mid-term evaluations and post-evaluations, which could guide both Parliament and the Cabinet on which public project should be prioritized and which should be scrapped. So, it is a very important thing. If we have had this process, I am sure, the Southern Expressway from Matara to Mattala would have never been done because that does not make any economic sense. So, that is how we wasted money.

So, in conclusion, I would suggest that we also focus on performance-based budgeting instead of line-item budgeting. Performance-based budgeting is the allocation

of funds based on programmatic results that contribute to organizational goals. So, in other words, in performance-based budgeting, governments use evidence to maximize the allocation of funds towards programmes that work and move away from those that do not work. That should be the objective of the Parliamentary Budget Office.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) Hon. Kabir Hashim, on the points you made regarding the People's Leasing and Finance PLC, we will call for a report and explain the situation according to that.

Also, about the baseless allegations I referred to, I think, you should not worry because I did not mention your name. I only referred to those who are responsible for those baseless allegations.

Then, with regard to the draft National Evaluation Policy you were talking about, we have had informal discussions also. Upon the arrival of the Hon. President, after he concludes his visit to France and the UK, we will call for a meeting and see how best we could accommodate that draft which had been done earlier. So, we will have a discussion with the Hon. President when he returns.

( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) Thank you, Hon. Acting Minister. We appreciate that. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . 14 .

[2.06 p.m.]

( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan) Thank you.

Sir, it is indeed a privilege to be able to reflect on one of the most important aspects of democratic development in this country. The speakers before me tried to assure that these developments are coming in as an order from the IMF, an order from outside.

Why? The Preamble of the Bill states that this Office will be an "independent institution", then, somewhere down the line, it states that it will be an "independent entity" and again, it states that it will be an "independent body". What do you mean by these? Therefore, I think it is better for us to stop and address those prevailing, important questions. Otherwise, we may run into another Janaka Ratnayake drama, where the trust between the citizens and the State would be lost. So, at this point, when we are debating the Second Reading of the Bill, I would urge all parties concerned to make that clarification, at least as a footnote or an annexure, what this body being independent means.

At the last Public Finance Committee Meeting, there were certain individuals - I do not know on whose invitation they came - who did not have any mandate to be there. When I questioned about them at the end of the Meeting, it was revealed that they were of some other agency who just happened to be there. So, Sir, through you, I would like to inform the Hon. Speaker that we need to have a clear understanding as to who comes to this Parliament, who attends our Committee meetings and who has the right to report those things. Do those agencies, be it multilateral or bilateral, have an MoU with Parliament? What does that MoU stand for and what are the limitations? The citizens of this country and we need to know those things. I think if they do not have a mandate to be there, we might as well call off those agencies immediately, explaining about our working mechanism. Sir, this is a serious issue and through you, I would urge the Hon. Speaker to attend to this matter.

Getting back to the subject under discussion, I would like to say that financial discipline is fundamental. In this country, we had Ministers of Finance and Secretaries who had little or no idea about what was happening in the international arena in terms of finance. With all respect to the former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, he personally told me that until the last week of his term of office, he was not informed about the grave situation this country was in by the key officials . I do not know, but I believe he had no reason to lie to me. He is a simple person like me and that could have been the truth. The grave situation was that transparency had been completely off the discussion table. Therefore, this Parliamentary Budget Office, one, needs to be independent, as was explained and defined and also be professional enough to understand what this country needs by 2030, 2040 and 2050.

It is the other day that I called the officers of the Department of National Planning.

This Bill also empowers the Parliamentary Budget Office - PBO - to analyze whether the economic forecast of any other political party, which is willing to contest, is viable or not - whether it may be a Marxist class analysis or a neoliberal analysis, it is alright. But, they are going to place their manifestos in the reality of Sri Lankan context and say, This is what our thinking and this is what we are.

Sir, one - possibly like the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara - may not agree with this and ask, What is the template of this? As you know, we have a capitalist understanding of the market economy; we have a Marxist understanding of the market economy and we have a neoliberal understanding of the market economy. Whatever the template is and from whatever angle that you take it, - we can agree or disagree. - such Office is very important because very particularly small parties or parties which are trying to come to power are in the habit of making juggernaut promises which are not realistic.

. . . . . . The State and the citizens' contract can be renewed and I wish that we all agree on that. If there is a Vote in the evening, I, for sure, will vote for this.

Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you. Next, the Hon. Sarathi Dushmantha.
