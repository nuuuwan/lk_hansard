from the Chief Government Whip to, at least, give us a chance to debate this issue because this is a very serious matter. Thereafter, if you want, you go ahead. I have really studied this. I was not there at the Party Leaders Meeting, where there had been some crosstalk about the issue; there had been some serious objections. Sir, this is an unprecedented issue. You all cannot, for your own parochial purposes, set up a Select Committee and what is much worse is, through this Select Committee process, you are trying to intimidate the administration of justice in this country and also the members of the independent Commissions. So, this cannot be allowed. Therefore, I make the fervent appeal, at least, give us a chance to debate this issue. You all have

the majority and can go ahead and do whatever you want, but, at least, let us record our concerns in a properly argued debate in the House. So, please, agree to that. Thereafter, you can go ahead and do whatever you want. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Susil Premajayantha, Attorney-at-Law) Sir, just give me a second. What I can say is, this Motion has been on the Addendum for more than five months; it is not that they suddenly brought this before the House. But, yesterday, at the Committee on Parliamentary Business - at the Party Leaders Meeting - we decided to include it on today's Order Paper. So, we had a further discussion. If you go through its Minutes, you can see what we discussed yesterday at the Party Leaders Meeting.

Now, one of our Hon. Members has moved this Motion and another Hon. Member, who is also one out of the 14 signatories to the same Motion, seconded it. Then, according to the Standing Orders, the Hon. Speaker can appoint the Select Committee. So, we discussed yesterday how we are going to have a debate on a future date.

I am trying to bring your attention to this issue. Already, there is another Select Committee which has been set up to look into the economic collapse that happened in this country and the Opposition has already refused to participate in it. This is a very serious precedent; never before have such things happened. With the Opposition trying to boycott that, the fact that you want to have a Select Committee comprised of only Government Members is a very unethical and politically damaging issue for the entire country. So, do not repeatedly do such things. That is why we are telling you,

2149 2150

do not have the prospect of another Select Committee being boycotted by the Opposition. If you all want to have the cooperation of the Opposition, give them a chance to be heard. Do not try to bulldoze us just because you all have the numbers in Parliament. These numbers have already been discredited. So, do not do this. - [Interruption]

Sir, I bow my head in shame for all the backwardness in my land but I take pride in the fact that my generation and my childrens generation have not accepted this backwardness as a final verdict of history. We are trying to do something about it. However, my backwardness should be not licence for someone else to take my land, and this is the essence of the Palestine problem. Now, sir, you asked why you should interest yourself in my problem. You owe it to me; you created my problem. You live in a world no longer capable of compartmentalization. My tragedy will become yours. The whole world order, if it crumbles, will leave no one safe, and the next war in the Middle East, God forbid, will not see you sitting comfortably on this seat, warm and happy, saying why should I care about you.

* : * .

* English translation of the Motion tabled.

Parliament of Sri Lanka emphasizes the need for a practical course of action instead of empty words to implement the decisions taken by the United Nations to immediately arrest the destruction of Palestinian land and provide an independent Palestinian State, as well as its associated world opinion.

All the efforts made by the United Nations to mete out justice to the freedom struggle of the Palestinian people to liberate the land of Palestine, which is considered to be the only remaining colony in the history of the world, have been suppressed by the occupying forces using veto power. The inhumane, suppression and expansionism which continues to occupy the land by force, treating the Palestinian land as an open-air prison camp and depriving the true heirs of the motherland of the dignity of humanity, is an ineffaceable stain on the conscience of mankind.

For more than seven decades, despite the world opinion, the territories reserved for a Palestinian state by the UN are being seized in a way that the civilized world can no longer tolerate, while forcibly taking away their cultivated land and even making them deprived of their waterways. The same forces are killing small children, sick people, elderly people and their families altogether, carrying out unacceptable attacks by air and land and even destroying the spaces to provide medical facilities to the people who have been victimized by these attacks. They are blatantly violating the resolutions adopted and decisions taken by the United Nations, including the proposals to deploy the peacekeeping troops at the borders, as well as the agreements for all peaceful negotiations and solutions. The Parliament of Sri Lanka emphasizes that, instead of uttering empty words, all the states of the world as well as the United Nations should intervene immediately to arrest this unjust process, which is similar to the racist and genocide activities experienced in South Africa.

Further, instead of weakening the global multilateral systems such as the UN General Assembly, the Security Council, the Human Rights Commission, the International Court of Justice, UNCTAD and UNESCO, the Parliament of Sri Lanka also emphasizes the need to strengthen the small countries by giving them participation when decisions are made in such a way as to provide economic justice to such small countries by preventing war, resolving conflicts peacefully, and maintaining peace and stability in the world.

We all are aware that ever since the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, there have been successive conflicts: the Suez Crisis in 1956, the Yom Kippur War, the Six-Day War, the Lebanese Civil War and the Syrian Civil War. This conflictual situation has been perpetuated due to the fact that the democratic rights of the Palestinian people have not been recognized.

We all believe that these two nation-States should live side by side; we are all in agreement with that. I distinctly remember, the Chairman of the PLO, Yasser Arafat, and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, of course, facilitated by President Bill Clinton, came to a historic agreement in 1993, namely, the Oslo Accords. Both sides to the conflict took a very balanced approach, made various sacrifices and negotiated a formula where both parties had to come to the middle. But, unfortunately, in the ensuing years, we have not seen peace dawn upon the Arab world. The conflict has remained the order of the day; it has been the norm, not the exception. So, I believe very fervently that there are so many agreements such as UN Resolutions 242 and 338, the Camp David Accords, the Oslo Accords and the Abraham Accords, which provide us, the international society, with the very basic foundation on which long lasting peace can be established between Israel and Palestine.

Today, the Palestinian people are facing a killing field. They are showered with bullets; they are showered with rockets and of course, all actions have reactions. The unfortunate situation is, there has been large-scale damage, damage to the lives of the civilians and also to the infrastructure. The whole socio-economic and political fabric of Palestine has been destroyed by this aggression.

2167 2168

Sir, we should recognize the fact that no nation-State or race has the right to practise a policy of apartheid. We all know about the 1973 United Nations International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid and the Rome Statute of the ICC adopted in 1998. They all exemplify the fact that racial supremacy should not be practised and is illegal.

We are looking at the major actors in the world and waiting for the so-called leaders of the international community to take the right decisions, decisions right by the people of Palestine and also by the people of Israel, and ensure that there is peace and harmony, the Palestinian people are not murdered willy-nilly, the atrocities that are being committed by murderous administrations are stopped and that everybody comes to the discussion table to reach the understanding of the necessity for these two States to remain side by side, having peaceful and harmonious relationships. So, it is our position, as the Samagi Jana Balawegaya and the SJB Alliance, that we need peace, tranquility and brotherhood in the Middle East. We need peace, peace at all costs and peace which will ensure that Israel and Palestine remain side by side and that the murderous activities that are being committed on the Palestinian people are stopped. Right now, we need peace and to ensure that the rights of the Palestinian people are given. Palestine's nationhood, their statehood has to be given and that has been the formula proposed and accepted internationally. But, it still remains to be seen whether those powerful international actors have the skill, the determination and the political will to make sure that those peace accords are implemented in a prompt manner, putting a stop to the murderous activities that are taking place in Palestine.

So, once again, I assure the Palestinian people that Sri Lanka is with you, that we are supporting your quest for nationhood and statehood. The existence of those two nation-States - Palestine and Israel - and the peaceful relationships between those two countries, we believe, are indispensable for promoting international peace and security.

I thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , () . 10 .

Today is the international memorial day of the great Nelson Mandela, who also stood against the historicized racism in his country. I would urge the political leaders, the religious leaders and the intellectuals of this country to look at settling Sri Lankas national problem, too, which would create an environment where every Tamil, every Sinhalese, every Muslim and every Vedda could live with equal dignity as citizens. That question is still facing us, Sir, without resolving which our speaking about Palestinians' rights and the liberation of Palastinians would be internationally questionable. I see the Hon. Dharmalingam Sithadthan seated in front of me, who had the first contacts with the PLO as students for the liberation of one part of this country. Now, the history has changed. Therefore, let us, across the divide of the ruling party and the Opposition, assure that we have deepening democracy in Sri Lanka irrespective of our religion, ethnicity and the language we speak.

!

, . , , . .

It is not any more an issue of a religious community; it is about international justice, international fair play and natural justice. King David, whose Star is on the Flag of the Israel State, wrote this in his Psalms. , . , . . This is a cosmic relationship about justice and injustice; this is an eternal issue of fair play. Therefore, as a country embedded in Buddhist philosophy, let us take the Middle Path. Let us call our friends on both sides, who are suffering, to settle this amicably.

The Israel Nation has a right to survive with dignity and without fear of terrorism. In the same breath, I must say that the Palestine State, too, has a right to survive with its own history, dignity and with global citizenship. We still, as a country of this size and with this kind of economy, can contribute, with an intellectual capacity such as ours, to the conduct of international affairs. So, let us stand together and call the international community to settle this matter. The ICC has been given the mandate to intervene in this matter and they played the role of self-appointed messiahs in this issue for decades. But, where are the results? Then, there is the International Court of Justice - ICJ. What is their position on this?

Sir, we are a country believing in the Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam policy, according to which everybody is our friend and to no one, we are enemies. That has been the Sri Lankan Foreign Policy for a long time. Therefore, on the same platform, we should call all the countries, particularly the international big powers and the UN

2169 2170

[

2023 18

Security Council members, to take a decision on this issue. This is an issue which has been historicized for more 3,000 years and passed down from the 20th Century to the 21st Century for our future generation. It should stop here.

Sir, the two-State solution for this issue had been accepted and is exactly what the Chairman of the PLO, Yasser Arafat, whom the Palestinians consider as the Father of the Nation of Palestine, also stood for till his life ended. That is the international position and also what every person who knows about politics, democracy and justice has to advocate.

Sri Lanka is bold enough to be one of the few countries which debated this issue in their Parliaments. In March this year, the UK Parliament also debated about the rightful existence of the State of Palestine. Sir, we are a State which is trying to establish democracy with our multicultural identity, to become a multicultural nationhood. I have argued to say that Sri Lanka is a plurinational State. There are people who claim themselves to be nations; there are people who claim to be communities and there are also people who claim that they are a religious identity.

Therefore, Sri Lanka has a lesson learnt to offer to the world. That is, having all the potential to become a modern democracy and a strong economy, we suffered because we did not recognize each others existence, whether you were Tamil, Sinhalese or Muslim; the historic position had been challenged by each other. Therefore, this is the time for us, as nations living within our State, to come together and learn lessons from the Palestinian history.

There is no peace without justice, claimed Bishop Desmond Tutu, who worked with Stephen Biko and the great Mandela. Also, we must remember what is on the other side of the coin, that there is no future without forgiveness. Therefore, let us agree on the policy of asking and offering forgiveness. We do not ask for distributive justice, but for deliberative and restorative justice because I cannot bring back a person who had gone from this world, who is no more. I do not know the pain of those mothers in Jaffna; I have only seen or witnessed that. Likewise, I do not know the pain of an intellectual in Palestine, but I have seen or witnessed that. Therefore, as an Assembly committed to participatory democracy, though it is majoritarian in practise, let us commit ourselves as a nation, as a State to ask the international community to deliver justice without delay because justice delayed is justice denied and justice denied here would be an injustice everywhere in the future.

Therefore, Sir, I resolve and stand by this whole discussion on a two-State solution for Isreal and Palestine, having fair play and without delay, announcing the Statehood of Palestine for the people in Palestine.

I thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Okay. [2.27 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Presiding Member, I am pleased to participate in this Adjournment Motion brought by my Colleague, the Hon. Imthiaz Bakeer Markar.

At the very outset, since the young State Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya, is in the Chamber - he is expected to reply, I believe - I would like to say that I posed a question to your Minister, the Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, the other day in this House. I believe he is abroad today. Three days after the attack on the Jenin Camp, I posed the question to him as to why Sri Lanka did not issue a statement, at least, to condemn what is happening in the Occupied Palesinian Territories. There were relentless attacks for two days on the refugee camp, which was situated in a 1.5 square kilometre area. The Israeli Army, which is one of the worlds most sophisticated armies, had deployed several battalions and armored cars and the entire area was bombarded. People were in panic, harassed, intimidated and 12 people paid with their lives, and the Sri Lankan Government kept silent. It is a shame, Hon. State Minister! In fact, the Hon. Minister gave us a promise that he would issue a statement forthwith, but nothing has happened. Where is our conscience? We have been a friend of the Palestinian people. Several Heads of State had been chairing the Sri Lanka-Palestine Parliamentary Friendship Association, but I do not know why, on this matter, we have kept silent.

Also, mere condemnation would not do, Sir. The Amnesty International, in 2022, reported that Israel has been systematically committing serious human rights violations against the Palestinians for decades. It cites atrocities such as forcible transfer of people, administrative detention, torture, unlawful killings, cauing serious injuries and the denial of basic rights and freedom among major violations of the human rights and humanitarian law committed against the Palestinian people.

2171 2172

The Hon. Imthiaz Bakeer Markar listed out various multilateral agencies which have passed resolutions against the State of Israel. Israeli violations have also been well documented in the Reports of the UN Israeli Practices Committee, of which Sri Lanka is a Member along with Malaysia and Senagal. However, the reports of that Committee over several decades detail only a fragment of the untold trauma and misery the Palestinians have experienced and continue to undergo to date. I believe our former Permanent Representative to Geneva, Palitha Kohona, who is now Ambassador to China and also another former PR in Geneva, Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka, headed that Committee. That Committee produced a report and the Israelis had totally ignored its recommendations. The Report of the United Nations Fact-finding Mission known as the Goldstone Report also highlighted war crimes and crimes against humanity committed within the Occupied Palestinian Territory.

In 2010, a Fact-finding Mission was commissioned by the President of the UN Human Rights Council following a Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council to investigate the violations of human rights and humanitarian law, including those resulting from the Israeli attacks on the flotilla of ships carrying humanitarian assistance to the Gaza Strip. A relation of the Hon Imthiaz Bakeer Markar was also in that ship. Among its several findings, the Mission called the situation in Gaza totally intolerable and unacceptable in the 21st Century.

The UN Human Rights Council established a UN Fact-finding Mission following the 2021 Israeli-Palestinian Conflict. On the 20th of October, 2022, the Commissions Report was presented to the United Nations General Assembly. The Report called on the Security Council to end Israels permanent occupation and on individual UN member-States to prosecute Israeli officials. Such was the seriousness of that Report. The Report found reasonable grounds to conclude that the occupation is unlawful under international law due to its permanence and Israels de facto annexation policies.

Now, I would like to move on to our friends, the United States. The United States as well as other western countries and Australia have done all that is possible to support Israel and its policies, which have caused untold misery and trauma to the Palestinian people. The declaration of the unresolved territory of Jerusalem as the Capital of Israel, to which it was decided to shift the US Embassy, was the single most assault on the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people and a blatant violation of the Oslo Peace Accords. The Hon. Imthiaz Bakeer Markar also mentioned it in his Motion. Some of the western countries often complain about initiatives being repeatedly brought against Israel within the UN Human Rights Council. In fact, the United States of America withdrew from the Human Rights Council twice since 2006, criticizing the Council as a forum for targeting Israel by Arab and Islamic countries. Several

High Commissioners and Ambassadors are in the Speakers Gallery today and I thank them for having taken this interest. So, that was the accusation the USA gave to withdraw from the UN Human Rights Council. Then, what happened? Each time the US withdrew from the Human Rights Council, it realized that its own stakes on human rights issues, including those which it considered vital from a national perspective, suffered terribly.

This led to the US rejoining the Council after each withdrawal. It is not clear whether that lesson had been understood in its proper context: that is, the US was left defenceless within the Council on issues that affected its interests the most by such withdrawals. The central thrust of the lesson is that the western countries cannot defend Israel against allegations of atrocities made against it at the expense of their own interests. So, it is time they complain that there were repeated initiatives within the HRC against Israel.

Let me also say that a meaningful conversation about US support for Israel should be had. I saw our friend, the US Ambassadress, meeting with Tamil parties a few days ago. Ambassadress Julie Chung, in her Twitter handle, had tweeted this, I quote:

Discussed importance of devolution, land returns & finding answers for families of missing persons, incl investigations into mass graves, as SL strives for truth, reconciliation, and lasting peace."

I thank her for this concern for our Tamil brothers; I thank her for having initiated a Resolution in Geneva when forceful cremations of Muslim bodies were taking place in this country. Then, there was religious disharmony in this country. Her Government took up the issue of cremating Muslim bodies in Geneva. But, what is this double standard now? That is what we are worried about. We are suffering in a way and the Palestinians are suffering even worse. Why are you silent there? What is this double standard, I do not understand. This double standard has to come to an end.

International reaction, international intervention or international outcry against these atrocities are being muted. This is not simply to join the chorus of condemnations; it is not going to help. Those who really care do not have the ability and those who have the ability, such as the United States, do not really care. This is what is happening and that is why we are making this plea. They use the veto. When 17 nations in the Security Council brought in a Resolution opposing the declaration of Jerusalem as the Capital of Israel, the United States used its veto. Several times over, the veto power had been used by a single superpower to the detriment of the Palestinian Cause. Is it justified? This is what we are asking. We are thankful that the so-called sole superpower has realized that the multipolar world is now shifting. Chinese diplomacy is now embracing the Middle East; the Chinese have brought the Saudis and the Iranians together and now, on their age-old conflict, they

2173 2174

[

2023 18

have opened diplomatic relations with each other. That was something unthinkable a year ago, but the Chinese have made some diplomatic moves there and they are moving ahead.

Sir, our fervent appeal to the West, the friends of Israel, is to prevail upon Israel to stop these atrocities in the name of the Abraham Accords. The Abraham Accirds are also being used in some ways. The behaviour that yields major infractions of human rights and humanitarian law receives active encouragement in some quarters because there are States in this region and beyond which require critical military technology and lethal weapons. A significant development in the Middle East with implications far-reaching beyond its immediate theatre into other regions as well is the signing of the Abraham Accords. While respecting the sovereignty of countries to conclude treaties between themselves on what they consider matters of shared interest consistent with international law, whether the Abraham Accords will achieve stability and prosperity within the region or in the signatory countries while the Palestinian question remains unresolved remains to be seen.

I dare say that the United States and other benefactors of Israel are using the Abraham Accords to do arms deals. Through arms deals, Israel has become further emboldened to carry on their atrocities in the Occupied Territories. So, their occupation of the Palestinian territory is the main cause for radicalization in the Occupied Territories. Therefore, these children, who are carrying catapults and are taking their anger out on the most modernized army in the world, are being harassed. After all, they are trying to protect their livelihood, their families and their precious land from being grabbed by Israeli settlers forcibly. So, where is justice? A Congresswoman in the United States Congress has moved a Motion against minors in Palestine being targeted and that is also being held up. So, what is this? The latest reports state that out of the Democrats, almost 48 per cent are supporting the Palestinian Cause today. They include Evangelical Christians, Jews and Rabbis; they are all against the Israel State's atrocities in the Occupied Territories.

Therefore, it is time, before the entire worlds conscience awakens, for the West to give up its adamant stand on protecting a continuously abusive State from heaping misery after misery on the hapless Palestinian people, to give them their freedom and remove them from the apartheid that is being practised in those Occupied Territories.

[2.52 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) Hon. Presiding Member, I thank the Hon. Imthiaz Bakeer Markar for bringing in this Adjournment Motion on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its effects on humanity before Parliament.

So, Sir, today, we are discussing this very important Motion which raises questions regarding peace and security, development and human rights of the Palestinian people. An immediate backdrop for this Motion is our shared concern over continuing violations of the human rights and humanitarian law in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. There are instances abound of denial of justice for victims and their families, organized settler-violence which destroys villages and homes of Palestinians, throwing them out of their lands and livelihoods and violation of their social, cultural, religious and economic rights. The recent attack on Jenin stands out as a glaring example of what an occupying power and an army of settlers could do to innocent people. It amounts to a form of collective punishment imposed on the Palestinians for what they are, a nation rooted in their own land and culture.

2177 2178

[

2023 18

Psychologically speaking, Palestinians appear to be a nation of cumulative trauma brought upon them by the occupying power on each passing day. Recently, I read an article published by a reputed news agency which states that there is no issue of PTSD - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder - amongst the Palestinian people there. According to that article, it is because there is nothing post for them to experience the stress disorder since attacks on them and the trauma are of a continuing nature right through out the year. My Colleagues have spoken and will speak during the time allotted for the Adjournment Motion today about the existential challenges and other multifarious issues faced by the Palestinian people at the hands of the occupying power. Let me, therefore, turn my attention to a fundamental concern which has received less focus in the context of the Middle East and internationally.

We all know that the Palestinian peoples collective tragedy began with the establishment of a new State on their territory in 1948. Having suffered the worst in the World War under the Nazi Germany, the Jewish people, collectively victimized and stateless, were settled on the Palestinian homeland so that they could rebuild their lives, recover from the wounds of persecution and live in a stable environment required for their flourishing as a people in the then emerging new world order. The new world order had, as its main plank, the objectives of peace, justice, development, human rights, democracy and the rule of law. It rested upon the United Nations Charter, which recognized the worth and dignity of all human beings as well as the principle of equality amongst peoples as well as nations. It reaffirmed the collective duty of humankind to respect the rights and freedoms of one another, secure a world free from the scourge of war and to work together towards establishing a future in which all peoples and nations lived in harmony and prosperity. It is this vision of a just, peaceful and rules-based new international order that was to underpin and inspire the search for solutions to questions, including those the World War II left in its wake. The situation of the uprooted Jewish community was an important question that required an immediate, just and equitable solution. It was in the nature of the world order that was thus envisioned that people should live in dignity, peace, co-existence and in an environment which fostered respect for the rights and freedoms of each other as well as mutual understanding and accommodation. In short, it was envisioned as a blueprint for diverse peoples and nations bonded by the common goal of humanity to pursue their aspirations peacefully and prosper collectively, thereby contributing to a world safer for all. Ironically, however, as events unfolded in the ensuing years, such expectations only transformed into a perverse reality. So, contrary to what was intended, some of the beneficiaries of the vision of the new world order, which is a just, peaceful and a rules-based system, indeed became its own undoers. The innate strength and legitimacy of the post-World War international order began to be challenged and thwarted by the very actors who benefited from it, in the very first place.

Today, what we see after 75 years of the establishment of Israel in a region which the West considers strategically important is a State where some of the vital

principles and objectives of the UN Charter and multilateralism recognized as the basis of the international order are being unravelled. Continuing violations of the human rights and humanitarian law and injustices against the Palestinian people do not just remain beyond the pale of accountability, whether domestic or international, but rather, the culture of impunity fostered by a blanket cover extended by certain States has now begun to eat into the essence of democracy and independence of State institutions there.

What are we to make of all this? Is it the beginning of a new international order, driven only by strategic interests and not by the principles of equality, justice and humanity that is being envisioned now?

Sir, I will just take another 10 or 20 seconds. I listened to a speech made by the Hon. Sir Gerald Kaufman, a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons in the United Kingdom who represented the Labour Party. He said, "I was brought up as an Orthodox Jew and a Zionist" and that he knew Ben-Gurion and was also a close friend of Golda Meir, who were both former Prime Ministers of Israel. The Hon. Sir Gerald Kaufman says that his parents came to Britain as refugees from Poland and when the Nazis were attacking, his grandmother, who was ill in bed in her hometown of Staszow, was shot dead by a German soldier.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . ( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) , .

In his speech, he goes on to say, I quote:

Madam, Deputy Speaker, my grandmother did not die to provide cover for Israeli soldiers murdering Palestinian grandmothers in Gaza.

He further says,

Israel was born out of Jewish terrorism. Jewish terrorists hanged two British sergeants and booby-trapped their bodies and massacred 254 Palestinians in 1948.

He, finally, says,

It is time for our Government....."

He is asking the British Government.

'.......to make clear to the Israeli Government that its conduct and policies are unacceptable and to impose a total arms ban on Israel. It is time for real peace.

Therefore, I would leave it to the States which observe "strategic reticence" on this matter to reflect on it diligently before it is too late. The continuing suppression and violence against Palestinian people should stop forthwith.

Thank you.

Presiding Member, I thank you for the opportunity given to me to speak on this timely, important Motion in support of the people of Palestine and their rights. I also thank the Hon. Imthiaz Bakeer Markar for the initiative taken on his part to move this Motion in Parliament today.

. . Human rights . . . , . ,

. , double standards ; .

Then, I would like to update this House on the situation on the ground in Palestine, which is of great concern. The security situation continues to deteriorate, leading to deplorable numbers of Palestinian and Israeli victims. This year alone, the number of Palestinians killed in confrontations with the Israel defence forces in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, has more than doubled, compared to that in the same period last year, with more than 130 killed including at least 22 children. In addition, large-scale destruction of property is caused by Israeli settlers. The number of Israelis killed by Palestinian perpetrators has also increased to 31 compared to the 28 in the same period last year, with many more injured on both sides. We are also witnessing an alarming increase of demolitions, evictions and settlement expansions with around 13,000 new settlement units announced in the occupied West Bank and approved by Israel in the past six months alone and new administrative procedures to expedite settlement expansion. Many countries have urged Israel not to proceed with these measures, which are illegal under international law.

Sir, all these developments only serve to fuel the cycle of violence, which has accelerated to alarming levels in recent months. It is clear that the only way to break out of this vicious cycle is a return to effective security cooperation between the Palestinian Authority and Israel. But, we know from experience that the security track cannot be separated from the political track. Remote as it may look today, there is no viable alternative to the two-State solution and the longer it takes, the more difficult it will become. In general, Palestinians have compromised by accepting the international legality and recommendations of the two-State solution on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. This means that Palestinians have agreed to have their State on 20 per cent of their historical Palestine, which I recognize as a huge sacrifice on the part of Palestine for the interest of sustainable peace and to end violence.

However, the present Israeli Government has declared directly that Palestinians should remove the idea of a two-State solution from their minds. That is why they declared to rebuild settlements in the North of the West Bank. Israeli Government has declared to build 10 new settlements on confiscated Palestinian lands and 10,000 housing units for settlers on Occupied Palestinian Territory. Further, the extremist Israeli Government encourages settlers, under the protection of the Israeli Army, to burn many villages, homes, fields and kill Palestinians. They have also taken a decision to arm the Israeli settlers with more weapons. This is clear ethnic cleansing carried out against the people of the land.

Sir, the Israeli authorities must be held accountable for committing the crime of apartheid against Palestinians. According to a recent Amnesty International

2181 2182

2023 18

Report, Israel enforces a system of oppression and domination against the Palestinian people wherever it has control over their rights. This includes Palestinians living in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory as well as displaced refugees in other countries.

The Report sets out that massive seizures of Palestinian land and property, unlawful killings, forcible transfer of people, drastic movement restrictions and denial of nationality and citizenship to Palestinians are all components of a system which amounts to apartheid under international law. This system is maintained by violations which are found to be constituting apartheid as a crime against humanity, as defined in the Rome Statute and the Apartheid Convention.

Successive Israeli Governments have considered Palestinians a demographic threat and imposed measures to control and decrease their presence and access to land in Israel and in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. These demographic aims are well illustrated by official plans to "Judaize" areas of Israel and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, which continue to put thousands of Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer.

Sir, we must call an end to the brutal practice of home demolitions and forced evictions as a first step. Israel must grant equal rights to all Palestinians in Israel and in the Occupied Palestinian Territory in line with principles of the international human rights and humanitarian law. They must also recognize the right of the Palestinian refugees and their descendants to return to the homes they or their families once lived and provide victims of human rights violations and crimes against humanity with full reparations.

The scale and seriousness of the violations call for a drastic change in the international communitys approach to the human rights crisis in Israel and in the OPT. We must step up support for the Palestinian cause in keeping with our stated policy of proactive and progressive non-alignment. We must express concern over the international communitys failure to impose tough sanctions on Israel for its continuous defiance of UN Resolutions. We must also urge the world community to take punitive measures to compel Israel to end its occupation of Palestine, oppressive policies and human rights violations.

In conclusion, I must reiterate the commitment of the Government of the Hon. President Ranil Wickremesinghe to the liberation of Palestine and also to ensure the right to self-determination of Palestinians. Sri Lanka, as a nation, has always been maintaining a consistent policy on the Palestinian cause and extending extensive support to Palestine at multilateral forums. In 2022, President Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his message on the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People which fell on 29th November, reaffirmed Sri Lankas steadfast solidarity with the Government and the people of Palestine.

I will be failing in my duty if I, on behalf of the Muslim community in Sri Lanka, did not thank profoundly the Hon. President Ranil Wickremesinghe for his bold remarks of condemnation over the burning of the Holy Quran in Sweden. His strong urging from Western Nations to uphold the value system of the Global South and refrain from allowing disturbances under the pretext of freedom of expression is a very clear message, which the entire Sri Lanka could be proud of.

Finally, the Government has always criticized the violations unleashed against Palestinians and we will continue to do so while expressing solidarity with the people of Palestine and working with the rest of the world community to end Asias last colony.

[3.16 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Jayantha Weerasinghe, PC) Hon. Presiding Member, I will make my speech in English today for the reason that I will be reading certain extracts from a UN Report on this issue. But, wherever needed, I will interject in Sinhala.

Sir, I am indeed grateful to the Hon. Imthiaz Bakeer Markar for bringing in this Adjournment Motion, giving us all an opportunity to air our views on this issue. My heart has always been with the Palestinian people and today, I have got this opportunity of driving home the utter injustice committed on the people of Palestine.

I would draw the attention of this House to the UN Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories, which I have here with me. I am proud to say that the Chairman of that Committee which constituted three countries - Malaysia, Senegal and Sri Lanka - is no less a person than the former Chief Justice of this country and our present Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Mr. Mohan Peiris. That, I believe, is a signal honour bestowed on this country. I will also say it in short in Sinhala. , . , . , . , - - . .

Sir, this particular Report has arisen from the UN General Assembly Resolution 76/80 and contains information relating to exactly a period of one year from 01st September, 2021 to 31st August, 2022. When I went through this Report, I was stunned by the utter injustice and cruelties committed on the people of Palestine.

This Report further states that the Special Committee wrote to the Israeli Government and said, Please tell us what your grounds are and that there was total silence from the Israeli Government. Therefore, the Committee, on its own, investigated into the matter and the utter cruelties they found out have been itemized here. The Special Committee has been asked to look into the atrocities committed against the Palestinian people from 1967. We all know about the 1967 War. So, for 55 years, huge cruelties and injustices have been committed against the hapless people of Palestine. Sir, some of the issues that are raised in this UN Report, I might read. It states, I quote:

Briefings to the Special Committee underscored Israeli policies and practices that infringe upon the human rights of Palestinians in a discriminatory manner vis-a-vis the treatment granted to Israeli citizens living in the same area.

So, it very clearly states that the Israeli citizens in that area are served with a different spoon, while the

Palestinians are served with a very poor spoon by the Israelis. And it further states, I quote:

......the alarming increase in Palestinian fatalities...

Sir, I repeat "the alarming increase in Palestinian fatalities."

........acquiescence, support and participation of Israeli security forces; the criminalization and detention of human rights defenders; the detention, assault and killing of journalists; and continued Israeli annexation of Palestinian land, including Masafer Yatta, which constitutes the largest displacement of Palestinians since 1967 and may amount to forcible transfer, a grave breach of International Humanitarian Law."

So, here is the UN Report which aptly states that the Israeli Government has committed a grave breach of international humanitarian law in forcibly transferring the people of Palestine. I am proud that a Sri Lankan, the Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the UN, chaired this Committee which came to these conclusions.

Then, under "Killing of Palestinians", they have itemized some glaring instances from 1st January to 11th August, 2022. I will quote from the Report.

From 1 January to 11 August 2022,...."

That is quite recently.

"..Israeli security forces killed 74 Palestinians including 20 children...

It is heart-rending to even listen to this, Sir. Then, the Report goes on to state, I quote:

"...from 10 to 21 May 2021 - 41 Palestinians, including 9 children, were killed by Israeli security forces. According to data collected by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), Israeli security forces injure a greater number of Palestinians in refugee camps with live ammunition than anywhere else in the occupied West Bank.

How do you like that? A great number of these horrendous killings take place with live ammunition in Palestine. Why is this slaughter of innocent people?

Then, it goes on to state, I quote:

In many instances, lethal force is used by Israeli security forces as a first resort, including the 11 May 2022 killing of a 16- year-old Palestinian boy in the context of a stone-throwing incident.

Can you believe that? The boy was just 16 years of age and just because he threw some stones, he was shot and killed! The Report further describes it, I quote:

The boy was shot in the chest from a distance of 100m, a distance at which he could not have posed a threat to Israeli soldiers.

The boy was 100 metres away, throwing stones and he could not have been danger to the Israeli forces. And what do they do? The child was 16 years old. They shoot and slaughter him. The UN Report then goes on to state, I quote:

On 15 March 2022, another 16-year-old Palestinian boy was shot several times in the back and killed while running away from an armoured vehicle of the Israeli security forces.

That was an utterly gruesome slaughter! The child runs away from the armoured vehicle of the Israelis and they shoot and kill him. The Report continues, I quote:

on 7 March 2022, in which Israeli security forces were filmed employing lethal force against a suspect who had already been injured and was no longer posing a threat.

A man falls injured, who is not a threat to anyone except to himself, and he was shot and killed. This Special Committee chaired by our former Chief Justice further states, I quote:

The Special Committee was briefed that Israel is currently holding the bodies of 325 Palestinians,

They are holding even the dead and it has repeatedly been requested, at least as a humanitarian gesture, to return those dead bodies to the Palestinian people.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have two more minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Jayantha Weerasinghe, PC) Sir, I can go on with this Report for another one hour, but I will say the least because of the time restriction.

However, I must also say this, Sir. Recently, we heard about a most inhuman, horrendous injustice harped by a foreign country by burning the Holy Quran and our President, the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, was one of the first to condemn that act with the contempt it deserved. Sir, before I conclude, I, too, take this opportunity to condemn that myself, to shower it with the contempt and disdain that act deserves. And I believe and fervently hope that during my lifetime, I will not hear such a disdainful, disgusting and disgraceful act again.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , ! 4 .

[4.00 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) Hon. Presiding Member, thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak a few words on the Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. Imthiaz Bakeer Markar.

While welcoming today's Motion on the question of Palestine, let me express my observations about Sri Lanka's policy on this vital global issue that has, unfortunately, for the past 75 years, eluded a just solution acceptable to all parties, especially for the Palestinians.

2197 2198

[ ...

2023 18

Since Sri Lanka's gaining Independence in 1948, our governments had supported the Palestinian cause and strongly opposed Zionist expansionism, as has been clearly shown in our vote in favour of multiple United Nations resolutions, including the UN Resolution 3379 of 1975 that affirmed, "Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination."

Sri Lanka's early post-independence governments, be they of the United National Party or of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, stood by the Palestinian cause as they believed it was their moral duty to extend their fullest support to the freedom cause of those people. We, as a newly independent country, valued freedom and understood the freedom struggle of the Palestinian people. Their problem was essentially an unfinished colonialism problem. It was created by colonial and imperial forces after the World War I. Our resolve to support freedom causes worldwide, including the Palestinian freedom cause, saw our governments in the 1950s, 1970s and 1980s playing a leading role in the Solidarity Movement of Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Organization and in the Non-Aligned Movement. The Palestinian cause has been very close to the hearts of Sri Lankans over the years and successive governments have stood in solidarity with the struggle of the Palestinian people. The people of Sri Lanka have recognized the fact that the Palestinian people have not only been deprived of their homeland but continue to be the subject of atrocities committed by the Israelis and have, therefore, supported them in different international forums.

Hon. Presiding Member, I would like to cite a few examples, which confirmed our unstinted support for the Palestinian cause. In 1976, when the then government, led by the Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike, hosted the second Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement and she came under tremendous pressure from Western governments to exclude any mention of support for the Palestinian cause. But, the Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike bravely defied Western pressure and devoted a substantial part to the Palestinian issue in the final communique of the Summit.

Sir, we were then very proud of our country's morally correct Palestinian policy. The Sri Lankan people understood that the Palestinian problem is not a Muslim problem, not an Arab problem, but a problem of humanity. As a result, early Sri Lankan leaders, especially the Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike, were household names in the Middle East.

But where do we stand today? Officially, we claim we stand by the two-state solution with an independent Palestinian State being created in keeping with the 1967 borders. But our proactive and morality-based Palestinian policy is sadly not evident, even when the suffering that the Palestinian people undergo in occupied territories aggravates. We make no statement when Israeli forces shirk their responsibility of protecting people under their occupation and continue their oppression. We were shocked by this silence when Jenin was under attack a few weeks ago. We were shocked by the warm welcome the Israeli Ambassador received in Sri Lanka while the

Palestinians lands were being forcibly taken to build settlements for Israelis. Does the toast symbolize our endorsement of Israeli oppression of the Palestinian people?

Many of the Western countries, including the United States, have supported the Israelis despite their many violations of international law. In contrast, Sri Lanka and the third world have consistently supported the Palestinian cause wholeheartedly and highlighted the continuing injustice that continues to take place even after 75 years. Sri Lanka has, over the years, been a great friend of the Arab and Palestinian people. Successive governments and the people of Sri Lanka have championed the cause of the Palestinians locally and in world forums.

The last year was particularly a bad year with regard to the transgressions by the Israeli forces in occupied territories. UN officials have cautioned that unless this continuous resort to violence is brought to an end, the situation can take a turn for the worse. The latest in the long list of brutalities inflicted on the Palestinians is the attack on the refugee camp in Jenin. In one of the fiercest assaults in two decades on the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces have brought death and widespread destruction to occupants of the refugee camp, which, United Nations experts have described as amounting to violations of international law.

Sir, I wish to refer to what Francesca Albanese, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation on human rights in the Palestinian territories, has said bout the attacks in Jenin. She has described the recent Israeli attacks as "collective punishment". The United Nations Rapporteur has accused Israel of carrying out possible war crimes during its military operation in the West Bank city of Jenin, charging it with killing children and displacing large numbers of civilians. The attacks were the fiercest in the West Bank since the destruction of the Jenin camp in 2002, Albanese said, referring to a military incursion during the height of the second intifada.

Since the creation of Israel in 1948, the Zionist State has been a law unto itself and ignored the expressions of disapproval by the international community in numerous UN resolutions. The Zionist ideology that gave rise to the Israeli state and continued to sustain its expansion did not care tuppence for the many United Nations resolutions that were passed in a bid to restrain its uncontrollable excesses. The international community has watched helplessly as Israel continues unchecked with its brazen violation of Palestinian rights.

The Zionist campaign to create a Jewish State in the midst of the Palestinian homeland began with the infamous Balfour Declaration of Palestine. Even before the ink had dried on the United Nations Resolution that created Israel, the Jewish State had unlawfully expanded its borders beyond the boundaries set out in the Resolution.

2199 2200

We urge the Government not to abandon the Palestinian cause. If we love freedom, we should love the freedom of our Palestinian brethren.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have two more minutes. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) Thank you.

As South Africas great statesman, Nelson Mandela rightly said, South Africas freedom is incomplete without the freedom for Palestinians. We cannot and should not abandon the Palestinian cause by pointing to the policy shift of other non-aligned countries which have embraced the West and some West-Asian nations which have signed the so-called Abraham Accords.

Sir, let us come together to end Israels colonization of Palestine. Let us all, in one voice, condemn Israels expansionist policy, its illegal settlement-building activities in occupied territories, its oppression of the Palestinian people, its apartheid policies and its continuous violation of international law.

Let us reaffirm our support for the Palestinians right to live within secure borders as citizens of a free nation. I call upon the international community to continuously put pressure on the Israeli Government in order to restrain itself and implement the two-state solution that has been put forward as an ultimate solution to the problem. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you. , .. ! 7 .

[4.12 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I thank you, Hon. Presiding Member. I consider it the Tamil National Peoples Fronts duty, Sir, to take part in this Adjournment Debate and in that respect, I would like to appreciate the Hon. Imthiaz Bakeer Markar's effort to bring this Motion forward today.

Sir, as a young student when I was studying Modern World History in school, the single-most event - globally - that, to me, could describe "a broken heart" literally, was the Palestine-Israel conflict. Because, when we studied in school, a big part of the syllabus was about World War II

and in that process, what we learnt about the way in which the global Jewish community was treated, created such a lot of empathy. When one thought of World War II, more than the detest and rejection of notions such as Fascism and Nazism, it was the solidarity and sympathy towards the Jewish community that faced genocide, to me, personally, was overwhelming. So, under no circumstances, Sir, can I describe myself as someone who is anti-Jewish - quite the contrary. There is a lot of sympathy for the Jewish people and for the Jewish nation. But, that "broken heart" that I mentioned came to be experienced in the way that nation treated the Palestinian nation and continues to do so.

Therefore, Sir, to stand in solidarity with the Palestinian nation and the Palestinian people is quite simply the right thing to do because, what Israel is doing today is quite simply wrong and to stand for what is right and to point out what is wrong is not to be anti-Jewish or anti-Semite.

Then, there is another reason why the TNPF can so overwhelmingly identify itself with the Palestinian cause; because we as Eelam Tamils in this island can relate completely to the destruction that the Palestinian nation is facing. That is why Hon. Presiding Member, I said our Party considers it our duty to take part in todays Debate and to quite clearly and strongly identify ourselves with the Palestinian cause. Hon. Presiding Member, to me, what is so sad and so ironic is that I think in this House there is almost unanimity with regard to the views expressed standing on the side of the Palestinian people. But, those very same Members are unable to see what they are doing in their own home and how they are treating their own, which is identical to the way in which Israel is treating Palestine.

That is the position of the Tamil people today. So, we heard so many Hon. Members from both sides talk about double standards of the West. Of course, they are double standards when one considers the sort of policies of human rights, international humanitarian law, democracy, anti-apartheid - all these concepts- when you talk of and when you are prepared to sign up to, obviously, those very same countries that uphold these concepts in a big way and would like to sign up to these concepts, sign up with Israel in the way they are treating Palestine. Naturally, that is double standards. And those double standards are here too.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have two more minutes.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) And those double standards are here too in this very same House and unless Hon. Presiding Member, this world begins to realize that if States are going to put self-interest above all and not sign up to and genuinely adhere to values and standards that one would consider to be universal, then, there will not be peace between Palestine

2201 2202

[ ...

2023 18

and Israel, nor will there be peace in the world. It will continue to destabilize as the last post World War II world has, in fact, been noted for. And today, the West, because of their self-interest over and above, the standards they would like to sign up to, is losing their credibility and the single-most instance that makes their credibility be called under question is in fact, with regards to their treatment and their signing up to Israel as opposed to Palestine.

It is in that context, Hon. Presiding Member, I think todays Adjournment Motion is quite apt. It is apt because not only should it call to question our conscience, but it should call to question the conscience with regards to what we are doing at home as well. And for that, I would like to congratulate the Hon. Imthiaz Bakeer Markar and I would once again state very clearly that we stand with the people of Palestine.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you.

[4.39 p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya - State Minister of Foreign Affairs) Hon. Presiding Member, at the outset, I want to thank the Hon. Imthiaz Bakeer Markar, Member of Parliament for bringing in this timely Adjournment Motion. I think, as you can see by the speeches made by the Hon. Members across the aisle, everybody in this House supports the Cause of Palestine. Also, before I start off my speech, I want to say that both the Hon. Minister and myself have been supporters of the Palestinian Cause and will continue to do so. As such, in consultation with the Hon. President, we will direct the Foreign Policy of Sri Lanka, in each and every instance, not forgetting our long-standing relationship with Palestine.

Also at the outset, I want to take a minute, Sir, to clarify one matter. My learned Friend, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem, stated that we, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, have been rather silent on the incidents that occurred in Jenin, which is not the case. On the 11th of April, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement, condemning the attacks on the Al-Aqsa Mosque in the holy month of Ramadan. So, unlike the Y ahapalana Government, which changed its position pertaining to the UNESCO Resolution on violence at the Temple Mount by Israel, the current Government has been very consistent in its policy towards Palestine. Sir, Sri Lanka is deeply concerned over the recent escalation of violence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including the incidents in Jenin in the West Bank, causing tragic loss of civilian lives and extensive damage to property. Sri Lanka continues to stand with the people of Palestine in achieving their legitimate aspirations, has always maintained a consistent policy on the Palestinian Cause and extended unwavering support for Palestine at multilateral fora as well.

Sri Lanka calls on all parties involved to take sustained measures to address the worsening humanitarian situation and prevent further escalation of violence. Our country firmly believes that efforts by the international community and the Palestinian and Israeli authorities should be augmented to make peace a reality in the lives of the Palestinians and Israeli people.

During the Fifth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries held in Doha in March, 2023, I met His Excellency Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian National Authority and assured Sri Lankas steadfast support for the Palestinian Cause. I am aware that the Hon. Speaker attended as the Chief Guest at the Commemoration of Al-Nakba Day in May, 2023, upon the invitation of the Palestine Embassy in Colombo. Sir, since 1968, Sri Lanka, as the Chair of the United Nations Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories, has been one of the most significant voices at the United Nations on the subject of the unfortunate conditions of the people in the Occupied Territories. The President of Sri Lanka, on 24th November, 2022 in his Message on the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, reiterated Sri Lankas position and called on the international community and all parties concerned to make renewed efforts to achieve a lasting solution through the early implementation of the United Nations General Assembly Resolutions on a two-States solution based on the 1967 borders. Moreover, the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, at the General Debate of the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly held on 24th September, 2022 in New York, restated Sri Lankas long-standing position on the Palestine issue, adding that Sri Lanka recognizes the legitimate security concerns of both the Palestinian and Israeli people and the urgent resolution of the matter on the basis of the UN Resolution on the attainment of the two-States solution. At the 51st Session of the Human Rights Council's General Debate, on the human rights situation in

2209 2210

[

2023 18

Palestine and other occupied Arab territories, Sri Lanka made a Statement on 30th September, 2022, highlighting that the repetition of the cycle of violence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory can only be ended with genuine political efforts for a negotiated solution to end the conflict. Sri Lanka reiterated its commitment to supporting a negotiated settlement in line with the internationally agreed parameters of two-States living side by side on the basis of the 1967 borders, which is key to achieve long-term security, peace and prosperity. We call on all sides to refrain from provocative and rhetoric acts. Until everyone enjoys peace, no one will be safe. Therefore, disproportionate use of power and suppression of legitimate rights of any people or community would only escalate further tension and create a situation where security of both the Palestinians and Israelis are threatened with the possibility of it escalating to other regions. Therefore, Sri Lanka, once again urges, all parties to act with restraint, respect human rights and act in a manner which advances humanity. The international community also has a huge responsibility in implementing the UN Resolutions without hindrances and acting towards attaining long-lasting peace in the region on the basis of the UN Resolutions stated previously.

I wish to place on record that the Sri Lankan Government continues to extend practical support to the Palestine Mission in Colombo. Since the inception of the Palestine Mission, the Government of Sri Lanka pays the rental of the official residence of the Palestinian Ambassador and has also provided premises to maintain the Palestine Mission in Colombo. This is, at a time, Sir, when we have closed five Sri Lankan Embassies around the world. Similarly, the Government of Sri Lanka, reflecting its solidarity with the Palestinian people, maintains a Representative Office in Ramallah.

Sir, we reaffirm our resolute support for their Cause, as the people of Palestine strive to gain their legitimate rights and aspirations. Once again, let me endorse our solidarity with the Palestinian people in achieving their inalienable rights and establishing an independent sovereign State based on the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions.

Thank you.
