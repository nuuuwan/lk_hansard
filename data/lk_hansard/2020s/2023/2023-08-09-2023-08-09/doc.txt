QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE RAISED BY HON. HARIN FERNANDO

ON 08.08.2023 ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I wish to announce to this august Assembly the Ruling with reference to the Question of Privilege raised by the Hon. Harin Fernando in Parliament on 08.08.2023.

Article 4(c) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka provides that the judicial power of the People shall be exercised by Parliament through courts, tribunals and institutions created and established, or recognized, by the Constitution, or created and established by law, except in regard to matters relating to the privileges, immunities and powers of Parliament and of its Members, wherein the judicial power of the People may be exercised directly by Parliament according to law;.

I also emphasize that according to Article 148 of the Constitution, Parliament shall have full control over public finance. No tax, rate or any other levy shall be imposed by any local authority or any other public authority, except by or under the authority of a law passed by Parliament or of any existing law.

I wish to announce, firstly, that the Cabinet of Ministers unanimously approved the Domestic Debt Optimization Programme proposed by the Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies at a special Cabinet Meeting held on 28.06.2023.

Afterwards, the Resolution for the implementation of the Domestic Debt Optimization to restore sovereign debt sustainability was approved by the Committee on Public Finance of Parliament by a majority of Committee Members at the Committee Meeting held on 30th June 2023.

Thereafter, as the subject matter contained in the said Resolution was essentially a matter of public finance, the Resolution for the implementation of the Domestic Debt Optimization to restore sovereign debt sustainability was passed by a majority Vote in Parliament on the 01st of July, 2023 with 122 Members voting in favour and 62 against.

As the Resolution for the implementation of the Domestic Debt Optimization to restore sovereign debt sustainability has now been passed by Parliament on 01.07.2023, the Resolution is beyond the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court or any other court established under the 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka and cannot be questioned and/or reviewed and/or challenged.

The Ruling given on the 20th of June, 2001 by the Hon. Anura Bandaranaike, Speaker of Parliament, held in unequivocal terms that Parliamentary proceedings cannot be called in question and/or interferred and/or intervened by courts and also held that the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction to issue interim orders, restraining the Speaker of Parliament in respect of the steps he is empowered to take under Standing Order 78A and the interim order of the Supreme Court is not binding and of no legal obligation to comply.

I also wish to highlight Section 3 of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act, No. 21 of 1953 read with Article 67 of the 1978 Constitution in this context, which provides that the Proceedings of Parliament shall not be liable to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament.

Hence, no court established under the Constitution of Sri Lanka is empowered to issue orders or judgments of any nature against a Resolution already passed by Parliament having followed the due Parliamentary process, and any such order or judgment of courts would amount to a violation of item 01 of Part B of Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act, No. 21 of 1953, as amended.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

Hon. Speaker, that is my statement on what we are going to do regarding provincial councils.

I also want to make a second statement regarding the steps we have taken to meet the concerns of the Tamil MPs of the North and the East so that we could move towards reconciliation.Sir, it is my sincere intention to progress without any political motivation, addressing the issues faced by the Tamil people in the North and the East in order to secure a much needed, sustainable national reconciliation in the country. Reconciliation, undoubtedly, is an indispensable factor for Sri Lankas own development. My recent meeting with Tamil Parliamentarians representing the Northern and Eastern Provinces was premised on this aspect. Subsequent to this meeting, I believe it is important to keep the Members of this august House informed of the matters discussed, as it forms the basis of the proposed trajectory the Government would seek to pursue in this regard.

In this context, continued action on the relevant issues are envisioned to contribute towards national reconciliation, which I will now seek to outline:

Anti-Terrorism Bill Following the discussions of the suggested amendments to the Bill, it would be presented to the Cabinet for approval. Subsequent to that, the Bill will be re-gazetted and any person can then petition the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court will have the last say with regard to the provisions of the Bill.

Anti-Corruption Bill I am pleased that the Anti-Corruption Bill was passed in Parliament last month with Amendments proposed by the Supreme Court in its Determination and other stakeholders, but without a vote. It has already been gazetted.

Truth-seeking Mechanism and the Bill The Interim Secretariat for the Truth-seeking Mechanism has been established and a Director General has been appointed. In addition, three Divisions have been established covering Legal and Policy, Public Relations and Information Technology. Applications have been sought for key staff positions for the

operationalization of the Secretariat, particularly for stakeholder consultations and preparations of drafting guidelines and policies until the formal mechanisms could commence following the relevant laws being enacted. Civil society stakeholder consultations including the UN agencies are continuing and when exhausted, Cabinet approval will be sought and it will be processed to become a legal framework.

Office for the National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) Bill The ONUR draft law has been submitted to the Attorney-General for the certification of constitutionality, which will subsequently be presented to Parliament. Additionally, the National Action Plan on Reconciliation drafted by ONUR will be presented to the Cabinet in the near future.

Office for Reparations At present, payments of monetary relief have been granted for 203 cases of missing persons from the North-East conflict amounting to Rs. 40.6 million, as at July, 2023. The process is continuing.

Office on Missing Persons (OMP) I reiterate the need to uphold justice for the people of the North and the East. Of the 21,374 complaints received by the OMP, investigations into 3,462 cases have been completed at present. Investigations are progressing on the remaining complaints and this process could get accelerated following the truth-seeking mechanism being fully operationalized. It would now be appropriate for those seeking particulars of missing persons to submit detailed information to the Interim Secretariat.

Sir, I table* the document containing the relevant information as Annex 1.

The OMP has commenced tracking missing persons. Further, action is being taken to expedite the data-entering process in order for its completion within three months. The issuance of the Certificate of Absence - CoA - is being expedited. The OMP and the Attorney-Generals Department are working on a Case Handling Policy and have drafted guidelines, focusing on effective management of complaints to the previous Commissions and the OMP. Endorsement for the guidelines will be sought from the Cabinet. Further, the OMP with 10 new panels totalling 24, which are expected to be in operation from August, has planned to have a resource team per district for referral services.

The Members of Parliament are free to take up relevant issues with the Offices of Reparations and Missing Persons. The OMP has already outlined its time frames in relation to their scope of work.

Granting Presidential Pardon to Prisoners involved in LTTE Activities Prisoners are under the three categories of remand prisoners, numbering 21, prisoners imposed with death sentence, three and those imposed with other sentences, 22. It has been decided to consider only the last two categories of prisoners for being granted Presidential Pardon in terms of Article 34(1) of the Constitution. In this context, considering the recommendations of the Hon. Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms, Presidential approval has been granted to remit the balance sentences and release 11 of the prisoners under the last category.

Establishment of the National Land Commission Steps are being taken to expedite the establishment of the National Land Commission - NLC - and a National Land Utilization Policy. A draft National Land Commission Law has been prepared and is being further studied for formulating a policy pertaining to the alienation of State land. A Land Commission Policy Act is also expected to be in place by September for the NLC to be guided in their functions. The composition of the NLC would be amended to include nine representatives from the Provinces and 12 government officials.

Resolution of Land Matters It may be recalled that an injunction order had been obtained from the Supreme Court in 2020 on the release of residual forest lands by a Special Committee. Subsequently, following discussions in May this year, the possibility of demarcating forests and wildlife conservation areas based on the 1985 Land Use Maps was requested to be examined. Consequently, a Cabinet Memorandum on this issue was submitted and approval was obtained to enforce the release of such forest lands by an Inter-Ministerial Committee. The withdrawal of the original interim order is being processed.

In the meantime, a database has been evolved, focusing on the said Land Use Maps, current land use patterns and proposals of the Divisional Secretaries related to the lands managed by the Forest Department in all districts of the North and the East. Maps containing information related to the districts have been made available for viewing by the Members of Parliament in the relevant District Secretariats for a period of two months. Sir, I table* the list of contact details of the relevant officials for this purpose as Annex II.

The proposals presented at the Divisional Secretariat level are to be considered by the Inter-Ministerial Committee, following the legal proceedings on the withdrawal of the original interim order. A Committee chaired by the Secretary to the President will examine and facilitate matters relating to land. So, issues could be taken up with that Committee.

National Plan for Archaeology The Department of Archaeology and the Central Cultural Fund have been informed that land demarcation and excavation across the country should be done according to a National Plan. The Director General of Archaeology has been instructed to prioritize and plan excavation work, identification of sites and the manner in which they should be executed. An Action Plan will be presented by the Department of Archaeology for the activities related to the identification of the areas to be conserved and/or proper acquisition to take place.

Road Map for the Issuance of All Country Passports for Sri Lankans living in Rehabilitation Camps in South India The Department of Immigration and Emigration has received a list of 2,678 Sri Lankans living in South Indian Rehabilitation Camps. Of the aforementioned number, those with both Sri Lankan Birth Certificates and National Identity Cards can be issued All Country Passports. The timelines for the issuance of the said documentation span two to four weeks. A considered decision would need to be taken with regard to the issuance of All Country Passports to those Sri Lankans living in Rehabilitation Camps in South India.

Resettlement of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in the Northern and Eastern Provinces The Presidential Secretariat, Northern Province Coordination Office has been established to assist the IDPs who have been affected due to the North and East conflict. As you are aware, people who were internally displaced in the North and the East were accommodated in welfare centres or have been living with their friends and relatives.

After the restoration of normalcy, they have largely returned to their places of origin. Following the resettlement of a majority of the people with housing and livelihood support, its current status in the Northern and Eastern Provinces is hereby tabled* as Annex III.

Action continues to resettle IDP families in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. Of the five districts in the Northern Province, resettlement of IDPs remains only in the Jaffna and Kilinochchi Districts. In Jaffna, there are 15 welfare centres with a total of 136 families and another 2,175 families are living with friends and relatives. There are no IDP families living in Welfare Centres in Kilinochchi. However, 182 families remain with their friends and relatives in the Peninsula, and 177 in Pachchilaipalli Division.

In the Eastern Province, IDPs are present only in Trincomalee and Ampara Districts and they live with friends and relatives, and there are no welfare camps in that province.

227 228

* . * . * Produced at end of speech.

* . * . * Produced at end of speech.

Particular attention has to be given to resolving problems associated with displaced persons' resettlement, which also requires releasing privately held lands for public use. I have tasked the officials to take immediate action to settle these issues by devising effective mechanisms for their resolution.

Lands to be released by armed forces- Northern Province. Of the total land area in Jaffna amounting to approximately 253,283 acres, the occupation by the security forces and the Police, in 2009 was 26,812 acres. Presently, 90 to 92 per cent of the land occupied by the security forces and the Police in 2009 has been released from time to time. Accordingly, 22,990 acres comprising 817 acres of State and 22,101 acres of private lands have been released. The current extent of occupied lands by the security forces and the Police is 3,754 acres, of which 862 and 2,892 acres are State and privately-owned, respectively.

Further release of the land is envisaged under the category of:

(i) Land for immediate release comprises 1.4 acres in Jaffna, 13 acres in Kilinochchi and 20 acres in Mullaitivu, as identified by the Army and the Navy.

(ii) The Army has earmarked 53 acres in the Jaffna District to be released in three to six months time.

(iii) A land strip of approximately 290 acres from the Security Forces Army Cantonment, Palaly has been identified to be released temporarily for specific purposes, including agricultural and seasonal crops.

(iv) Regarding lands that cannot be presently released, a study is being carried out in this regard on the instructions of the Army Commander to ascertain the possibility of further freeing up of land in the Northern Province.

I am aware that this is an area of contention for the Northern populace and therefore, we will continue to seek ways and means to release, as far as possible, the military-occupied lands in that Province.

I would also like to state, in regard to what I have mentioned here, the steps we are taking. There will be certain matters which the MPs from those areas would like to raise. Specially, they may suggest different timelines and some amendments. So, I have asked the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms to deal with all those requests. Therefore, I would request you all to take up any issues on that matter with the two Ministers.

Development Plans for North and East It is imperative to create extensive and practicable plans to develop the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. Anticipating that renewable energy could meet 70 per

cent of the countrys national electricity need by 2030, one of the key objectives of both the Northern and the Eastern Development Plans is to harness the regions renewable energy potential through the production of green hydrogen and green ammonia, using innovative technologies. This strategy aims to attract investments and could transform the Ports of Colombo and Trincomalee as hubs for export of green hydrogen. Pooneryn is being earmarked to be developed as the main town for this purpose.

We have already taken steps on creating a conducive environment for the investment and export of solar and wind power, culminating in a Memorandum of Understanding with India to facilitate collaborative efforts in this area. The Adani Group has come forward to invest in the renewable energy sector of Sri Lanka. I believe that this collaborative approach could lead to substantial growth in this area.

Additionally, the "Water to the North" Programme comprises the development of various waterways. In this context, the Government has already approved the projects for the Poonakary Tank and the Malwathu Oya and they have been put in the special list or the priority list of irrigation works. Talks are presently continuing on the "River for Jaffna" Project, which would bring fresh water to the Jaffna Lagoon and increase the capacity of the Iranamadu Tank. The Small Tanks Renewal Project is important to be accomplished. In fact, that Project will give rise to developing the agricultural and solar energy sectors in the Northern Province.

In addition to this, the Economic Subcommittee of the Cabinet is today considering two Cabinet Papers - one, by the Minister of Irrigation and the other, by the Minister of Water Supply - to look at the development of water supply for urban use in the Jaffna Peninsula as well as developing some of the other projects like Parangi Aru. So, there will be a Committee chaired by my Adviser, Dr. R. Samaratunga to look at those plans and to make a combined plan.

It is also essential to upgrade air and sea connectivity in the North. The development of the KKS Harbour and the Vavuniya and Palali Airports and the establishment of a ferry service connecting the Northern Province to South India are facilities which have been earmarked. The establishment of Investment Promotion Zones in KKS, Paranthan and Mankulam are being worked towards. I will get the BOI to take those over.

We also have plans for the development of tourist attractions in Jaffna and Mannar through a tourist cruise project around the Mannar Fort, the Kankesanthurai Port, the islands and Vadamarachchi. Under an Agriculture Modernization Programme, we will seek to promote coconut cultivation in the Vanni. Jaffna, being home to a seat of excellence in higher education with its University, would be developed as a University City. Additionally, land has been identified in KKS for the establishment of a campus under the aegis of the SLIIT.

Similarly, plans for developing the Eastern Province are progressing with Trincomalee being the core. Indias assistance, as our closest neighbour, in implementing the Trincomalee District Development Project is of immense value to Sri Lanka. The ongoing cooperation in the development of the Trincomalee Tank Farms and Indias agreement to further enhance Trincomalee as a national and regional hub of industry, energy and economic activity is a fillip for developing further mutually beneficial cooperation. The Eastern Province plays an important role in naval affairs and the Trincomalee Port should be made into a leading, strategic port. It is important that we work together with India when developing the Eastern Province Port, by having discussions on several programmes in that region. Further, we cannot limit the economic activities of that Port solely to the Trincomalee District. This should be connected with the cities of Anuradhapura, Vavuniya and Dambulla, especially when the District of Vanni and the Eastern and the North-Central Provinces are responsible for the bulk of agricultural production. Since India has a lead to develop industries in that Province, an industrial zone should be created. The Port, therefore, will also be connected with that and we are planning to establish a Joint Task Force for this purpose.

From an economic point of view, the Eastern Province has much to offer the tourism industry. In particular, there is the cultural triangle of Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Dambulla, which is in close proximity to the Eastern Province and could be a natural route for enhanced visits by tourists to the beach-fronted cities of Batticaloa, Arugam Bay and Trincomalee. The Cabinet also approved Surbana Jurong to cover planning from Verugal Aru to Arugam Bay for tourism purposes. The cruise tourism initiatives could also be a part of this development plan.

The fisheries, agriculture and animal husbandry sectors are well poised for modernization in the Eastern Province. In this context, the opening of the Land Systems A and B of the Mahaweli Right Bank will provide the much-needed impetus for enhancing agricultural pursuits.

I hope that some of the Hon. Members of Parliament who continue a misplaced refrain of the Government purportedly selling out the country to a third party will now constructively understand that no country can progress alone, that, too, especially in the instance of a nation emerging from an unprecedented economic crisis, as has been the experience of Sri Lanka. It must be understood that engaging in a robust relationship with our closest neighbour India would undoubtedly strengthen our ability towards ensuring mutually beneficial cooperation. You have my assurance that I will not engage in initiatives inimical to the sovereignty and integrity of this country. In the same manner, I urge all of you for constructive engagement in our quest for national reconciliation, considering that the interests of the people is the bedrock for our countrys development.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Speaker, - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) , 0 ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Sir, the Hon. President has made an elaborate Statement on his intentions regarding devolution, development matters as well as regarding reconciliation in the North and the East, together with the other intended legislations he wants to introduce. While thanking him for his elaborate Statement - perhaps, we can debate it on a different day - in the mean time, I would earnestly request the President to look at two issues. One is - Hon. President, I have raised this issue with you personally as well - you had referred to the participation of some parties with misconceptions at the All Party Conference. We, too, participated with some inhibitions, but then, unfortunately, it came true when issues relating to elections were taken up. Now, we have an issue particularly relating to the North and the East. Muslims are an integral part of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces and as stakeholders, similarly as you have had discussions with the Tamil Members of Parliament, we, too, would like to have a direct

235 236

discussion with you rather than with your Foreign Minister and the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms. We would appreciate it if we, as Muslim Members of Parliament, be given a chance to have a same level of discussions so that we also can resolve some of these issues.

In the meantime, we also have another issue, which we have raised with the Prime Minister and the Hon. Janaka Wakkumbura, the State Minister in charge of the subject, is also aware of it. It relates to the impending elections for the local government authorities. I am not going to raise an issue about those elections now because that creates disturbances. Our problem is, as Party Leaders, we have been seriously hampered with many candidates, who have got their political rights but are government servants, now being misplaced; they have gone to other schools on transfers and there are various other issues. If there is no intention of holding elections, you had rather cancel the nominations and allow those people to get back to their original places of work. So, this is a serious issue, Hon. President and you had better earnestly consider this. I think all the Party Leaders will agree on this, if at all it happens. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Firstly, regarding answering the issues of the Muslims - I do not think others will take that up - as far as I am concerned, I am prepared to meet you all, as I said, after I discuss this. I am prepared to discuss the matters concerning the Muslims, not only in the North and the East, but also in the rest of the country. The Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Justice have been appointed because we have given certain timelines and information. If the Tamil Members representing the North and the East want a change in that or want more information, then, they can contact those Ministers. So, that is limited to that issue. And, now that you have requested, we will cancel those election nominations. There is no problem. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Sir, can I clarify the matters raised by the Hon. Sivagnanam Shritharan?

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, please.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) He is the only Tamil MP who raised an issue, firstly, on having federalism, whether you can have Tamils only. No, you cannot. It is as those in the country as a whole electorate or as people of two provinces. That is, unless they change the Constitution. But, I have taken into view what the Tamils have wanted and that they have been suffering. - [Interruption ] You are calling me a Sinhala racist and the Hon. (Ven.) Athuraliye Rathana Thero is calling me a Tamil supporter. So, where do I stand? Anyway, I understand the problems you are having.

All I want is to ensure that the Thirteenth Amendment is implemented because we are spending half a trillion rupees on provincial councils! The people of the North, the South or the Uva are not getting any benefit out of

249 250

them. So, let us do it. When you do it, it will also resolve part of the issues there. I am trying to act within the Constitution. But, if the Hon. Member wants to talk of anything else, I am prepared to. I know he represents an area where people are undergoing a lot of suffering. I understand that, but the best thing is that we all get together and see how we can resolve it.

Sir, we are talking about the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. That is not something which was brought about by any other country, but by us; we ourselves brought the Thirteenth Amendment into the 1978 Constitution. There was an issue in this country; we had a 30-year war and it had to end at some point. Every person in this country should be able to live in a united Sri Lanka. Every Sri Lankan has to be given the right to live in this country. They have the right to live in this country and also the right to enjoy equal opportunities in this country. I think we cannot go ahead unless we come to some compromise. Obviously, there is going to be some compromise when it comes to the implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment. We are not going to give in to everything that it provides for. We have to make some

amendments to it and come to some compromise. If that is what is needed, it has to be done. There has to be some sort of a solution to the problem we are having in this country because at Geneva, whether we like it or not, this issue going to be thrown in our face every year. So, we have got to find a solution to this problem because we cannot go ahead without doing that.

First of all, Sir, we should put a stop to racism in this country. 0 "" 0 0 "" "" 0 "" 0 0 0 , 0
