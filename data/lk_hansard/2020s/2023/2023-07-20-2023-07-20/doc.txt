In the 1950s, Hon. Deputy Speaker, when setting up the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, The Banker magazine of London spoke about the danger of moving out of a currency board. I would like to table* that article which appeared in The Banker magazine and also quote from that article. At that time, the writer of that article had spoken about the dangers of moving into this system, saying, I quote:

The step from an 'automatic' currency system (such as that which Ceylon inherited with its old Colonial Currency Board) to an ultra-modern 'managed' currency system is necessarily fraught with great dangers and there may be some who will regret that Ceylon has decided to run such risks at this time.

See, in the 1950s, some writer spoke about this in a magazine of London and now, actually a lot of people are regretting it because we, finally, got bankrupted due to the way the Central Bank has been acting.

2473 2474

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

Then, I would like to quote John Adams, who was a political philosopher plus the second President of the USA.

All the perplexities, confusion and distress in America arise, not from defects in their Constitution or Confederation, not from want of honour or virtue, but more from the downright ignorance of the nature of the coin, credit and circulation.

Then, I quote Thomas Jefferson, who was also a President of the USA.

I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our Constitution - I mean an additional article - taking away from the federal government the power of borrowing..

Now, look how important this is. Do not underestimate the "damage" the wrong central bankers and officials can do to a country. It is important to know what Sri Lanka has been doing wrong in the last 74 years. 74 . .

There were two previous occasions on which a new Central Bank of Sri Lanka Bill was to be introduced. One was in 2001, by the current President Ranil Wickremesinghe. It was thwarted in 2004 when the JVP got together with Mahinda Rajapaksa and toppled that Government. Then, also in 2019, the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe tried to bring in a new Bill and again, that Government was toppled. Now, this is the third time. This Bill needs to be changed, but in the right way.

It is important to understand how Sri Lanka and its people empowered the Central Bank to print money freely whilst working on stimulating the economy through output targeting, to intervene and influence policy rates artificially, to intervene in foreign exchange rates through a flawed, flexible exchange rate system and to artificially maintain exchange rates by wiping out our reserves and bankrupting us in the process and then trying to influence inflation targeting through "flexible inflation targeting" methods and still trying to maintain price stability, which was its primary objective in the end. Ultimately, none of the objectives has been achieved. That is what that has been happening in the past few years.

Now, has this Bill addressed those problems? Look at the history and see what we can learn from that. In the 1930s in the US, the Federal Reserve intervened to raise interest rates and policy rates in the hope of slowing the rapid rises in stock prices. What happened after that? The result was the Great Depression; 1930 Federal Reserve . That was the result of it. Then, in the early 1970s, how do you think the Bretton Woods Agreement collapsed? The USA Gold Reserve could not meet the value of dollars in circulation. A sizeable increase in domestic spending on President Lyndon B. Johnson's "Great Society" Programme, which was an economic stimulation programme, and a rise in military spending on Vietnam War gradually worsened the overvaluation of the dollar and the Bretton Woods Agreement collapsed.

In the UK, the Sterling Pound, which was the pre-eminent world currency by the 1970s, ran into trouble following Keyness theory of money printing in the 1970s. When Edward Heath was Prime Minister, he had Anthony Barber as his Finance Minister, who cut taxes up to Sterling Pounds 1 billion and printed Sterling Pounds 2.5 billion. What happened? The Sterling Pound was devalued and the United Kingdom went into a balance of payment crisis. Does it not sound familiar? I can go on giving more examples, but there is not enough time.

B.R. Shenoy, Goh Keng Swee ; ; . . .

Learn from other countries which have done this right and learn the right lessons. That is very important.

In this new Bill, the Cluase "Accountability is under question. The Central Bank can continue to create instability as in the past, misusing certain Clauses and powers in the Bill. But, there are no penalties for the

Central Bankers who fail to meet inflation targets set by Parliament. They are allowed to make people poor overnight through inflation and go scot-free. That is not fair. In some countries, central bank governors have to resign if targets are not met. Sir, the current accountability provisions in the Bill are weak or non-existent. We have confidence in the current Governor of the Central Bank, but what happens if he is replaced? We have seen Governors who have brought this country down on its knees. Therefore, we have to have safeguards and accountability provisions. Hypothetically, if the Governor, the Governing Board and the Monetary Policy Board get together with the President, the Minister of Finance and the ruling party supporters as during the Rajapaksa regime, they can take us to the cleaners again. That is why some people are trying desperately to include the output gap targeting under the pretext of emergencies. I think the Supreme Court did not understand the real context of the case. As economists, we understand what we have to do.

Then, talking about independence, independence must be from politicians, from Ministers and from governments interfering in the Central Bank and not from the law or accountability. Goals and targets must be discussed in Parliament and with the Parliamentarians by the Minister of Finance. The Ministry of Finance must set the goals and targets and the Central Bank officials must be able to use tools to achieve those targets. They must be accountable, if they cannot achieve those targets.

Sir, as there is a time constraint, I am not going to talk about the Amendments to the new Bill. My Colleague, the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne and my other Colleagues will talk about them. There are many Amendments that I stand for, especially the one to Clause 26, in which Clause there are no provisions on accountability. Under that, in inflation targeting, if they do not achieve the targets, the Monetary Policy Board only have to come and submit a report to Parliament and tell why they could not achieve it, but there is no deterrent. There are places where action should be taken because there are times at which their accountability and responsibility must be questioned for taking wrong decisions. Therefore, I would like to say that Clause 86 is the core or the heart of this Bill. And, if you are trying to say that in emergencies, the Government must be allowed to print money, I am afraid I cannot agree to that.

Sri Lankas biggest economic crisis was precipitated by the Central Bank by purchasing Treasury Bills from the primary market. We saw that during the global health emergency in 2020 due to COVID, there were countries, including Nigeria, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, which printed money through their Central Banks to refinance funds. They are now in trouble. But, countries which borrowed hard cash and managed their taxes without printing money maintained stable economies and exchange rates without creating a crisis as soon as economic activity resumed.

( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) Sir, I would like to wind up by saying that I am not at ease with this Bill because I feel we have come back to the same place again, that the Central Bank still has, along with its primary objective of price stabilization, the contradicting objectives of output targeting, exchange rate determination, policy rate determination and inflation targeting, which is a toxic mix.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne. You have six minutes.

[2.23 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Presiding Member, today, we are passing a new law called the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Bill, with which we can take a look at our monetary system and the Central Bank.

When it comes to this law, the primary aim is the independence of the Central Bank. But, that cannot be looked at differently from accountability of the Central Bank. So, the independence of the Central Bank has to go hand in hand with its accountability. Why should there be independence? There should be independence because the fiscal policy has driven the monetary policy in this country for a long time. Therefore, the Central Bank needs to be independent when it comes to its primary objectives of controlling inflation, price stability, financial system stability and now, they have brought in a new objective, which is economic stability. However, the Cental Bank also needs to be accountable and accountability is actually, absolutely necessary in this country. Accountability starts with the legal system itself. For law's delays, people in the legal system are responsible. Why are there law's delays? We have the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption - CIABOC. What is their accountability? Nothing of significance has actually happened. Therefore, we want the Central Bank to function and achieve its objectives, but also to make sure that it is accountable.

We have a financial crisis in this country. Different people might pass its responsibility to different people, saying those are responsible for the financial crisis, but the Central Bank is also responsible for that. For the printing of money and the inflation going sky-high, the Central Bank is responsible. The Governor and the Monetary Board have to take responsibility for the mess we are in today. So, on the one hand, we are arguing for the independence of the Central Bank while, on the other,

we have a financial situation, for which the Central Bank is also responsible. The excuse that they had pressure from Presidents, Prime Ministers and Finance Ministers is not good enough. If this country is to be put right, professionals should stand up. That is why we are arguing for accountability.

The Monetary Policy is technical; it is data-driven. Information is price-sensitive because they decide on how many Treasury Bills and Bonds are there, what the tenors of those are, what the amounts are, what the prices are and what the yields are based on that. So, price-sensitive information is there. When there is price-sensitive information, it can lead to corruption, as has happened in the past. We had a Bond scam in 2015. That is what was alleged. Still, we do not know about it; still, we are waiting for a decision on it. But, leakage of such information has happened for decades; there have been leakages of sensitive information. People have benefited privately from that. So, we do not want the Monetary Board diluted. We, as a party, are opposed to the expansion of the Monetary Board. We do not want it to be subsumed by the Governing Council. That is why we are proposing an Amendment to that. We are saying that if you have the Governor and two Deputy Governors on the Monetary Policy Board, there should be at least four other independent people on it, restricting the members to seven. Do not subsume it with the Governing Council and if necessary - you know how those seven are to be appointed - two members from the Governing Council could be appointed to that. That is one of the Amendments we are seeking to propose in terms of accountability. Accountability is important because we live in a country where the political philosophy is, there should be the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary. The Central Bank does not become a fourth arm of governance, in that sense. So, it has to be accountable to Parliament.

If you look at Clause 26 of this Bill, accountability measures are there; there are measures like inflation targeting. Under that, the Minister and the Central Bank shall sign a monetary policy framework agreement. If the Central Bank is not performing up to the required level, they have to report that to Parliament through the Minister and that information should be made publicly available. But, if the Central Bank goes on failing, just giving a report would not help. Therefore, I think we have to go further and take measures.

Clause 19 of the Bill refers to the disqualifications and removal of office-holders from office. We are moving an Amendment to that as well to include their not achieving the inflation target agreed upon over a reasonable period of time - it is not to be unfair by anybody - as a disqualification for the removal of officials. Some countries have such accountability. I know that New Zealand has such accountability. New Zealand might not be a favourite of the International Monetary Fund. We are not here to play a game of favourites for the International Monetary Fund, New Zealand or for anybody. We want to do what is best for Sri Lanka. That is why we are saying that it needs to be done. We are arguing that if we strengthen Clause 19, accountability will also be strengthened.

2509 2510

Then, Sir, on the appointment of members to the Governing Council and the Monetary Policy Board, there has been a suggestion that nominations could come from the Constitutional Council as well as the Hon. President. Ultimately, it needs the approval of the Constitutional Council.

Then, the cooling-off period, I know, the Judiciary said is three years, but the original Bill said one year. So, I am raising a practical issue here. Three years is a deterrent to getting good people and is something for the Government to consider. If you consider it, we will support it.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is up. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) As regards Clause 86, we agree with the original Clause. We are willing to give a two-thirds majority on that. Also, we recognize that you have proposed some checks and balances, which we are actually willing to live with.

But, Sir, there are two things we want changed. One is, the composition of the Monetary Policy Board; there, we want to see a change. The second is, we want to see a change in the Clause relating to disqualification and removal of officials from office, which, we think, will make the Central Bank not just independent, but also accountable, that, then, we will have a better law than the law that is presently being proposed.

Thank you, Sir, for the time given. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan. You have ten minutes.

.

. . . . . : if the Opposition is willing to start a quarrel between the present and the past, you must remember that we will lose our future eternally. So, the point is, we can go on arguing about what is happening at present and who did what in the past, but remember, the Opposition, collectively, will be responsible for burying a better future for the citizens of this country. Therefore, institutional freedom, political freedom and ideological freedom must be guaranteed in a deepening democracy and an emerging market like Sri Lanka. Then, one can ask what philosophy we follow, whether it is Keynesian economics, post-Keynesian economics, Marxist economics, post-Marxist economics, structural economics or free-market economics. That debate is a philosophical debate. What we, in this House, are committed to is to deliver democracy to our citizens. .

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. State Minister, your time is up.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan) Sir, I will wind up.

Finally, all that I wish to say is, the Central Banks independence through this Bill is a new beginning for our country. No politician, no leader, no Parliament can ever manipulate it hereafter. There is a correlation between deepened democracy and the independence of the Central Bank. You take Germany. They made their central bank independent. You take New Zealand and they also did that. Then, you take France and they, too, did that. Therefore, . .

They tried to destroy the dagoba there, which is 2,000 years old. He goes there and meets them, which is a disgraceful act, highly uncalled for and beyond the mandate of diplomatic protocol. It is a contemptuous act and I strongly recommend that he be notified persona non grata - a person unacceptable and unwelcome - in this country. 2 000 . .

. She meets ITAK, TPNA, PLOTE and TELO leaders and talks about the political problems of the country. The US should not have any political interest in our country. Julie Chung is a smart lady, we know. She immigrated to the US from Korea, was raised in California, joined the Foreign Service in 1996 in the first cohort of the Thomas R. Pickering Fellowship Programme, was the recipient of the Presidential Rank

Award and Secretarys Distinguished Honour Award and speaks Korean, Japanese, Spanish and Khmer languages in addition to English. But, I think she must adhere to the conditions laid down in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. They have a duty not to interfere in the internal affairs of this State.

She came as the Ambassador to Sri Lanka on 10th February, 2022, a month before protestors attempted to attack President Gotabayas private residence. From the time she took office, we have observed that she has been interfering in our domestic affairs, violating the Vienna Convention. Once the Federation of National Organizations asked her not to create an anti-China frenzy by insisting that China is behind the delay of Sri Lankas debt restructuring process and also said that Chung is trying to mislead the people and create animosity between Sri Lanka and China. They also asked that if the US is so concerned about Sri Lanka - the US had printed three trillion Dollars in 2022 - why do they not use some of it to help us?

Also when the Presidential Secretariat was freed from illegal occupants on 22nd July, last year, she tweeted, Deeply concerned about actions taken against protestors in the middle of the night. We urge restraint by the authorities and immediate access to medical attention for those injured. Acts of anarchy are defended and justified in the name of strong democracy. This kind of intrusive comments amount to interference in internal matters of a sovereign State.

Mr. Daya Gamage, a retired Foreign Service National Political Specialist who worked in the US Department of State for 30 years, has written an article titled The two-faced Ambassador: Chungs actions highlight US double standards. In that, he writes that six weeks after the September 11 attacks, the US Congress passed the USA Patriot Act, neither discussion nor amendments were permitted and members barely had time to read the Bill before they were forced to cast a vote on it and that all the obnoxious provisions of the USA Patriot Act were in operation until the promulgation of the Freedom Act of 2015. He further writes that on Sri Lankas proposed Anti-Terrorism Bill, Julie Chung "expressed her strong desire to see extensive discussions both public and Parliamentary" and also noted that certain aspects of the proposed Bill fall outside of international standards.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. Please wind up. () ( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera) Hon. Presiding Member, please give me one more minute.

Lastly, I would like to quote Ms. Shivanthi Ranasinghe. In one of her articles she says, If Chung fails to note the growing resentment towards her, the consequence can be catastrophic. The current trend is to

set up "Go Home Villages" and create public mayhem till the offending individual is ousted from office. Both the democratically elected President and the Premier were thus removed. Therefore, it should not surprise any, if anti-Chung protestors suddenly declare the US Embassy as the 'Julie Chung-Go Gama'.' Would Chung then simply catch the next plane out of the Island as the 'peaceful protestors' smashed up the US property?
