Steadfast political commitment helped the country achieve major gains in 2016. Sri Lanka withstood pressure from the food and beverage industry and introduced traffic light labelling on sugary food and drinks. Tobacco taxation was increased significantly despite resistance.

Hon. Member, as you correctly mentioned, we agree that there are disparities between national data and regional data. The Nuwara Eliya District is one of worst affected areas in relation to malnutrition. We are looking at those specific areas to see how best we could address certain grievances of the children in those areas. Thank you.

At this point, I thank the Australian Rotary Club for donating a CT scanner to the Ashraff Memorial Hospital, Kalmunai. Hon. Minister, already we have built the chamber and everything is ready and there is only the installation to be done. This morning, Dr. Shridaran, DDG (Planing) called me and said that permission will be granted by the Ministry. I thank the Ministry, which has been helping us to do that good job. Thank you, again.

And also, I want to bring to your notice the need for a cath lab for the Batticaloa Hospital. It is essential, Hon. Minister. For cath lab tests, we have to go to the Jaffna Hospital since it is the closest for us. The people of the Ampara District, the Batticaloa District and the Trincomalee District, of all those three districts, are suffering due to this. In our district, more and more NCD patients are found and we see their sufferings. Poor people have to wait for years to get their angiogram done. There was a machine received and getting that for us was very challenging. I do not want to mention what happened to that. It disappeared without being brought to the Batticaloa Hospital. During the last Government, we had a proposal. That is, since we are faced with a big challenge in getting the necessary equipment, to get those under a public-private partnership, in which somebody can invest and we can pay on instalment basis. In India, they are doing that. Similarly, we want to have a plan for our county since we have financial issues and are unable to invest money on equipment. I think you know all that and actually, getting those equipment has been challenging.

The other matter is related to dialysis machines. I cannot speak for the entire country. In the Base Hospital-Kalmunai North, the Asharaff Memorial Hospital, Kalmunai, the Base Hospital, Sammanthurai, the Base Hospital, Pottuvil and the Base Hospital, Nintavur, we have dialysis centres. The Hospitals of Sammanthurai, Pottuvil and Nintavur, each has two dialysis machines and I think the Kalmunai Hospital has five or six machines and the Kalmunai-North Hospital also has five machines. This is not enough. Twenty four hours, they are doing dialyses. We need to increase the number of dialysis machines. So, I hope you would support us by providing more dialysis machines to those places.

1543 1544

The present Secretary to the Ministry introduced the "Vision 2020" Programme when we had been in charge of that Ministry and now, it has come to a standstill. For the "Vision 2020" Programme, they gave one mobile unit and I have not seen that mobile unit and do not know where it is. It was given by a donor. Under the "Vision 2020" Programme, there were a lot of donors globally. They had been giving money to buy lenses for cataract patients, which supported those undergoing surgery in those days, but now it has come to a standstill.

Also, Hon. Minister, during my period - I thank the former Minister Rohitha Abegunawardhana for talking about NCDs - what we did was, I think at that time, the DDG was Dr. Siriwardena, we prepared a booklet in Tamil and Sinhala about NCDs, including warnings on use of food, behaviour and everything, to be given to school children through the RDHS offices. We had a functioning RDHS Office in Kalmunai. We gave those to the RDHS, but so far there have been no results on that. That was a good booklet. If that booklet is distributed to schools, the school children would read it and tell their mothers and fathers how to change their behaviour and the consumption of food to control NCDs, which have become challenging to the country today.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. Please, wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Faizal Cassim) One minute, please, Sir.

As regards CKDU, we introduced a project from Malaysia, which is a big project. I think there were 80 patients preliminarily. We wanted to do peritoneal dialysis here. They provide all the machines and the solution and we have to pay for the patients monthly. But now, that has slowed down. If you could spread that system throughout the country, to all the areas like Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Dehiattakandiya and so on, it would be helpful for the patients to get their dialyses done at night and go back to work in the morning. Earlier, in the Presidential Secertariat, we had a CKDu unit, but it is not functioning now. There was also a fund, under which we carried out a lot of water recycling projects, but it has come to a standstill now.

So, Hon. Minister, if you could request the President to form such a fund again, that would help the people with CKDu.

Thank you very much. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana) Just give me a minute, Sir, to clarify regarding the cath lab programme. Actually, JICA has promised to provide five cath labs to the country, which project has

come to a standstill because of this financial calamity. We have started discussions again to see whether we could restart that project. If so, we might be able to give one to the Batticaloa Hospital. Also, we pay attention to whatever requirements in the Kalmunai Base Hospital. In the backdrop of these financial constraints, it is a bit of a concern, but we will try and do whatever possible from our side.

( ) (The Hon. Faizal Cassim) Sir, - ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes, Hon. Faizal Cassim? ( ) (The Hon. Faizal Cassim) When I was Deputy Minister of Health, in the Kaluwanchikudy Hospital, I built a big room to start an Osu Sala centre. The people in Kaluwanchikudy are very poor. Because of that, I made arrangements to start an Osu Sala centre. Hon. Minister, if you could start that, it would be great.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 10 .

Hon. State Minister - I am very happy that a lady Member had been appointed as the State Minister - why are you all not implementing the National Policy of Healthcare Quality and Safety in the plantation sector in the up-country? Though there are hospitals under the Provincial Council, they are not functioning well. The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva is here. When he was Minister of Healthcare and Nutrition and I was the Deputy Minister, we took over 51 estate hospitals and developed them. We appointed MBBS doctors also to those hospitals. But now, most of those hospitals are closed. The Ohiya Hospital is not running properly. Likewise, the Uva Paranagama District Hospital and the Westhall Estate Hospital in Kandy District are also not running properly. So far, only those 51 estate hospitals were taken over, which was during our period, by the Central Government. That is all. After that, it has not been implemented. The large amount of money that is being allocated for the Ministry of Health is for implementing that National Policy of Healthcare Quality and Safety. But, it is not being implemented in the up-country, in the plantation sector. Why? Those estate sector people are not robots! They are sacrificing their lives for the economy of this country.

Since the Hon. State Minister of Health is here, I would like to say that there are less infrastructure facilities available in the plantations. There are pregnant mothers in those areas and the condition of the roads are very bad. So, how can the pregnant mothers travel from Maskeliya to the Glankan Hospital? How can they travel

from the Roeberry Estate, from which there is no road at all? From the Ohiyauda area, pregnant mothers and plantation workers receiving treatment are transferred to the Badulla Hospital. So, please take these matters into consideration. The new Minister of Health is here. We wish him and you also, Madam, all the best in continuing this service. Please try to allocate money for the hospitals in the plantation areas also. They are also human beings; they are also citizens of this country, but they are ill-treated. The National Policy of Healthcare Quality and Safety is not implemented there at all.

. , . ! , , , , ! . , , , , . !

And also Hon. (Mrs.) Seetha Arambepola, I would like to tell you that there is a language problem too in those areas. So, why do you not recruit some Tamil-speaking, up-country youth for the health service? If you all could do that, it would be very much appreciated since that language issues is there.

At long last, the head of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority, Professor S. D. Jayaratne, has finally admitted that inferior drugs had been imported to the country and used at Government hospitals.

, Prof. S. D. Jayaratne, former Chairman of the NMRA, had admitted that inferior drugs had been imported to Sri Lanka and those had been used in government hospitals, as a result of which, undoubtedly, a number of deaths had taken place. So, that is a very sad state of affairs. So, this is an area which you have to look into very carefully and attentively because if this continues, definitely, the confidence that the people of this country have in the health service would further deteriorated. That is one factor I would like to bring to your notice.

Hon. Minister, this is with regard to the closure of State hospitals. It is reported that the State healthcare system is in a severe crisis, that 40 hospitals had been closed and 100 hospitals are on the brink of closure. Another news report states, "In a dire revelation, it has come to light that the State healthcare system is facing a severe crisis, with 40 State-run hospitals shuttered and an additional 100 are teetering on the brink of closure. The gravity of the situation is particularly pronounced in the Northern Province, as well as in the Puttalam and Nuwara Eliya Districts, where hospitals are either already shut down or slated for closure". Hon. Minister, I just want to say that in the Nuwara Eliya District, the health sector is already severely affected due to lack of medical facilities. If the hospitals are also shut down, the situation there would go from bad to worse. Hon. Minister, the entire nation and you are well aware that even during the COVID-19 pandemic situation, the plantation sector worked tirelessly, contributing immensely to the countrys economy. At the same time, during the past 200 years, they were given stepmotherly treatment in terms of education and health. So, I request you to take necessary steps to improve the health sector in the plantation sector and also take measures to prevent the closure of hospitals in the Nuwara Eliya District as well as in the country as a whole.

( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, today, I am really delighted to participate in the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Health, which is functioning under the leadership of a professional doctor, who is none other than the Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana. I always felt that the Minister of Health should be one from the medical profession. Even during the previous Government, whenever we requested the then Minister, the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senarathne, for hospital requirements, we were able to have our requests executed promptly as he understood the needs, being a doctor himself. So, Hon. Minister, I am so glad that a person of your caliber is heading the Ministry of Health and also your State Minister.

Having said that, Hon. Minister, let me draw your kind attention to the almost completed surgical unit of the Base Hospital in Eravur, which was upgraded to a Type B Base Hospital in 2011. It caters to a population of almost 110,000 belonging to all communities. Ninety per cent of the building of that surgical unit in the hospital is completed and Accesss Engineering, the company which has been doing the construction, has mentioned that it will be completed before December, 2023. It would be much appreciated, Hon. Minister, if you could instruct through your good offices to hasten its completion, to finish it as soon as possible. I also take this opportunity to invite you

to come and commission the surgical unit of the Eravur Base Hospital.

Next, I would like to draw your kind attention to the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital, where the construction work of the renal unit and the cardiology unit is yet to be completed. With more than 90 per cent of the construction done, the finishing up of this project is being delayed. According to the Department of National Planning of the Treasury, eight building complexes have been approved for the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital. They are, a ward complex, a surgical unit, a maternal and paediatric unit, a radiology and laboratory unit, quarters for doctors and nurses and an expanded oncology unit equipped with iodine therapy. However, considering the dilapidated condition of the old buildings of this Teaching Hospital, I urge you, Hon. Minister, to consider constructing at least one building complex with six storeys. While understanding the economic crisis we are in, your favourable consideration of the construction of this one building would be appreciated.

Furthermore, the Regional Director of Health Services, Batticaloa has indicated that there are health sector vacancies in Batticaloa. More than 12 hospitals are without permanent doctors; more than 20 dispenser vacancies exist in the Batticaloa region and there are also 47 midwife vacancies, 105 minor staff vacancies and six vacancies for MLTs. Hon. Minister, there are other areas which require your attention. There is a dire need for an MRI unit in the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital since such a unit is not available anywhere in the Eastern Province. Also many ambulances are under repair. The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva was saying that more ambulances are due to arrive and please consider the Batticaloa District as well when distributing them. Then, we also need a provincial water checking lab.

Sir, since my time is limited, I would like to draw your kind attention to the 1,500 Dengue Control Field Assistants who were given appointments way back, on 22nd August, 2017. Please consider making them permanent because they are doing a wonderful job in my area as well as all over the Island.

Having said that, let me thank you and wish you all the best, Hon. Minister!

Thank you. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana) Hon. Member, thank you for your kind words.

We will be submitting another Cabinet Paper, seeking approval for absorbing these 1,500 Dengue Control Field Assistants into the mainstream. So, we will see whether we could get approval.

Also, in relation to the surgical unit in the Eravur Hospital, if it is nearing completion, we will complete and come to see that. Thank you.
