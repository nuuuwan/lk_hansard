. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam. You have nine minutes.

[3.46 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, one-fourth of my time has been reduced for the second time. I think that is completely unfair because there is only one speaker from our party for the whole Debate. We do not disturb Parliamentary proceedings, but we are penalized the most and also, we are put right at the end to speak.

Anyway, Sir, I want to take this opportunity to bring one matter to the notice of this House. You might be aware that there have been some mass graves identified in Kokkuthuduvai in the Mullaitivu District. There, the concern, Sir, is the haphazard way in which those exhumations are carried out. We have been made aware in the Tamil media with photographs published -

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) You have been given additional three minutes, Hon. Member.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Thank you, Sir. I deeply appreciate that.

So, there have been photographs appearing in newspapers, in Tamil media in particular, of heavy machinery being used for the exhumations and clearly, the concern amongst the families of the disappeared, who assume that those mass graves contain the remains of their loved ones, is that these excavations or exhumations are done in a deliberate way in order to ensure that the proper outcomes with regard to the investigations would not come out. Sir, you, being a lawyer yourself, know that exhumations are a very particular form of forensics, where expertise is generally needed. I, as someone who practised as a criminal lawyer, know that the relevant Department, on several occasions, sought foreign expert advice and involvement on such matters and Sri Lanka, as far as these mass graves and exhumations are concerned, is actually found severely wanting.

The track record of Sri Lankas exhumations is shocking, Sir. In fact, today, I wish to table* a Report that had been published jointly by the Journalists for Democracy in Sri Lanka, the Families of the Disappeared, the Centre for Human Rights and Development - CHRD - and the International Truth and Justice Project.

It is titled Mass Graves and Failed Exhumations in Sri Lanka and had been published in June, 2023. Sir, you will find in that Report shocking findings with regard to the way we had handled mass graves and exhumations in the past, that all efforts to uncover the truth had been severely undermined. The findings in that Report are, magistrates and forensic experts had been transferred abruptly, if they were getting too close to the truth, the Police delayed carrying out judicial orders, the families and lawyers were denied access to sites, no efforts were made to find live witnesses in the course of these exhumations, no ante-mortem data was collected and almost on every occasion or very rarely when someone was convicted, they were Presidentially pardoned. The classic example of that is the case in Chemmani.

To date, Sir, out of those exhumations, very few had led to the identification of the victims or any clarification of the circumstances of their deaths, let alone the prosecution and conviction of those responsible for the disappearances and murder of the people whose bodies had been recovered. The legal framework is also inadequate. In 2016, the Interim Report of the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms pointed to the arbitrary procedures, lack of coordination between actors and lack of mandatory involvement of a Consultant JMO and deficiencies of investigations into suspected grave sites.

And, above all, Sir, as we all know, the curse of the country is political interferences in almost all politically sensitive cases. A good example is the investigation into the Kaluwanchikudy site. When it was assumed, at the beginning, that it was an LTTE victims site, there was a lot of hurry, things began to rush. Then, when they realized that it was a fellow called Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan formerly of the LTTE and known as Karuna who was responsible for the whole thing, everything came to a crash; nothing has happened for almost 10 years.

In the case of the Matale mass graves, the magisterial judicial inquiry, I am responsibly informed, made findings that those remains were from the 1980s. The Government then rushed and appointed a Commission of Inquiry, which wanted foreign experts involved, who finally found that it happened before 1950, very convenient! So, Sir, this is the track record we have with regard to exhumations of these mass graves.

2017 2018

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

( () - ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Suren Raghavan - State Minister of Higher Education) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . ( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Suren Raghavan) I would like to ask the Hon. Member whether, with regard to the case in Mannar, -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Again, just yesterday, there were news reports -

( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Suren Raghavan) The House needs to know about the case in Mannar. Then, I was the Governor of the Northern Province and started the investigation process. Hon. Member, if you know any new details about that case, this House needs to know. Thank you.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) In fact, in Mannar, over 300 bodies had been exhumed.

Then, just yesterday - this is news today - there were reports about a grave in Kokkuthuduvai. All of a sudden, I think the court has decided that no further exhumations are to take place, which is quite a unique decision to have been taken when more and more bodies were in the process of being found. So, what I am trying to say here, Sir, is that when there has been this live finding just last week, where those heavy machinery had been used, I think it is important that the Government intervenes, especially at a time when it is trying to establish some form of credibility in the eyes of the international community with regard to accountability. So, I think it is high time that the Government intervenes. I ask that the Government immediately involve the ICRC to protect that site until such time that all stakeholders could agree on a proper way with regard to proceeding with those exhumations because if we are not prepared to do that, I think the Governments two-faced stance with regard to its so-called commitment to reconciliation and accountability will, once again, get exposed.

Finally, Sir, I just want to make certain comments with regard to the references made by the Hon. Premitha Bandara Tennakoon, State Minister of Defence, and also

the Hon. Premnath C. Dolawatte. Both of them - I was in the House when their speeches were being made - made references and objections to certain protests that are being carried out in the North and the East with regard to certain Buddhist viharayas. I myself have been involved in some of them. Sir, one of them mentioned that there are Tamils who go and pray at the Nagadeepa Viharaya. There are Tamils who go and pray, not only at the Nagadeepa Viharaya, but also at several other viharayas. I was brought up by anamma.

Apart from my parents, the person whom I can give credit to for bringing me up is a Sinhala, Buddhist amma from the Matara District. So, we have no problems with the Sinhalese or the Buddhists.

But, the protests that are taking place in the North and the East are specifically for reasons that are quite sinister. That is why we are protesting. For example, the viharaya at Thaiyiddi is illegally built. It is built on a private land, a land belonging to individuals, to private citizens and is illegally built with no authorization whatsoever. In fact, there is a land of about 20 perches which belongs to a viharaya in that area and is still vacant. Nothing is being built there, but on this private land, there is a viharaya being built.

( ) (The Hon. Premitha Bandara Tennakoon)

. . rose.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Let me finish. You can answer me once I finish.

So, there is a viharaya that is being built on that private land. Secondly, Sir, we are also protesting - [Interruption] No, no, you speak after I finish. Otherwise, I would not get to finish.

The other thing we are protesting against is constructions done on archaeological sites, where courts have ordered no buildings should be built. You are a lawyer, Hon. State Minister. Courts have ordered that no new constructions can be made on such sites. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Premitha Bandara Tennakoon) Sir, I am referring to the land he was talking about earlier. I do not know anything about what you are saying now, Hon. Member. I want to mention that there is a deed

2019 2020

2023 07

indeed for the temple that is being built there. The GA confirms that there are 1.9 acres. The Hon. Member does not know better than the GA. So, we have to go by the GA. Of course, there is a dispute. So, we will look into that. We have appointed a committee to look into that and there is no point in going there and disrupting whatever they are doing there. Do not do that, Hon. Member. We can settle this.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Once again, Hon. Tennakooon, you must understand - you are a lawyer - that there are procedures even with regard to building a temple. So, there is a procedure. Just because a GA says so, you cannot go and build a temple without any plan or without any acceptance from the local authority. All of it was done illegally. Anyway, I can tell you with all responsibility that it is an utter lie you are uttering today. - [Interruption]

( ) (The Hon. Premitha Bandara Tennakoon) What I am saying is, we have appointed a committee to look into that. So, there is no point in going there and disrupting the religious affairs of those people. You have no right to do that.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) You have appointed a committee after we went there and protested. Otherwise, you would have never appointed a committee.

Also, there are Orders given by your own courts that on archaeological sites that are to be excavated, no new buildings could be built. You are constructing new buildings there. Then, what does others say? You have the Ven. Ellawala Medhananda Thero who, all of a sudden, pronounces that around that area, in about 300 acres, you cannot have anybody else, but only Sinhala Buddhists. So, is that not sinister? Are those not reasons for us to protest? So, please do not mislead the Sinhala people who will not approve these racial acts. Please do not mislead people like that.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. Please wind up.

( ) (The Hon. Premitha Bandara Tennakoon) It is not the general public who are protesting against this. I must put that on record as well. It is not the general public who are opposing this, but political movements. So, if there is a problem, we can talk about it, have a committee to look into that and solve the matter. But, this is not the way to go about it.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you.
