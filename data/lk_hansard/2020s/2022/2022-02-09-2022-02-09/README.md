( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, this emanates from a ruling by the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue. Then, Hon. Minister, you have to follow it, unless you appeal against it. Therefore, the easier way for the Government is to consider bringing an Amendment, by which the income from the EPF and the ETF could be exempted from Income Tax. That would be the best thing for Parliament to do. Otherwise, what you can do is, you can go to court. If the court upholds that interpretation, you are stuck again. , , .

, , - Prohibition of Anti-Personnel Mines Bill - ?

Sir, this is a Bill to provide for the implementation of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction and to provide for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. The Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction was concluded by the Diplomatic Conference on An International Total Ban on Anti-Personnel Landmines in Oslo in September 18, 1997, 25 years ago.

On the 13th of December, 2017, Sri Lanka acceded to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction, which is also known as the Ottawa Convention. Article 9 of the APMBC - that is, the Ottawa Convention - requires State Parties to take all appropriate legal, administrative and other measures, including the imposition of penal sanctions to prevent and suppress any activity prohibited to a State Party under the Convention undertaken by persons or on territory under its jurisdiction or control.

Therefore, the need arises to draft an enabling legislation to implement the provisions of the aforesaid Convention in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, this draft Bill

641 642

specifically provides provisions for the retention of anti-personnel mines for the purposes of developing or training persons in techniques of mine detection, mine clearance, mine deactivation or mine destruction, and the Minister may, from time to time by notice published in the Gazette, authorize the retention or transfer of a number of anti-personnel mines. The High Court of the Western Province holden in Colombo shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear, try and punish the offences under this law.

Sir, we are a very respectable partner of the international community and we have obligations and rights in terms of the international community. So, as a responsible member of the international community and in terms of the obligations of the Convention that we have acceded to and signed, we are empowering the aforesaid Convention by bringing in this law. We have worked overtime to draft this and I must thank everyone from the different departments who were involved in drafting this Bill. Some of them from my Ministry are present here. I must also thank the officials of the Attorney-Generals Department, those from various forces and also the officials from the Legal Draftsmans Department for tirelessly working on and getting it through. It is important that we do it and that is how we can be an equal, dignified partner in the international community so that others would not be able to come and interfere in our internal affairs unnecessarily; that is what we have been working on. I must thank both the former Minister of Foreign, who is the current Minister of Education, and the current Minister of Foreign, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, for their untiring efforts in rebuilding our international image without compromising our sovereignty and national integrity. So, we must thank them for that. We cannot accede to conventions giving up our rights, but be equal partners in a dignified manner. So, this is a step towards that.

The next Bill, I must bring to your attention, Sir, is an Amendment to Section 88 of the Civil Procedure Code.

, , " " . I do not know the Tamil translation of it. It says - I suppose you already understand what it says - that the people who go to court or into litigation, destroy themselves. . , " - " . That means, there is no confidence in judges because it is said that the judges are biased. That is how the saying goes. But, when they are biased in favour of truth or in favour of justice, maybe, those who have got aggrieved by it are saying so.

Then, we have to give due consideration to songs of Nanda Malini like the one which goes on to say, ".. " . , . If we take the extent to which this questioned issue about justice and courts has sunk in, it has even gone into the literature of this country.

, . : ; their freedom of mobility has been curtailed and their freedom to leave the country is restricted. So, it is under all kinds of conditions that these people have been released even recently. Therefore, the stigma of having been apprehended under the PTA for even the flimsiest of reasons continues to haunt these individuals and their families even after they have received bail or have been released from prison. So, all of these aspects have to be taken into consideration. It is not just the individual who has been affected by this, but that persons entire network and family.

When we talk about reforming the PTA, we have to really understand that the PTA has been implemented in this country in the most arbitrary way, that people are taken into custody on the flimsiest of reasons and detained for extended periods of time with absolutely no regard for the consequences of that intervention or action by the State, not just on the individuals, but on the individuals' families and loved ones. If you do a real assessment of who these detainees are, I am sure the Hon. Sumanthiran will agree with me, you would find that in most cases, the people who are really suffering under the PTA are people with very little influence and very little economic power in the society. Some of the better known cases at least get some press attention. We are extremely pleased that Hejaaz Hizbullah had been finally bailed out, but that was after so much lobbying, so much press attention and so much of discussion on it. There are many other detainees whose names we do not even know; there are women in prison whose names we do not know. So, when we talk about reform of the PTA, this kind of cosmetic changes that are being proposed, which we suspect are simply a ploy to win some goodwill from the international community, are simply not enough. This Act has been a bane on our society for decades and it is time that we actually do something meaningful about it.
