( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) No, no.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) Our loyalty is to the people of this country and no one else. We will stand by that. Anything which goes against our conscience, we are not going to be part of. If anybody has any problem with that decision, it has to be taken up with the Minister of Finance. I was the Minister of Finance then. So, I am ready to face anything, but do not go after honest, brave officials who have done what is best for the country. Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe never wanted this position. We wanted him to come; the former President wanted him to come and he had come and done the job. I can see that there is some sort of a conspiracy to get rid of him. I do not think we are in agreement with that. I am glad that the Hon. Minister of Finance and President of this country has stood by him, working hand in hand and so many things have been happening because of those decisions.

Sir, I would like to make my comments on the last day of the Debate on the Appropriation (Amendment) Bill, which I personally and professionally think has been brought at one of the most decisive junctures of the nation that had survived, at least, for 2,000 years. By 4.30 p.m. today, we will decide on this Bill and as a nation, will see that there are two kinds of people represented in this House, who decide on our future. The first kind is, those who are not afraid to change at this darkest crisis of the State. The second kind of people are those who are willing, still, to hold on to their dark aspirations and who are power hungry irrespective of the collapse of the State.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. S. Viyalanderan. - [Not in the Chamber.]

Then, the Hon. Naseer Ahamed. [1.52 p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed - Minister of Environment) Hon. Presiding Member, I wish to thank you for giving me the opportunity to participate in this Debate on the Interim Budget for 2022, which is aiming at laying the structural foundation towards creating a new National Economic Policy in line with the prevailing local and global economic realities and emerging trends. It will be transformed into action and processes in the forthcoming Budget for the year 2023. So, in reality, from this moment onwards and for the next 18 to 24 months, Sri Lanka will undergo a period of heightened economic reform which will eventually lead to the formation of a more robust national economy.

Sir, this amendment Bill proposes a 20 per cent increase in expenditure to Rs. 4,672 billion for the year 2022, which is likely to widen the Budget Deficit to 9.9 per cent, although it is lower than the earlier 12 per cent. This situation will compel the Government to introduce strict expenditure controls whilst adopting smart and creative revenue enhancement measures.

In terms of revenue Proposals, the Budget contains Proposals relating to both tax and non-tax revenue with an increase of VAT to 15 per cent as one of the key tax reforms. The Opposition has already started lamenting that the increase of VAT will negate whatever relief given to the poor. This concern will however be addressed by way of directing relief to the specific target sectors and communities so that the overall relief distribution mechanism will be efficient, more productive and recipient-targeted. The Proposals introduced in tax administration are also futuristic. In the area of non-tax revenue, I am happy to note that President Ranil Wickremesinghe has thought it fit to include a Proposal submitted by my Ministry to make the Sri Lankan mineral and mining industry to reach a revenue target of Rs. 2 billion per annum with value addition by attracting joint ventures with advanced technology.

Sir, prudent expenditure management is the key to success in any budget. Measures introduced in that area are very pragmatic and timely. Particularly, the one to consolidate identified local authorities by merging Pradeshiya Sabhas with a municipal or an urban council adjacent to them will result in efficient utilization of resources.

Public sector reforms, as rightfully identified in the Interim Budget, are long overdue. Sri Lanka has more than 1.5 million public sector employees at present, the number having doubled over the past 15 years. The efficiency of the Public Service is low compared to that of our peers in Asia, despite there being a public servant for every 14 citizens. This is a much-needed reform which many governments were reluctant to address effectively. However, with the proposed and ongoing measures, the Government is confident that it will be able to transform the Public Service into a lean and efficient service within a reasonable time frame.

Restructuring of State-owned enterprises - SOEs - is also a major area of concern to any government, which again has been ambitiously taken up in the Interim Budget and which is admirable. It is my view that we need to think afresh about the whole concept and approach to the SOEs and limit the involvement of the Government in them to a bare minimum while strengthening its regulatory role like in many other developing and developed countries. I strongly believe that the Government has no business to being in business. We should leave it in the hands of the private sector whilst strengthening the policy formulating and regulatory functions under the government authorities. Such reform will push Sri Lanka up also in the worlds ease of doing business rankings, resulting in attracting global investors to Sri Lanka.

Even with a huge economic crisis at hand and much of the pressing socio-economic priorities taking centre stage, is it not commendable to offer social welfare to the tune of Rs. 46.6 billion for the next four months' period? In addition, the Budget also proposes a kerosene subsidy, Rs. 133 billion to reduce the impact of the economic crisis on the poor, increasing the monthly Samurdhi allowance from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 7,500 to 1.7 million

1071 1072

Samurdhi beneficiary families, increasing the allowance paid to the elderly, the disabled and the kidney patients to an amount ranging between Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 7,500 et cetera, which will bring a lot of relief and concession to the poor and the marginalized communities in our society. An allocation of US Dollars 110 million - Rs. 40 billion - for the importation of urea for the Maha season will ensure paddy farmers yielding a good harvest, resulting in reduction of the price of rice. In addition, US Dollars 70 million - approximately Rs. 25 billion - is allocated to ensure an uninterrupted supply of domestic gas, which will bring a sigh of relief to many ranging from small businesses to housewives. So, such a huge relief Budget with many social welfare programmes to be implemented during the period of the next four months will undoubtedly bring a lot of relief to the poorer segments of the society, contrary to the false propaganda that is being made by the Opposition by undervaluing the significance of Governments social welfare effort.

One key and significant characteristic in the Interim Budget, 2022 presented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe is the strengthening of the legal framework by introducing new laws, revising the existing laws and regulatory authorities and their functions et cetera. Accordingly, nine new Bills have been proposed to be introduce with another four existing Acts and Ordinances also to be revised. In terms of regulatory and monitoring bodies, a number of such authorities, including an Inspector General for expenditure management similar to the one in the USA, a Parliamentary Committee on Ways and Means, a National Debt Management Agency - NDMA, a National Agency for Public-Private Partnership - NAPPP - et cetera have been proposed to be set up and strengthened with the objective of providing efficient services to all relevant stakeholders in the society. These are very welcomed moves in creating a law-abiding society with a strong legal regime. It is in the same context that I pay my tribute to President Ranil Wickremesinghe for proposing to enact new laws in line with Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code of the United States in order to facilitate business restructuring by getting rid of their indebtedness while staying alive in business. This reform has been under discussion since the early 1990s and was strongly lobbied by trade chambers and the private sector, although it has not seen the light of the day upto now. I am sure that this will make all such stakeholders happy and hopeful of business continuity despite indebtedness.

As I mentioned previously in my speech, the outstanding feature of the Hon. Presidents Policy Statement is his realistic assessment of the economic crisis. He has analysed the deep-rooted causes for the underdevelopment of the economy and the proximate reasons for the current crisis and proposed pragmatic policies. He said pursuing pragmatic economic policies and undertaking economic reforms are vital to become a developed economy.

As I understand, the three pillars of the Presidents strategy are, one, ensuring law and order, two, getting

immediate international assistance and three, bridging finance from friendly countries and international organizations and entering into an International Monetary Fund - IMF - Extended Fund Facility - EFF - undertaking reforms that would stabilize the economy and lay the foundation for economic growth.

The Interim Budget presented within weeks of his Policy Statement shows the quick transformation of his vision into action. The success of this transformation depends a lot on the ability of the Government to implement its programmes. And the response of Parliament to the Hon. President's call to unite would also be significant. As the Hon. President has been repeatedly calling on the Opposition parties to join an all-party Government, the expectation of the people is also the same.

In conclusion, I wish to congratulate President Ranil Wickremesinghe for presenting an exemplary Interim Budget for 2022 with a strong economic reform framework and a plan of action for follow-through towards the forthcoming Budget in 2023. It is the duty and responsibility of all of us as Legislators to stand with the people and support the people-friendly vision and mission of the Hon. President to take our nation in the path of progress, and I appeal to my fellow Parliamentarians to join this national cause and be proud contributors to its inevitable success.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. S. Viyalanderan. You have seven minutes.

Next, the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam. You have 17minutes.

1081 1082

[

2022 02

[2.28 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, I thank you for not cutting too much of my time. From the 18 minutes I had earlier, it is now 17 minutes.

Firstly, I would like to state that the fact that this Interim Budget is being debated under trying circumstances is accepted even by us and that the Government has to take tough decisions if this country is to somehow come out of this crisis is also something we fully recognize. In that respect, the Government managing to come to some sort of understanding with the IMF, albeit conditional on certain performances that must be fulfilled from the Government side, is, I think, an important milestone.

However, Sir, if you look at the statement issued by the representatives of the IMF soon after the conclusion of the negotiations with the Government, one of the things they flagged, which, I think, is extremely important, is that to reduce the impact of the current crisis on the poor and the vulnerable, social spending must be raised by improving the coverage and targeting of social safety-net programmes. What it clearly shows is that in these negotiations, one issue that has been of great concern - I presume both to the Government also as much as to the IMF - was what is going to happen to the very vulnerable because of the reforms that must naturally occur if the country is to come out of the crisis. The worry is that if the vulnerable and the poor are not, in some way, buffered or protected, then they will suffer far worse than what has already occurred.

Now, in that respect, Sir, I would like to focus on the North-East because I do not think anyone in this House will contest the fact that the North-East is probably one of the poorest and the most vulnerable areas of the country, if not the most vulnerable area.

The pauperization of the people of the North and the East did not start with this crisis; the pauperization of the people of the North and the East happened much earlier and has been that way for a considerable number of decades. That, as a result, has been the reason why there is also this ethnic conflict that we speak of. So, under those circumstances, could the people in the North and the East, in some way, be protected and their economy be made to grow - I ask you, Sir, and the Hon. Members Opposite - when you have a strangulating presence, a suffocating presence, an oppressive presence, an occupational presence of the military there, where their ratio is 14:1? For every 14 civilians, you have a military personnel. Out of the 20-odd divisions of the Sri Lanka Army, you have 16 based in the North and the East. Can you just imagine the sort of occupational presence that creates? I ask you one question, Sir, with all honesty. This is a military that the people of the North and the East accused of heinous crimes. The people of the North and the East already feel extremely vulnerable because those who they know committed those crimes live amongst

them. So, quite apart from that oppression and quite apart from that severe trauma, now they have this economic crisis, which has hit trauma beyond speakable limits on them. And, if not for the diaspora and their relatives abroad, those people would have died of starvation long time ago, long before even this crisis commenced. Now, they have to put up with the crisis. So, Sir, the question is whether this Government - the onus is on the Government more than even on the IMF - has, in any way, even under these most trying circumstances, recognized the vulnerability of the people of the North and the East? You have a situation where you get at least 90,000 war widows in the North and East! Can you imagine the impact that will have on the economy of the people of the North and East? But, very unfortunately, Sir, from the statement that the IMF has issued, there does not seem to have been any discussion, any discussion, with regard to restructuring the military.

Today, the military is so huge in its structure that in your last Budget, for defence, you allocated something like 19 per cent in total; for military as well as non-military needs of the defence establishment, it almost came up to 19 per cent. For education and health together, the allocation did not exceed 10 per cent. This time, I think in the Interim Budget, you have increased the allocations for education and health slightly; it is minimal. But, you have also increased the military. I will tell you, when the rupee has devalued to such limits, you are going to end up allocating even more for defence at the next Budget. Otherwise, you cannot sustain your military, you just cannot sustain the hardware. So, even in this crisis, when there is no war and when Sri Lanka does not have any enemies - if it has any enemies, they are the Members of this House because it is they who have destroyed the country, it is they, through their decisions of the last several decades, who have ensured that the peoples economy has been destroyed and nobody else - yet you choose to maintain this most oppressive military. So, I ask you again, how can the economy of a people expand under this suffocating occupational presence of the military? It just cannot.

So, under those circumstances, it is our view that if we are to, in some way, cooperate with the Government, then the Government must start looking at restructuring the military to a point where it is fair on everybody and most importantly, on the most vulnerable and the poor. If you do not do that, then the question is whether your policies are for the few and not for the many because that is certainly how it seems. So, Sir, our view in that regard is, this Interim Budget fails; it fails miserably and it fails because this Government, particularly the President, needs the military. The Government does not have public support; on the contrary, the public want this Government to go home. The public want another mandate; they want another election. If you do not want to face the people and if you do not want to respect democracy and the democratic wish of the people, then you need that military. You need to oppress the people and it is through that oppression that you can sustain yourselves. So, it is our view that this Interim Budget and the Governments policies in general, at no point, will look at the concerns of the people of the North-East because the Government

1083 1084

require the military, if they are to, in some way, survive politically and if they are to survive politically, they need the military to stifle democracy in the South because that is the only way they can sustain their rule. In that sense, again, it is the North-East that is going to be the target repeatedly. So, that is the view we have with regard to this Interim Budget.

Mostly, we expected a very strong leadership coming from the main Opposition party, in particular from the Hon. Leader of the Opposition. I think he has been taking a principled stand on most things. But, I must tell you, Sir, that I was astonished, I was shocked at a statement he made when he spoke on this Interim Budget, where he stated that he condemns the oppression using the military against the protestors, that he condemns the arrests that have been taking place as being undemocratic, all of that he said, but the justification was something so shocking. What he said was that at the rate the Government is using the military to oppress the protestors and arrest them using the PTA and whatnot, the Opposition will not be able to support the Government in Geneva. Who is in Geneva? Who goes to Geneva everyday? Who wants to raise the voice in Geneva? It is the Tamils. Because of the injustice that was committed, the genocide that was committed and the war crimes that were committed, it is we who go to Geneva, it is we who request the international community, "At least you put our issue on the Agenda". The Leader of the Opposition says that he might not be able to support the Government in Geneva because the very same military is also oppressing the protestors today. That is, the Sinhalese. So, "If the Sinhalese are being oppressed, then, of course, we will have to stand on principle, but if only the Tamils are oppressed, then we will stand with you, we will back you and we will support you in Geneva" is what he means. I was astonished because I expected much much more from the Leader of the Opposition. It almost sounds like he is a Member of the Government. That is the logic of the Government. That cannot be the logic of the Hon. Sajith Premadasa nor can it be the logic of a party that broke away from the President and claims that they are different in principle. But sadly, that is a slip that speaks the truth and that is why I say the Tamil people cannot expect anything from this House. Not only this House, but even if this House is dissolved and there is an election, unless people decide on policy that it is enough, unless the people take up that position - when we talk of a system change, we mean a total change, a break from the racist policies that have been followed for the last 75 years - no one who gets elected to this House is going to make that change, Sir. So, it is for that reason that the only hope, the only hope, we have is that, at some point, the people protesting will take up the Tamil issue. They have not done it so far. Tokenism will not do to bring this country together; it has to go far beyond. And, if, at this crisis, we do not begin to transform genuinely and deeply, then we are not going to get out of this crisis. You are going to continue to spend many times more on defence. That is only going to increase expenditure and that is a guzzler of money; it just burns money. It is not going to produce anything towards your economy. Why? Because

you will keep making permanent enemies from within. So, it is that spirit of hope we have, not of the Members of this House, but of the ordinary people who, we again hope, will understand, open their eyes and see that that change must come right across, not only in the South, but for all of us. If it comes for all of us, it means that you must recognize who the Tamils are, who the Muslims are and you must recognize all for us to come together to be the Sri Lanka we would like to call "our home".
