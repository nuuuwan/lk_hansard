( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) . . . He has given the concurrence to proceed. - [Interruption] There is no acting Minister.

() 2 ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Sir, let me ask for a clarification. If a Minister is overseas, is it necessary to appoint another Minister to

overlook the duties of that Minister who is not in Sri Lanka? I recall, when the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera used to go overseas, that I used to act as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. So, is that the normal practice? Has somebody been appointed to look after the duties of the Minister of Finance?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) If there is a Deputy Minister, he might be appointed to cover the Ministers duties. But, there is no Deputy Minister now. The Hon. Minister, as Minister of Finance, is representing the country and is on a special mission on finance and monetary affairs. The Hon. Minister of Energy has sought his concurrence to increase prices and he has given the concurrence; it is available. That is all. . .

The unrest that is experienced in several parts of the country is the result of agitation driven by the anger and frustration of desperate citizens. The people are appealing for relief in order to restore their livelihoods and make ends meet. These protests have to be viewed in the wider context of the country being now declared bankrupt and the serious crises of accountability and governance that the country has experienced in recent years,

We call upon the President and the government to heed the call of the people of this country by allowing an alternate government to take charge of the affairs of this country. While we welcome the admission by the President that wrong policies adopted by his administration have contributed to the current crisis, mere admissions of mistakes will not put things right. The present government has clearly lost its mandate to govern in the eyes of the people.

"The present Government has alearly lost its mandate"; . . :

To ignore and seek to suppress such an unprecedented public outcry and be blind to reality will be another serious folly. A government which has undermined independent institutions and concentrated power in a single institution and mismanaged the economy driving the country to bankruptcy, does not have a moral right to navigate the country out of such a crisis by relying on a mandate achieved in the past.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Hon. Presiding Member, we live in momentous times. For the first time, our people, most specially our youngsters, are beginning to realize the humanity of our people, wherever resident on this Island. They are beginning to realize that the Tamils are not terrorists but human beings; they are beginning to realize that the Muslims are not extremists but human beings; they are beginning to realize that the up-country Tamils are asking for an increase in their daily wages because they are human beings and that the Catholics are not anti-Buddhists but human beings. They are also beginning to realize that scheming politicians and their backboneless slavish, corrupt officials, in order to keep themselves in power and to cover up their dishonest behaviour and the robbing of the assets of the country, have been setting one community against the other, one linguistic group against the other, one religious group against the other and so on, all in the name of religion and patriotism! They had deliberately distorted history, not willing to share the true facts of history with the people at large. They had lied to the extended Sri Lankan community about their real economic situation, which has today bordered on bankruptcy.

You would remember my Maiden Speech on the 20th of August, 2020. I referred to a popular Sinhala saying among villagers: kala kala de, pala pala de; what you sow, you reap. It is as simple as that. If you sow manioc, you could not harvest paddy and vice versa. Politicians are paying for their sins and the people, for their stupidity. It was made out that the minorities were planning and plotting to exterminate the Sinhala Buddhists and the people believed this canard and voted in large numbers for the God-sent deliverer and his parties. Now, they realize that they had been taken for a ride. The Galle Face Green reverberates with their anger and anguish!

But, this is the time for reflection of our past and reassessment of our present in order to ensure that the future would not destroy all of us. We cannot allow our emotions to govern us at this time; we cannot allow our anger to take control and make us act rashly. When taking our steps, we should tread with caution.

No doubt, there are anachronisms among our midst. They have been identified and exposed; they need to go. But what next, if they go? Could the country be stable? Could we all agree on a smooth transfer of powers from the individual to the many, from an Executive Presidency to a Parliamentary democracy? Even if we do, what strategies are there to reverse our downward trend, economically and politically?

I am glad the Government, even at this late hour, has shown an inclusiveness in appointing the experts to advise them on the economic front. That inclusiveness was hitherto missing.

There is some concern shown in the South with regard to the relative calmness shown by the Tamil-speaking people of the North and the East. This should be understandable. For nearly 30 years, the Tamil-speaking community had to continuously face in the North and the East the sorry plight that all communities are undergoing today. It was, in fact, worse. With no fuel, no electricity, no medicines and essential commodities in short supply and sometimes, banned in their areas, they had to grapple with the wrath of the military who were bombing their areas intermittently, if not continuously. They all were terrorists in the eyes of the South, thanks to the effective conditioning carried out by our politicians. They were not human!

After 21st of April, 2020 - today is 21st of April - after Easter Sunday, the Muslims were all extremists, thanks to the effective camouflaging undertaken by the powers who were behind it. The Muslims were not human! My Brother Rishad Bathiudeen a little while ago said that about 300 people are still in prison because of that incident.

All our up-country Tamil brethren who had toiled hard for the economic betterment of this country from pre-Independence days were called saboteurs who were asking for too much like David Copperfield. A mere Rs. 1,000 increase in their wages was looked upon by a large majority of our people as almost sacrilege and the up-country Tamils were not human!

Thanks to our youngsters, the arbitrarily created watertight compartments amidst our multi-ethnic, multi-lingual and multi-religious people have now begun to crumble at the Galle Face Green. There is greater awareness now among the Sinhalese of the plight so far of the Tamils of the North and the East and the up-country as well as of the Muslims in the yesteryears.

It is their erstwhile suffering so far that has brought on this impasse, say many Buddhists who understood the Buddhas teachings.

The Tamil-speaking are not sure if the enlightenment that has engulfed our majority community, especially the youth among them, would be a permanent or a temporary feature. If fuel is available tomorrow, electricity ceases to be cut, medicines are not in short supply and food items come back to the retail shops, would they slide back to their old beliefs is a question that we ask. Would the Tamil-speaking again become non-humans in their assessment? No wonder the North and the East are, today, relatively calm because any regime change in the South is not going to bring them the desired political, economic or social regeneration. So far, our Sinhala Buddhist leaders have strayed away from humanistic considerations from the time of the so-called Independence in 1948 in dealing with the needs and aspirations of the Tamil-speaking people. Would there be a change in perception among the majority community hereafter? If so, our Tamil diaspora could come to the aid of Sri Lanka.

There is no doubt that the powers that be in the South since around 1956 have seen to it that the North does not prosper economically. Due to lack of time, I will not go into details which I am possessed with. But, the fact remains that our areas have not been allowed to develop.

The question foremost in the minds of the Tamils is whether the adversity faced by the South today might improve the lot of the North in the near future. Our Tamils, both local and diasporic, are prepared to get involved in the resuscitation of the countrys finances, if our political and social aspirations are met by the Central Government.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Just give me one more minute, Sir.

We are not asking for separation. We are only asking that the North and the East be recognized, as in the Indo-Lanka Agreement, as the historical habitation of the Tamils, and since the Tamils constitute a people in terms of Article 1 of Part 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, that we be recognized to the right of self-determination as per that Article and we be allowed to freely determine our political status and freely pursue our economic, social and cultural development unhampered by others. By an internationally conducted referendum, the democratic aspirations of the Tamil-speaking people of the North and the East could be ascertained. Hoping our adversity might wake the eyes of our detractors in the near future, let me end this short speech.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera, please. You have six minutes.
