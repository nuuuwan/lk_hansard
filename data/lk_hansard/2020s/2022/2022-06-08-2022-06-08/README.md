To get bridging finance, we need agreement with the IMF both on our arrangements and also in regard to the debt restructuring plan. That is something we are unfamiliar with. So, we have got the services of two consultants. We have got to speed it up especially in regard to the private creditors who have taken the ISBs. I am doing my best; I will do my best to push this forward and ensure that we can get finance by September the latest.

So, we have to work hard and think anew. . . , , , , . , , . , , , , , . , , .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) That, I will ask them and let you know. I have not discussed that. I am focusing not on the full lot, but the World Bank can give us some bridging finance before the others do, and they want agreement with the IMF. Then, regarding political reforms, I will ask them.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Samantha Powers communique and also the US Ambassadors communique mention about political reforms.

[12.42 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Presiding Member, with this Debate on the Statement made by the Hon. Prime Minister yesterday, the Resolutions under the Appropriation Act and the Supplementary Estimate, the country is looking to Parliament today for answers to the unprecedented economic crisis that the country is facing. Each time Parliament meets, people have expectations that there would be some change, some forward movement to resolve this crisis and they are disappointed because this was a Parliament, when it was constituted or soon thereafter, which had a two-thirds support for the Government. With that two-thirds support that they gathered together, they brought an Amendment to the Constitution -the Twentieth Amendment- and strengthened the hands of the President with the powers that were somewhat taken back to Parliament by the Nineteenth Amendment; that was reversed.

Sir, the Presidents own Election Manifesto in 2019, the "Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour", I urge everyone in the country to read. You will laugh dying; you will

actually laugh before you die of hunger, if you read that and compare it to the state that the country is in today. Before I deal with other matters, I would like to point out that in the Manifesto, there is one very specific proposal he had made. It is in pages 36 and 37 of the English version of the Manifesto. In page 37, he very specifically says that the Income tax will be reduced, the Economic Service Charge Tax and the Withholding Tax will be scrapped, a simple Value Added Tax of 8 per cent will be introduced, replacing both the current VAT of 15 per cent and the Nation Building Tax of 2 per cent, the PAYE Tax will be scrapped and the personal income tax will be subject to a ceiling of 15 per cent, a five-year moratorium will be granted on taxes payable by agriculturists, small and medium enterprises and so on. Huge tax reliefs were announced even in his Election Manifesto; it was an election promise. Sir, I would like to table* those two pages - pages 36 and 37 - under Chapter 5 titled "People-centric Economy".

At that time itself, the then Finance Minister of this country, the late Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, specifically addressed those election promises candidate Gotabaya Rajapaksa gave the country at a press conference held on the 19th of October, 2019. What did the then Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera say? He said, If these are implemented, Sri Lanka will become like Lebanon and Venezuela. Unfortunately or fortunately for him - the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera is not with us today - his prediction has come true; his warning has come true. Again on the 30th of October, 2019, he tweeted - it is still there on Twitter and I want to table the Hon. Mangala Samaraweeras tweet made on the 30th of October, 2019 - and said, I quote:

"Gota's tax plan wants to set #Sri Lanka on an Express Train to bankruptcy, default and a Greek style debt-crisis. VAT change alone equivalent to Health, Defence or Pensions budgets. #LKA certainly doesn't need advice from a PR agency conjured 'business community'."

Sir, I am also tabling* the Hon. Mangala Samaraweeras tweet of 30th of October, 2019.

So, one cannot say that there were no warnings. The Finance Minister of the country at that time said this. The Hon. Prime Minister now wants to set up a Parliamentary Budget Office. During the last Parliament, we had that drafted and all that set up, but it was never presented to Parliament. Recently, he asked me for that draft and I have sent it to him. I hope that it is done. One of the tasks of that Parliamentary Budget Office is, for an election, when somebody makes a promise, an election promise, to immediately calculate the impact of that promise and publish a report saying that this is how it will impact on the economy. Unfortunately, we did not have the Parliamentary Budget Office to say it, but nevertheless, the Minister of Finance said it more than once, but voters

257 258

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

were duped. Voters were told there would be a strong country, a strong leader. What do we have today? A strong leader? We need a strong leader to invoke that sentiment amongst the voters. The Easter Sunday Attack was also carried out earlier and voters were duped.

These tax cuts were actually implemented in December, 2019 and that move was the single most reason why we are in this predicament today. I am not saying that that is the only reason, but that was the trigger because it was only after that, beginning April, 2020, that our ratings started falling. When the ratings started falling, the Central Bank, under the Monetary Law, gave confidential reports and I believe it cautioned the Government that we would not be able to borrow anymore. And by July/August, 2020, we were shut out of the international financial markets and that is it; that is what happened. So, the person who is single-handedly responsible for this economic crisis is still the Head of Government;

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] he is still the President.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

Some people are saying, No, no, do not look at the politics. Let that be, deal with the economic crisis". Yes, of course. To deal with the economic crisis, the wrongdoer must be removed! You cannot keep the wrongdoer, the one who is mostly responsible in that chair and deal with the crisis. How can you do that? Why did the Prime Minister resign? Why did the entire Cabinet resign? Why did the Governor of the Central Bank resign? Why did the Secretary to the Treasury resign? Why did all of that happen? Why did, suddenly, 40 to 42 Members who were seated in the Government benches declare themselves to be independent? Now, this is a new vogue. This Parliament no longer consists of a Government side and an Opposition side; this Parliament now consists of independent MPs. A new fashion. Each one stands up and says, I am independent, as if that is some big thing, a virtuous thing. You ought to be independent, anyway. That is another matter. But, our system is that of Government and Opposition. That is why we have an aisle in the centre; that is why our Standing Orders say that we cannot cross that aisle unless we are crossing over, we are changing sides. It does not even say that. It merely says that you cannot cross that aisle. So, this Parliamentary system is one where you have two sides. This Parliamentary system is not one where you have independent MPs. This Parliament has failed if it says, Everybody sitting here is an Independent MP. That is not our system.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have only two more minutes.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Okay, Sir.

So, the President must definitely step down. There might be some interim relief that he has got by the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe running and taking the position of Prime Minister, the one single MP from his party. I mean, where in Parliamentary democracy do you have this kind of Prime Minister, a single MP? From his party, there is only one person. That is, to give relief to the Government that is at sixes and sevens. The President has lost his mandate. The President

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] is a wrongdoer who caused this huge economic calamity. So, he must move, he must step down or he must be removed.

The Parliament also has lost its mandate. Two-thirds you had! What do you have now? Groups within the Government: so-and-sos group, the other persons group, another persons group, all calling themselves independent MPs". So, Parliament has lost its legitimacy; Parliament has lost its mandate. There must be an overhaul of this whole system but before that, Parliament must also be dissolved. It has anyway dissolved into independence; it has been dissolved. I mean, in actual fact, it is dissolved. So, formally, you must dissolve it, at least, now.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you.

So, I say to those out there who think that this is merely playing politics, no, it is not. Until you set this right, you are not going to even begin to address the economic issue. Every institution has told this country that there must be political stability. How do you have political stability with this Parliament of independent MPs? You have no stability at all. We must understand that we are part of a problem now. We are unable to give solutions. People are looking to us for solutions. But, we are not doing that. We are only crying about our houses being burnt, about this and that and the other. We are not giving any solution and we cannot give solutions so long as this kind of political instability continues in this country and every day of delay, I repeat, every day of delay, in establishing stability costs the country several million dollars. So, it must be fixed fast. We are part of the problem. We must say, Yes, we will pass a

259 260

[ .. ]

2022 08

Resolution and request the President to dissolve Parliament.

One of the biggest promises given by the President himself in his last Address to the Nation and also very categorically stated by the Prime Minister is that they will do two things. One is, to bring back the Nineteenth Amendment. The Twentieth Amendment, you brought in with such fanfare. The former Minister of Justice is here and he moved that Bill. Suddenly, he said, No, no, the Twentieth Amendment is bad. Now, we will abandon it; we will repeal it and bring back the Nineteenth Amendment and then, we will start the process of abolishing the Executive Presidency itself". Both the President and the Prime Minister, within the last two weeks, have given the country that assurance. But, where are you now? You cannot even bring back the Nineteenth Amendment.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Some draft was produced and it was discussed with us, the Members of the Opposition and the Party Leaders. Even with all kinds of dilution, still we said, Alright, do it; we will do it. What happened on Monday at the Cabinet Meeting? Nothing has come out. You are unable to give effect even to that promise, to bring in a highly watered-down version of the Nineteenth Amendment! You call it the Twenty First Amendment, but it is not the Twenty First Amendment. The Twenty First Amendment is what the Hon. R.M. Ranjith Madduma Bandara has presented to Parliament. That is a substantial one. Then, at least, give support for that to be passed if you are serious about your promises, if you are unable to finalize a draft and if you have no unanimity in the Cabinet to do that. So, the Cabinet has failed. This Parliament is unable to do anything because there is no one side that could support any reform.

If we are to move from this - I am concluding, Sir - a relief Budget will be most welcome, but we will have to look at it to see what is there in it. We are waiting to see what your draft Amendment to the Constitution is. We will have to wait for it. But, the longer we wait, the more serious the economic crisis would become and the ones who are affected by that are the most ordinary citizens and the poor of this country, and we do not seem to think about them or care about them.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry. You have 15 minutes.

We know for certain that the economy was mismanaged, thus we have to face this situation today. Sir, I am tabling* these proposals and I would like it to be an open document so that anyone could go through it because there are details in it as to how we could achieve economic prosperity.
