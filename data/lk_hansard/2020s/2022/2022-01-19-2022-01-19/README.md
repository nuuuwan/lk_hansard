MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT

PUBLIC SECURITY PROCLAMATION

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) .

ANNOUNCEMENTS

PROPOSALS TO IMPROVE QUALITY OF DEBATES AND

CONDUCT OF MEMBERS ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Prime Minister, Hon. Leader of the Opposition, Hon. Leader of the House, Chief Whips of both the Government and the Opposition, Hon. Ministers and Hon. Members of Parliament, first, let me wish you all a happy, healthy and a productive New Year!

As you all know, last year was a very challenging and a stressful year for all of us. The House was not spared from the COVID-19 disruption that engulfed the whole world. Despite that, we managed to conduct Sessions on matters of importance to the country and pass the Budget for 2022, keeping in line with our responsibilities.

I would like to place on record my heartfelt appreciation and thanks to all the Members of Parliament, all the staff led by the Secretary-General of Parliament, Sergeant-at-Arms, security forces, health authorities and all others who made smooth functioning of Parliament possible during those times.

The year 2022 marks a new beginning and I feel it is appropriate for this House to also make note of it and change some of the things for its betterment.

Once you cross the Bar of the House, you all are considered as Hon. Members of Parliament. That honourable title demands that you speak and behave accordingly, in a respectable manner, which in turn reflect upon the House. That is how I learnt when I entered Parliament. When I first spoke in Parliament, it was after weeks of preparation, reading in the Library and watching and listening to speakers such as the late Hon. Gamini Dissanayake, the Hon. Ranasinghe Premadasa, the Hon. Lalith Athulath Mudali et cetera. As new Members, we wanted to give the best impression of ourselves to the House because it would have been a great shame to do otherwise. But today, a very few Hon. Members prepare for their speeches in advance, use the Library or speak facts. According to the information furnished by the Library, only 330 books had been borrowed by Hon. Members during the year 2021 and 122 of those had been under the title fiction. Ninety four of the borrowed books had been on political science and 27 on sociology.

Only 11 books on economics, five books on science, four books on law, three books on technology, one book

51 52

on education and one book on Sinhala literature had been borrowed by Hon. Members.

For a House of 225 Members, this is embarrassing. This lack of preparation and knowledge on subject matters have led to insults, lies and false allegations with unparliamentary language being part of the speeches and most of the speeches and statements being made to gain political mileage rather than guiding the State. This finally escalates to shameful, unparliamentary conduct.

As the Speaker, it is my responsibility to conduct the House productively and to ensure the rights of all Hon. Members. The House, its Standing Orders and other procedures are designed to facilitate that, taking for granted that its Members will conduct themselves honourably.

All Hon. Members must understand that upholding the dignity of this institution is the most sacred duty of all of us. If people lose faith in this House, that means that they lose faith in democracy. The repercussions of that will be grave for all political parties and citizens of this country. I urge all of you to understand that and have national interest and the interests of all you represent at heart in all matters, putting aside petty political drama inside the House. People of this country are facing grave difficulties and they expect both the Government and the Opposition Members to act responsibly like statesmen and stateswomen.

I earnestly request all of you to help me rebuild the image of this institution and discuss with me how we can achieve that. I expect both Chief Whips especially to act more responsibly and guide their respective sides.

I have drafted the following proposals to improve the quality of the debates and the conduct of Hon. Members, and are for discussion and adoption:

An Independent Research Analysis Office especially tasked with giving the Hon. Members an independent view on the Budget and performances.

Discussions and presentations by sector experts on

topics such as economics, technology, management, leadership, sociology and any other related topic which any Hon. Member can request to be held during evenings after Parliamentary Sittings conclude.

Language and education facilities for Hon.

Members who wish to master different languages or pursue education.

I invite all the Hon.Members to put forward any improvements or corrections to these proposals and to propose better ones to ensure better functioning of the honourable Parliament.

Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, I agree with what you said regarding better functioning of the House and the need to improve

the standards because we are going through the worst crisis we have faced in the last few decades and it is also essential that Parliament gains and maintains the respect of the people. Your proposal especially in regard to having a separate Office for looking at the economy and for its assessment is good, but we must also have an assurance that the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank would make the statistics available to us.

Then, documents relating to other matters, which the Government have, should also be tabled. For instance, recently we found that the Agreement with the New Fortress Energy had not been tabled and we have to get it through courts. If that is done, I would go a bit further and suggest a Code of Conduct which, from time to time, the Party Leaders could see who is maintaining and who is not. So, if we all can agree on a Code of Conduct and to have all these issued discussed with the Hon. Members when they are raised, I would go along with it. I only have to make those comments. I do not think the Party Leaders would disagree on having a Code of Conduct and ensuring that it is followed. Then, privately, you can talk to the Hon. Members who do not follow it.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) The next speaker is the Hon. M.A. Sumanthirian.

Before he starts, will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan to the Chair?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, I propose that the Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan do now take the Chair.

. . Question put, and agreed to. () .

Whereupon THE HON. SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. (DR.) SUREN RAGHAVAN took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The Hon. Speaker reiterated this afternoon the need for an honourable conduct in Parliament in order to build a deeper and a stable democracy and all the Leaders have agreed to that. So, I hope I will get all the support from you to meet such aspirations.

Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran, the Floor is yours. [2.24 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Presiding Member, thank you for the time given to me to say a few words on the Policy Statement made by His Excellency the President yesterday in this House.

When the Party Leaders met last week, there was a long discussion as to the sufficiency of time for this Debate. The Opposition sought more time. We thought the President would actually lay out something that we must debate in this House and that we need more time for it. So, we spent quite a bit of time haggling over the insufficiency of time allotted for this Debate. But, listening to His Excellency the President yesterday, to that listless speech he made in this House, I am convinced that the time allotted is too much. There was no policy that was stated; there was identification of a few issues, but no answers were given and there was nothing by way of a message on the Inauguration of the Second Session of Parliament which Parliament should get excited about and debate for two more days.

Sir, he was right when he identified one issue. He said, I quote:

The most serious challenge we face today in economic management is the current foreign exchange problem.

81 82

[ ]

2022 19

That, we all know. Then, he said, I quote:

Today, we are encountering the climax of a problem for which a number of Governments have failed to provide a lasting solution."

He rightly does not blame just the last Government. He blames a number of previous Governments and if you go back for two more Governments in the past, those were the Governments headed by the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. So, he has squarely laid the blame for the crisis that the country faces today on them - if you take the last 15 years, two-thirds of that was governed by the Government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa - and says that they failed to provide a lasting solution. But, as I said, he identifies the issue, lays the blame on the shoulders of someone else, albeit his own brother, but does not provide a solution or a direction. A Policy Statement of a Government is one that gives a direction, one that points in a particular way to give the people confidence and one that says that this is the path we will tread and this is how we intend tackling this issue.

While he makes the Statement, we are told by text messages that another US Dollars 500 million has been put into our begging bowl. It is like a daily existence now for this country. We are waiting out there holding the bowl and someone has to come and give us the next meal. That is the level to which the countrys finances have come to. We really do not know where our next months supplies are going to come from or what we will pay towards that. When the country is facing such an enormous challenge, all that the President has to say is just that one paragraph, two sentences - one identifies the problem; the other lays the blame on someone elses shoulder.

He started his Policy Statement by rightly identifying the fact that there are different Hon. Members in this House elected by different people with different mandates. So, he said that right at the beginning of his Statement, but as he went along, he probably forgot how he recognized this House because when it came to the people of the North and the East, he said something that was opposite to how he started his Statement and it is very serious. Sir, I quote the President:

We regard Governments prime responsibility towards reconciliation as providing such facilities to these people without discrimination.

This is, talking about the people in the North and the East. It is an insult to the people who have been struggling and fighting for their dignity, to be treated as equals in this country. That is far more important than what he identifies here as facilities. They have not been fighting for facilities. They have been fighting for their equal citizenship right, their right to self-determination, the right for self-rule, for shared powers of governance, and for the President to reduce all of that to a level of saying that there are these basic facilities that are necessary and that is what will bring about reconciliation shows much about what he understands the national problem to be.

Then, he says, I quote;

Therefore, I urge the Members of Parliament representing the people of the North and East in this Parliament to set aside various political ideologies, at least temporarily, and support the

Governments efforts to improve the living conditions of the people in their areas.

Having recognized that we have different mandates from our people, he says, set aside your ideologies, at least temporarily. What does he mean by ideologies? I read the Sinhala and the Tamil texts. It should have been translated as your party policies. Our party policy is the mandate we have received from our people and it is a consistent mandate that we have received, for which we serve our people. We do not listen to others who tell us how we should serve our people. We listen to our people and the mandate that they give us. So, it does not lie in the mouth of even His Excellency the President to tell us to lay aside the mandate that the people had given us and to join in providing basic facilities.

For shortness of time and also because, as I said, this Statement or policy declaration - I do not even want to call it Throne Speech - does not deserve any more time of this august Assembly, I conclude my speech with that.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. (Dr.) Bandula Gunawardana. 1 .
