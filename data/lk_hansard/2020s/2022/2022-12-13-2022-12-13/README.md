, , constitutionality , legitimacy . , follow . whether it is legitimate or not , legitimacy through people's sovereignty; .

( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) Constitutionality legitimacy , Government legitimate Government ; this is, of course, a legitimate Government. You might not agree, you might disagree, but this is a legitimate Government. Also, you may remember that when the President was elected in

903 904

Parliament, you supported one candidate. If that candidate won, what would have been the situation? Then, would it be legitimate?

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. State Minister, what I was trying to say is that - the Parliamentary procedures were followed; the procedures were followed as stipulated in the Constitution - if one said that this administration was legitimate, you had lost that legitimacy through the resignation of the President who received a mandate of 6.9 million votes. That President has gone home; that President was thrown out of power. That was done through peoples power. Please understand that all these powers are subservient to the power of the people of this land. That is why the then Finance Minister had to go home, the then Prime Minister had to go home and the then President had to go home. Do remember, former President His Excellency Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who received a mandate of 6.9 million, had to go home. That is why I say that - Constitutional procedures would have been followed, that is a different matter - you all do not have legitimacy.

( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) , .

, . ; . Also, at the same time, Hon. Leader of the Opposition, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa walked out without killing a single innocent person in this country. But, we have seen in the past that there had been Presidents who remained in power by killing thousands and thousands of innocent youth in this country. So, if you talk about legitimacy, we have a legitimate President and a legitimate Government. On the other hand, Hon. Leader of the Opposition, I do not think your position is also legitimate because you can see that a number of Members who are with you now in the Opposition were never with you then. So, those Hon. Members who were with the President who had a mandate of 6.9 million are now in the Opposition. In that case, you also do not have a legitimate power from the people to sit in that seat.

However, first of all, let us restore this economy. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. State Minister, let us stop this debate now. ( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) The problems you raised now have arisen because our economy is weak. So, let us restore our economy. Then,

we will go for elections and the people can elect whoever they want to rule this country. But, first, let us restore this economy. Hon. Leader of the Opposition, you were offered the responsibility by the former President; you were offered the chance of being appointed as Prime Minister. But, for whatever reasons, you did not accept it. Now, I urge you, please let us restore this economy. People are suffering at the moment. The painful reforms brought in have affected the people of this country. So, let us get together and restore our economy. If the economy is not restored, there would not be people to vote for any of the parties contesting. So, let us restore this economy. Then, we will deal with the rest of the matters you were talking about.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Please stop at that.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. Speaker, I just want to make a correction. You do not "re-store" an economy, you "restore" an economy. I just want to correct that. "Re-store" , . But, you "restore" an economy. - [Interruption

( ) (The Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya) , ,-

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) The other thing is, you asked - [Interruption.] No, I have not finished. Do not cut me off, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) , . (4 .

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. Semasinghe, you asked the question why I did not take the responsibility by becoming the Prime Minister. I did not want to be sworn in front of an illegitimate President rejected by the people. That is the reason; I have explained my position. But, what I am trying to tell you is -

( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) Sir, he is also going to violate the Constitution of this country. You have - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) No, I have never ever violated -

[

2022 1)

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Please stop this debate now. There is no more time for this. Forty-five minutes have already been taken for this. Please stop this. -[Interruption.] You had better stop this.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) So, I do not get a chance to reply. Is it? ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Please, Hon. Leader of the Opposition.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) The State Minister is bigger than the Leader of the Opposition.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Please, stop this. You have taken enough time. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) It does not matter, Hon. Speaker. I know that in the security of the four walls of this House, the Government side thinks that everything is fine, everything is hunky-dory, that all the 22 million people are happy and they are trying to reclaim that they are legitimate.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Please, let us stop there. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Okay. The best way to restore legitimacy is to go for an election.

Hon. Speaker, my father served as a teacher in the Public Service and also in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs under former Ministers of Foreign Affairs, the Hon. A.C.S. Hameed and the Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar. My mother was a housewife. I have two brothers and a sister. One brother is an engineer while the other serves as a Chartered Accountant. After passing the GCE (A/L) Examination in 1994, I entered the Open University of Sri Lanka to pursue an LLB Degree. However, I could not complete the degree due to my entry into active politics. Sir, I consider that those baseless allegations and false accusations will bring disrepute to my parents also, who are no longer living.

(c) If not why?

983 984

) ( - ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed - Minister of Environment) Sir, the Answer is as follows:

(a) (i) The Central Environmental Authority has reported that it is waste water treated in accordance with the standards of the Central Environmental Authority that is released into rivers by the factories in the vicinity of rivers. Several government agencies work in relation to the regulation of activities associated with rivers and the Central Environmental Authority is one such institution. It has been reported that the Central Environmental Authority controls instances of environmental pollution which occur due to industrial activities declared in Gazette Notification No. 2264/18 through the environmental protection licencing system and minimizes the environmental damage that can be caused in implementing projects specified by Gazette Notification No. 772/22 through the environmental impact assessment process. Thus, waste matter/water generated from industrial activities declared by Gazette Notification No. 2264/18 needs to be disposed of in accordance with the specified standards while obtaining an Environmental Protection Licence, for it is a legal requirement. It is necessary in this connection to purify the industrial waste water generated by industrial activities so declared, up to the level declared by standards. The Central Environmental Authority has reported that the waste water thus purified should be released in accordance with the conditions of the Environmental Protection Licence. The Central Environmental Authority has also reported that the waste water generated by factories and purified up to the level of the aforesaid standards are released into rivers/other reservoirs, which is allowed only after looking into the use of the respective river/reservoir and the volume so released.

(ii) The Central Environmental Authority has reported that no Environmental Protection Licences are issued for constructions and they are issued only for industrial activities which operate releasing waste matter/waste water according to the relevant standards. The Central Environmental Authority has reported that approvals for building construction should be obtained from the local authorities and those activities are regulated by the laws and regulations of the respective local authority.

(b) (i) The Central Environmental Authority has

reported that the control of waste matter/waste water discharged by factories is carried out through the Environmental Protection Licensing process. It has also been reported that a method of monitoring industrial activities, for which Environmental Protection Licences are issued, is in operation at the Central Environmental Authority and the Authority takes action to inform the relevant industrial party to rectify the shortcomings in the disposal of waste matter/waste water identified further through the monitoring process and the Authority follows up on the completion of such rectification. (ii) The Central Environmental Authority has reported that a considerable number of factories have been located close to rivers and the details of the industries established in close proximity to rivers in several areas are given below: - 1,200 factories have been identified in the 500-metre buffer zone of the Kelani River within the Districts of Colombo and Gampaha. - 22 factories which generate waste water have been identified in the vicinity of the Nilwala River and the river named Polwathumodara Ganga in the Matara District while seven factories which generate waste water have been identified in the vicinity of the river named Polathu Ganga in the Galle District. - 36 factories generating waste water in the vicinity of the Badulu Oya, Uma Oya and the Mahaweli River in the Badulla District and eight factories generating waste water in the areas close to Kumbukkan Oya, Kirindi Oya and the Walawe Ganga in the Monaragala District have been identified. (iii) The Central Environmental Authority has reported that measures such as cancellation of the Environmental Protection Licence and filing legal action have been taken against factories which dispose of waste matter/waste water into reservoirs associated with rivers, violating relevant standards, criteria and specifications. As such, the Central Environmental Authority has reported that it has taken legal action against nearly 60 factories located close to rivers and that it has made arrangements to file cases against factories which do not comply with the laws and regulations of the Authority.

(c) Does not arise.
