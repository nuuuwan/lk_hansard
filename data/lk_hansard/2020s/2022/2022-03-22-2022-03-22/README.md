Mr. Deputy Speaker, it is with a sense of satisfaction that I present to this House a series of Amendments to the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act. Sir, this is an old Act; it is 43 years old. During that period, there is no question that circumstances in this country and our priorities and objectives have undergone a fundamental change. It is, therefore, necessary to revisit the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, No. 48 of 1979 and to examine the changes that are now opportune in light of the basic social transformations that have taken place in our country during a period of almost half a century.

I want to make it very clear, Sir, that this is an initial step. The Government is engaged in a comprehensive review of security legislation in our country. These are Amendments to an old Act. These Amendments are being brought within the framework of existing legislation. But, we are now preparing a comprehensive legislation. Obviously, Sir, that is going to take some time and this is being done with the active assistance and inputs by various other institutions of the Government. My distinguished Colleague, the Hon. Ali Sabry, Presidents Counsel, Minister of Justice, is very closely associated with this endeavour. There is also a very vigorous input by the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of Justice. We are in close consultation with the Chambers of the Hon. Attorney-General. This work is very much underway, Sir; it has started and it is making progress, but clearly, it is going to take some time. We do not think that it is appropriate for us to keep the country waiting for a long time when there are urgent amendments that should be brought to the 1979 Law. So, all that I am doing today is presenting to this House the urgently required Amendments, and we will, with all vigour, proceed with our efforts to bring before the House in due course the overall legislation, which I referred to.

At the same time, Sir, I want to make it very clear that this is not a cosmetic exercise. Every one of these Amendments which I am proposing to this august Assembly today is substantial; it is going to make a difference. That is true of each one of the Amendments that I am introducing. When you take the Amendments as a whole, in combination, I make bold to say that the cumulative effect of these Amendments is to make a very substantial improvement of the existing law. I will demonstrate to you, Sir, how important each Amendment is, but when you put all together and when you view these Amendments as a whole, I can convince any objective fair-minded person that these Amendments, without any extraneous agenda, will make a profound impact upon the existing laws of this country and that these Amendments will significantly further the cause of human rights and human freedoms in Sri Lanka.

The Supreme Court in its Determination has suggested a few changes. We are accepting those changes, Sir. I will move Committee Stage Amendments accordingly to accommodate these suggestions which have been made by Their Lordships of the Supreme Court in their Determination and once those Amendments are incorporated into this Legislation, the effect of the Ruling by the Supreme Court is that these Amendments can be passed by this Assembly with a simple majority.

779 780

I would like to pose this question to the people who say that this Legislation is an eyewash, that it has no substance or content whatsoever.

Sir, let us look at Clause 8 of this Bill. It states, I quote:

(3) Every trial under this Act shall be held on a day to day basis, ...

It is now compulsory, it is mandatory; these trials must be held from day to day. Does that not make a difference? The existing position in our country is that there can be and there has been, in some cases, unfortunately, an interval as long as six months or nine months between one date of trial and another. This means that the person who is subject to the Detention Order is languishing in custody for unjustifiably long periods because the trial is taking so long. That is the current position. But, it will no longer be the future position. In the future, there is an established norm, an inflexible norm, a mandatory norm and that mandatory norm is, trails from day to day. If that is not going to happen, the High Court must record its reasons. Those reasons must be cogent, compelling reasons; it is part of the record. It is, therefore, public scrutiny and public examination. Today, in particular cases, the Chief Justice of Sri Lanka issues directions to the High Court to say that these trials must be concluded expeditiously, that they must be heard without long intervals. No such direction by the Head of the Judiciary is now necessary. There is no discretion in the matter. There is a rule, a very definite, specific, explicit rule - trials from day to day - and I challenge anybody to put forward a rational argument to the effect that that does not make a difference. It makes a fundamental difference to the existing situation. But, that is only one of the changes that I envisage by this amending Legislation, Sir.

If you would be kind enough to look at Clause 3 of the amending Bill, that incorporates a whole series of steps that must necessarily be taken when a person is taken into custody on the basis of a Detention Order. There is no discretion; the Executive cannot decide whether to comply with these or not. They are embedded in the law as compulsory steps which must be taken in any situation where any person is taken into custody under the aegis of a Detention Order. As soon as a Detention Order is made, a certified copy must be made available to the Magistrate in charge of the area. So, the Magistrate is immediately informed. Now, the law, as I have presented it to this House, states that the Magistrate must be informed within a reasonable period. The Supreme Court, in its Determination, has suggested that that is somewhat vague and they would prefer a specific time frame to be referred to in the law. We agree with that suggestion. So, instead of saying within a reasonable period, we now say within 48 hours. So, within 48 hours, a Magistrate has got to be informed; it is compulsory and absolutely essential.

Sir, that is not all. Once a Magistrate is informed, he cannot do nothing about it. He must get into action; he

must take a series of steps. These are compulsorily required by the law. The Magistrate must visit the person subject to detention, at least, once a month personally. He cannot delegate it to anybody; it is a non-delegable, imperative duty that is imposed by the law on the Magistrate. He must visit the person in detention himself and is personally responsible for ensuring the well-being of the person subject to detention. The whole purpose of that is to make absolutely certain that there is no maltreatment or torture.

The definition of torture, Sir, is also interesting. That definition is contained in Clause 13 of the amending Legislation which I have presented. The definition of torture is that contained in the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhumane Or Degrading Treatment or Punishment Act, No. 22 of 1994, which I presented to this House many, many years ago when I was the then Minister of Justice. The essential element of the definition of torture is that it does not refer only to physical torture, but also mental distress, emotional distress.

So, "torture" has a very expansive definition; it covers the entire ground of human turmoil, and the duty of the Magistrate is to personally visit the person in detention to ensure that torture in this very expanded form is not inflicted upon the detenu. And, surely, that is an important change in the Law.

If the person subject to detention has any complaint to make with regard to maltreatment, the Magistrate shall record his observations on that complaint. So, the person subject to detention has every opportunity of opening out to the Magistrate and making any complaint with regard to the conditions under which he is held. If such a complaint is made, then the Magistrate is required to record his observations on that complaint which happens to be made by the person subject to detention. If there are any indications of torture, the Magistrate has the power to direct that the suspect be brought before a Judicial Medical Officer - a JMO - for medical examination and the JMOs report must be submitted to the Magistrate. So, a JMO will examine the detenu and the JMOs report must be submitted to the Magistrate. Then, it becomes part of the written record in the case. If the JMOs report contains any indication whatsoever of torture, then, medical treatment has to be provided.

What is more, Clause 6(1)(1D) of the Bill, as I presented it, states, "The Magistrate may also direct the Inspector General of Police to commence an investigation into the alleged torture in order to enable the Attorney-General to institute criminal proceedings . It states "may". So, there is an element of discretion there. The Supreme Court has suggested that we substitute the word shall for the word may. We agree with that suggestion and I will be moving a Committee Stage Amendment accordingly. So, this means that the Magistrate has an imperative obligation to inform the Inspector General of Police and the Inspector General of Police, in turn, will bring the matter to the notice of the Attorney-General of the Republic, who will be under the

781 782

[ ( .. ]

2022 22

duty to institute criminal proceedings as expeditiously as possible. So, Sir, these are new changes; these are not features of the existing Law.

Now, I will summarize the main changes. In terms of an Amendment to the Code of Criminal Procedure Act in 2021, the Magistrate has been given the authority to visit persons in detention in police stations only. But, this Law is much wider in scope, that the Magistrate can visit not just a police station, but places of detention, any place where the detenu is held. So, that is a significant change; it is a considerable expansion of the authority of the Magistrate.

At the Committee Stage, Sir, I will move an explicit Amendment which will authorize the Magistrate, on the basis of the report submitted by the Judicial Medical Officer, to order a change of the place of detention of a detenu. If there are indications that the person subject to detention is being badly treated, then he will no longer remain in that same place, he will be sent to a new place and after examining the JMOs report, the Magistrate will have the power to make such a direction. So, to that effect, I will be moving a Committee Stage Amendment this afternoon, Sir.

At the moment, the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, acting under their Statute, can make a direction with regard to the treatment of the person in detention, but it is only a direction, it is only a recommendation. But here, the new Law which I am introducing to this House takes it outside the area of recommendations or directions. Here is judicial authority directly conferred upon the Magistrate and that, too, makes a significant difference on the ground.

There is another very important change that is made by the Law in consequence of these Amendments, Sir, and that has reference to a fundamental right. That is, the right of the person to have the assistance of a counsel, an Attorney-at-Law and the lawyer is entitled to make representations on behalf of the person in detention. That is, in most legal systems in the world, considered a very basic right.

Now, that is not there in that form in the existing Law, as a specific statutory right that is recognized by the Law. True enough, there are some statutory regimes where this is recognized. For example, the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Act, No. 5 of 2018. That Act recognizes the right of a person in detention to have access to a counsel. But, that is in a specific statutory context, limited to situations under that Law. But here, that is no longer the case; this is now a general right. Whenever a person is taken in under a detention order, that person has a right of access to a counsel and the counsel has the right and the duty to make representations on behalf of the person in detention. Sir, Section 260 of the Criminal Procedure Code recognizes such a right. But, that is only in respect of judicial proceedings; that is, when the matter has reached the courts. But, by that time, a great deal of damage may have been done. Now, this law enables the person in detention to have access to a counsel long before his matter reaches the courts. During the

investigation, when interrogation is taking place and long before the matter has reached the courts at all, in that incipient stage, in that preliminary stage where a great deal that is of importance may happen, the dtenu has the right to be guided by the advice of a competent legal counsel.

Today, Sir, if a person in detention wants to have a lawyer, he has to go before the Supreme Court under Article 126 of the Constitution. In other words, he has to bring a Fundamental Rights application. There is no specific right to a counsel. He has to go before the Supreme Court and in proceedings under Article 126, he has to prevail upon or persuade the Supreme Court that this relief is just and proper in the circumstances of his particular case. Hejaaz Hizbullah had to do that. That will no longer be necessary. Hejaaz Hizbullah, today, would not have to go to the Supreme Court and convince the Supreme Court in a Fundamental Rights application that it would be in the interest of justice for him to have access to a counsel. It is now a right that he can demand because it is specifically incorporated into the provisions of the amending law.

There are also other changes, Sir. A person in detention would naturally have the human impulse to get in touch with his relatives.

Whereupon THE HON. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. (DR.) (MS.) HARINI AMARASURIYA took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Please continue, Hon. Minister.

.. ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) I was saying, Madam Chair, that apart from the right of access to a counsel, provision is also made for

783 784

communication with the next of kin, the spouse, the child or maybe a brother of the detenu. That, too, is specifically not recognized as a substantive right under the existing Law.

Clause 5 of the amending Legislation which I am presenting to this House says in so many words, in expressed terms that the person in detention shall have the right to communicate with his relatives. That, again, is a change to the existing law. This is why, Madam Chair, I maintain that every one of these Amendments is significant and substantial, but taken in combination, they certainly make a profound and undeniable difference to the content of the existing law.

Clause 6 has the effect that all these protections which I have enumerated to this august Assembly will apply in the same form in respect of a restriction order. The difference between a detention order and a restriction order is that in terms of a restriction order, the person may be detained in his own house, he does not have to be in remand custody. Even in those circumstances, the authority of the Magistrate or the authority of the Judicial Medical Officer is retained intact.

So, these are changes which are very expansive in the scope of their operation. That is why I maintain credibly and responsibly that these are changes that are important from the stand point of protection of the right of the individual and human freedom in general.

Madam Chair, how can anyone say that this amending law does not make a difference? Section 15(2) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, as it now stands, declares that where an indictment is brought under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, the court shall, in every case, order the remand of such person until the conclusion of the trial. The court has no discretion; if the indictment is brought under the PTA, the court has no discretion. It is bound to remand the person until the conclusion of the trial.

In Hejaaz Hizbullahs case, the Attorney-General of the Republic went to the Court of Appeal, as you are aware, Madam Chair, and told the Court that he has no objection whatsoever to the grant of bail, that he agrees to the grant of bail. But, the High Court of Puttalam said that the Attorney-Generals view really does not matter because the Court does not have jurisdiction. So, jurisdiction is fundamental; it is the root of the law. Therefore, if the High Court does not have jurisdiction, the mere consent of the Attorney-General does not change the situation and notwithstanding the consent of the Attorney-General, the High Court of Puttalam declared that Hejaaz Hizbullah cannot be sent home. What happened next? The matter was taken to the Court of Appeal and it took all the ingenuity and the professional skill of Mr. Romesh De Silva, Presidents Counsel to convince the Court of Appeal that notwithstanding the explicit prohibition, ex-facie the existing law, the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to enlarge Hejaaz Hizbullah on bail and that in the circumstance of the case, it is right and proper to do so. In the course of his submission, Mr.

Romesh De Silva, Presidents Counsel, undoubtedly one of the ablest persons at the Sri Lankan Bar, had to argue that in this context - Section 15(2) of the PTA says that the court "shall" remand - the word shall must be construed as may. There is, of course, a cursus curiae, a whole series of decisions both here and in the United Kingdom that supports the position that in certain statutory contexts, the word shall should be construed as may. Also, the Court of Appeal relied upon Article 138 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka which says that in circumstances of this kind, notwithstanding an explicit provision, the Court of Appeal can act in the interest of justice. So, the point that I am making, Madam Chair, is that all this reasoning is now totally redundant, entirely superfluous, not required at all because we have now provided in black and white that after the effluxion of a certain period of time, after the effluxion of 12 months, the Court will have jurisdiction to enlarge the detenu on bail, to send him home. That is the effect of Clause 10 of the amending legislation which I have the honour to present to this House.

If you do not have that very clear provision, if you leave it to the discretion of the court, the outcome is uncertain. In Hejaaz Hizbullahs case, the High Court said, How can we do this? The Attorney-General may agree, but we cannot do it because we have no jurisdiction. But, in the case of Ahnaf Jazeem - the law is the same; Section 15(2) is identical and it does not change from case to case - there was a practical difference on the ground, that Hejaaz Hizbullahs application was refused while Ahnaf Jazeems was successful. That kind of discrepancy, the result changing from case to case chameleon-like as a result of the exercise of judicial discretion, we think, is unsatisfactory in a matter that touches the heart of human liberty. It is, therefore, necessary for the legislative prescription to be there in the law and that is what we have done, Madam Chair. It is no longer a matter of discretion; the court has discretion and we have said so. The supreme Legislature of this Island now says that that jurisdiction is vested in the court and the court can, in appropriate circumstances, exercise it and grant bail.

Moreover, there is another significant change. Under the existing law or the PTA, as it now stands, once a trial commences, until it is concluded, the High Court Judge is compelled to keep the accused, the suspect, in detention or in remand. That is no longer the case, Madam Chair. After this Amendment is enacted into law, the High Court Judge, even while the proceedings are in progress, has the discretion to grant bail in appropriate cases. Who can say that that does not make a difference?

There is also another important change, Madam Chair. Section 9 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act declares that a detention order cannot be called in question in any proceedings before any court of law, that it cannot be challenged anywhere. It is stated in black and white in Section 9. Section 9 is an ouster clause. But, the counsel arguing for bail will have to argue before the Supreme Court in terms of an application under Article 126 that an ouster clause cannot detract from a fundamental right that is enshrined in the Constitution;

785 786

[ .. ]

2022 22

that is a legal argument. You have an ouster clause prima facie applicable, but the counsel will have to argue that that has no application when it comes to a fundamental right that finds its place among the provisions governing basic rights. So, the result is uncertain. Now, all that uncertainty is removed by Clause 4 of the amending law which is now before the House for consideration because Clause 4 says that the detention order can be challenged by certain names, that it can be challenged by proceedings under Article 126 that refers to fundamental rights or it can be challenged under Article 140 of the Constitution which refers to the writ jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal. Now, the Supreme Court in its Determination has added one more section. Under Article 141, habeas corpus applications can also be brought, notwithstanding the reclusive clause that is contained in Section 9. Habeas corpus, Madam Chair, as you are aware, has a long history in England and in other jurisdictions of the Commonwealth. It is the principle remedy by which the right to freedom is asserted by an individual, however humble. This Amendment, therefore, breaks new ground. It does so in an imaginative way and in a manner which makes a basic difference to the content of the existing law.

There is yet another change. Section 14 of the present law, as it stands, gives the Minister the power to make an order, preventing the person in detention from speaking. Then, he cannot make a statement; he cannot communicate. Clearly, that is an infringement of the right to expression of opinion, the right to freedom of speech. We are taking that provision away altogether. We are not amending it, we are not whittling it down, we are not modifying it, but we are repealing Section 14 of that Law. That is being done by Clause 7 of the amending legislation and I want to particularly point out, Madam Chair, that it has a specific importance with regard to the rights of journalists. Expression is crucial for the work of a journalist and that right is now impregnably protected by the provisions of the amending legislation. Clause 2 of the amending law that I have presented to this House also reduces the permissible period of detention under a detention order. Under the existing law, it is 18 months and now, it is being brought down to 12 months.

Then, I just want to make two points in conclusion, Madam Chair. This Government has taken action under Section 13 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act to appoint a body of three very competent persons, presided over by former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Mr. J.A.N. de Silva. Their task is to identify persons in detention who can be released into the community after proper rehabilitation without any significant detriment to vital interests relating to the security of the community as a whole.

I am happy to tell you, Madam Chair, that under that procedure, we have released, up to now, 81 persons who were languishing in jail, in remand for very long periods. There has been a careful examination of the circumstances of each case, which has been discriminating. And, as a result of that examination by an impartial body of persons with judicial experience and other administrative experience, we have identified as

many as 81 people to be released, who are now tasting the fruits of freedom after a very long period of incarceration and that is due to action taken by the present Government, Madam Chair.

Then, the final point I want to make is that His Excellency President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, in my presence, issued clear directions to the Inspector General of Police and to the armed forces that the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act must be resorted to only in very exceptional circumstances. It cannot be the norm; it is not the rule; it is very much the exception. For example, just because a gun is found in somebodys house, you cannot automatically invoke the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act. The gun may have been there in connection with some personal dispute or some commercial dispute and it does not necessarily follow that the firearm has a nexus with matters that come within the purview of the Prevention of Terrorism Act. So, His Excellency President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has insisted that, in future, the normal provisions of the law, that is, investigations under the Criminal Procedure Code, should be accepted as a norm and it is only in very exceptional cases where there is manifest evidence indicative of some terrorist dimension that recourse to the Prevention of Terrorism Act will be justifiable.

There are people who are clamouring for a moratorium on this law or a total repeal. That is not realistic, Madam Chair, because as you are particularly aware with your knowledge of sociology, throughout human history, all civilizations have grappled with the essential conflict between the deep-seated human desire for physical security, on the one hand, and the devout wish for the enjoyment of human freedom in all its aspects, on the other. This has been a perennial tension through all civilizations - security, on the one hand, and liberty, freedom, on the other. You have to arrive at an equilibrium between these two, a perceptive balance which has to be made in relation to contextual factors, the circumstances that are applicable to a particular society at a particular stage of its development. We cannot, therefore, totally abolish this Legislation. That will not be acceptable to public opinion in this country. There has to be a residue of provisions which enable life and limb to be adequately protected, and it is my humble submission to you, Madam Chair, that this amending legislation strikes a perceptive balance. Having regard to all the changes which have taken place in our country during the last 43 years, we have whittled down the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, diminished its rigidity in a manner that is appropriate to the present stage of development of Sri Lankan society. We have stopped short of abolishing it altogether. That is too extreme a step and it lacks a sense of balance.

Madam Chair, I conclude with those observation and asking all Members of this honourable House, outside politics, outside partisan expressions of opinion and irrespective of party affiliation, to support the Government in this endeavour. This is not political; it is not party politics. The Law has to be changed, but there is a limit to the changes that are permissible. And, I repeat again that this is an initial endeavour and we will proceed

787 788

with all alacrity in the task that we have set ourselves to address comprehensive legislation, not just an amendment to an Act that is 43 years old, but comprehensive new legislation governing security in this country and we will bring that legislation in due course before Parliament.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Just to add to that, Hon. Minister, these amendments that have been suggested by us are in keeping with the Law Commission Report which was prepared by the same lawyers you mentioned - the former Bar Association President, Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva, Presidents Counsel Sanjeeva Jayawardena and Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva. You know about their perceptions about national security. They have always stood by that precept. These are the people who have suggested these amendments. So, why are you reluctant to adopt them? This is what we are asking you.

.. ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Madam Chair, give me just one moment to make a very brief response to the question put to me by the Hon. Rauff Hakeem. The Government has to make a practical appraisal with regard to competing priorities and we have to make an informed decision regarding the steps that can be taken at this time. We honestly feel that this is the maximum we can do now; we cannot go further. We have to carry the public with us. You were in power for five years and I know that honest attempts were made, but those attempts failed because the current was too strong, the groundswell of public opinion was too strong. That is why those efforts did not succeed. So, we do not want the best to be the enemy of the good; the best must not be the enemy of the good. Therefore, let us make a start, let us improve the law by making these changes and as I assured you earlier, we will come up with a comprehensive legislation in due course. I am certainly prepared to give serious consideration to the proposals that were made by the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella at that time. - [Interruption.]

[12.01 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa ) Thank you.

Madam Chair, let me, right at the outset, state that the consistent policy position of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya has always been that Sri Lanka needs a robust, effective national security framework without compromising on human rights and democracy. We have stated our position in June, 2021 in a very public statement and also reiterated that in my letter to the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. So, we firmly believe that this fair balance has to be established.

Madam, the PTA was enacted as a temporary provisions Act for a period of six months in 1979. Yet, this law has remained on Sri Lankas statute books for 43 years. We believe that it is outdated and is a draconian piece of legislation which is not fit for its purpose, the purpose being protecting Sri Lankas national security interests while respecting the constitutional rights of all peoples in Sri Lanka.

The PTA, as it stands right now, has many serious weaknesses and four of them stand out.

Let me elaborate on those four points, if I may. Firstly, long-term detention up to 18 months is permitted without trial under Section 9 (1) of the PTA. Secondly, Section 7(1) dispenses with the requirement to produce a suspect

before a Magistrate within 48 hours, if a detention order is issued. A suspect may, therefore, be kept in custody for 18 months without production before a Magistrate. Thirdly, Section 15 (2) denies bail to the accused once the indictment is served in the High Court. Under Section 16 (1), confessions to police officers are admissible as evidence, thereby incentivising the abuse of suspects in custody. Fourthly, Hon. Minister, the burden of proving that the confession was made under duress falls on the the accused. That is, under Section 16 (2) of the PTA.

Those weaknesses have enabled the persecution of political opponents, journalists, lawyers and human rights activists who pose no actual threat to national security. So, we firmly believe that those Sections of this particular Legislation which causes egregious harm must be amended, must be repealed, and of course, in view of the national security considerations, we also sincerely believe in replacing it. So, it is not a mere repeal that is needed, but repealing and replacing it.

Hon. Minister, let me give you an example. Way back in 2009, do you remember the episode with regard to J.S. Tissanayagam? Do you recollect that? He was convicted solely on a purported confession he gave to the police and not a single shred of evidence other than that was presented in courts. President Barack Obama went to the extent of naming this case on World Press Freedom Day. So, following international pressure, the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa pardoned Tissanayagam in 2010. The act of pardoning itself proved that he was, in reality, never posing a threat to national security. It is a clear-cut, unambiguous example of the PTA being weaponized to target a journalist who was critical of the Government rather than the actual terrorists.

Another example is the arrest and detention of lawyer Hejaaz Hizbullah. Once again, this person, an eminent lawyer, was targeted because he was critical of the Government. May I remind this noble House that Hejaaz Hizbullah was one of the pioneer legal representatives who championed the cause of democracy in appearing on behalf of the legitimate Government at that time - the Yahapalana Government - when you yourselves on the other side of the political aisle used extraconstitutional means and manipulation of the Constitutional procedures to grab governmental power. That was the sole reason why Hejaaz Hizbullah was arrested, victimized and I would go to the extent of saying that he was terrorized. That should not be the case.

Hon. Minister, what should you be doing? You should be going after the brains behind the Easter Sunday attack; you should be going after those terrorists who committed that heinous crime. That is what you should do. But, unfortunately, the authoritarianism that exists within our Sri Lankan polity has induced all of you to get together and embark on a surge of political victimization activities simply using the PTA. So, these examples clearly demonstrate that the PTAs legacies primarily are of abuse and selective application to target dissenting voices.

Hon. Minister, another reason to repeal the draconian aspects of the PTA is that it stands as an insult to Sri

793 794

2022 22

Lankas independent Judiciary. Judicial power cannot be exercised by officials of the Executive. This is a violation of the doctrine of separation of powers. The several weaknesses mentioned earlier, specifically, the impact on the independence of the Judiciary, deprive judicial officers of powers afforded under ordinary law and place undue authority on the Executive branch. That is a violation of Article 4(c) of the Constitution which provides that the judicial power of the people shall be exercised by Parliament through courts. Let me give you several examples. Under ordinary law, under the Evidence Ordinance, a confession may be made only to a magistrate, whereas under the PTA, a confession may be made to a police officer not below the rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police. Under ordinary law, under the Code of Criminal Procedure, a suspect must be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours and in some cases, within 48 hours of arrest. That provision enables a judicial officer to inspect the condition of the suspect and oversee the investigation. But, the PTA strips this power from the Judiciary and deprives it of any meaningful oversight. The proposed new PTA Amendment only enables magistrates to visit places of detention, but that does not guarantee any oversight as it places the onus on magistrates to travel to detention centres rather than on detaining authorities to produce the suspects before the magistrate. It is not practical for magistrates to travel to the detention centres to get a real impression as to how the suspect is being treated. The reason why the ordinary law requires the suspects to be produced in court, before a magistrate is that it is in court and outside the place of detention that suspects may have the ability to inform the magistrate about ill-treatment. Moreover, under ordinary law, under the Bail Act, a trial judge has the power to consider a suspects bail application, whereas under the PTA, the trial judge is stripped of that power. So, Hon. Minister, these provisions reflect undue and totally unconstitutional authority and lack of trust in the competence and capacity of judicial officers to make appropriate decisions. So, I invite you to place your trust in the Sri Lankan Judiciary. We have a unique Judiciary; we have a noble Judiciary; we have an impartial Judiciary. If you agree with my contention, please walk the talk.

None of the aforementioned four issues are addressed within the proposed Amendments to the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) (Amendment) Bill that has been placed on the Order Paper of Parliament. Therefore, the proposed Amendments ought to be rejected in toto and that is our position, the position of the SJB and the SJB Alliance. Previously, the SJB had clearly stated that it does not merely wish to point out the failings of the present Government without offering viable solutions. In this context, the 2016 Proposals of the Sri Lanka Law Commission should be considered as a starting point to repeal and replace the current PTA. The Sri Lanka Law Commission is a body comprising eminent Members of Sri Lankas legal fraternity. The proposals were developed by the Commission, which was chaired by eminent lawyer, Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva with other eminent lawyers such as Manohara de Silva and Sanjeeva Jayawardena. They were all members of this particular body. Their proposals and suggestions are

concise, effective and compatible with international best practices. In these proposals, each of the main weaknesses of the PTA have been addressed. Section 4 (2) of the proposals requires that a suspect be produced before a magistrate within 72 hours of arrest; Section 4(4) gives the authority to the magistrate to decide whether a person should be released on bail, which is entirely in keeping with the doctrine of separation of powers. Moreover, the High Court has the power to grant bail when the suspect is produced before the High Court and even after the trial has begun. Section 5(1) provides that the maximum detention period is 30 days upon a detention order being issued by the Minister, after which the suspect must be produced before the High Court. The High Court has the power to remand the person ino police custody for a further maximum period of 28 days. Section 7 provides that the suspect can make confessions to the magistrate and the magistrate is empowered to satisfy himself about the voluntariness of the confession. Therefore, those proposals can be developed into a simple and precise National Security Act for Sri Lanka which effectively balances national security interests, fights against potential terrorism and exiting terrorism, if it so exists, while ensuring the constitutional rights of all persons including their civil liberties.

Hon. Minister, there was a time when an alternative approach like the Counter Terrorism Bill was adopted, about which I personally had certain reservations precisely because I believe that laws, statues especially with regard to countering terrorism and protecting national security interests have to be precise, nimble and fit for their purposes. I had a contra opinion about the Counter Terrorism Bill; there were serious reservations. In fact, certain aspects of the Counter Terrorism Bill exacerbated and enhanced the shortcomings of the PTA.

Counter-Terrorism and Security Act. I ,certainly, believe that we also should have our own, but its provisions should achieve the objectives, the objectives of promoting national security and preventing terrorism, not victimizing people based on their colour, creed, political ideologies and what they stand for. Human rights activists, civil society activists and media personnel should not be victimized purely because they have opposing opinions.

Moreover, when we talk of terrorism, I think we have to look at the root causes of terrorism - discrimination, economic marginalization, exploitation, exclusion from development, sentiments of victimhood and also lack of political empowerment. These issues must be addressed and should be included in an inclusive human development programme. We should, as a nation, as a country, achieve national security through brotherhood, harmony, preventing discrimination and eradicating racism that uses ethnicity, religion, cast, creed or any other tool to achieve ones political ends.

Lastly, Madam Chair, I would like to make a recommendation specifically with regard to the National Security Council. You know very well that the National Security Council of Sri Lanka has been established under the Public Security Ordinance Regulation No. 1 of 1999. I personally believe that it would not suffice. There is an urgent need for the establishment of a National Security Council, giving it legal authority and legitimacy through an Act of Parliament, through a legislation. You can always emulate the National Security Act of 1947 of the United States; you can always emulate the Civil Contingencies Committee or the so-called Cabinet Office Briefing Room A - COBRA - of the UK, which was established under the 2004 Civil Contingencies Act. Please focus your attention on those aspects, which will promote national security and terrorism prevention measures and methodologies through such Acts.

. . -- . . . . . In fact, you should pay attention to State-sponsored terrorism using the State infrastructure to apprehend people just because they believe in a particular political ideology.

[12.23 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Firstly, since you all have been criticizing the PTA, I put my hand up and say I am one of those who drafted it. It was abused later. But if you did not have that legislation, you may not have fought this war. When we

797 798

[ ]

2022 22

first drafted it we had the LTTE; we had a lot of terrorism where Members, mainly the Members of the TULF, were killed. We brought this in to proscribe the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. But that law was not sufficient because they could say, We did not belong to the LTTE. We had to find a new law and we did. I was one of them - I was the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs when we looked at it. We actually selected Northern Ireland - the instance of terrorism in Northern Ireland which was quite similar to what we had in Sri Lanka - and we brought in the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Whatever people might say, that was necessary at that time and that was in accordance with the law at that time and it was used. I must also admit, in time to come, it was abused. That was the problem.

Then, after 1983, we got a situation where we went beyond the terrorism that you found in Northern Ireland. We were virtually at war. So, we did not bring in new legislation because we had the Emergency Law which was brought in. I mean, basically, we had the same provisions that were in the Defence of the Realm Act they brought in UK for the World War I. The same provisions that were used were really brought in under the Public Security Ordinance. Thereafter, the war went on and the war was over in 2009.

We still retain the PTA. But there were questions whether the PTA was sufficient and also there were abuses of the PTA, which had been mentioned by some of the Hon. Members here - that when the war was over, why the PTA was going on? I also understand that. I think the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran will tell you the difficulty we had of getting people released who had been locked up for 20 years under the PTA. The Hon. Minister of Defence was insisting that there should be clearance by the intelligence agencies and I do not know; I could not understand what the agreements were. Finally, we had to give instructions to release them because there was a question of the Attorney General agreeing to release them.

So we went on. Then we felt that the whole nature of terrorism had changed. At one time, they thought the LTTE was the new threat. No, it was not. After September 11, there was a new type of terrorism and that type of terrorism is what we thought would come into this country. So we thought we should bring in new legislation and I must say the Cabinet agreed at that time to this Counter Terrorism Bill. Now, of course, people can bail out on it; but, everyone was there. If you look at the minutes, there was no dissention on that law. As far as we were concerned, we felt it was necessary. It was drafted both with the help of experts from the UK and the EU, both on the intelligence field and on the legal field. It was covered by both. And then, it went around the embassies, it went around Sri Lankans and we brought it in. Unfortunately, events that came in were such that we could not pass it. You had the 52 days government followed by what happened with the Easter Bombing.

But, what we say in principle is what you need are counter terrorism laws, which look at this present situation and also put in safeguards. I am not saying to

bring in that Bill we made. You all may not like it. But what I am saying is that the PTA even with Amendments is insufficient. What you require is a new counter terrorism law. Kindly get help from the EU and the UK if you want and draft it and bring in a new law. The Amendments are certainly an improvement to the PTA. It strengthens the safeguards, but the approach is not sufficient. I am a one who feels that there is going to be terrorist threats and we have to meet the situation. There are committees, commissions and groups which say that you can meet it under the ordinary situation. No, we cannot meet it under the ordinary situation.

I think, when we were at the Law Faculty, the Hon. Minister and I both studied the famous case of Liversidge vs. Anderson and the dissenting judgment of Lord Atkin. Laws are not silent. It may not be silent; it has to speak the same language in different ways. So, certain suspects have to be taken in, but the safeguards have to be there and those safeguards are built into the Counter Terrorism Laws of Europe. UK has a large number of laws. I think Prevention of Terrorism Law was repealed and there are only two Sections. There was a whole lot in 2001 and now they are trying to bring them into one legislation. That is the way you should do. But, that has to be in todays turns and it is international terrorists; it is not like the LTTE or the IRA or anyone that operated within an area. So, our laws must cover all that. I do not think we have all those provisions. The laws of detaining people were all there. In the new one, you are staying at home and you have the electronic instruments put on you, so you cannot walk around. That really gives more freedom. So that is what we require. Many Members on both sides will disagree what I say. But, I think we have to go ahead with this.

Second part is, having a law is not sufficient. You must have a competent intelligence service and that is the problem we have. I have seen how the intelligence services operate. I have seen the information that has been given. Sometimes they are good; sometimes they are bad. And, we do not have the competence. When we wanted to deal with reducing the period of detention, you would have found that it is they who come and say, do not do it. But you keep people for years. What do you find? I will tell you. I was there when the National Intelligence Bureau was formed. We brought in the Special Branch. Today the Special Branch spend most if its time looking at what the local politicians do, what the Working Committees do here and what the Working Committees do there and what the trade unions do there. You just ask how much of time they spend on it. Okay, have a Special Branch if you what to see what the politicians are doing - we are doing - and have a separate intelligence system. That is lacking. When we were in the government we were always told that LTTE is the threat. That is what happened to us. Despite the fact that some of us took up and I had to increase the focus on terrorism, what was happening with the ISIS, then it became a big story.

I was reading the evidence the other day of the Commission which looked into April bombings and there is this Army Commander who says that I objected to

799 800

them searching women who were wearing hijabs. Yes, I objected. What is the use of searching them? In the UK they did not search them; but they put conditions in France. What has happened? Some teachers heads had been cut off in France. There is no problem in the UK. Basically, he thought that there was a terrorist hiding under the dress of every Muslim woman - you are laughing. But what happened? Finally, who gave the information on the bomb? A woman. If you went to harass the women that would not have come. I was seated there; I know it. It was one woman who saved the situation for us.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) That has been the way. I used to question people in the National Security Council to be sure that they knew what they were saying. You take the two policemen who were killed in the East. What did the Intelligence say? It was the LTTE. There was no LTTE capable of killing, but they insisted. It is because the Hon. Kabir Hashims Secretary gave some information that we got on to this track. So what is wrong is we have no analysis; we are incapable of analyzing. That is the biggest problem in our security system. We cannot analyze.

I remember when I was the Prime Minister in 2003, they said in the East, Karuna was doubling and trebling the number. I think the Hon. Minister knows that. I did not believe it. I asked some of the foreign intelligence agencies and they said, "You cannot double or treble the number." But that went on. We have allowed them to come and go. This is what happened. Finally, there were no numbers and you based a strategy which failed. Is that what you are asking for? There are many shortcomings. The worst is the fact that they cut each other's throats regularly. What you have to prevent in legislation is throat-cutting in the intelligence service before you do anything else. I think this House has to look into this whole system and look at what is the intelligence service that we require.

Look at what happened with the Commission. To begin with, I read the evidence. I go to the library and read the evidence. What some of those officers said at the Commission is not what actually took place. I was there the day the bombs blasted. I know what they told me. The foreign intelligence services said, "You have to professionalize the intelligence services." If you do not bring that in and the new law, both together, you cannot face terrorism. You have to face terrorism.

Look what happened. This House should do an investigation as to why one Member of this House, Hon. Rishad Bathiudeen, was kept in custody. It is a breach of

privilege. Can they answer why they took in Hon. Rishad Bathiudeen? So, that shows the depth. I think we have to inquire into it; it has to be raised. There is no issue. What I find is that actually this is the view that some of our security people have expanded the PTA. No. In my view, you need a new law and you need a new system. I must admit that this really improves the safeguards for the people. But the law by itself does not meet our requirement for a new system where we have to deal especially with terrorism of new type. We will have another type. No one knows what will come in Ukraine once the war is over. We cannot guess. But we need flexibility and the laws. For this reason, I would say that I cannot support this Bill because I think we require a modern intelligence system and modern laws.

Thank you. [.. 21. 4]

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. You have nine minutes.

[12.42 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, for this opportunity to speak on a very important Bill that is before the House today.

The Prevention of Terrorism Act was brought in as a temporary provisions Bill. In fact, the title to the Act even has "(Temporary Provisions)". That is a joke because what was brought in for six months has gone on to live for 43 years! The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe was heard a little while ago to say that at the time it was brought, it was constitutional. No, it was not. The law that he says he helped draft was unconstitutional and the Government of that day knew it. That is why it was brought in as an urgent Bill with the certificate that it will be passed by a two-thirds majority in Parliament. The guarantee of a two-thirds majority was given to court even before the matter was examined by court as an urgent Bill. So, from its very inception, even those who gave birth to it knew that it was an unconstitutional law that they were enacting and they continued to do that. And successive Governments have allowed it to remain, not just merely allowed it to remain, but abused it. It was not that it was necessary at that time and that it was initially used and later abused, but it was abused from day one because the very provisions in that Act are for abuse, not for anything else, not to prevent terrorism.

Because time is short, I am going to recount one or two personal experiences of mine and when I speak on that, I hope it qualifies my declaration under the etiquette of personal involvement in a matter that I speak of. That will illustrate the absurdity of this Law. I have previously mentioned a case, which I will mention again. There was a couple, a husband and wife, who were prosecuted under Section 5 of the Act for failure to give information about a certain person called Babu.. They obtained confessions from this couple. They were people who were threatened and they gave confessions. They were not tortured, but there was a threat of torture - hooks and ropes were brought - and they gave and signed the confession. But, the person named "Babu" who was also arrested, despite severe beatings, did not sign the confession. So, I appeared for this couple when the matter came up. "Babu" had been released because he did not sign the confession. "Babu" came to watch the proceedings of those two persons who were charged for failure to give information about him! That is how absurd this law is. And, what is more? I pleaded guilty on their behalf because they pleaded with me to plead guilty because two years had lapsed, they were in prison, there were three children and no one to look after them. Because of the circumstances, they were given a suspended sentence and they were able to come out after pleading guilty to an offence that they knew very well, we knew very well and the court knew very well that they did not commit.

Then, there is another case of a person whose supposed confession said that he gave food parcels at a particular point in Jaffna to LTTEers.

803 804

On that very day, he was having his appendix removed at Sri Jayewardenapura Hospital. That matter was brought up. The Hon. Tilak Marapana was the Attorney-General. Mr. Mohan Peiris was my senior in the case and we told the prosecutor, Do not embarrass yourself; withdraw the indictment and the indictment was withdrawn. They write up whatever stories they want and get you to sign a confession.

The Hon. Leader of the Opposition mentioned the case of J.S. Tissainayagam. I was the counsel in that case. His supposed confession said in one place - he himself had written it in his own handwriting because he was forced to do that - They offered me money. I said I did not want. In Tamil, it said, . It was written in black ink, but a correction was made in blue ink over that. The letter "", the , "" was changed to "" to say, , which meant, I said I want. In that supposed confession, there were 50 odd other places where he had made corrections in black ink and he has initialed on the side. On this particular point where a different ink was used, there was no initial on the side. The very document was not authentic, but it was on that document that he was found guilty and sentenced to 20 years rigorous imprisonment. That provision still remains! You are not touching that, the most talked about provision in the PTA, the confessions made to police officers being admissible as evidence against that person and even the co-accused, for that matter. That provision still remains; you have not touched it!

Hon. Minister (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, you are embarrassing yourself when you stand up and say that you are reducing the detention period from 18 months to 12 months. I cannot believe that you can do that! Does it make any difference on the ground? No, it does not. Tell me one person who has been released because the 18 months have lapsed. Tell me one person who is going to be released because 12 months are going to be lapsed now. It is not going to make a difference because you have Section 7 of the Act. Before the 12 months lapse, all you have to do is to produce the person before the magistrate and the law stays and will still say, The Magistrate shall remand the person until conclusion of the trial. But, the trial is in the High Court, not in the Magistrate's Court. So, that does not change.

You say that you are providing provision for bail. Yes, it is for the first time that a provision for bail, a right is coming in and I acknowledge that. But, anyway, you have been releasing people on bail even without that. As you yourself said, courts have interpreted now authoritatively that the word shall must be read as may. So, what is this? This is a superfluous thing now and when you bring it in saying that the Court of Appeal can grant bail, your proviso states, Subsequently, the High Court can remand the person. Where in the world do you have a law where the higher court grants bail and subsequently, the lower court can remand the person?

Since time is short, I would like to say that we have started a campaign going countrywide, where people from all walks of life and all ethnicities are calling for the total repeal of the PTA. Listen to the people of this country. We, Tamils, have said this for 30 years or more, maybe, for 40 years. Others have also said it. The JVP suffered under this. When I started my practice, I appeared for many persons who were charged under the PTA in 1989, 1990, 1991 and so on. Now, you are victimizing the Muslim community under this Law. So, all of those people are asking for total repeal of the Act.

We will oppose this Bill even though there is a provision, a legal right for bail because you are using this Amendment to mislead everyone saying, This is some good first step. Let us start here. We will move on and so on. You are pulling wool over the eyes of the world or you are trying to. You will not succeed in that, but you are trying to. Therefore, in order to expose this puerile attempt by the Government to try and show that there is some reform - I told you, Hon. Minister, in Jaffna that if this is reform, you have to change the meaning of the word reform in the dictionary and you did not counter me on that at that point - and to show that it is something which makes no change on the ground, we will be opposing the passage of this Bill today.

[1.15 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Presiding Member, I was listening to the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, Minister of Foreign Affairs, when he prefaced his presentation of this Bill. He said that this is only an initial step. However, he alluded that these are very substantial Amendments and certainly not cosmetic amendments. He also proudly declared that these Amendments break new ground. Given his ability with the Queens language, he was able to pull the wool over the eyes of the entire House by saying various words in trying to describe the effort of this Government, which basically is a woefully inadequate cosmetic exercise and a minimalist approach to change the status quo as far as the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act is concerned. That is why we have decided to vote against this Bill, particularly because this does not serve any purpose for the simple reason that the impact of these Amendments is merely superficial and this is a charade. The Hon. Minister of Justice is here. He will know that all of these Amendments, except for that relating to the reduction of the six months period, have virtually materialized through other means connected with legislative provisions in other Acts of Parliament, constitutional safeguards or judicial interpretation.

So, what are we trying to tell the country and the international community through this effort? This is virtually a puerile attempt to take the focus away from the timely need to totally do away with this draconian piece of legislation from being implemented in this country. Therefore, we are calling, at least, for a moratorium on the Prevention of Terrorism Act. As a prelude, the Hon. Minister had already said that he is prepared to further

consider amendments. There was a robust presentation made by the Leader of the Opposition in defence of our position to oppose this Bill and he was followed by the former Prime Minister, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe. He, too, very clearly articulated from his practical experience the various historical happenings that has impeded the criminal justice system in this country through such faulty legislation which deprives the liberty of the citizens.

Sir, the biggest culprits, as far as I am concerned, are the Police Department and the Attorney-Generals Department. I say this because they are the people who come and tell the Ministers and the Cabinet, You cannot do away with the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act. We must retain all these draconian provisions. Those people have found it to be a very convenient tool to conclude investigations, wrap up investigations as they please and then get promotions.

I dare say this. Without any rigorous and substantial supporting evidence, you are able to succeed in inducing and coercing a suspect and obtain a confession under duress. Most of the time, it is due to the mental trauma and the physical abuse or the torture that these suspects are subjected to. Confessions being admissible and important time-tested safeguards in the Evidence Ordinance being made inapplicable has resulted in serious travesty of justice. In many cases, this has been pointed out by superior courts in this country.

Officers - with an exception of a very few - have resorted to this PTA as a means to get promotions; to show that they are efficient in exposing terrorism. What is more? What the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe said is also very true, that there is so much of intrigue within the officers of our intelligence agencies; one is against the other and therefore, he wants to fix the other. What has happened to Shani Abeysekara, one of our reputed, very efficient investigators? What has happened to former DIG Ravi Seneviratne, another reputed and a very good officer with a lot of integrity? They are all under the scanner of this particular legislation. These are all officers who have served the country with distinction; but now there is a witch-hunt against them using the same legislation. Sir, this is an utter shame!

I would like to say that there are umpteen number of judges who have criticized the variety of manners in which this legislation is being abused. Recent among them, I would like to mention, are Justice Bandula Karunarathna, Justice Janak De Silva and High Court Judge Amal Ranaraja in the Azath Salleys case. They have all pointed out the puerile, very inefficient and deliberate manner in which these provisions are being abused. This has also been pointed out by the young judges who have been bold enough to look at the weaknesses in this legislation. They have pointed out the inefficiencies very clearly.

What happened in the Azath Salleys case? Of course, that was done under the ICCPR Act, but remember, even the PTA contains the similar provision under Section 2(1)(h). It is the usual practice of the AGs Department to use Section 2(1)(h).

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you are making a very valid contribution, but we have to be mindful of time.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I know. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) You have two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Let me say this, Sir.

What happened in the Azath Salleys case is a damn shame! Three of our Members of Parliament went and made a statement. They cherry-picked certain portions of a statement made at a press conference and then tried to bring an indictment against him. I dare say this. I asked the officers in the AGs Department who aided and abetted in creating this indictment and the weakness of it was clearly exposed in the High Court judgment. This is a damn shame! Our institutions have become the tools in the hands of their political masters. This must end, Sir. These issues must be exposed. This is a damn shame!

See what has happened. In every case we find - the Hon. Ranil Wickremesighe has also pointed out how the Easter Sunday investigators had attempted to take the direction of the investigations in a different way because certain intelligence officers were coming there to save the suspects. Finally, they were found to be implicated in the Easter Sunday attacks. These were the very people whom intelligence officers wanted to release. Now they are found to be the culprits of the Easter Sunday attacks. Now the Cardinal has gone to Geneva and the matters have been taken up there. The High Commissioner for Human Rights has, in her statement, asked the Government to look into the possibility of security forces being involved in this entire conspiracy. It has gone to that extent.

Now we resort to this piece of legislation.

With so many years of use, how much has been achieved which has finally contributed to radicalizing people who are held in custody for so many years for no fault of theirs? That is the type of mental trauma that you subject them to. These institutions are plagued with corruption and impunity and they incentivize torture. That is what is happening and I would like to say this, Hon. Presiding Member. Finally, the PTA has shown distrust and also insecurity and has caused human suffering to untold number of people. Therefore, it is time that we totally do away with this draconian piece of legislation and at least a moratorium must be brought to the implementation of the PTA and therefore this Act must be thrown out from the law books of this country.

Thank you.

[2.26 p.m.] . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Let me thank the Chair for giving me this opportunity to speak about a heinous, hideous, barbaric and draconian law in existence in Sri Lanka for the past 43 years. It came in as a Temporary Provisions Act, but it has had a two score and three-year stint thanks to the successive Sri Lankan Governments who preferred their own individual safety than the safety of the people. The provisions of this Act have been conveniently used by successive

Governments to silence their critics and to terrorize their opponents. It has been mostly used against the Tamils and, in recent times, against the Muslims. Many an innocent person had been convicted solely on the basis of uncorroborated confessions made to police officers, which were manufactured by the powers that be.

The very Act which sought to prevent so-called terrorism fanned the flames of hatred and violence. When the State decided that a person must be kept in long custody or detention, it immediately preferred to take that person into custody under the PTA, whether he had committed any offence or not.

Often Judges grant conditional bail to persons detained for long periods without charges or indictments being filed, advising the Police or the Attorney-Generals Department to file cases when they are ready. More often, such cases are not filed. It could only mean that the purpose of the arrest was detention and incarceration of the person rather than any severe act committed by such person. The PTA has been an instrument of repression rather than a mechanism to ensure public security. The powers that be have so far raised the bogey of terrorism and kept this draconian law in the statute books until now. It is high time that the PTA is withdrawn altogether.

Mostly, those taken into custody under the PTA are political prisoners or prisoners of conscience. A political prisoner is a dissident generally, who is critical of agents of governmental authority - military included - or ruling elites. These political prisoners are different from common criminals. Whereas political prisoners are involved in some type of group struggle against the establishment or the ruling elites, common criminals are typically involved in an element of satisfying their self-interests. Political prisoners are those penalized by legal systems and imprisoned by a political regime, not for their violation of the countrys codified laws, but for their thoughts, ideas and actions that have fundamentally challenged the existing power relations. It is the State which identifies individuals as common criminals and so-called "terrorists". Prior to capture, they may have been dissidents, revolutionaries, social reformers, freedom fighters or radical thinkers depending upon the nature of their activities and how their activities were interpreted, but they all become so-called "terrorists" after arrest under the PTA.

The Amendment Bill seeks to give a few cosmetic concessions to those taken into custody under the PTA. It has not examined the crux of its illegality. I say illegal because, in comparison with our regular criminal law, there are provisions in the Prevention of Terrorism Act that go contrary to the basic principles of criminal and evidentiary law. Act No.48 of 1979 permits the conviction of a person purely and solely on his confession made to a police officer. Our regular law forbids the acceptance of confessions made to police officers as evidence. Thus, the Amendment Bill seeks to make cosmetic changes, forgetting that the law itself is

835 836

contrary to the regular law of the country and, therefore, needs to be jettisoned from our statute books. The general civilized law of our country frowns upon the admission as evidence of confessions to police officers due to the danger of confessions being "manufactured" in police stations through physical or mental intimidation. Such admittance by a "politically-motivated law" such as the PTA was contrary to Sri Lankas obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

The danger of relying on an uncorroborated confession lies on the possibility of the matters stated in the confession being found to be factually wrong or erroneous. If we suppose an accused states that he shot and killed person "X" and it later transpires that "X", in fact, is still living, the charge would fail, but the accused would have been found guilty solely on his confession and he would be convicted and sentenced. In the absence of the Act requiring corroboration of the contents of the confession by separate independent evidence essential to find an accused guilty, the PTA must be removed from our statute books; it has no place in a civilized country. I hope all my Colleagues in this august Assembly consider this country civilized.

Therefore, it is appropriate that the PTA as well as the Amendment Bill are withdrawn even at this late stage. If we are interested only in dealing with common criminals, our regular criminal law is more than enough, but if our politicians are interested in saving themselves from the wrath of their voters and cirtics, then they would have to retain such a diabolical law for their own individual safety. But, our politicians would have to realize that the PTA would be an instrument of repression against them in the hands of their successors opposed to them later.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you, Hon. Member. Your time is over.

. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Please give me half a minute, Sir. In their own interest, the present Government, which has so soon earned the wrath of our people, must make sure that the PTA is no more when they leave office. Otherwise, the PTA would boomerang on them. Let us hope the PTA as well as the Amendment Bill would be withdrawn today.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne. You have eight minutes.

[2.32p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member.

Today, in this Debate, we have had many views expressed and something that really surprised me was the former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe putting up his hand and saying that he was also responsible for bringing in the PTA under urgent conditions in 1979. I had no issue with that. He was a young politician and he participated in that process. But what surprised me was that he concluded that with the PTA it was actually possible to reduce terrorism. 1979, 1983, and 1990s! I mean, what are we talking about? Terrorism does not basically go away. We are just formulating laws. Laws are part of a system and terrorism does not go away in that particular way.

The problem we have with the present PTA - if I am to summarize it - is that the term that somebody could be held is extraordinarily long, and the amendment suggests to bring it down. The next problem we have with it is that a person really is not produced before a Magistrate like under the normal law and it is by a Detention Order by the Executive. The third issue we have is it denies bail to the accused even though an indictment has already been there in the High Court and fourthly, it makes confessions to police officers admissible and thereby incentivizing the abuse of those in custody. So, it is very clear that this has been abused in a big way.

Just to give you an idea, according to the data of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, 212 people were arrested under the PTA in 2020 and it was 109 people in 2021. This is what actually the data shows and I will not go into all the data. The well-known cases of how this has been abused are the cases of Rishad Bathiudeen, the arrest of Azath Salley, Hejaaz Hizbullah, then, Ahnaf Jazeem, and with Hejaaz Hizbullah, five others have also been held under the PTA. And also, there are some names which we have talked less about and among them is the high-profile case of Murugupillai Kokulathasan, a freelance Tamil journalist who was arrested in Batticaloa on 28th Novermber, 2020 because of a social media post commemorating civil war-related incidents. He remains in custody. Keerthi Ratnayake, a freelance journalist, was summoned to a police station and arrested on 14th August 2021 and he remains in custody. Ten Tamil-speaking people were arrested for having memorialization events in Batticaloa on 18th May, 2021 and held under the PTA. In Batticaloa, again the police detained 19 people in November, 2020 for allegedly posting online birthday wishes for the late LTTE leader. Well, if these are offences, let us take them under the normal law of the country.

I do not think we should be using a draconian law like the PTA to harass people like this and I think we should look at it under the normal law of the country.

837 838

2022 22

Sir, I am now quoting from a document released by the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka on the 15th of February, 2022 under the signature of the Chairperson Justice Rohini Marasinghe, which states, I quote:

Notwithstanding the amendments already suggested by the government, the HRCSL advocates the complete abolition of the PTA.

The Commission believes that the offence of terrorism should be included in the Penal Code with a new definition for terrorism. It is explicitly for those who threaten or use violence unlawfully to target the civilian population by spreading fear thereof to further a political-ideological or religious cause. The Commission advocates that terrorism should be investigated under the General Law of the country with necessary amendments. The Commission also supports that it is not required to exclude the application of the Evidence Ordinance for the offence of terrorism. The indefinite period of detention violates the Constitution. Deprivation of liberty of a person pending investigation or trial shall not constitute punishment (Art 13(4).

This is the view of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka.

Now, we really need to address this issue. We, the Members of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, are conscious of the importance of national security. The question that really lies before this House is how do we balance the importance of national security with prevention of terrorism. How do we balance this? How do we protect the human rights of people while being conscious of the issues of national security?

What happened when this law was brought in 1979? It was brought in and passed basically under the state of Emergency and there was no reference to the Supreme Court of the country. That is how it was actually passed and it remained in the books for so long without actually being corrected. One fundamental problem with this is that the provisions reflect an undue and totally unconstitutional lack of trust in the competence of the judicial officers in the country. I think we need to rebalance this by focusing on the importance of the judiciary and the judiciary making the decision whether somebody should be held or whether that person should actually be released.

The Samagi Jana Balawegaya is proposing that we take the Law Commission draft prepared in 2016 under the Chairmanship of Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva, who is presently the Chairman of the present Governments constitutional process committee and adapt that as actually the alternative to the existing PTA. So, we are for repealing the existing PTA and then replacing it with the draft prepared in 2016.

I might say this in closing my remarks. I listened carefully to the Hon. Minister and I could not agree with everything he said. For example, he said that there are going to be daily trials. The issue is, before you get to the trials, people are unfairly held for such long periods. I have a long list of them. I cannot read them because of the lack of time. The magistrate going and visiting detention centres is not practical. I am not sure whether the Hon. Minister has visited a prison cell. I have visited the

prisoners in prison cells. I have been to detention centres. It is not practical for a magistrate because he has a load of work to do instead.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Sir, I will conclude with what the Daily Financial Times has stated on the 07th of March, 2022. I quote:

What is needed is a genuine effort in Sri Lanka to address its numerous outstanding human rights issues. In this regard it is time for an emeritus professor of law to learn a few things from a dead fashion designer on how to be a positive instrument of change to advance human rights in Sri Lanka.

Thank you for the time provided. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 24 .

If that is the case, terrorism is no longer something that is regional or local; it is global and transnational.

[2.51 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, I would like to start my intervention by referring to the speech made by Hon. Minister (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, where he made quite a passionate plea, pointing out the fact that these Amendments are proposed to improve the present Act and

explaining particular provisions in the Bill such as day-to-day trials, that the Magistrate can visit detainees in prisons and detention centres and if the Magistrate so feels that there are signs of torture, then, a JMO can be asked to examine the detainee and the various stipulations provided thereafter.

With regard to those two Amendments that he pointed out, trying to make out that those are fairly significant improvements which would, hopefully, lead to a significant shortening of the detention period and also, in some way, deter torture, I would like to say the whole thing lies on whether those Amendments are, in fact, practical. There are provisions already, in the law, in the Constitution. For example, if you take fundamental rights petitions, you have to bring them within one month and then, if I am not mistaken, Hon. Minister, FR matters have to be concluded under the Constitution within a year, but those would not happen. We all know that unless it is an important matter which is in the public eye and has caught the attention of the entire country, these matters get dragged on, not for a year, but for years. If we take day-to-day matters, there have even been trials-at-bar, which ideally should sit day-to-day, but those have shown to be not practical and instead, are almost always observed in the breach. Already, there are provisions for the Magistrates to visit detainees in police stations, but the fact of the matter is that they just do not do that. In reality, they do not have time to do it and even if they do visit them, let us assume that they do, then, we, once again, have to rely on whether our current system is going to be fair, whether our current system has not been corrupted to such an extent that there would not be discrimination.

Sir, the reality is, when Sri Lanka was investigated by the Human Rights Council and the OISL Report came out, the then High Commissioner for Human Rights, Prince Zeid - in fact, he presented the Report to the Human Rights Commission - had a press conference and made an observation. In recommending a hybrid accountability system for Sri Lanka and rejecting a domestic investigatory mechanism, a domestic criminal justice system, he said that because of the ethnic conflict and because law and order and the judicial mechanism in this country have been so corrupted - what he meant by corrupted is along ethnic lines, that there are biases and discrimination so embedded in the whole system - an internal investigation or an internal judicial justice process was not something that is going to be credible. And, that is what we are left with today.

So many Members of the Opposition also spoke. When you speak in terms of national security, what does national mean? Does national mean that it is only for the security of the Sinhalese people? Does national mean that it is only for a certain section or does it, in fact, mean for everybody? If it means for everybody, Sir, then surely it cannot be determined purely on majoritarian terms. Just because a majority of the Members of this House wants something, that surely cannot be national. If national means that there are several identities within that polity, as we say that Sri Lanka is a multinational country, that there are two or more nations in this

843 844

country, then each of those peoples views must also be accepted. So, fundamentally, the question here is that you have violence against the State; no one denies that. You have violence against the State because this State excludes and consistently provides for only a section and rejects the other; there is no inclusiveness.

When we talk of mandates, the North and the East have repeatedly given mandates regarding how they want to see this country. Those mandates have not called for cessation; those mandates have not called for taking up arms. On the contrary, those mandates have consistently asked not to take up arms before. The leaders who have come to this House now and previously have asked the Tamil people to reject not only separation, but also violence and they have asked Members opposite and members from the Sinhala community to include their views also and make this inclusive. That is where you failed. You consistently failed and you are failing even today! So, you keep us out no matter how many times our people have given resounding mandates. I can tell you that the mandates that have been given by the Tamil people in the North and the East with regard to a plurinational country that we want to see, with regard to a federal country that we want to see are far greater and far stronger than the mandate that this present Government has.

When Members who are sitting here, representing such people hit their heads against a brick wall, when members on the ground, our party and our constituency on the ground, consistently get disenfranchised, when their religious places are being stolen from them, when their lands are being stolen from them, when their existence is being denied to them and when the lands they ploughed for decades and decades before the war - because of the war, they got displaced and when they returned, all of a sudden, they were told that those lands are a forest, but people from other ethnicities who do not belong to that area can, in fact, destroy the forest and plough those lands now - are stolen from them, what do you expect them to do? But, that is what is happening even now. When the Hon. Prime Minister visited Jaffna, he had a lot of opposition. That opposition, today, is non-violent; that opposition, today, is trying to get your attention. Despite the fact that they have been destroyed and despite the fact that their own relatives and they have been put behind bars under the PTA, even today, again, they are voicing their opposition. They are voicing it, but in a democratic and a non-violent way. But, how long can you expect them to keep voicing their opposition and hitting their heads on a brick wall?

Sri Lanka has to transform. If Sri Lanka does not transform, then, Sri Lanka will never recover. Today, there is a Tamil diaspora. That diaspora lives, by no stretch of the imagination, in the richest countries in the world. That diaspora together earns more than the Sri Lankan State does. If that diaspora decided to contribute in a constructive way, today, Sri Lanka would not be in this economic mess, but you would rather not have those people coming and contributing in a constructive way.

Why? Because of your racist vision of what Sri Lanka ought to be. If Sri Lanka can be plural, if Sri Lanka can, in fact, say Hey, look, we celebrate our differences!, if you can say that when you go to the North and the East and see people talk differently and behave differently, that it is something good for this country, if you can say, no matter how different the parts of the country are, that we celebrate the difference and we are also united, then, things can change.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member. Please wind up.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I am winding up, Sir. I am telling the Sinhalese people that you have been lied to consistently, you have been lied to about who the Tamils are and you have been lied to with regard to your own leaders' intentions. Today, they have made this country bankrupt, not because of anything else but because of their greed.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) I am sorry, Hon. Member. I have to stop you now.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) So, for Gods sake, open your eyes and transform Sri Lanka to make it inclusive. That is the only way forward.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you may be speaking something very meaningful. If you get more time from the camp of yours, I can allow you. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) People are fighting for their rights; people do want to safeguard their democratic values. Therefore, I urge the Government to look at the history of this country. Hon. Minister, you are a Minister of integrity. So, I would like to conclude my speech asking you and appealing to you to make certain changes. I think everyone who is here is asking for four fundamental changes to this Bill. If the Hon. Minister and the Government are ready to accept those changes, I think we can move forward.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you very much for your contribution. ( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) Sir, please give me one final second. What we really need is a completely different Bill, Sir. So, I hope you can do that in the future.

[3.54 p.m.] ... ( ... - ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry - Minister of Justice) Hon. Presiding Member, first of all, I am thankful to you for providing me an opportunity to take part in this very important Debate.

Listening to the Hon. Members of the Opposition, I was wondering whether we are actually debating the original Act of 1978 or the Amendment Bill. Considering the manner in which criticism has been levelled against us, it is as if we are bringing in a new law for the first time, introducing the PTA. We are not doing that. We are introducing safeguards to the Act in order to address some of the longstanding issues we have identified over a long period of time and which need rectification. Instead of applauding that, instead of saying that there is at least something progressive happening, you just want to bring

it to naught. What is the point in doing that? Let us assume that you would not vote for it and this Bill would not get passed. Then, what happens? The PTA remains as it is now. Is that what you want? I think, over a period of time, we have been so divided in this House on this issue, that no one could see what is positive or negative other than our party affiliations and political ambitions.

The Hon. Leader of the Opposition made an empathetic, passionate speech, asking to withdraw the entirety of the PTA. May I now bring to your attention an article which appeared in the "The Sunday Times" of last week and which reminded the Leader of the Opposition about a "U" turn on the PTA. About the previous Government's Counter Terrorism Bill, this is what The Sunday Times states, I quote:

In Sri Lankan politics, changing party colours often or making U turns on critical policies for ones own political convenience is not something new when the ultimate goal is securing votes and retaining your seat. It could be one of the reasons why we have had only a handful of statespersons and plentiful of run-of-the-mill politicians in our recent political history.

One such complete U turn was witnessed this week when Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa declared in a letter to Tamil National Alliance (TNA) spokesperson M. A. Sumanthiran stating that the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, No. 48 of 1979 (PTA) should be abolished completely without tinkering with the law and only making amendments to the substantive law.

It further states, I quote:

"Not so long ago, addressing a rally in Ampara weeks after the Easter Sunday attacks in 2019, Mr. Premadasa, who was then Housing Construction and Cultural Affairs Minister reiterated that the PTA must be strengthened while suggesting that the then Yahapalanaya (Good Governance) Administration in which he was a fairly prominent member should suspend the reforming process ....."

That reforming process, you were leading, Hon. Presiding Member.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes, I was the Chair. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry)

....of the law by replacing the PTA with a Counter Terrorism Act (CTA).

So, this kind of political bargaining, we should forget. We are not here to do that. We sincerely believe that some progress has to be made and we are making that progress. I would not speak just for the sake of speaking. So, I table* that article in "The Sunday Times.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Sir I rise to a point of Order.

863 864

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Eran Wickramaratne, what is the point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) The Hon. Minister referred to the Leader of the Opposition and said that he had asked for the repeal of the PTA. That is only half the story. He asked for the repeal and replacement of the PTA by the Law Commission draft on counter terrorism. That is the full picture.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) No, that is not the full picture. What you say is correct. But, what I am saying is, in the past, when he was the Minister of Housing and when the Counter Terrorism Bill was brought in, he said that the PTA should be strengthened. - [Interruption] Yes. That is what I am saying. So, what is your problem now? - [Interruption] That is exactly what we are saying. We are inviting you - [Interruption]. Exactly.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Speaker will now take the Chair.

.

, , .

Whereupon THE HON. MAYANTHA DISSANAYAKE left the Chair and THE HON. DEPUTY SPEAKER took the Chair.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I think this is a very important first step. As a lawyer, I totally agree with the argument that separation of power is very important. In separation of power, the Executive powers, the legislative powers and the judicial powers should be separated. No one can assume the role of the judge and keep somebody in detention forever. However, all jurisdictions including the USA, the EU, India and Singapore, you name anyone, have certain safeguards to protect their national interests. So, we need to have a very important law to protect our national security while safeguarding the rights of the innocent and the people who have been detained under this Law.

But, there are no two words that this law has been misused and abused over a long period of time. So, there

have to be safeguards; those safeguards are necessary. While those safeguards are necessary, it is also important that we have sufficient counter terrorism laws in the event of extremism which borders terrorism, to quickly quell that. Otherwise, the entire public will suffer. We have seen, when the LTTE was running riot, the whole country suffering from it, mostly the Tamil community. It is their youth who were rounded up and taken away in the night by the LTTE to forcibly conscript. Recently, when I went to Kilinochchi, I met five parents of some missing persons. When I spoke to them, all of them said that the missing were 13 or 14 when they were taken. They used the word "Iyakkam" and said that they came and took the youth away and after the war, they went missing. Now, they want to reclaim them. As Lord Buddha had very clearly preached, violence is not a solution to anything. Hatred does not cease by hatred. Hatred has to be ceased by love and tolerance. So, we need to go back to our drawing board and try to make people keep in touch with others.

I agree with you all that we need to bring in a substantial amendment to this Law. As the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs very correctly pointed out in the morning, we are in the process of doing that. This is the first step, a progressive step. What are the benefits of this? We have reduced the period of detention from 18 months to 12 months. Also, we have specifically admitted that any member of the public in this country who is detained have the right to go the Court of Appeal and to the Supreme Court and challenge his detention. That right is specifically given. Apart from that, for the first time, as a right, the people who have been detained for more than one year can go to court and ask for bail, whether the other side, the Attorney-General, consents it or not. We have taken that discretion away from the Executive and given it to the court so that the court can look into it.

Furthermore, I must also mention about a progressive step that we have taken. About eight months ago, after 31 years, we established an Advisory Committee under the PTA. We appointed former Chief Justice Asoka de Silva as Chairman - the President himself appointed him - and two others. That Committee has looked into the detentions and released almost 81 people who have been detained for a long time. Those are positive developments. No one can deny those things and we must say that we have been looking into these issues. Most of you all have made so many representations; we make representations all the time. The President himself had very clearly instructed not to use the PTA unless absolutely necessary, but only in matters that are connected to terrorism, as a result of which the IGP had sent out a circular in September, 2021 - that is what I referred to, Hon. Presiding Member - instructing not to use the PTA indiscriminately for the kind of offences which the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne and the other Hon. Members of Parliament referred to.

So, as a result, since September, 2021, there has been a de facto moratorium on the use of the PTA on offences other than those which have a direct involvement with terrorism. Therefore, these are progressive steps made in that regard.

865 866

2022 22

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) That is exactly what I am coming to. Hon. Sumanthiran, we are doing it now; as a result of that, we are bringing in a new Amendment today.

Now, let us assume that this Amendment is defeated. Then, will you be in a better position or a worse position? That is what I am asking. As a result of this Amendment, the Magistrate is forced to oversee their detention; he is asked to visit the detainees and there is a necessity to produce the suspects before a Magistrate within 48 hours.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) If it is defeated, you will be forced to bring in a proper amendment.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) That is exactly what you did for the last five years. During the "Y ahapalana" Government, you were almost acting as the Deputy Prime Minister. Were you able to get anything before Parliament? Nothing was brought in, not even a comma was changed.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You do not know how to do it. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) No, we are doing it. - [Interruption] Hon. Sumanthinran, we are doing it. This is the first step.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) This is eyewash. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) What is eyewash? It is eyewash for you. You do not want this to be passed because you want to go and canvass it in the international arena and say, Nothing is happening. -[Interruption.] No, it is the other way round. We will do it; we will also bring in a new Act. I am telling you, as the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs said, we will change it, bring in a new Act and that will be a balanced Act. I want your support on that; we all want your support. So, we will find a way to have a balanced mechanism and bring in a new legislation. Everyone knows that all countries have counter terrorism legislations and we also need one. So, there is unanimity in that regard. We all agree that there has to be some supervision by the Judiciary. With that also, we agree. So, we will reach that goal. We will immediately start the

867 868

Apart from that, one other important Amendment is that - the Supreme Court has also suggested that - within 48 hours, the Magistrate has to be informed, and also the Magistrate is given the power to go and visit the detainee and he will have to. The Amendment states shall, not may and it is a responsibility on the part of the Magistrate. Then, it is further proposed to hear the cases on a day-to-day basis. Up to now, it has been up to the Chief Justice to direct that and then only it takes place. Now, it is a duty cast upon the Judge to hear it on a day-to-day basis. After one year of detention, if the cases are still not filed, as a right, the detainees can make applications for them to be released on bail. So, this is not a simple progress; this is actual, substantial progress. These have been introduced in order to safeguard the peoples rights and their liberty because we believe in all that.

Considering the kind of attacks which happened in the past - maybe, the JVP uprising in 1987-89, the LTTE activities and also the post-Easter Sunday attacks - some sort of a national security law is important for the country. So, we are not, even at the behest of the international community or otherwise, going to totally remove our existing anti-terrorism laws without having some other legislation which is current, important and balanced in place. Therefore, we will work on that. We understand that terrorism has different faces. Now, things have changed. Terrorism is no longer something that controls a territory or carry out guerilla attacks, but something more than that. It is the use of cyberspace; it is brainwashing; it is the use of political power; it is money transferring or money laundering. So, in order to meet these serious challenges, we need to introduce a new law. We will do that, but in the meantime, it is equally important that no one is given the power to abuse this.

I agree with the Members on both sides of the divide who mentioned how these confessions were used in order to punish or detain innocent people. One of the two most recent examples is, in Vavunathivu, two people were arrested for the murder of police officers there. They were arrested on a confession and it was said that the LTTE was involved. But after that, it was realized that, actually, Sahran and his clan were involved in that. So, until such time, on a confession, they were detained. Then, the other recent incident is, another person from Trincomalee was arrested and detained over something that happened in the Lanka Hospitals, where a bomb was planted. But, after the incident where a bomb was discovered in a church, it was found that those poor fellows have nothing to do with it. So, it is true that this Law has been abused. There are no two words about that. So, we need to have -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Minister, having said all of that, you are not proving the confession.

process and find a way so that we all can be happy about that.

I am not going to take much more time, Sir. What we are saying is that this is an honest and a long-drawn attempt to have a comprehensive new legislation which would replace the existing Law with sufficient safeguards both in relation to the State as well as to protect the liberty of the detainees. In that light, this is a step in the right direction. Sir, I do not know whether the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran was here, there has been clear progress during the last eight to12 months in this direction. Firstly, we went to the Cabinet and got its sanction to amend it. Secondly, I personally wrote to His Excellency the President on the advice of the Hon. Attorney-General to establish an Advisory Committee so that the people who have been detained unfairly will be provided with a mechanism to apply and get their cases reviewed. That mechanism is in operation. The former Chief Justice His Lordship Asoka De Silva is chairing that Committee. That mechanism is also working. As a result of this mechanism, we have been able to provide relief to at least 81 people detained. So, this is progress we have made. Then, I was explaining, Sir, that there has been a de facto moratorium on the use of this Act since September, 2021, relating to which the IGP had sent out a circular instructing not to use the PTA on offences other than those specifically related to terrorism, as a result of which it has not been used.

Sir, the next step we have been discussing now is the new law or the amendment coming in. So, there is a clear progress, as of now. Then, the other thing is our duty. We do not treat our citizens differently. For me, whether they are Muslims, Tamils or Sinhalese, there is no difference. For me, all are human beings. We need to treat all of them equally. We belief in that. As lawyers, we have been trained and treating like that. Article 12 (1) of the Constitution is in front of our eyes. That is always the most cherished Article in the Constitution. So, we believe in that. We will work towards it and will introduce a comprehensive new Act. As the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs said, we all will work together and find a solution for this long-standing issue.

Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I would like to have a clarification from the Hon. Minister.

It is good that you want to have some judicial supervision over Executive action. But as it obtains in some Commonwealth countries, to check the abuse of such legislation, why do you not have some Parliamentary supervision as well, when you are considering some new amendments?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) We will discuss that. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . .

[.. (.2(] ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) .

When the Hon. Minister of Justice asked us why we could not applaud the amendments that they are bringing in today, instead of applauding, I was appalled - not applaud but appalled - at the position that the Hon. Minister of Justice took in trying to justify the amendments that they are bringing in today. He said it was a start and he apparently is of the belief that these are superfluous amendments because some of the laws that were introduced subsequent to the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, have in fact erased some of the positions that were originally included in it. For instance, in giving bail and so on. What he was first saying looked like that we are debating the original Act of 1979 as opposed to the amendments.

The others spoke about the way in which that Act was brought in within 24 hours as an urgent Bill. The Hon. Minister of Justice seems to have forgotten that with the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution, the ability for the Government to bring in an urgent Bill was removed and you, yourself, by the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution reversed it. Now again, you have the ability to bring in urgent Bills. So, it is appalling that you are asking us as to why we are not applauding your position.

Since the Hon. Members in the Opposition have, in detail, explained why we are not in favour of these amendments, I am not going to take time to dwell on it further. But, something that you told just now struck me, Hon. Minister. You said, "It does not matter whether the person is Sinhalese, Tamil or Muslim. For me, every person is a human being."

871 872

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) .. .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Deputy Speaker, in my speech, I just said that the laws in this country are never implemented and that is a part of the problem with these amendments. The Presidential Task Force for One Country, One Law has written to me - a Tamil Member of Parliament - in Sinhala. To the best of my knowledge, I think, we are in a country that says that Tamil is also an Official Language. But this is the law. This is the way this country behaves.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . . [4.23p.m.] .. ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Mr. Deputy Speaker, we have had a rich and rewarding Debate throughout the day in which various points of view have been expressed by Hon. Members on both sides of the House. I would like to express my genuine appreciation to all of them and also to the Ministers and the officials who worked very hard on this legislation in the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Defence and the Attorney-Generals Department.

The Hon. Leader of the Opposition used strong language to denounce the present Prevention of Terrorism Act. I agree with him. He used words like, outdated and draconian. He said that there are many serious weaknesses. I am quoting the exact phrase that he used; he said, There are many serious weaknesses in this legislation. And that is why, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we have brought in these immediate amendments, urgent amendments, to rectify the situation to a large extent. I have indicated succinctly the main areas in which these amendments will have operation: the increased authority of Magistrates and Judicial Medical Officers, day-to-day trials, access to counsel, communication with the next of kin or other close relative, the virtual repeal of Section 15(2) of the PTA which denies bail in all circumstances - "shall remand" - the court is forced to remand. That is no longer the case. That itself is a very significant amendment. Then, Section 9, which says that the Detention Order shall not be called in question in any proceedings whatsoever. We are making an explicit exception in respect of fundamental rights jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, the writ jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal and habeas corpus applications. So, all of these represent significant changes in the law.

I would like to reiterate what my Colleague, the Hon. Minister of Justice said. These are urgent amendments. We do not want to postpone these until the overall exercise is completed. The House will agree that that is a complex exercise. It is going to take some time but I can assure the Hon. Members of the House that the suggestions that you made will be taken fully into account when we bring before this House a complete legislation dealing with national security in the country. That will be a fresh point of departure, that will completely be a new Statute and it will not take the form of amendments to existing legislation.

The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, the Chief Opposition Whip, has submitted a series of amendments. I was just saying that we have received the amendments that you have presented. I would like to tell my Friend that we are not in a position to accept those amendments right now. But, I assure you that we will study these very carefully, genuinely, not superficially and we will do our best to extract from those amendments, the substance that you are proposing and all of that will be taken into account when we complete the exercise that we have already embarked upon: that is the comprehensive legislation.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) - ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) The amendments I submitted are not only the amendments of the SJB. We have had discussions with all parties and with human rights organizations and those are in line with committee headed by Presidents Counsel Romesh De Silva.

.. ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) So, all the more reason, Hon. Kiriella, to reflect seriously on the content of those amendments, we are certainly happy to do that when we bring before you the complete overall legislation. So, may I thank the House for the cooperation that was extended to us. I have no doubt that this is going to make a definite change in the law. It is going to make a difference on the ground. If the law remains exactly as it is, the position will be far worse than what it would be. These amendments will have be enacted into law and I, therefore, ask all Members of the House, irrespective of party affiliation, to extend their unqualified support to these amendments.

I thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker.
