It is, therefore, necessary to revisit the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, No. 48 of 1979 and to examine the changes that are now opportune in light of the basic social transformations that have taken place in our country during a period of almost half a century.",

Obviously, Sir, that is going to take some time and this is being done with the active assistance and inputs by various other institutions of the Government. My distinguished Colleague, the Hon. Ali Sabry, Presidents Counsel, Minister of Justice, is very closely associated with this endeavour. There is also a very vigorous input by the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of Justice. We are in close consultation with the Chambers of the Hon. Attorney-General. This work is very much underway, Sir; it has started and it is making progress, but clearly, it is going to take some time. We do not think that it is appropriate for us to keep the country waiting for a long time when there are urgent amendments that should be brought to the 1979 Law. So, all that I am doing today is presenting to this House the urgently required Amendments, and we will, with all vigour, proceed with our efforts to bring before the House in due course the overall legislation, which I referred to.",

This means that the person who is subject to the Detention Order is languishing in custody for unjustifiably long periods because the trial is taking so long. That is the current position. But, it will no longer be the future position. In the future, there is an established norm, an inflexible norm, a mandatory norm and that mandatory norm is, trails from day to day. If that is not going to happen, the High Court must record its reasons. Those reasons must be cogent, compelling reasons; it is part of the record. It is, therefore, public scrutiny and public examination. Today, in particular cases, the Chief Justice of Sri Lanka issues directions to the High Court to say that these trials must be concluded expeditiously, that they must be heard without long intervals. No such direction by the Head of the Judiciary is now necessary. There is no discretion in the matter. There is a rule, a very definite, specific, explicit rule - trials from day to day - and I challenge anybody to put forward a rational argument to the effect that that does not make a difference. It makes a fundamental difference to the existing situation. But, that is only one of the changes that I envisage by this amending Legislation, Sir.",

They are embedded in the law as compulsory steps which must be taken in any situation where any person is taken into custody under the aegis of a Detention Order. As soon as a Detention Order is made, a certified copy must be made available to the Magistrate in charge of the area. So, the Magistrate is immediately informed. Now, the law, as I have presented it to this House, states that the Magistrate must be informed within a reasonable period. The Supreme Court, in its Determination, has suggested that that is somewhat vague and they would prefer a specific time frame to be referred to in the law. We agree with that suggestion. So, instead of saying within a reasonable period, we now say within 48 hours. So, within 48 hours, a Magistrate has got to be informed; it is compulsory and absolutely essential.",

The matter was taken to the Court of Appeal and it took all the ingenuity and the professional skill of Mr. Romesh De Silva, Presidents Counsel to convince the Court of Appeal that notwithstanding the explicit prohibition, ex-facie the existing law, the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to enlarge Hejaaz Hizbullah on bail and that in the circumstance of the case, it is right and proper to do so. In the course of his submission, Mr.",

    "text": "Romesh De Silva, Presidents Counsel, undoubtedly one of the ablest persons at the Sri Lankan Bar, had to argue that in this context - Section 15(2) of the PTA says that the court \"shall\" remand - the word shall must be construed as may. There is, of course, a cursus curiae, a whole series of decisions both here and in the United Kingdom that supports the position that in certain statutory contexts, the word shall should be construed as may. Also, the Court of Appeal relied upon Article 138 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka which says that in circumstances of this kind, notwithstanding an explicit provision, the Court of Appeal can act in the interest of justice. So, the point that I am making, Madam Chair, is that all this reasoning is now totally redundant, entirely superfluous, not required at all because we have now provided in black and white that after the effluxion of a certain period of time, after the effluxion of 12 months, the Court will have jurisdiction to enlarge the detenu on bail, to send him home. That is the effect of Clause 10 of the amending legislation which I have the honour to present to this House.",

In Hejaaz Hizbullahs case, the High Court said, How can we do this? The Attorney-General may agree, but we cannot do it because we have no jurisdiction. But, in the case of Ahnaf Jazeem - the law is the same; Section 15(2) is identical and it does not change from case to case - there was a practical difference on the ground, that Hejaaz Hizbullahs application was refused while Ahnaf Jazeems was successful. That kind of discrepancy, the result changing from case to case chameleon-like as a result of the exercise of judicial discretion, we think, is unsatisfactory in a matter that touches the heart of human liberty. It is, therefore, necessary for the legislative prescription to be there in the law and that is what we have done, Madam Chair. It is no longer a matter of discretion; the court has discretion and we have said so. The supreme Legislature of this Island now says that that jurisdiction is vested in the court and the court can, in appropriate circumstances, exercise it and grant bail.",

You have an ouster clause prima facie applicable, but the counsel will have to argue that that has no application when it comes to a fundamental right that finds its place among the provisions governing basic rights. So, the result is uncertain. Now, all that uncertainty is removed by Clause 4 of the amending law which is now before the House for consideration because Clause 4 says that the detention order can be challenged by certain names, that it can be challenged by proceedings under Article 126 that refers to fundamental rights or it can be challenged under Article 140 of the Constitution which refers to the writ jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal. Now, the Supreme Court in its Determination has added one more section. Under Article 141, habeas corpus applications can also be brought, notwithstanding the reclusive clause that is contained in Section 9. Habeas corpus, Madam Chair, as you are aware, has a long history in England and in other jurisdictions of the Commonwealth. It is the principle remedy by which the right to freedom is asserted by an individual, however humble. This Amendment, therefore, breaks new ground. It does so in an imaginative way and in a manner which makes a basic difference to the content of the existing law.",

It cannot be the norm; it is not the rule; it is very much the exception. For example, just because a gun is found in somebodys house, you cannot automatically invoke the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act. The gun may have been there in connection with some personal dispute or some commercial dispute and it does not necessarily follow that the firearm has a nexus with matters that come within the purview of the Prevention of Terrorism Act. So, His Excellency President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has insisted that, in future, the normal provisions of the law, that is, investigations under the Criminal Procedure Code, should be accepted as a norm and it is only in very exceptional cases where there is manifest evidence indicative of some terrorist dimension that recourse to the Prevention of Terrorism Act will be justifiable.",

That is not realistic, Madam Chair, because as you are particularly aware with your knowledge of sociology, throughout human history, all civilizations have grappled with the essential conflict between the deep-seated human desire for physical security, on the one hand, and the devout wish for the enjoyment of human freedom in all its aspects, on the other. This has been a perennial tension through all civilizations - security, on the one hand, and liberty, freedom, on the other. You have to arrive at an equilibrium between these two, a perceptive balance which has to be made in relation to contextual factors, the circumstances that are applicable to a particular society at a particular stage of its development. We cannot, therefore, totally abolish this Legislation. That will not be acceptable to public opinion in this country. There has to be a residue of provisions which enable life and limb to be adequately protected, and it is my humble submission to you, Madam Chair, that this amending legislation strikes a perceptive balance. Having regard to all the changes which have taken place in our country during the last 43 years, we have whittled down the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, diminished its rigidity in a manner that is appropriate to the present stage of development of Sri Lankan society. We have stopped short of abolishing it altogether. That is too extreme a step and it lacks a sense of balance.",

The Government has to make a practical appraisal with regard to competing priorities and we have to make an informed decision regarding the steps that can be taken at this time. We honestly feel that this is the maximum we can do now; we cannot go further. We have to carry the public with us. You were in power for five years and I know that honest attempts were made, but those attempts failed because the current was too strong, the groundswell of public opinion was too strong. That is why those efforts did not succeed. So, we do not want the best to be the enemy of the good; the best must not be the enemy of the good. Therefore, let us make a start, let us improve the law by making these changes and as I assured you earlier, we will come up with a comprehensive legislation in due course. I am certainly prepared to give serious consideration to the proposals that were made by the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella at that time. - [Interruption.]",

President Barack Obama went to the extent of naming this case on World Press Freedom Day. So, following international pressure, the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa pardoned Tissanayagam in 2010.

The several weaknesses mentioned earlier, specifically, the impact on the independence of the Judiciary, deprive judicial officers of powers afforded under ordinary law and place undue authority on the Executive branch. That is a violation of Article 4(c) of the Constitution which provides that the judicial power of the people shall be exercised by Parliament through courts. Let me give you several examples. Under ordinary law, under the Evidence Ordinance, a confession may be made only to a magistrate, whereas under the PTA, a confession may be made to a police officer not below the rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police. Under ordinary law, under the Code of Criminal Procedure, a suspect must be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours and in some cases, within 48 hours of arrest. That provision enables a judicial officer to inspect the condition of the suspect and oversee the investigation. But, the PTA strips this power from the Judiciary and deprives it of any meaningful oversight. The proposed new PTA Amendment only enables magistrates to visit places of detention, but that does not guarantee any oversight as it places the onus on magistrates to travel to detention centres rather than on detaining authorities to produce the suspects before the magistrate. It is not practical for magistrates to travel to the detention centres to get a real impression as to how the suspect is being treated. The reason why the ordinary law requires the suspects to be produced in court, before a magistrate is that it is in court and outside the place of detention that suspects may have the ability to inform the magistrate about ill-treatment. Moreover, under ordinary law, under the Bail Act, a trial judge has the power to consider a suspects bail application, whereas under the PTA, the trial judge is stripped of that power. So, Hon. Minister, these provisions reflect undue and totally unconstitutional authority and lack of trust in the competence and capacity of judicial officers to make appropriate decisions. So, I invite you to place your trust in the Sri Lankan Judiciary. We have a unique Judiciary; we have a noble Judiciary; we have an impartial Judiciary. If you agree with my contention, please walk the talk.",

Therefore, the proposed Amendments ought to be rejected in toto and that is our position, the position of the SJB and the SJB Alliance. Previously, the SJB had clearly stated that it does not merely wish to point out the failings of the present Government without offering viable solutions. In this context, the 2016 Proposals of the Sri Lanka Law Commission should be considered as a starting point to repeal and replace the current PTA. The Sri Lanka Law Commission is a body comprising eminent Members of Sri Lankas legal fraternity. The proposals were developed by the Commission, which was chaired by eminent lawyer, Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva with other eminent lawyers such as Manohara de Silva and Sanjeeva Jayawardena. They were all members of this particular body. Their proposals and suggestions are",

Section 4 (2) of the proposals requires that a suspect be produced before a magistrate within 72 hours of arrest; Section 4(4) gives the authority to the magistrate to decide whether a person should be released on bail, which is entirely in keeping with the doctrine of separation of powers. Moreover, the High Court has the power to grant bail when the suspect is produced before the High Court and even after the trial has begun. Section 5(1) provides that the maximum detention period is 30 days upon a detention order being issued by the Minister, after which the suspect must be produced before the High Court. The High Court has the power to remand the person ino police custody for a further maximum period of 28 days. Section 7 provides that the suspect can make confessions to the magistrate and the magistrate is empowered to satisfy himself about the voluntariness of the confession. Therefore, those proposals can be developed into a simple and precise National Security Act for Sri Lanka which effectively balances national security interests, fights against potential terrorism and exiting terrorism, if it so exists, while ensuring the constitutional rights of all persons including their civil liberties.",

There is an urgent need for the establishment of a National Security Council, giving it legal authority and legitimacy through an Act of Parliament, through a legislation. You can always emulate the National Security Act of 1947 of the United States; you can always emulate the Civil Contingencies Committee or the so-called Cabinet Office Briefing Room A - COBRA - of the UK, which was established under the 2004 Civil Contingencies Act. Please focus your attention on those aspects, which will promote national security and terrorism prevention measures and methodologies through such Acts.",

M.A. Sumanthiran will tell you the difficulty we had of getting people released who had been locked up for 20 years under the PTA. The Hon.

Finally, we had to give instructions to release them because there was a question of the Attorney General agreeing to release them.",

After September 11, there was a new type of terrorism and that type of terrorism is what we thought would come into this country. So we thought we should bring in new legislation and I must say the Cabinet agreed at that time to this Counter Terrorism Bill. Now, of course, people can bail out on it; but, everyone was there. If you look at the minutes, there was no dissention on that law. As far as we were concerned, we felt it was necessary. It was drafted both with the help of experts from the UK and the EU, both on the intelligence field and on the legal field. It was covered by both. And then, it went around the embassies, it went around Sri Lankans and we brought it in. Unfortunately, events that came in were such that we could not pass it. You had the 52 days government followed by what happened with the Easter Bombing.",

It may not be silent; it has to speak the same language in different ways. So, certain suspects have to be taken in, but the safeguards have to be there and those safeguards are built into the Counter Terrorism Laws of Europe. UK has a large number of laws. I think Prevention of Terrorism Law was repealed and there are only two Sections. There was a whole lot in 2001 and now they are trying to bring them into one legislation. That is the way you should do. But, that has to be in todays turns and it is international terrorists; it is not like the LTTE or the IRA or anyone that operated within an area. So, our laws must cover all that. I do not think we have all those provisions. The laws of detaining people were all there. In the new one, you are staying at home and you have the electronic instruments put on you, so you cannot walk around. That really gives more freedom. So that is what we require. Many Members on both sides will disagree what I say. But, I think we have to go ahead with this.",

When we wanted to deal with reducing the period of detention, you would have found that it is they who come and say, do not do it. But you keep people for years. What do you find? I will tell you. I was there when the National Intelligence Bureau was formed. We brought in the Special Branch. Today the Special Branch spend most if its time looking at what the local politicians do, what the Working Committees do here and what the Working Committees do there and what the trade unions do there. You just ask how much of time they spend on it. Okay, have a Special Branch if you what to see what the politicians are doing - we are doing - and have a separate intelligence system. That is lacking. When we were in the government we were always told that LTTE is the threat. That is what happened to us.

    "text": "The Prevention of Terrorism Act was brought in as a temporary provisions Bill. In fact, the title to the Act even has \"(Temporary Provisions)\". That is a joke because what was brought in for six months has gone on to live for 43 years! The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe was heard a little while ago to say that at the time it was brought, it was constitutional. No, it was not. The law that he says he helped draft was unconstitutional and the Government of that day knew it. That is why it was brought in as an urgent Bill with the certificate that it will be passed by a two-thirds majority in Parliament. The guarantee of a two-thirds majority was given to court even before the matter was examined by court as an urgent Bill. So, from its very inception, even those who gave birth to it knew that it was an unconstitutional law that they were enacting and they continued to do that. And successive Governments have allowed it to remain, not just merely allowed it to remain, but abused it. It was not that it was necessary at that time and that it was initially used and later abused, but it was abused from day one because the very provisions in that Act are for abuse, not for anything else, not to prevent terrorism.",

    "text": "Because time is short, I am going to recount one or two personal experiences of mine and when I speak on that, I hope it qualifies my declaration under the etiquette of personal involvement in a matter that I speak of. That will illustrate the absurdity of this Law. I have previously mentioned a case, which I will mention again. There was a couple, a husband and wife, who were prosecuted under Section 5 of the Act for failure to give information about a certain person called Babu.. They obtained confessions from this couple. They were people who were threatened and they gave confessions. They were not tortured, but there was a threat of torture - hooks and ropes were brought - and they gave and signed the confession. But, the person named \"Babu\" who was also arrested, despite severe beatings, did not sign the confession. So, I appeared for this couple when the matter came up. \"Babu\" had been released because he did not sign the confession. \"Babu\" came to watch the proceedings of those two persons who were charged for failure to give information about him! That is how absurd this law is. And, what is more? I pleaded guilty on their behalf because they pleaded with me to plead guilty because two years had lapsed, they were in prison, there were three children and no one to look after them. Because of the circumstances, they were given a suspended sentence and they were able to come out after pleading guilty to an offence that they knew very well, we knew very well and the court knew very well that they did not commit.",

Peiris, Minister of Foreign Affairs, when he prefaced his presentation of this Bill. He said that this is only an initial step. However, he alluded that these are very substantial Amendments and certainly not cosmetic amendments. He also proudly declared that these Amendments break new ground. Given his ability with the Queens language, he was able to pull the wool over the eyes of the entire House by saying various words in trying to describe the effort of this Government, which basically is a woefully inadequate cosmetic exercise and a minimalist approach to change the status quo as far as the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act is concerned. That is why we have decided to vote against this Bill, particularly because this does not serve any purpose for the simple reason that the impact of these Amendments is merely superficial and this is a charade. The Hon. Minister of Justice is here. He will know that all of these Amendments, except for that relating to the reduction of the six months period, have virtually materialized through other means connected with legislative provisions in other Acts of Parliament, constitutional safeguards or judicial interpretation.",

Now they are found to be the culprits of the Easter Sunday attacks. Now the Cardinal has gone to Geneva and the matters have been taken up there. The High Commissioner for Human Rights has, in her statement, asked the Government to look into the possibility of security forces being involved in this entire conspiracy. It has gone to that extent.",

That is what is happening and I would like to say this, Hon. Presiding Member. Finally, the PTA has shown distrust and also insecurity and has caused human suffering to untold number of people. Therefore, it is time that we totally do away with this draconian piece of legislation and at least a moratorium must be brought to the implementation of the PTA and therefore this Act must be thrown out from the law books of this country.",

But what surprised me was that he concluded that with the PTA it was actually possible to reduce terrorism. 1979, 1983, and 1990s! I mean, what are we talking about? Terrorism does not basically go away. We are just formulating laws. Laws are part of a system and terrorism does not go away in that particular way.",

The third issue we have is it denies bail to the accused even though an indictment has already been there in the High Court and fourthly, it makes confessions to police officers admissible and thereby incentivizing the abuse of those in custody.

The well-known cases of how this has been abused are the cases of Rishad Bathiudeen, the arrest of Azath Salley, Hejaaz Hizbullah, then, Ahnaf Jazeem, and with Hejaaz Hizbullah, five others have also been held under the PTA. And also, there are some names which we have talked less about and among them is the high-profile case of Murugupillai Kokulathasan, a freelance Tamil journalist who was arrested in Batticaloa on 28th Novermber, 2020 because of a social media post commemorating civil war-related incidents. He remains in custody. Keerthi Ratnayake, a freelance journalist, was summoned to a police station and arrested on 14th August 2021 and he remains in custody. Ten Tamil-speaking people were arrested for having memorialization events in Batticaloa on 18th May, 2021 and held under the PTA. In Batticaloa, again the police detained 19 people in November, 2020 for allegedly posting online birthday wishes for the late LTTE leader.

There are provisions already, in the law, in the Constitution. For example, if you take fundamental rights petitions, you have to bring them within one month and then, if I am not mistaken, Hon. Minister, FR matters have to be concluded under the Constitution within a year, but those would not happen. We all know that unless it is an important matter which is in the public eye and has caught the attention of the entire country, these matters get dragged on, not for a year, but for years. If we take day-to-day matters, there have even been trials-at-bar, which ideally should sit day-to-day, but those have shown to be not practical and instead, are almost always observed in the breach. Already, there are provisions for the Magistrates to visit detainees in police stations, but the fact of the matter is that they just do not do that. In reality, they do not have time to do it and even if they do visit them, let us assume that they do, then, we, once again, have to rely on whether our current system is going to be fair, whether our current system has not been corrupted to such an extent that there would not be discrimination.",

As a lawyer, I totally agree with the argument that separation of power is very important. In separation of power, the Executive powers, the legislative powers and the judicial powers should be separated. No one can assume the role of the judge and keep somebody in detention forever. However, all jurisdictions including the USA, the EU, India and Singapore, you name anyone, have certain safeguards to protect their national interests. So, we need to have a very important law to protect our national security while safeguarding the rights of the innocent and the people who have been detained under this Law.",

While those safeguards are necessary, it is also important that we have sufficient counter terrorism laws in the event of extremism which borders terrorism, to quickly quell that. Otherwise, the entire public will suffer. We have seen, when the LTTE was running riot, the whole country suffering from it, mostly the Tamil community. It is their youth who were rounded up and taken away in the night by the LTTE to forcibly conscript. Recently, when I went to Kilinochchi, I met five parents of some missing persons. When I spoke to them, all of them said that the missing were 13 or 14 when they were taken. They used the word \"Iyakkam\" and said that they came and took the youth away and after the war, they went missing. Now, they want to reclaim them. As Lord Buddha had very clearly preached, violence is not a solution to anything. Hatred does not cease by hatred. Hatred has to be ceased by love and tolerance. So, we need to go back to our drawing board and try to make people keep in touch with others.",

We have reduced the period of detention from 18 months to 12 months. Also, we have specifically admitted that any member of the public in this country who is detained have the right to go the Court of Appeal and to the Supreme Court and challenge his detention. That right is specifically given. Apart from that, for the first time, as a right, the people who have been detained for more than one year can go to court and ask for bail, whether the other side, the Attorney-General, consents it or not. We have taken that discretion away from the Executive and given it to the court so that the court can look into it.",

It is the use of cyberspace; it is brainwashing; it is the use of political power; it is money transferring or money laundering.

He said it was a start and he apparently is of the belief that these are superfluous amendments because some of the laws that were introduced subsequent to the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, have in fact erased some of the positions that were originally included in it. For instance, in giving bail and so on. What he was first saying looked like that we are debating the original Act of 1979 as opposed to the amendments.",

And that is why, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we have brought in these immediate amendments, urgent amendments, to rectify the situation to a large extent. I have indicated succinctly the main areas in which these amendments will have operation: the increased authority of Magistrates and Judicial Medical Officers, day-to-day trials, access to counsel, communication with the next of kin or other close relative, the virtual repeal of Section 15(2) of the PTA which denies bail in all circumstances - \"shall remand\" - the court is forced to remand. That is no longer the case. That itself is a very significant amendment. Then, Section 9, which says that the Detention Order shall not be called in question in any proceedings whatsoever. We are making an explicit exception in respect of fundamental rights jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, the writ jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal and habeas corpus applications. So, all of these represent significant changes in the law.",

So, may I thank the House for the cooperation that was extended to us. I have no doubt that this is going to make a definite change in the law. It is going to make a difference on the ground. If the law remains exactly as it is, the position will be far worse than what it would be. These amendments will have be enacted into law and I, therefore, ask all Members of the House, irrespective of party affiliation, to extend their unqualified support to these amendments.",
