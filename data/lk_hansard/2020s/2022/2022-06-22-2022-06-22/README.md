the licence concerned has been issued after obtaining all the recommendations from the relevant institutions and that the whole mining process at this site is carried out under the direct supervision of a mining engineer.

has reported that a certain number of complaints had been received by the Bureau due to mining activities conducted over a long period in the areas concerned, the majority of such complaints had been made regarding the harm caused to the groundwater, in such instances follow-up action was carried out by obtaining a report from the Water Resources Board and that in the case of other complaints, a joint inquiry was conducted and follow-up action has been carried out according to its recommendations. In addition, the Bureau has reported that several reports are due to be received from the Water Resources Board and upon receipt of such reports, action will be taken based on their recommendations.

(b) (i) The Geological Survey and Mines Bureau

has reported that 71 licences have been issued so far for stone quarrying within the Kandy District.

(c) (i) The Geological Survey and Mines Bureau

has reported that the following courses of action are adopted regarding harm to the public such as spread of dust, breaking away of pieces of stone and destruction of roads:

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) . . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran? . . ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you Hon. Prime Minister for your Statement. I just want three clarifications, if you do not mind.

Firstly, you referred to the discussions with the IMF staff team that is here and we all are looking forward to a Staff-level Agreement. I only want to know, in the context of wanting to strengthen the Parliamentary system, whether you will present to Parliament the Staff-level Agreement before it is signed.

Secondly, with regard to the fuel issue, there are suggestions that it might be alleviated somewhat, if private parties are permitted to import fuel. Is the Government considering the possibility of allowing private importers to utilize their foreign exchange, which they may have got by exports or whatever, to bring fuel?

Thirdly, we heard early today that there is a foreign bank which has sued Sri Lanka for defaulting on payments to them. From what we have seen in Bloomberg, they are making allegations that some parties are being treated preferentially. They refer to the Rajapaksa-controlled Government and say that parties in Sri Lanka are being paid their dues and this bank, which says that over US Dollars 250 million is due to them on the Bonds, has sued Sri Lanka. What steps is the Government going to take for parties such as these? We know that when you default, they will sue. What are the steps that are being taken to meet these claims?

Those are the three clarifications I seek, if the Hon. Prime Minister does not mind.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) On what do you need a clarification?

1037 1038

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) They mentioned about the corrupt Government, the Rajapaksa family controlled-Government and that some parties are being treated preferentially, meaning that local banks are being paid and that foreign debt is being defaulted.

So, those are the three matters I wish to have some clarification on. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) As far as the IMF Staff-level Agreement is concerned - I think the IMF staff is going to meet you all and get your views also - it is not presented. They take it with them and present it to the Board. But, I can brief this House on what has been discussed.

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Who signs it? ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) We do not sign it like that. The Staff-level Agreement is part of the process. It is only for the Board. But, we can certainly keep you informed of that. Then -

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) What about importation of fuel? ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I will let you know. I think the exporters are allowed access to bunkering fuel. It is a question of whether we going to lose on our foreign exchange by allowing them to import.

With regard to your third question, I will look into what you have said about the local banks being paid. There is an issue. We are looking at the local banks, both Government and private, because it is one of the biggest problems that we have to face.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please make your speech short. ( ) (The Hon. Jeevan Thondaman) Sir, I would like to bring up just one last issue which, recently, we have witnessed. First of all, we were dealing with an economic issue and while we were looking for a solution for that economic issue, we came face to face with a political issue. And, while we were looking for solutions for both those issues, now, unfortunately, a law and order issue has cropped up. The reason why I am bringing this up is that the Minister of Public Security, the Hon. Tiran Alles, is right there. I would just like to say that we understand that the police are also stressed out; the police are also mentally exhausted, waiting in lines and helping people out. They also have issues, we agree, and I empathize with them, but that does not justify police brutality, that does not justify a senior police officer carrying a gun in front of the unarmed public. That is not acceptable at all and I sincerely hope that the Hon. Minister in charge would take necessary action regarding that incident.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up.

( ) (The Hon. Jeevan Thondaman) Do not worry, Sir. Give me one more minute and I will finish.
