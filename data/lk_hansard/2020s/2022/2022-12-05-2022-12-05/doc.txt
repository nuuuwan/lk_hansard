In the front page of "The Sunday Times" newspaper of 04th December, 2022, it was reported, I quote:

"Committee rejects move to increase retirement age of Parliament Secretary General

By Ranjith Padmasiri A proposal to increase the retirement age of the Parliament Secretary General Dhammika Dassanayake from 60 to 63 has been turned down by the Staff Advisory Committee in Parliament, a senior official said.

Mr. Dasanayake is due to reach the retirement age of 60 in March next year.

Another proposal to absorb the position of Coordinating Secretary to the Parliament Secretary-General to the permanent cadre (Executive Grade) with a pension after 10-year service also has been turned down by the Committee which met under the chairmanship of Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana.

However, a proposal to increase the retirement age of parliament staff from 60 to 63 has been accepted with a revision to increase only up to 61 years, but subject to Cabinet approval."

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) .. . 26 .

[11.27 a.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Chairman, out of the 26 minutes I have, I will speak for 20 minutes - please stop me at 20 minutes - and the balance six minutes will be taken by the Hon. Govindan Karunakaram.

I am glad that both the Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation and the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms, whose Ministries' Votes are being discussed at the Committee Stage today, are present in the Chamber.

Sir, I have seen a report that the SriLankan Airlines, in the first half of the Financial Year 2022/2023, had lost Rs. 112.8 billion. That is the loss made in the first half of the Financial Year 2022/2023. That includes the forex losses also. Nevertheless, that is a staggering figure and every month, it keeps making these losses and the State absorbs them. I am mentioning this figure because the cost of having an election is only Rs. 11 billion. Whenever we talk about an election, defence is taken stating, How can we afford an election? One months loss of the SriLankan Airlines is more than the cost of having an election. Therefore, that is not an argument. You keep making these losses and then say, How can we hold an election? Fundamental to the functioning of a democracy is periodic elections.

One might say, Well, the Parliament has a mandate for five years. Why are you asking for an election now? I wish to draw the attention of both the Hon. Ministers to the fact that by your own very conduct, you conceded to the country that this Parliament had lost its mandate. A few months ago, both of you crossed the Floor and came and sat in the Opposition; you conceded that Parliament had lost its mandate. The election that gave a near two-thirds majority to the Government at that time was lost. Subsequently, you were both given ministerial portfolios and you have crossed back to the Government side, taken those Cabinet posts and you are both in the front row now.

The Hon. Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms made a very strange speech, if I might call it that, today just before me. Hon. Minister, you might as well made that speech sitting in the Opposition. You sounded very much like an Opposition MP, complaining bitterly about corruption that is rampant and the fact that all these persons who are corrupt, including businessmen, are protected by politicians. It is rich coming from a Minister who holds the portfolio of justice to be complaining about that. To complain about that is our task. Your task is not to keep complaining about that. Your task is to remedy that, to put it right. I know that it is not something which can be done in a day.

You might say, Well, I have only taken on this portfolio and not even a few months have passed and so on. But, corruption is endemic; it has gone on for so many years. The Hon. Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms has been on this side and that side and then, on this side and then, on that side; then, again, on this side and again, on that side. I have lost count of the number of times you have crossed this Floor, Hon. Minister, ever since you entered Parliament first. I do not know whether you have a record of the number of times you have crossed the Floor.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) Hon. Member, you must remember that I crossed the Floor twice and every time, I crossed over from the Government side to the Opposition. But, at the moment, I am holding this portfolio since I have been elected from the party which rules today and I have got the mandate from the people of the Colombo District. Therefore, remember that I have never crossed the Floor just to get anything or to get power; Always, I have crossed over from the Government side to the Opposition, opposing the policies of whatever Government that was in power.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The point I was making was whether you remember the number of times you crossed over. You did not answer that. Perhaps, you yourself have lost count of the number of times you crossed the Floor. This time you crossed over from the Opposition to the Government side; your last crossing over was towards the Government side. - [Interruption.] No, I am not complaining. You came to the Opposition, sat here a few months ago with us and then, you crossed over again. So, that is the only point, nothing more. I am not dividing you; I am just saying that you may not even remember the number of times you crossed the Floor. That is all.

The task you have undertaken, we understand, is an enormous task; it is not an easy one. But, it is not your lot to complain to this House. Your task is to put all these right. After you took over as Minister, you forwarded several Bills - we appreciate that - to this House, making Amendments, bringing in new Acts of Parliament and so on. But, on some of those, we had raised our concerns like in the case of the Poisons, Opium, and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, under which the bail application had been moved from the High Court to the Court of Appeal. There is a question of access to justice and that is something you need to put right. Perhaps, it was there in the draft when you took over as Minister. Several of these drafts, we find, were done before you took over as the Minister of Justice and those are just being churned out like in a factory floor, produced here and tabled. Some of them will not fit in with the legal culture of our country and so on. I understand that there is the Registration of Title Act, which will impinge on prescription. Prescription is a mode of acquisition. It comes from the Roman-Dutch Law. Actually, it has a fundamental

45 46

principle that nobody absolutely owns a property. If you do not use it, if you do not derive from it over a long period of time, for ten years, then somebody else can take it. But, title registration now comes in and if it is registered, then I was told, that prescription will not apply.

Those run counter to some basic principles. I am just raising it. I do not want you to respond, Hon. Minister, but, at some of these things, we will have to have a closer look before we make them into laws and trumpet to the country and elsewhere that a lot of reforms are being made.

You are also the Minister for Constitutional Reforms. The President has, for the umpteenth time - I heard him saying that two days ago also - said that before the 75th Anniversary of our Independence, the national question of this country will be solved. Not only does he say that, he also says that if it is not solved before that date, it will never be solved. That is a prophet of doom, as it were, but he says that. So, the primary responsibility, if I might call it, in this House to carry that through rests on your shoulders as the Minister who holds that portfolio. As I have said it in this House while the President was present, I wish to repeat that, as for ourselves, we will cooperate with whatever genuine effort that is taken and that is the reason why we have continued to sound positive although we have serious doubts in our minds. We do not want to be blamed by you saying, Well, we were ready to do it, but the Tamil side raised various issues and they were not willing to do it. No, we are ready, but it must meet with the just aspirations of our people. You know what it is; we have said it very clearly. We have said that it must be a meaningful scheme of devolution to the North and the East on a federal structure.

I have said once before, recently, in this House that federalism is not a bad word. There are many countries in the world, indeed the strongest countries in the world, which have a federal structure. The federal idea was introduced into this country by none other than the founder of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike in 1926. The Kandiyan chiefs wanted federalism, to have three units in this country. So, it was the Sinhala leaders who wanted it. They could not have wanted something that was bad for the Sinhalese people. So, this bogey of saying that a federal idea will divide the country cannot continue any further. Persons like you, learned in the law, must tell the people the truth, that there is absolutely no danger of the country dividing because we share power in a meaningful way under a federal structure. Unless we do that, we will continue to have this "wound festering", I am borrowing again from the phrase the President used on the 03rd of this month. We are willing to come to a settlement that will be good, not just for our people, but for the country. This is the moment to do it; this is the moment to put a lot of things right because we are in this economic crisis.

I agree with you entirely that the big fraudsters must be brought to book, but that is not done merely by passing

laws. There are some things that are fundamentally flawed in this country. They have ingrained into the system, so much so that if a deal is being made or some contract is being given, percentages are already allocated - you must be knowing this - like 5 per cent for the Minister, so much for the Secretary to the Ministry and so much for somebody else. All of that is established, systemized. Systemized corruption is very difficult to eradicate. That is why the youth of this country are saying "system change". That "system change" has to do both with the political culture as with the culture of corruption in this country. And, until we strike at that root, it will hurt us somewhat when we do that and we will not put it right, and I think the time has come. We have declared our country bankrupt. We have gone through three decades of war. At least now, if we are not willing to strike at that root and turn it upside down, the country will never resuscitate from the coma it has got into. So, Hon. Minister, as you said, this is the only time you have gone in the other direction. We appreciate that you have taken on a responsibility, a most difficult responsibility at a most difficult time, but that enormous responsibility must be carried out.

Now, we, in the Opposition, too have a function; we, in the Opposition, have the function of supporting you in every positive step you take. That is the role of a responsible Opposition and we will play that role, you know that very well. We will play that role, but equally, we have the enormous responsibility to oppose, to make plain to the country, to announce and call out to the Government, if the Government is on a wrong path. Now, after these several months of this new Government, most of us, if I speak the truth, are not in a position to pull our full weight with this Government. It has to do with the fact that you, on your side, still have people whose hands are sullied, who, everyone knows, are corrupt and you are carrying on regardless. If the President and you think that you can somehow balance these matters, carry on and get away, you are sadly mistaken. It will not happen unless that fundamental change is made; unless the Government and everyone here comes to the realization that we must start anew, nothing is going to change because the forces of evil that have gripped this country are far too strong to be balanced; they have to be eradicated. So, all the racist elements, the corrupt elements, all of that have to be totally eradicated. You cannot leave some of them and work with the others and hope that this is politics and we can manage the two, that we can somehow get across. No, that would not work.

Therefore, Hon. Ministers, I urge you, please, as two Ministers who left the Government ranks and crossed the Floor recognizing that the Government had lost its mandate - now, you have gone back and taken ministerial portfolios, but you all recognized that there is no mandate for this Government - also support the view that Parliament, too, has lost its mandate and that it is only with a fresh mandate, with a fresh outlook for that fundamental system change the people ask for that we can come out of this mess the country has got into. And, fundamental to that is the resolution of the national question and repeatedly, ad nauseam, we are saying, because we want the country and the world to hear, that

47 48

[ .. ]

2022 05

we will cooperate on that, not to just cover up and hope that things are balanced, no, but to do the right thing properly, make that fundamental change and share power in a meaningful way under a federal structure. Then, you will have not only just our support, but also the support of the entire world to change this country around.

I must thank the Hon. Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation for reducing the airport tax for the Palaly Airport by half. That has enabled, I believe, the first flight to arrive on the twelfth of this month. I urge him to actually take away the airport tax in toto. Then, we will have more tourists coming in and the foreign exchange we badly need. It was an important move to declare, on September 19th, the Palaly Airport and the Batticaloa Airport as international airports together with the Ratmalana Airport. That must come into effect; both the Palaly Airport and the Batticaloa Airport must receive foreign tourists and others who will bring the much needed foreign exchange into our country. I am referring specifically to those two airports because, linguistically, they will attract Tamil-speaking tourists from South India, Malaysia, Singapore and from various other parts of the world. Take that into consideration and develop those. So, my appeal to the Hon. Minister is to relax that balance airport tax also and enable economic recovery through that process too.

Thank you.

[12.18 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Yadamini Gunawardena) Hon. Chairman, the clarion call for a mixed system of elections is very clear at this time. I believe there is consensus on that in this House from both sides. Over the last couple of years - no less, but almost extending to a decade or more - this has been extensively deliberated at Committee level in Parliament as well as among the general public. So, I think it is about time that we move into finalizing the formulas and setting up this mixed system of elections because the current system has, for the last three and a half decades, failed to reflect the mandate of the people. I think even my learned Friends of the Opposition will agree with me that it has become nothing more than a facade and an electoral mirage, when it comes to continuing with the PR system. It has become unsustainable. Expenditures on the election campaigns have become so exorbitant that it has become impossible to sustain campaigns and it has not been able to deliver to the electorates as well.

So, a mixed system of elections, as proposed by the Dinesh Gunawardena Committee Report, through which about 70 per cent is elected from the First-Past-the-Post System - if you take Parliamentary Elections, when taking 225 as a fixed number, around 150 are to be elected under the First-Past-the-Post System and the remainder 75 are to be allocated for PR where the best performers among the losers be given a chance as well as a guaranteed representation; maybe a quota for the youth and the women to be accommodated within this 75 - is something that both sides of this House could come to an agreement on since there is consensus for a mixed system of elections.

Similarly, this should be extended to the Local Government Elections whereby about 4,000 plus wards are to be set up to elect the grassroots representatives across the country and it gives almost 70 per cent of the institutions whereby, maybe, 30 per cent be allocated again for the youth and the women representatives to be included in these institutions.

I am bringing this matter to your consideration at this moment because it is very important, before any election is being called for, that this House agrees to a mixed system of elections. In a sustained representative democracy, the will of the people or their correct mandate should be reflected and also in these institutions, be it Parliament or the local government institutions. Therefore, it is important that the will of the people is sustained.

57 58

At the same time, as far as accountability to the voters is concerned, under the wards system or the First-Past-the-Post System, there is a much stronger accountability to the voters because the connectivity between the elected and the voters is sustained more than under the current PR System or the manapa system. Therefore, before any election is called for, this important aspect has to be finalized by this House. My request, as a Parliamentarian and a youth of this country, is that this matter be taken up seriously before anything else is considered by this House in the coming months.

I would like to quote Article 9 of the Constitution, which was also part of the Kandyan Convention signed in 1815 and later included as Article 7 of the 1972 Constitution. There have been Supreme Court deliberations and judgments in that regard.

The comprehension of a question paper, which is about the ability of a particular student, is different from writing answers to questions. We know there are students who come from very difficult areas and who have studied in vernacular languages. You yourself, Hon. Minister, and me are such examples; we all came from rural areas. Though, after we came to Colombo, we have learnt and improved English over a period of time, when we entered

117 118

the Law College, we were not confident enough to answer certain question papers in English. Now, of course, all the lectures are being conducted in English. That is quite a bit of a problem. But, in our days, we had some lectures in our own mother tongue. This difficulty has to be properly understood. The Council of Legal Education headed by His Lordship the Chief Justice must also consider this issue a little more sensitively because this is a much more deeper problem and this also has socio-economic complications because of the education policy in our country. So, the students cannot be held at fault for refusing to sit for exams or protesting against exams being conducted in the English language. Our original courts conduct cases in the national languages. Even though the original courts are conducting cases in the national languages, it is true that in our superior courts and even in making submissions in the original courts, of course, we use English. That is a different matter. The Hon. Minister, I know, understands this issue and the sensitivity attached to it and I am sure, a proper decision will be made. I am told that the Council has now given a concession for repeaters to sit for papers in their own mother tongue.

But, that is insufficient because the problem runs much deeper and therefore, this matter should be taken into consideration. Hon. Minister, I hope you will approach His Lordship the Chief Justice and some of our Legislators also can come and speak about this. I am sure that we have some different opinions like Presidents Counsel the Hon. Jayantha Weerasinghe. But still, this issue needs to be discussed and resolved so that at least some kind of comfortable time period could be given for students to be ready to answer all question papers in the English language.

Having said that, let me also endorse what the Hon. Mujibur Rahuman and a few others spoke about the Easter Sunday attacks, the indictments that have been filed and the various controversies attached to it.

, . . . 2016 . 2016 2019 21 , . . . .

The charge sheet contains more than 20,000 charges. ( ) (The Hon. Mujibur Rahuman) Twenty three thousand.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Twenty three thousand charges! This is an absurd situation. The former IGP and the former Defence Secretary were acquitted by court. I do not know what happened in that case.

Then, I am told that the Attorney-Generals Department has about 35 vacancies for State Counsels at the moment. So, they are having a serious human resource problem within the Department. I do not think a State Counsel can sit and go through papers and produce at least three indictments a day; it is so difficult. But, I am told that they are proudly saying that, now, they produce almost 1,000 indictments for a month. How is it humanly possible? Finally, all these cases will be over without any success in courts.

In the British system, I am told that the Crown Prosecution Service has a practice called suspended prosecution, where you assess the rate of success of a charge and if there is a possibility of that case not succeeding or if there is an iota of doubt that it might not succeed, they suspend the prosecution and look at the future conduct of the person to be charged so that you do not right away go and charge him That is what is happening there.

But here, there are so many cases that are failing in the courts of law. Looking at the success rate particularly with regard to criminal cases, I must say that we must revisit our entire criminal justice system because absolutely puerile attempts are being made at many cases. When you see the success rate of cases in courts, it is a very sorry state of affairs. Poor people are spending hours and hours in courts and some of them are spending the entire lifetime in court houses. Finally, the accused get either discharged or acquitted.

In the criminal courts also, we must see whether we could introduce a mediation effort. Through mediation, we can settle so many cases without going for trial. The Hon. Ali Sabry, former Minister - the process started while I was there as Minister - introduced the pretrial procedure, but that also has not become very successful because we use the same judges to attend to the pretrial matters also. So, we need to have a separate cadre appointed as pretrial judges both at the Magistrate's Court level and the District Court level. Then, when it comes to framing issues, we will have those matters disposed of easily. Also, try and see whether mediation is possible to settle maters there. Now, it does not happen.

Now, look at our Traffic Court. It is a total waste of time. All that could be done online. The Police could be asked to send the charge sheet by post, asking the person who is being charged whether he is pleading guilty or not. Then, they can charge a payment and finish it off without having all these court houses sitting for days on end, wasting time and money. The entire Traffic Court system can go through a dramatic change. That is

119 120

[ ]

2022 05

happening in so many other countries. Unless it is a case relating to a very serious and a fatal accident, you can refer it to the Magistrate's Court of the area right away.

Then, you can also extend the Circuit Court system since it is a question of proximity to courts for litigants. Litigants are wasting time travelling from one place to the other. I am told that, now, they have set up a Circuit Court in Kinniya and I would like to request you to set up a Circuit Court also in a place like Deltota in the Galaha police area. Hon. Minister, your Deputy Minister knows that Hewaheta is a very large area and people have to travel 40, 50 miles to come to Kandy to attend to Magistrate's Court matters filed by the Galaha Police. So, you can set up a Circuit Court somewhere there and one of the magistrates can come and sit in the Circuit Court for a day per week and dispose of all the cases without those people having to travel all the way to Kandy. I am making that request and I have even identified some places in the Deltota area for you to set up the court, if necessary. So, those matters, I would like to bring to your attention.

Hon. Minister, I am told that the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption has also been gazetted under you. Has it been gazetted under you or the President?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) It does not come under anybody; it is an independent body.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Yes, it is an independent body. But, for purposes of vote - [Interruption.] Yes, I know. Today, at the Party Leaders Meeting, we were talking about the amendments to the Bribery Act.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) Not an amendment, but we will bring in a new Bill. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Yes, the new Bill. President's Counsel Sarath Jayamanne, the other day, presented that Bill, which was a very wonderful piece of legislation. A lot of areas of reforms that we have been proposing for a long time have been embodied in that Bill. I think you should rather introduce it soon; bring that Bill to Parliament so that we could have it passed.

Along with that, what is important is to look at also introducing a stolen asset recovery law. We have to have a separate law for stolen asset recovery. I am told that

President's Counsel Sarath Jayamanne and His Lordship Yasantha Kodagoda have co-authored a concept paper on non-conviction-based stolen asset recovery provisions to be -

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) Hon. Member, that is about disposal of production while the case is pending.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Not only disposal of production, even for confiscation -

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) Justice Kodagoda did that particular one.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Is that so? I do not know. Anyway, that was what I was told by President's Counsel Sarath Jayamanne the other day. Some of those novel ideas too should be made into laws.

When we talk about the criminal justice system and the reforms that are necessary to be introduced, it is important to look at the Police Department and its conduct. Today, in "The Morning," newspaper, there is an interview by the Chairman of the National Police Commission and former IGP, Mr. Chandra Fernando. There, he says, I quote:

"If we work independently, it does not matter even if we go and meet God."

This is about meeting a VIP at the Katunayake Airport. All of us who are here belong to different faith groups, if we get a chance to meet God, will be happy.

That is a different matter. But, God is one thing and godfather is something else. He goes and meets the godfather when he arrives at the Airport and what is worse is the excuse he is trying to give. He would rather have said, I am an independent Chairman. I can go and meet anybody and my independence would not be affected. Then, we could have accepted it. What he says is, I suddenly heard a commotion and I went there to see whether some police assistance is necessary. That kind of puerile explanations are not necessary. All of us know about godfathers, cronies and all that. Besides that, I have nothing against the Chairman of the National Police Commission, but the problem is when such things take place, the confidence in the independence of the Commission is gone. That is the whole issue. So, these things have to change.

I must say that former Chairman of the National Police Commission, Mr. Ranjith Abeysuriya, was one of

121 122

the most respected silks in this country who performed a wonderful job as the Chairman of the National Police Commission. He was a senior practitioner in the criminal courts and his son is also an Additional Solicitor General now in the Attorney-Generals Department. So, such people with such eminence were able to give so much of confidence to the activities of the National Police Commission.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) A lot of things need to be discussed, but my time is up, I know.

I would finally raise a small matter regarding the Valaichenai Court. The Court has now been shifted into the interior rather than having it near the main road. It was at Valaichenai near the Colombo-Batticaloa main road, but it has now been shifted to Kalkudah. There was a land identified at the Navalady Junction for that, which would have been convenient for everybody. Now, a large section of people have to travel far -

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) When was that shifted? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) That had been done during the Hon. Ali Sabrys time. I think the Hon. Sivanesathurai Santhirakanthan brought some pressure and wanted it to be shifted right into the interior, which has caused a lot of inconvenience. So, such decisions have caused a lot of difficulties for the people. Therefore, if these things could be reversed, we will be happy.

Sir, since my time is up, I will conclude with that.

Thank you. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) , . , 165 - Ordinance - . , . anti-

The other matter is that the Hon. Member referred to the independence of the Chairman of the National Police Commission. That is why we have proposed a new Anti-corruption Bill. We are not going to appoint retired officials as Commissioners to the National Police Commission because they have no responsibility and no independence. They act according to their whims and fancies. Finally, people will have to suffer because nobody is responsible. We will not allow that to happen in the future.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 8 .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, I am thankful that I can say some words on the Votes of the Ministry of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms whilst the Hon. Minister is present in the House.

Sir, I wish to restrict my comments to constitutional reforms because it is a topical matter in the context that the President, I think, on numerous occasions in the recent past specifically mentioned the need to find a solution to the ethnic conflict, which has existed almost as long as since Sri Lanka became independent. So, in that context, I wish to state a few matters for the purpose of record.

Our party has taken up the position, Sir, that if the President does, in fact, invite us for these talks, we want that process to be serious. We do not want it to be another talking shop because we have had so many numerous processes in the past like all-party conferences, round-table conferences - you can give it whatever name you want - but, ultimately, nothing has come of them. Certainly, as far as finding a solution to the ethnic conflict is concerned, the Tamil people had come out of those talks feeling extremely cheated. That is because when you go into a negotiation process, if you do not know, to some extent at least, that the outcome of those negotiations will have some bearing on finding solutions to the aggrieved party, which, in this case, are the Tamil people, then that process gets sidetracked to a point that it becomes meaningless.

Our party is a very good example of winning at the last elections and growing exponentially in popularity in the North and the East because we are a party which does not want to get cheated and we are very clear about that. It is for that reason that we have said - we say it with utmost responsibility - if these negotiations are to be taken seriously by our party and if we are to seriously take part in them, we would like to take part, then there must be certain parameters laid down. You know that the Tamil people, by going through these negotiations,

167 168

[ ]

2022 05

actually legitimize this Government. This Government needs a lot of legitimacy because they are not popular; they are in Parliament at the rejection of the people of this country. Then, you have a President who is in office when he could not win his own Seat and he got elected by Members opposite who are being rejected by the people outside. So, we all know that the President needs legitimacy; we all know that this Government needs legitimacy and in that case, he needs to have people engaged with him. So, we do not want that legitimacy simply to be given without knowing full well that this process is going to be meaningful as far as our Electorate is concerned. Sir, the Tamil National Peoples Front is a serious organization. We came out of the TNA in 2010 and we went to the people and told them that we are going to get cheated, that the TNA is going to cheat the Tamil people and there is not going to be any solution. And it is, in fact, because we have been so accurate and brutally honest with our people that today we are growing in popularity. We are not going to put their trust in jeopardy. So, if we are to, in fact, engage with this Government with regard to finding a negotiated solution, then there must be certain parameters laid down. We must know that President Wickremesinghe and this Government is serious and the only way that we believe we can assume there will be seriousness is if this Government tells the Sinhalese people that we cannot find a solution to the ethnic problem within the Unitary State structure, that considering a federal solution does not mean secession and that there is a massive gap between secession and federalism. So, if we cannot have this Government telling those basic truths to the Sinhalese people and if, without laying down those parameters, we are going to be asked to engage in negotiations, then, Sir, I think the Hon. President and the Government can find other partners in the North and the East for that; we certainly are not prepared to cheat our people and be a party to another fiasco.

So, it is in that context, Sir, that I wish to state a few more things. We talk of a Unitary State. We have had a Unitary State since Independence; this country has known no other system of government other than a unitary structure. One of the most important justifications for a unitary State is, if you depart from a Unitary State, we are told, it would be a slippery slope towards secession. But that is further from the truth, Sir. Let us take the 75-year history of Sri Lanka. You have had a Unitary State, but you could not prevent the secessionist movement and you could not prevent a scenario in 2000 where you had an area of this Island completely under the control of the LTTE and in which area your writ, the State's writ, did not run. All that happened within this Unitary State. Legally, you are a Unitary State.

It is not the constitutional terms unitary or federal which is going to determine whether the people in this country, particularly the Tamil people in this country, want a separate State or not. How you treat them, what is the political culture that is being used and whether those people, whoever who they may be, feel loyal towards the State are the values which will ultimately determine whether all of Sri Lanka, all of its peoples are going to be faithful to this State. Those are the only values, Sir, which

will be the determining factors, not your label of unitary or for that matter, even federal. Sri Lanka can be federal, but if that federal structure is defeatist to a point where it is not implemented in the same way that people talk of the Thirteenth Amendment and various other constitutional provisions, then again, you are not going to have a loyal citizenry who say that Sri Lanka is the home for all of us. No, on the contrary.

So, Sir, it is our view that the Sinhalese people should be told the truth and truth has never been told to them. They have been frightened and brainwashed to a point where nothing but a Unitary State is being considered; anything beyond a Unitary State is immediately rejected. Well, if you are going to reject it in that way, then be clear that you are going to have a permanent state of insecurity where you are going to always look beyond your shoulder thinking that the other non-Sinhala Buddhist sections of this country are not going to be faithful to the State, and you are going to spend exorbitantly on that because you are going to be paranoid in that way and rightfully so because if you are not prepared to consider alternatives to a Unitary State, I do not think you are going to have anybody else being genuinely faithful to this country. I can tell you that. As a person who was born and bred in Colombo amongst the Sinhalese, who grew up amongst the Sinhalese, I can tell you that whilst the Sinhalese people are honest, protective, friendly and faithful to friendship, when it comes to this ethnic problem, something happens to them, all sense goes out of the window. That must change, Sir, if we are to be serious in finding solutions to this ethnic problem.

I also want to mention one other matter. We talked about electoral reforms. The Hon. Yadamani Gunawardena is present here. He spoke in the afternoon and I listened to his speech. He was someone who was very strongly calling for a change in the electoral structure. One of the matters that he and many others also spoke of was that the present PR system does not reflect the true will of the people. I find that quite preposterous; it is the complete opposite. It is the PR system which most closely reflects the true will of the people. Unfortunately, if the people are divided and are not willing to vote in numbers to one party, those percentages are reflected in Parliament and you would not have the sort of majorities you ideally would want. But, please do not mistake that into thinking that that is not the true reflection of the people. On the contrary, it is the true reflection of the people.

Now, I am asking you to consider this. The Tamil people in this Unitary State, where it is this House which determines practically everything, under a PR System, stand the closest chance to becoming relevant. When the House is divided, where it cannot find a simple majority under normal circumstances and where they will have to have some coalitions or in some way, need the support of the Members of the Opposition like the Tamil parties who primarily sit in the Opposition, then our value becomes important because they need, for various things, partners across. But, if you try to change or depart from the PR System, then our value reduces very significantly. If you

169 170

want to find a system of governance which gives a stable government so that it does not have to rely on the numerous small parties to form a government, I understand that. But, if that is going to happen, then, at the very least, the ethnic problem must be resolved. If you want one of the two major Sinhala-dominated parties to form a stable government without resolving the ethnic problem, then, in that case, what you are effectively going to do is to make the Tamils, the Muslims and the other minor sections or nations of this country totally irrelevant, numerologically, completely irrelevant. That is not something we can consider as a friendly act, Sir. Everything that is happening in this House, every word that is being spoken in this House, from where we sit, sounds very ominous; every word seems to be to try and reduce the strength of the non-Sinhala Buddhist population, electorally and otherwise and that is something extremely worrying, Sir.

So, it is under those circumstances that we say this with regard to electoral reforms and the change of the Executive Presidency. We all know that the Executive Presidency is the only institution which has to go before the whole country as a single electorate. There, the whole country is considered as an electorate and as result, for a candidate to win outright in the first count itself, the votes of the Tamils, the Muslims and the upcountry Tamils become extremely important. By all means, the Executive Presidency has been a curse for this country and that also must be altered. But, you cannot do these things without genuinely trying to address the ethnic conflict. If you are considering these changes to the existing provisions that make the Tamils, the Muslims and the upcountry Tamils important, which move will make us irrelevant, at the very least, the ethnic problem must be resolved in a way so that we can manage our own affairs. For that purpose, the Hon. Minister must convince the President that some truth must be spoken. The Hon. Minister, who is a lawyer like the President, knows fully well that any departure from the Unitary State is not going to lead to secession. Whatever guarantees you want under a federal Constitution to prevent secession can be given, but those are not reasons to not consider a federal structure. And, for as long as the Members in this House do not speak the truth with regard to finding a solution to the ethnic conflict and tell the truth to the Sinhalese people themselves, all your efforts will be looked upon as time-buying mechanisms or legitimacy-buying mechanisms and nothing more.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 5 .
