This statement was issued by the Ministry of Finance. This is available, Sir. I can table it because I do not want to take much time, but I will read through it so that some of the doubts would be cleared. The Hon. Minister of Finance engaged with the Governor of the Central Bank in serious discussions, covering most of the issues that have been raised and repeatedly raised by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition. This statement was issued on the 21st of April, 2022, which states, I quote:

" Meeting with the US Department of State and USAID.

Ali Sabry P.C. and the U.S. Department of State experts Donald Lu, Assistant Secretary - Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs and John MC Daniel, Chief of the Economic Unit of the U.S. Department of State along with the Experts of USAID Anjali Kaur, Deputy Assistant Administrator and Sanjay R. Iyer, the International Cooperation Specialist at the residence of the Ambassador of Sri Lanka for US His Excellency Mahinda Samarasinghe. The successful discussion had focused on a variety of options and solutions for strategic economic development for short-term and mid-term challenges. The Finance Minister M. U. M. Ali Sabry P.C. has received the assurance of the valuable support from the esteemed institutions to strengthen the economy of Sri Lanka.

, . It further states,

Meeting with Kristalina Georgieva - IMF Managing Director

The Managing Director has assured her sincere commitment to work together towards mapping a pathway to assist the economic recovery for Sri Lanka. The key highlights of the discussion had premised upon the Policy actions required to be taken to address the economic challenges of Sri Lanka.

Meeting with Gita Gopinath - IMF First Deputy Managing Director

( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Speaker, - ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Please, first give me the chance to explain.

, . . . , , , . , . . .

, , . . . , . . -IMF - . . . . The Hon. Leader of the Opposition is asking for a road map. Can there be a road map without finalizing something? You can demand for a road map; .

, , . "" . . . , . . IMF , ; ; . . . They have enough reserves. The largest reserves are with those countries and we have initiated discussions. We hope to engage in serious discussions. .

. . The National Security Council never summoned you, Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe. These former Ministers of the Government of yours are talking today as if they did not know that the then Hon. Prime Minister and the Deputy Minister of Defence were kept away from the National Security Council. Who chaired that? . . [ ] . [ ] . [ ] . [ ] , . [ ] - [ ] , , . National Security Council . The countrys security was in a serious situation. Hundreds of people died and that was the Government they represented.

Sorry, Sir, I do not want to say anything further. The Hon. Minister of Finance, when he returns, will make a Statement and present the road map together with the details of the discussions he had. If you want to summon a meeting earlier than that - the Hon. Prime Minister is here and he will give an assurance - you could summon, Sir.

The Table informed me that I was originally allocated ten minutes and now, they inform me that I have only five minutes. This is ridiculous! Our party has only one speaker. We cannot even formulate an argument within that time. We do not disturb this House; we behave with decorum and we do not delay Proceedings. So, we cannot be penalized like this. If that is the case, please inform us and we will leave. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees)Hon. Member, I agree with you. We have been discussing this at the Committee on Parliamentary Business as well. If you can raise this issue at the Committee on Parliamentary Business as a Party Leader, I think that would be meaningful. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, as the Chair, you must also do justice by the Hon. Members. When other Members disturb, if you cut our time by half, tell us that you do not want to hear what we have to say. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees)We will refer it to the Hon. Speaker and look into that. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam. You have seven minutes. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, a few weeks ago, I spoke in this House saying that I feel we are at a golden moment. I said that because I felt that, for the first time, we have a situation where the Sinhalese people are questioning their own leaders. If you take the last elections, they felt that Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the Rajapaksa family, probably, were the only people who could, in some way, salvage this country for them. They also felt that way in 2015 when the regime changed and within three months of that regime, you had a situation where there were the Central Bank bond scam and various other corrupt, politicized practices which disillusioned them. The reason why, in our reading, the people voted the Rajapaksas out in 2015 was because they were corrupt and the family needed to be treated a lesson. That was the message that came from the Sinhalese majority. They felt that the family should be treated a lesson, but when the very next Government behaved in the way it did, then ultimately they felt that regardless of whatever faults, they have to bring back the Rajapaksas because they are the only ones who could, to some extent, steady this boat. But, today, those very same people are out on the streets saying that they want the Rajapaksas out, that they want President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his Government out.

Amidst, all of this, Sir, there is a question that is being asked of the Tamil people. That is, why is it that in North-East, which is predominantly Tamil-speaking and Tamil, the Tamil people who have consistently voted against the Rajapaksas, who have consistently stood for accountability so that Gotabaya Rajapaksa could stand before an international court and Tamil people could get justice and who have stood against those whom they considered to be genociders and war criminals are, when the South is up in arms, when the ordinary Sinhalese people are against those very same people they brought into power, are quiet? Make no mistake, they are quiet not because they do not want the Rajapaksas out; of course they do, our party included. We were the first to sign a No-Confidence Motion against the Government. So, make no mistake. But, there is some huge vacuum, Sir, that the ordinary Sinhalese people who are out on the streets protesting must fully understand.

Today, the Tamil people see a moment because the Sinhalese people are calling into question 74 years of leadership and 74 years of system. It is the same thing that the Tamil people have been saying for the last 74 years, that this system is a failure, it will bankrupt this country, it is a system that is exclusivist, that it will sideline people, will create enemies within the State and that you need to change it. But, today, when the Sinhalese people themselves are saying that, what is the message that is coming out of this House?

Even the Opposition who want a change, who are tabling Bills in Parliament to bring about a change, are talking of the Executive Presidency and the repealing of it along with certain other changes. The Executive Presidency, Sir, is the only institution that the minorities - the Tamils, the Muslims and the up-country Tamils - feel they have some leverage on because you need 50 plus per cent of the votes in order to get elected in the first round. That means, that the non-Sinhalese actually have leverage and that is why, traditionally, the non-Sinhalese parties and the non-Sinhalese people have generally felt that the Executive Presidency is a moderating factor because a person who aspires to that position would have to, in some way, allay the fears of the non-Sinhalese. But, it is that very same institution the Sinhalese people want out now, and we fully understand that because it is an undemocratic, dictatorial system which needs to go and which the Sinhalese people have got hurt by. We understand that, we respect that and we are prepared to support that, but you also understand that for 74 years, we have been asking for a system change as well. And, if you are not prepared to accept that system change which empowers all the peoples of this country, which says that Sri Lanka belongs to all its peoples, not only to the Sinhalese Buddhists, but also to the Tamils, the Muslims and to the up-country Tamils, then, todays change is only premised on the lack of democracy towards the Sinhalese people and the South. That is the wrong message that is being given, Sir. The Executive Presidency, if it has to go, needs a Referendum. If you are prepared to face a Referendum, surely, you should be prepared to go before the people by changing the whole system. But, no, not a single party in the Opposition other than the Tamil parties are talking about a system that can, in fact, empower the Tamil people. So, that has to change. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I am winding up, Sir.

Our view is that we are willing to be full partners with the Sinhalese people in changing this system completely, not only the Executive Presidency and bringing about a system which recognizes Sri Lanka, if ever it is to recover and live to its true potential, as a multinational, plurinational country, and the Constitution that can only bring that reality into being is one of a federal nature. It is time that the Sinhalese people understand that their leaders will never tell them the truth, that federalism has nothing to do with separation, that, on the contrary, federalism is the system pursued by countries which are foremost economically in this world and has shown that in countries like Canada and even in other countries where federal institutions have been recognized for non-majoritarian systems, those people have rejected separation.

505 506

2022 22

On that basis, Sir, I urge the ordinary Sinhalese people who are trying so hard today to change this country for the better to have a complete system change, to put pressure on their leaders, whether it be on that side or this side, to make this a system change which empowers the Tamils, the Muslims, the up-country Tamils as well as the Sinhalese Buddhists. That will be the success; everything else will be a failure. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 10 . ( ) (The Hon. Wasantha Yapabandara) , . . ? 2016.
