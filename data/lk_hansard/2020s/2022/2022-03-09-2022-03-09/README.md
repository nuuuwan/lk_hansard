The relevant documents prepared under Article IV were tabled before the Board only last week. Now, we can make the relevant observations and any other comments. If you want it tabled before Parliament, we will be meeting again only on the 21st. At the All Party Conference that His Excellency the President has summoned - it will be communicated to all the political

parties - also we can take it up. But, we will make it available -

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Even through Parliament, the public gets it. Then, the Chambers of Commerce, all other professional associations and even trade unions can get ready. Otherwise, we would be going without the Report; we are just wasting time.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) First, the Report had to be officially tabled before the Board. It was tabled and has now been officially released. So, we can make it available to the Leaders of the political parties and others. There is nothing to hide. It is available now; it is in the open. But, if the former Prime Minister wants it, we will have it delivered specially to the Leaders of political parties and MPs also. .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Sir, what is available is the summary. The full Report has been given only to two agencies, as the general practice: to the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Correct.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) So, we would like to have it together with all the statistics on the balance of payments, exchange rate and everything at least as at end of February this year. So, if you can give it this week, then we can get ready for any discussion.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) We will get it delivered before the All Party Conference.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Okay. Thank you.

Then, the Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya. [11.27 a.m.] () ( () () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya) Hon. Speaker, thank you for giving me time to make some remarks on this very important Bill. In principle, we have no objection to this Bill. This is something which is necessary and in principle, we support it. But, we need to ensure that the Bill does not have any impact on the right to expression, especially on journalism and media freedom. I think there are specific areas in this Bill which are of concern and which could be addressed to make this Bill stronger.

Obviously, in this age where data is used so widely, protection of data from being subject to abuse is absolutely essential and there is no doubt about that. However, there are three specific concerns that have been raised by journalists, media persons as well as activists in the field of right to information, which, I think, should be considered more seriously. One is that there are certain restrictions that have been imposed with regard to how journalists can access and use media, especially when processing data, and on how media actually use data for reporting. That is something which is causing concerns among journalists about how personal data can then be used for journalistic purposes. So, some definition as to the use of data for journalistic purposes could be included in this Bill because that will make this area much more clearer so that for journalistic purposes, data can be used freely.

The other concern is, of course, on the independence of the Data Protection Authority. Currently, all powers relating to the Authority, including appointing members to the Authority, come under the Minister. Now, the way the Bill is currently formulated, there is a greater chance or room for abuse of powers given to the Minister. The current Minister may say that he will assure us of the independence of the Authority. But, you, Hon. Minister, are not going to be the Minister-in-charge of this Act for its lifetime. So, when we draft a Bill, we cannot think of the Bill in terms of the current Minister or the lifetime of this particular Parliament. These Acts stand for years and changes may occur with the people who are interpreting these Bills. So, the important thing is to actually ensure that the Bill itself is drafted in a way that reduces the possibility of abuse, that it does not leave room for interpretation of clauses in ways that are detrimental to the public and the public interest. So, in this regard, the level of independence of the Data Protection Authority is something that is questionable. There is a greater possibility that the Data Protection Authority could be used for political purposes. For instance, it is not a judicial body, but it has powers for investigation and to impose penalties. In that context, the composition of this Authority must ensure that there are sufficient independent persons involved in this decision-making. And also, we feel that the powers of this Authority to actually investigate and impose penalties on those who seem to be in violation of the Act need to be considered very carefully. There needs to be enough protection, that we cannot leave room for any loopholes where political interference can undermine some of the other rights that are also enshrined in our Constitution and in other Acts.

There are also legitimate fears that have been raised with regard to the impact on the right to information. Now, the Hon. Minister assured us that that will not happen, but if you look at page 3 of the Bill, Clause 3(2) states, In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of this Act and the provisions of such written law, the provisions of this Act shall prevail. So, that suggests that this Act overrides or prevails over all other existing Acts. So, how can we assure that the right to information would not be compromised by the enactment of this Act? There are several other rights that are enshrined through other Acts and the Constitution, including the right to freedom of expression.

So, how do we ensure that this Bill does not restrict any of those existing rights and does not override the prevailing rights which have been enshrined through other Acts? The words of the Hon. Minister are not sufficient to give us confidence that this Bill would not undermine those existing rights. Rather, reforms are necessary, revisions are essential to make sure that there are no loopholes, that there is no possibility for this Bill to actually infringe on those other existing rights.

In conclusion, Sir, what we feel is that this Bill is necessary; there is no argument about that. The need to protect data subjects from infringement of privacy, especially by State authorities, is something that is quite essential. There is no doubt about that. However, given the current political situation where media is feeling some

255 256

[ () ]

2022 09

level of threat, where media rights have been curtailed to some extent, where media people have been attacked for their work especially with regard to use of media in the digital space, there are legitimate fears that this Bill can infringe on the right to expression and also on the right to information. So, as long as this Bill can accommodate those concerns, can be revised in relation to enhancing protection of the right to expression as well as the right to information, there is no argument at all about the need or the logic behind enacting this kind of Bill in this day and age.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Namal Rajapaksa) Hon. Speaker, first, I must thank the Hon. Member for accepting the need to bring a Bill of this nature and also contributing in a very progressive manner on the Bill, unlike my other Colleagues who made it very political. The Hon. Minister of Justice will also brief at the end of the day regarding the concerns of the Bill. The Data Protection Authority will make regulations under Section 43 of the Act, those will be published and also brought before Parliament. So, the regulations can be drafted in a way that they would not override the Right to Information Act. The Hon. Minister of Justice Minister will give you a detailed briefing on that during his speech at the end of the day.

Otherwise, in this digital age, data can be stored for a very long period of time and can be used for other purposes. Another guiding principle that has been included in this Bill is that data has to be used in the relevant, aforesaid ways and that data has to be kept safe and secure. So, all those aspects have been looked after by this particular Bill.

Otherwise, again you will have issues coming up from this Bill after it is passed and after the Authority is established because there are genuine concerns. There are absolutely genuine concerns, Hon. Minister. , , ; they are absolutely genuine. We are not trying to do politics here. We want this Bill to be passed in the right format. So, you, as a young and upcoming Minister, have the opportunity here to get the support of the Opposition also for the first time in this Parliament. We have opposed many Bills; we have not supported them. . . Especially, there are grave concerns in terms of appointing the Authority. If the Authority is appointed and the Authority is seen to be favouring the Government in every way in the future, again there will be problems in this country. - - . . ; this Bill is needed. Every country in the world is having Data Protection Acts passed in their Parliaments. But, what generally happens is - I have seen this in several countries - for a broader time period, the Bill is debated, the interested parties are called in and their opinions are taken into consideration and the Government generally passes it with the agreement of both sides of the aisle.

. . . I really appeal to the two Ministers, please consider the need and the request of the country to adopt these amendments and pass this Bill.

[3.52 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member for the opportunity to speak on this important Bill before Parliament today.

I followed the Debate from morning and constantly, from the Opposition, speakers have been asking for certain changes, certain amendments. It is true that they also asked for time to consider certain provisions of this Bill, so that some changes could be made, enabling them to support the adoption of this Bill today.

There are some concerns only with regard to some of the provisions. This is a salutary move. The whole idea is most welcome. But I find on the table that the Government has placed the proposed Committee Stage amendments today and there are many amendments that have been proposed running into several pages. The amendments in Sinhala goes up to 28 pages; Tamil goes up to 42 pages and the English goes up to 23 pages and so on - which indicates that even at the last minute, the Government itself is moving amendments.

Those are not just typos or things like that, but substantial amendments are to be moved and I might mention one which was a concern and the Government is actually removing that. In Clause 28, we found a very strange provision and I was trying to recollect if there was any other statute that had this provision. Originally in the Bill that is before us Clause 28 (1) of the Bill states, I quote:

The Minister may, by Order published in the Gazette, designate a public corporation, statutory body or any other institution established by or under any written law and controlled by the government-

It says, ... and controlled by the government... . It is explicitly stating, controlled by the government. That seemed like a very strange provision, but I find that in the

323 324

[ () , ]

2022 09

proposed Committee Stage amendments that have been given to us, that phrase has been left out and that is a welcome thing. So, this is one of the things that I was concerned and I was going to raise, and I find that that is to be corrected during the Committee Stage.

If that is what is happening - that is a good thing- why can the other concerns that have been raised also not be taken into account and dealt with, without speaker after speaker from the Government Benches saying, This has been very long in coming. You had ample time, you did not go to the Supreme Court challenging this. You did not come for this committee, that committee or other committee and why are you coming here and making these suggestions? If the Government itself has looked at it in the eleventh hour and is proposing Committee Stage amendments dealing with some of the objections that have been raised, why is it not possible to constructively engage with the concerns that are raised and make those amendments? That is all that we ask.

This House is supposed to be a deliberative assembly. It is not just trading insult at each other. Sadly, that is what it has been reduced to most of the time. But when issues are raised, the Minister concerned will be there and will take it into account. If you look at how this was conducted, years past that is what happened. The Hon. Minister immediately on his feet says, Yes, that is a legitimate concern. We will move an amendment on that at the Committee Stage. But, here you are stuck in a groove. All that you are able to say is, Why did you not tell us early? Why did you not do this and why did you not go and challenge it. That is not the spirit with which a debate, a discussion or a deliberation should happen in this House.

Having said that, Sir, may I raise just three issues? The independence of this Authority is a serious concern. Yes, it is true that you are removing those words, controlled by the government . It is there now in your proposed Committee Stage amendments and I thank the Hon. Minister for doing that. But yet, the substance is that it is going to be controlled by the Government. You are just taking the words out but in effect it is going to be controlled by the Government. Therefore, I would urge that while you make that change, make that change a substantive actual change - that it is not controlled by the Government. Do not only remove the words, change the nature of the Authority and make it independent. That is one concern.

The other is with regard to Right to Information. The RTI Law is now hailed as one of the important achievements of this Parliament. We have got that. We have even amended the Constitution to include that as a fundamental right. Then, to make certain laws, particularly the Right to Information Law -

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) These are the last two minutes of your time, Hon. Member.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) How much more time? ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Two more minutes. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you.

To make that also subject to the provisions of this Act seriously undermine the gain that we had by adopting the Right to Information Law and indeed even making it a fundamental right. So, I would urge the Government to consider exempting that Law from the operation of this.

The other matter is, of course, - I am sure the Government knows; the concerned Minister knows - the journalistic purposes. Several journalists associations have urged the Government to address that issue. They want journalistic purposes also included in data processing and it is not too late. We have had serious amendments done in the Committee Stage at the eleventh hour. I remember, in the Debate on the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution, the Debate was put off for half an hour and serious amendments were made. It was adopted. Even now, it is possible for you to make these three important changes to this Bill so that we will all together congratulate the Government on a well achieved feat.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you, Hon. Member. Concluding remarks on the Second Reading of the Data Protection Bill to be made by the Hon. Minister, M.U.M. Ali Sabry. You have 22 minutes.

[4.01 p.m.] ... ( ) ( ... - ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry - Minister of Justice) Hon. Presiding Member. First of all, let me thank all of you who have come up with constructive views on this important Bill. But we must first say that we have not adopted a confrontational attitude in this. The fact that we are moving a number of Committee Stage Amendments in regard to the establishment of the Data Protection Authority itself, while giving it specific powers, restrictions as well as qualifications, shows that we are willing to listen. But, the Hon. M.A. Sumanthirran and all of us know that there is nothing called "a perfect law. If you wait for that perfect law, just like you waited during the last Parliament for the PTA and the counter-terrorism law, it will never come. Therefore, let us take this and move on.

325 326

Let me also take you very carefully through these concerns. Most of these concerns that we are expressing today are not really founded. With due respect, I know the Hon. Sumanthiran did not articulate in that precision because I presume that he has read it and therefore there is no such a huge concern about journalistic rights because there is nothing called journalistic rights. In this country, journalists rights and the peoples rights - freedom of expression -are one and the same. The journalists do not have a special right or anything beyond that. They have certain amount of privileges.

Let me quote from the famous judgment of Victor Ivon v. Sarath N. Silva, Attorney-General and Another. I states,

"The freedom of the press is not a distinct fundamental right, but is part of the freedom of speech and expression, including publication, which Article 14 (1) (a) has entrenched for everyone alike. It surely does allow the pen of the journalist to be used as a mighty sword to rip open the facades which hide misconduct and corruption, but it is a two-edged weapon which he must wield with care not to wound the innocent while exposing the guilty."

Therefore, you cannot give something which is not entitled specifically and then make use of it in a manner which is being currently used by many. So, those restrictions are important and we cannot give a freedom of a wild ass because we know what happened with that kind of freedom. Therefore, it is important, if someone could carefully go through this Bill. May I invite you to go through the provisions of Clause 5 in the Bill. It states, I quote:

The processing of personal data shall be lawful if a controller is in compliance with - (a) any condition specified in Schedule I hereto;

May I ask the Hon. Member, to go through Schedule I. One Hon. Member who has made certain remarks prior to this in this House told that you have to have a prior contract or consent which is a misnomer. In Schedule I, under Conditions for Lawful Processing, there are many other provisions such as consent, contract, processing necessary for compliance with legal obligations; processing is necessary to respond to an emergency that threatens the life, health or safety of the data subject or another natural person and processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest and so on. Therefore, if you use it bona fide for correct purpose, there is enough exception in this.

May I also invite your attention to Clause 35 of this Bill. It states, I quote:

"35. Exemptions, restrictions or derogations to the provisions of this Act shall not be allowed except where such an exemption, restriction or derogation is prescribed by regulations and respects the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society for-"

Under that, there are subsections (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e). Subsection (e) states, I quote:

"(e) the protection of the rights and fundamental freedoms of persons, particularly the freedom of expression and the right to information."

So, it is a misnomer. I do not think that it is being properly studied and read before commenting on that. So, freedom of expression entrenched in the Article 14 of the Constitution itself is protected. The Right to Information Act is protected. Of course, the Right to Information Act per se has limitations. We all know that. This is not a new position. Most of us know that.

The other misnomer that I picked when I was listening is that Sri Lankan Law does not provide or protect privacy. That is not true. Sri Lankan Law, time and again, since 52 NLR, the Supreme Court has ruled that the right to privacy is prevalent in our law. May I invite your the attention to the case of Nadarajah v. Obesekera [52 NLR 276] in 1971 where the notion of invasion of privacy was discussed. It was recognized that the right of an individual to personal space exists. Similarly, it was discussed in the case of Hewamanne v. Attorney General in 1999. We all know, the Court of Appeal also -with regard to The Sunday Times case - accepted the fact that this right to privacy prevails in this country. We are doing it in terms of this. I am glad that none of Members of the Opposition are saying that this is not a necessary piece of legislation. I must give that credit to the Members of the Opposition. All of them welcome this piece of legislation. That is a great consensus. They all agree that this is a necessary piece of legislation on infrastructure which is necessary in the digital era, for us to protect our privacy ; for people to protect their privacy and to prevent public being exploited and misused. We saw all these things all over the world.

Sometimes, in countries like France, Germany, England and even in the USA, data has been used to go against the will of the people and to create a difference of a public opinion using this technology as in the case of Cambridge Analytica and other infamous cases that we all we know. In countries like France and Germany, up to 20 million Francs could be imposed as penalty. Therefore, this is a necessary tool. Why are we brining this in? If we read this very carefully, this is not something that the Hon. Minister or the Government sat and drafted.

That is not so. This has been drafted through a very comprehensive transparent process, a consultative process which was involved thorough professionals. We have again and again mentioned that particular fact because this is necessary for us. But there has to be an end to this. Otherwise, it will be open-ended and you will never bring this in.

Therefore, I believe, there is nothing call a perfect legislation. Todays perfect legislation may not be perfect for tomorrow. Therefore, we cannot sit and wait tomorrow to come to do the legislation. We must do this legislation. That is how we can bring it forward. For example, today we discuss it and I think, tomorrow we are bringing in some amendments to the Land Development Ordinance after 56 years. We all know that women have no right to inheritance. We all know only the eldest in the family, irrespective of whether he had developed and lived and looked after the elderly, have the

327 328

[ . .. ]

2022 09

inheritance right. But we are changing that. For 56 years, we made five attempts, but it never happened. We have been struggling to change the MMDA for 60 years. It is very difficult. Therefore, I say to take it in that spirit.

This is the idea of this Bill. It states under the Preamble, I quote:

"WHEREAS it has become necessary to facilitate the growth and innovation in the digital economy in Sri Lanka whilst protecting the personal data rights of the data subjects:

AND WHEREAS it has become necessary to improve interoperability among personal data protection frameworks as well as to strengthen cross-border co-operation among personal data protection enforcement authorities:

AND WHEREAS it has become necessary for the government of Sri Lanka to provide for a legal framework to provide for mechanisms for the protection of personal data of data subjects ensuring consumer trust and safeguarding privacy whilst respecting domestic written laws and applicable international legal instruments:"

So, as we have agreed so far , this is an overwhelmingly forward-looking, progressive and a necessary legislation. We must congratulate the Hon. Minister for taking the lead in that and getting it done today. We can continue to talk about it, but we will never have it. I know there were a couple of concerns you expressed. I have already dealt with those concerns. I am saying those concerns are adequately addressed. Even more so, we are open for suggestions. I am saying, let us resolve it today. I discussed with the Hon. Minister who had presented it today and the Hon. Minister of Mass Media. If the Media personnel in this country and the journalists have a legitimate concern, as I told earlier, in terms of Section 35, it is important that I read the Sinhala part of it. This is totally unfounded. If you feel that your rights are threatened, we are still willing to sit, talk to you and if amendments are necessary, we are willing to do that. It is important to understand one further thing. Even an amendment is not necessary, in terms of the Clause 43 of the Bill, the Hon. Minister is empowered by regulation to do so. So, what is necessary is an amendment to the First Schedule of the Act. So, if necessary, we will not hesitate to do so as a Government because none of these things were done by the Minister himself sitting and writing it. The widest possible consultative process was adopted; a professional team was appointed as the drafting team. Thereafter, a consultative process was adopted. There was a specialized - a specified team which was looking at it headed by Justice K.T. Chitrasiri. Thereafter, seven consultative processes took place. Thirty written requests came in. I know the Bar Association of Sri Lanka had a full-day seminar on these things. All these things were taken into consideration.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Speaker, I just want to ask a question. Thank you, Hon. Minister, for the clarifications.

On the Authority itself - as I made out the case - we are talking about the protection of data of the citizen. My concern I said was wider, protection from government, not which government, but protection from government, because sometimes States can become autocratic over time and you can have autocratic leaders. So, when you have data and they are held in different places, one concern is the collation of the data, then who uses the data and how they use it. I mean, we have seen cases around the world how this has happened. When Mr. Sumanthiran raised that issue, you said that you are taking the words, government control out, which I think is a very good thing, but actually there is no mechanism. I am looking at this on the background, the principle, of the Nineteenth Amendment. There were mechanisms. So, the President or the Minister can appoint; they can propose or nominate the names, but, there were independent mechanisms to check on the persons. Similarly, here, in the earlier draft - this process has been going on and this has been quite long-drawn-out, I accept that - I saw that there were some proposals. So, what is your view? Can we put some mechanisms in so that it does not totally depend on the executive arm of Government?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) Hon. Wickramaratne, we have moved on from the Nineteenth Amendment. There were discussions and we all know what happened during the Nineteenth Amendment unfortunately, when you had two, three power centres. I think we are all suffering today because of that kind of a foundation that we had. There were good things also. But, somebody has to appoint and we have laid down their powers and qualifications. You cannot appoint anyone from anywhere: their qualifications have been stated; their roles, regulations and the powers have been defined. Whatever the regulations - rules rather - they are going to draft, they have to be published in the Gazette, Minister has to approve that, then it has to come to Parliament and thereafter, Parliament has to approve it. So, there is no authoritarian power being given to this particular Authority.

Therefore, I think, given the circumstance where we are now, President and even the Ministers are given powers to appoint boards and the competent authority all over. That happens from 1977 onwards with the setting up of Mahaweli Authority. We all know that through the Mahaweli Authority, something which you planned to do in 30 years, you managed to do that in 3 to 7 years because of those powers which were conferred on that Authority. Therefore, it is a necessary thing for us to do. Do not worry about it. I am sure, and I am certain, that we will use it for the proper purpose.
