When he decided on a course of action, Sir, he did not consider the element of popularity. In fact, many of the things that he did cost him a great deal in political terms and he knew that that would happen.

Samaraweera categorically said that non-alignment is obsolete, it is outdated and that it no longer serves a useful purpose in the contemporary world. That was his conviction and he did not hesitate to give expression to that belief. We do not agree with that point of view. The Non-Aligned Movement is something with which Sri Lankan leaders like the late Prime Minister (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike were prominently associated. The Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka, Jawaharlal Nehru of India, Nasser of Egypt, Sukarno of Indonesia, Archbishop Makarios of Cyprus, each of them was a colossus in formulating the principles that gave life and substance to the Non-Aligned Movement.

Mangala Samaraweera believed that international bodies must be given an overarching role with regard to the affairs of this country. He held that conviction very sincerely, he stuck to it, he adhered to it and he knew that it was not at all a popular point of view. Indeed, he did something which I do not think any Foreign Minister in any country did at any other time. That is, when a Resolution was brought in respect of Sri Lanka, a Resolution that was very sharply critical of the countrys armed forces, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera decided not only to support that Resolution, but to cosponsor that Resolution. And I know that the officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs very strongly advised the Minister against embarking on that course of action, but he believed that it was the right thing to do. We do not think that it is the right thing to do, but he did. He did not, for a moment, expect that to be popular; he did not, for a moment, believe that that would advance his political career. That was furthest from his thoughts; he regarded it as utterly immaterial and he did it. His view was that issues of reconciliation must be handed over to international bodies and that that was the way to achieve credibility. The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella said that at that time, no Resolution was brought against Sri Lanka. Obviously, no Resolution would be brought against Sri Lanka if you are prepared to hand everything over lock, stock and barrel to be decided by international bodies. That is an ideology which we believe to be not correct because we believe fundamentally, that reconciliation must be addressed in keeping with the culture, the historical antecedents and the social traditions of each country.

So, we believe that in evolving solutions - these are very sensitive matters - local conditions must play a leading part. That is why local institutions like the Office on Missing Persons, the Office for Reparations, the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation, the Steering Committee on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16 of the Sustainable Development Council of Sri Lanka, which is very important, and the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka must play a vital role in evolving solutions which are acceptable to the people of this country.

    "text": "The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera rejected non-alignment - I had discussed it with him - because he felt non-alignment was a concept that came up during the Cold War and with the disappearance of the Soviet Union, you could no longer take that view. \"What we are going to be, we should work out\", he said. I had discussions with him and there were things I agreed to and did not. Even in respect of the UN Human Rights Resolutions, firstly, he stood by the stand that was taken during the Chandrika Kumaratunga Government when they moved to ban the LTTE and during what took place when the current Prime Minister was the then President. He went along with that. He was against the LTTE; he was completely against the LTTE. What he did there was to try and get a Resolution in favour of Sri Lanka, keeping in line with the Joint Statement of the UN Secretary-General and our President at that time. That is what he moved towards, and there were a lot of discussions. Sir, I must first tell one thing, that the whole Government agreed to it, everyone who sat in that Cabinet agreed to it. No one can say no because in New York, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera was the one who negotiated it. He and the then President both spoke to me. I was in Colombo - I think Mr. Sagala Ratnayaka and my Secretary, Mr. Saman Ekanayake were in my office - and when they approved it, I discussed it further with some of the Ambassadors here and we came to the Cabinet. So, no one can wash their hands; we all were responsible. That much I must say. So, he was the one who originated it and he was the one who discussed it. Certainly, we had a value system, that we should have reconciliation. But, there was one thing I told him and he agreed, that there is going to be no war trials as we have not signed the Rome Convention, that we are not going to sign it either and",

Mangala tweeted, True Buddhists must unite now against the Talibanization of our great philosophy of peace and love of all beings. No Buddhist can condone a statement to stone another human being to death, even if it emanates from the robed orders. That was Mangala, that was true Mangala. That was his courage of conviction.

Mr. Prasad Kariyawasam says this in his tribute: This approach was aimed at bringing all action on alleged rights violations in Sri Lanka away and out of Geneva and New York, to be handled exclusively on Sri Lankan soil. It was expected that this locally designed inclusive approach would not only revive international recognition for Sri Lankas Judiciary but would create internationally recognized truth seeking platforms and evidence to vindicate all those wrongly accused and provide appropriate redress to those wronged during conflict in Sri Lanka. This approach would have also restored the reputation of Sri Lankan security forces internationally, opening up opportunities for further international engagement such as UN peacekeeping assignments. The reputation of the institutions of the Army, Navy and Air Force that had been tarnished internationally, allegedly as institutions that do not credibly investigate allegations, would have been restored through this process.",

There was a time when people made disparaging statements on political platforms about sexual minorities. When people of sexual orientation were being targeted by insensitive homophobic comments made on political platforms, to them, Mangala responded proudly and very correctly saying, Yes, I am so, and I am not ashamed to accept it. I am proud of being so instead of being a thief, a murderer and a fraudster. That was Mangala. There are many politicians who talk tongue in cheek, little realizing that they are targeting people with stigma and discrimination. These qualities in Mangala - his openness, his clarity of thought, his comradery, his wit and his humour - were what endeared all of us to him.

Even when he was a Minister in the Maithripala Sirisena-Ranil Wickremasinghe Government, I was critical of him because of a view that he himself shared in this House and outside, which was that he did not want international investigations to take place, that he did not believe that the Sri Lankan military should be exposed to an international inquiry. His efforts were, in fact, to make sure that, if at all, an internal inquiry takes place, but not an international one. So, I was critical of that position because that is not the position that I agree with. So, when I heard the speech of Mr. Rahul Gandhi and when Mangala Samaraweeras name came to mind, I was wondering how it could have come to my mind. After all, I was critical of him, I had critical ideas of him and that was when I realized that his name came to my mind because of what he said after he left the mainstream political parties. I have seen and heard several of his interviews both in Sinhala and English - I do not miss them - and realized that it was an unhindered Managala Samaraweera who was speaking after he came out of these mainstream political parties.",

I saw in him, after he left mainstream politics, a man who thought that this country was getting destroyed, a man who thought that if this country went down the path of the last 74 years, then we are going to scrape the bottom of the barrel. A man who thought to be a patriot, a genuine Sri Lankan and has the best interest of Sri Lanka at heart is not to promote divisive politics, but rather pursue a vision for Sri Lanka which can unite all, for people like Gajan Ponnambalam also to say, Well, hang on here. This vision that this man talks of has a place even for me and my vision, where I want the Tamils in Sri Lanka to belong\". That, I think, was the greatness in the man. I heard so many speeches here today and have read so many condolence messages of him describing him in so many terms, but it is the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, after he left the mainstream political parties, who was free enough to voice his own genuine opinion of the direction in which this country must take that I could find myself subscribing to.

It is the only quality, in my view, Sir - a quality and a vision that say that we have had enough of the past - that can save this country. We must have a clean break and then we must think anew; we must not be afraid of thinking anew because we have hit rock bottom in following the past. And, that sort of logic, if it does not arise any time soon, then, Mangala samaraweera - his personality, his ideology and his vision - and his contribution, it can only be said, would be a waste and that would be tragic.

I was only about 26 years of age when I came to this House and there was such an amount of enthusiasm in the North and the East that something would finally come about with regard to a political solution. But, when I came to Parliament, there was an Opposition, to which the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera belonged, which was vociferously opposed to that Ceasefire Agreement and that peace process. When you heard the speeches of the Opposition, it was quite frightening; quite honestly, as a new Member of Parliament, it was quite frightening and very disheartening. In those circumstances, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera met me down the Opposition corridors and I did not want to speak to him because, you know, at that time, you take politics quite personal, that when you have Members of the Opposition express such opposing views to you, to what you expect out of this peace process, then, you somehow do not want to associate with them. But, he actually made it a point to come up to me and say, Do not worry Gajan, things will ultimately work out. He said that purely because of this impression I had of the Opposition at that time. Unfortunately, things did not work out. But, that was the man, he reached out to people who he thought were vulnerable, needed help, needed a hand of reassurance to see something positive come out of this mess. And that vision, this country must start to groom because if that does not happen, I am afraid, we would go down the precipice.",

My first encounter with him was a spat; I criticized him and called him a \"fashion designer\" for what he was trying to do with economics long time back. And then he hit me back hard, called a press conference and decimated me. Many years later, I met him at \"The Bayleaf \" and Harpo Gooneratne said, Harsha, Mangala is there. I think you should go and talk to him, meet him. So, I went up to him, he gave me a hug and I returned it. He said, Harsha, there is no need to fight, is there? Let us have a drink. That is how I actually physically met him for the first time.",

When we worked for the campaign of the last Presidential Election, at which the Hon. Sajith Premadasa contested and which the Hon. Nalin Bandara Jayamaha spoke about, we proposed to strengthen the reforms we had initiated for the nation as a whole, which had fallen victim to ill planning of both the economy and the society. Mangala, even though he faded out towards the end of that campaign and decided later not to contest the General Election, then reignited his ideology, which the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe spoke about earlier, with young people through the movements called the \"Radical Centre\" and the \"Freedom Hub\".",

Mangala Samaraweera and my elder brother Chrysantha Wickramaratne were classmates. I came to know Mangala as a politician. I had the unique opportunity of being his State Minister of Finance when he was the Minister of Finance. Mangalas achievements in politics as a Minister, as a Foreign Minister in postwar reconciliation, in building Sri Lankas international image, getting the GSP plus back to Sri Lanka, getting the fishing ban removed - these are all part of history now. He took over as Finance Minister but he had a secret. He had a team and he had friends. Dr. R.H.S.Samaratunga and the officials were really the backbone of what he was doing. He had people like Mr. Mohamed Ali Hussen who handled the media. He had Mano Tittawella, Deshal de Mel, Daniel Alfonso and many others who were advisers and some of those were young people. He had many friends too who really contributed - Krishantha Cooray, Malik Samarawickrema and Ruwan Ferdinandez of his team particularly come to my mind. Mangala took over as Finance Minister in a very difficult environment. We had the worst drought in 40 years. The debt service payments were enormous. Governments revenue was at its lowest - it was at about 11 per cent. Government expenditure was 17 per cent to 20 per cent of which salaries, wages, interest payments, welfare and transfers were about 16 per cent and he had no discretion over those. But Mangala had a principle. The principle he had was, Remove the disincentives; let businesses make money. Tax them and provide social services. His achievements were - the new Inland Revenue Act of 2017, which was a landmark legislation; income tax to corporates collapsed just to 3 bans; SMEs got less than Rs. 500 million turnover; 14 per cent tax - the lowest in the world; Withholding Tax on professionals, doctors, lawyers; expanding the tax net from Rs. 1 million to",

Greater independence to the Central Bank but with accountability of the Monetary Board; disciplines on deficit financing on money printing and legal framework for inflation targeting - all were planned when the government changed. Mangala got me as the State Minister of Finance when he was going into the Finance Ministry. He did not want to go into the Finance Ministry, but the Hon. Prime Minister insisted that he should go there. Mangala was not an economist; he was not an accountant; he was not a finance specialist; but Managala was a true leader. He listened to the experts and came to his decisions based on the technical advice. The Constitutional coup in 2018 disrupted the further reforms he wanted to do in the Customs Department and the Excise Department. He was contemplating a rule-based system for this country and to take away discretion.",

Generally, when we take a Vote of Condolence, the list of speakers are not that long and also the number of speeches are fairly short. But today, when we speak of someone like the late Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, I think, the whole day will be taken up and maybe, a following day also might be required if we go to accommodate the entire list of speakers who wish to speak. That shows, Hon. Presiding Member, the level of respect, the level of dignity that he earned as a Minister, as a Member of Parliament and as a human being. The level of respect and regard he had, independent of the political background, says a lot about his character and it is displayed by the fact that there are many speakers including young Parliamentarians, new Parliamentarians and senior Parliamentarians listed to speak on this Vote of Condolence.",

    "text": "Sir, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera was known as a kingmaker and also he was a master of media; some would say he was a spin doctor, a master strategist and a political maestro. I remember meeting Hon. Mangala Samaraweera when I was very young, in 1990, when I was back from the boarding school for a holiday in Sri Lanka. He was having breakfast with my father, the late Hon. Gamini Dissanayake. After he left, I remember asking my father who that young smart gentleman was. He said, Oh! That was Hon. Mangala Samaraweera. He is a young, up-and-coming Member of Parliament from the SLFP. So, I thought to myself, my father being a senior prominent Minister in the UNP Government, why was he entertaining, why was he having politicians and Members of Parliament, especially, from the SLFP. But he said, Son, keep an eye on Mangala. He is a man to watch. One day, he will be a national leader in this country. Those were the words of my father regarding Mangala Samaraweera and after that, I did not meet him. My father was assassinated in 1994 and thereafter, I remember my mother, Srima Dissanayake, called uncle Mangala many, many times to get his support to set up the Gamini Dissanayake Foundation. He helped our family immensely to set up the Gamini Dissnayake Foundation. Whenever my mother used to call him and say, Mangala we need your help; we need to get this passed in the Cabinet; we need to get a video of Gamini done; we need to get some pictures from the Ministry, will you help us?, immediately, I repeat, immediately, within a matter of days, it was done. My mother did not need to speak to him again and again to remind.",

Mangala Samaraweera wrote to the then Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa twice - correct me if I am wrong, there are senior Members here - based on the way the war was conducted. The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera was not happy with the way things were going on, the way the war was conducted. He wrote twice to the then Prime Minister, the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, which resulted him being getting sacked from that Cabinet. I think he lost the portfolio of Foreign Minister for writing those letters. Thereafter, in 2015, in the Good Governance Government, he was again the Foreign Minister. I think he initiated some efforts to reconcile the divided country; he initiated some efforts to bring Sri Lanka the glory that it was always supposed to achieve. I think, through reconciliation, he tried to bring about some change. He even started dialogues with diaspora. Certain diaspora groups that are being banned right now, he even went and met them and started dialogues with them. Unfortunately, the reconciliation efforts that he started, he could not successfully conclude.",
