.. ( () .. - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of Foreign) Hon. Speaker, the Hon. Prime Minister, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and the other speakers who participated in this Vote of Condolence this morning paid tribute to various qualities of the late Hon. Mangala Samaraweera and the contribution that he made to the political life of our country. With your permission, Sir, I would like to add a few brief thoughts of my own.

If you ask me what is the quality of the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera which I remember most vividly today, I would say that it was his ability to swim against the current. Throughout his political life, that was the capability which the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera demonstrated in the fullest measure. When he decided on a course of action, Sir, he did not consider the element of popularity. In fact, many of the things that he did cost him a great deal in political terms and he knew that that would happen. He knew that what he was doing would not appeal to the vast majority of the people, but that did not deter him; he acted according to his conscience. His conscience was his guide.

The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella said that he was not quite sure why the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera made the decision in August, 2020 not to contest the General Election. I do not know and it is not a matter that I discussed with him, but my own hunch is that he felt that mainstream political parties right across the spectrum, whatever the party maybe, did not adequately reflect his own convictions and aspirations. He felt that there was a

869 870

gulf, a divide which could not be bridged. He could not, in all honesty and sincerity, identify with the published policies of the orthodox political parties in the country. I think that that is the reason why he made what was obviously a momentous decision. He decided not to contest the election, not to contest from the Matara District or from anywhere else. And he went, I would not say into retirement, but he withdrew from active party politics. Sir, that is because he was not prepared to sacrifice his conscience on the altar of political power. That is saying a lot. Especially, in the times in which we live today, when there is so much cynicism, I think that is a quality which we must certainly remember on this occasion and pay tribute to a personality who was able to behave in that manner.

The Hon. Sajith Premadasa, the Leader of the Opposition, also said in the course of his speech that there are many views of the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera with which he also does not agree. I would say that that is our own view. Nevertheless, we respect him; we respect him because of the consistency with which he adhered to his views. Some of his views, we profoundly disagree with; we do not feel able, as a Government, to act in accordance with those views.

If I may give a couple of examples, Sir, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera had a very definite view about the Non-Aligned Movement. We discussed his contribution in Foreign Policy. Both the Prime Minister, the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, and the Hon. Leader of the Opposition referred to his initiatives in the domain of Foreign Policy. The Hon. Samaraweera categorically said that non-alignment is obsolete, it is outdated and that it no longer serves a useful purpose in the contemporary world. That was his conviction and he did not hesitate to give expression to that belief. We do not agree with that point of view. The Non-Aligned Movement is something with which Sri Lankan leaders like the late Prime Minister (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike were prominently associated. The Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka, Jawaharlal Nehru of India, Nasser of Egypt, Sukarno of Indonesia, Archbishop Makarios of Cyprus, each of them was a colossus in formulating the principles that gave life and substance to the Non-Aligned Movement. My own view, Sir, is that the non-aligned ideology, that philosophy is absolutely crucial, perhaps, it is more important today than it was at any other time in the history of the world.

Today, we live in a world that is not unipolar, not even bipolar, but it is multipolar. In conducting the Foreign Policy of the Government of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, we believe that we should approach issues in a particular way, not belonging to this camp or that camp, this power bloc or that power bloc. Our approach is to look at each issue on its merits. We may agree with this side on one particular issue, but we may tell them in all candour that on some other issue, we find ourselves totally unable to conquer with their point of view. So, the essence of non-alignment is objectivity and dispassionate judgement. The

world needs it today and to dismiss it in a cavalier fashion as something that was suited to a bygone age and has no practical utility or value in the world today is a point of view which we would not agree with.

Then, even more relevantly and importantly, the late Hon. Mangala Samaraweera believed that international bodies must be given an overarching role with regard to the affairs of this country. He held that conviction very sincerely, he stuck to it, he adhered to it and he knew that it was not at all a popular point of view. Indeed, he did something which I do not think any Foreign Minister in any country did at any other time. That is, when a Resolution was brought in respect of Sri Lanka, a Resolution that was very sharply critical of the countrys armed forces, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera decided not only to support that Resolution, but to cosponsor that Resolution. And I know that the officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs very strongly advised the Minister against embarking on that course of action, but he believed that it was the right thing to do. We do not think that it is the right thing to do, but he did. He did not, for a moment, expect that to be popular; he did not, for a moment, believe that that would advance his political career. That was furthest from his thoughts; he regarded it as utterly immaterial and he did it. His view was that issues of reconciliation must be handed over to international bodies and that that was the way to achieve credibility. The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella said that at that time, no Resolution was brought against Sri Lanka. Obviously, no Resolution would be brought against Sri Lanka if you are prepared to hand everything over lock, stock and barrel to be decided by international bodies. That is an ideology which we believe to be not correct because we believe fundamentally, that reconciliation must be addressed in keeping with the culture, the historical antecedents and the social traditions of each country. There is no size that fits everybody.

It is impractical to evolve a solution in Geneva and to impose it on the rest of the world; that will simply not work. And, that is the point of view which I will express at the 49th Session of the Human Rights Council which, Sir, commences on the 28th of February and Sri Lanka comes up on the agenda on the 3rd of March. So, we believe that in evolving solutions - these are very sensitive matters - local conditions must play a leading part. That is why local institutions like the Office on Missing Persons, the Office for Reparations, the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation, the Steering Committee on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16 of the Sustainable Development Council of Sri Lanka, which is very important, and the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka must play a vital role in evolving solutions which are acceptable to the people of this country. So, these are differences of opinions. The late Hon. Mangala Samaraweera had one view; we have a different view. The Hon. Sajith Premadasa conceded that.

But, that is not a reason to have less respect for the personality and the convictions of the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera. He did what he thought was right. We may not agree with it and we will not do it, but throughout his life, he did not consider expediency to be important. The

871 872

[ () ..

late Hon. Mangala Samaraweera probably had a bright political future ahead of him. He left us at a very young age. Undoubtedly, that is a loss to our country. He could aspire to high political office in the future; that was very much on the horizon, but he discarded it deliberately and consciously. He said, I do not want it because I do not agree with the policies of the established political parties. I, therefore, prefer to leave the domain of active politics. In fact, after he decided not to contest the elections, he formed a movement; he did not call it a political party. Sir, these are things that we must remember and appreciate on this occasion.

Sir, I appreciate the opportunity that you have given me to express my own views about the personality, the convictions of the late Hon. Mangala Samaraweera and I consider it my privilege to pay tribute to a personality who made an indelible impression on the political life of our country.

I thank you, Hon. Speaker.

The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera rejected non-alignment - I had discussed it with him - because he felt non-alignment was a concept that came up during the Cold War and with the disappearance of the Soviet Union, you could no longer take that view. "What we are going to be, we should work out", he said. I had discussions with him and there were things I agreed to and did not. Even in respect of the UN Human Rights Resolutions, firstly, he stood by the stand that was taken during the Chandrika Kumaratunga Government when they moved to ban the LTTE and during what took place when the current Prime Minister was the then President. He went along with that. He was against the LTTE; he was completely against the LTTE. What he did there was to try and get a Resolution in favour of Sri Lanka, keeping in line with the Joint Statement of the UN Secretary-General and our President at that time. That is what he moved towards, and there were a lot of discussions. Sir, I must first tell one thing, that the whole Government agreed to it, everyone who sat in that Cabinet agreed to it. No one can say no because in New York, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera was the one who negotiated it. He and the then President both spoke to me. I was in Colombo - I think Mr. Sagala Ratnayaka and my Secretary, Mr. Saman Ekanayake were in my office - and when they approved it, I discussed it further with some of the Ambassadors here and we came to the Cabinet. So, no one can wash their hands; we all were responsible. That much I must say. So, he was the one who originated it and he was the one who discussed it. Certainly, we had a value system, that we should have reconciliation. But, there was one thing I told him and he agreed, that there is going to be no war trials as we have not signed the Rome Convention, that we are not going to sign it either and

873 874

that within that framework, we should do it. How that reconciliation should turn out is where we -the Government and the different parties in the Opposition - have our differences. How that should be done is what we finally have to discuss. I am sure my Hon. Friend will mention something in that regard because reconciliation is necessary. The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera believed in that and we all believe in a Sri Lankan identity.

[11.40 a.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Speaker, we are gathered today to pay tribute to Mangala, who is not a run-of-the-mill politician, but a rare political personality, who, during the 30-plus years in which he participated in politics in this country, has left an indelible mark as a bold and enthusiastic politician who would not run away from controversy, if it happened to be conflicting with his ideals. Such a rare politician is rare indeed in the political firmament of this country.

So, when we rise to pay tribute to Mangala, we could talk about many of his achievements. But, when thousands of people pay tribute to him, let me start with a tribute paid by no less a person than Samantha Power, the former Permanent Representative of the US Government to the UN during the Obama Administration. She says this: I was devastated by Mangalas passing and these

881 882

days find myself craving his wise counsel, irrepressible mischief, and rare gift for friendship. I also miss knowing that Mangala is out there hustling, refusing ever to give up on the idea that people could change for the better, that his country could realise his ideals, and that the worlds nations could think - and act - beyond their immediate self-interest. These were the words that all of us would always approve and attest as a true amplification of Mangalas character.

Mangala was a go-to politician when there was a crisis; Mangala was a very astute strategist when it came to mobilizing people; Mangala was a person who could coin slogans to create enthusiasm among the masses; he was a kingmaker and was never Head of State or a Prime Minister, but he had all the hallmarks, credentials and qualities that should have even catapulted him to such positions. So, when he died, the tributes that poured in from all corners of the world and every section of Sri Lankan society were replete with the honour and dignity with which he had been held.

In remembering his trailblazing career, I certainly need to speak of some of those controversial moments in his political career, the controversial remarks that were not seen as remarks that should be made by a pragmatic politician. But, he was such a rare leader that he did not mince his words when he had to say the right thing.

In the post-Easter tragedy, he slammed a leading religious dignitary for making controversial comments targeting Muslims when he urged true Buddhists to unite against Talibanization of the religion. Mangala's message came days after this senior religious leader attached to one of religious Chapters in the hill-country said, The Muslims are destroying the country and called for their stoning and a boycott of Muslim-run shops and businesses. Mangala tweeted, True Buddhists must unite now against the Talibanization of our great philosophy of peace and love of all beings. No Buddhist can condone a statement to stone another human being to death, even if it emanates from the robed orders. That was Mangala, that was true Mangala. That was his courage of conviction. He comes from Matara where only less than 2 per cent are Muslims. He did not say this to please the voters; he did not say this to please or rather swell his vote bank. But, that was Mangala. His commitment was that.

As a Minister, I think he was somebody who achieved much in every portfolio he held. As the Telecommunication Minister, he introduced telecommunication reforms, the first PPP project in this country. He introduced the first regulator of a public utility, the TRC. That also paved the way for port sector reform. When he became Minister of Ports, he carried on from where he left in the telecommunication industry. When he became Foreign Minister, his achievements were many. But, I was very sorry to hear today, the current Foreign Minister, quite against tradition while speaking on the Vote of Condolence, criticizing Mangalas attempt to introduce UN Resolution 30/1,

saying that it exposed our armed forces to dangers. Sir, here, I must quote from a tribute by one of our celebrated diplomats in the country, Prasad Kariyawasam. In his tribute to Mangala, he refers to this particular matter. I must read this because, otherwise, no justice would be served to a person of Mangalas calibre. Mr. Prasad Kariyawasam says this in his tribute: This approach was aimed at bringing all action on alleged rights violations in Sri Lanka away and out of Geneva and New York, to be handled exclusively on Sri Lankan soil. It was expected that this locally designed inclusive approach would not only revive international recognition for Sri Lankas Judiciary but would create internationally recognized truth seeking platforms and evidence to vindicate all those wrongly accused and provide appropriate redress to those wronged during conflict in Sri Lanka. This approach would have also restored the reputation of Sri Lankan security forces internationally, opening up opportunities for further international engagement such as UN peacekeeping assignments. The reputation of the institutions of the Army, Navy and Air Force that had been tarnished internationally, allegedly as institutions that do not credibly investigate allegations, would have been restored through this process.

This was said by a person of the calibre of Prasad Kariyawasam, who was a former Permanent Representative to the UN and who held even the post of Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of this country. So, this is in defence of Mangala, when our current Foreign Minister, unfortunately, on a Vote of Condolence, said that Mangala let down the security forces in moving Resolution 30/1.

Having said that, Sir, may I also say this. Mangala was a person who was not duplicitous. He was never a man who would run away from the reality. There was a time when people made disparaging statements on political platforms about sexual minorities. When people of sexual orientation were being targeted by insensitive homophobic comments made on political platforms, to them, Mangala responded proudly and very correctly saying, Yes, I am so, and I am not ashamed to accept it. I am proud of being so instead of being a thief, a murderer and a fraudster. That was Mangala. There are many politicians who talk tongue in cheek, little realizing that they are targeting people with stigma and discrimination. These qualities in Mangala - his openness, his clarity of thought, his comradery, his wit and his humour - were what endeared all of us to him. If you entered his company, you would have found that it was always full of laughter; he had an infectious ability to enthrall everybody around him.

Of course, as a Finance Minister, his achievements were no less creditable than any other. He brought in monetary reforms, fiscal reforms and tax reforms. His achievements ended up in our country by, for the first time after 63 years, recording a surplus in the primary balance in our countrys fiscal records. Such were his achievements! So, he was not only a straightforward idealist, a politician, but was also a very clever trailblazer who changed the way politics existed in this country.

883 884

Now, Sir, I would like to end with this quote found in another tribute by one of his colleagues and friends, Prof. Rohan Samarajiva, a former Director General of Telecommunications. He says this: I grieve not for him, but for us left behind.

With those words, I conclude. Thank you, Sir. [.. 11.54 ( ) (The Hon. Karunadasa Kodithuwakku) , . . .

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I thank you, Hon. Speaker, for allotting me some time to speak on the Vote of Condolence of the late Hon. Mangala Samaraweera.

Sir, on the 02nd of February, I heard a speech made by Mr. Rahul Gandhi in the Lok Sabha, the Lower House of the Indian Parliament, where he called into question the direction that India was taking and the politics of India was going. He reminded the Members of the Lok Sabha

that in the Indian Constitution, India was described not as a nation, but as a "Union of States", and he said that what it means is, there must be negotiation and conversation between the Centre and the states and not the Centre ruling the states. Also, he said that the alternate vision that was being promoted in India was a kingdom and he condemned that and went on to make his speech. In my view, Sir, it was one of the most inspirational speeches that I have heard in recent times, but certainly of my generation too.

Sir, when I heard that speech, I immediately thought who is the person who belongs to the majority community in this country, Sri Lanka, whom I could think is capable of making such a speech, and the name "Mangala" came to my mind. Then, I thought harder because when the late Hon. Mangala Samaraweera was a Minister in various capacities in various Governments, I was critical of him. Even when he was a Minister in the Maithripala Sirisena-Ranil Wickremasinghe Government, I was critical of him because of a view that he himself shared in this House and outside, which was that he did not want international investigations to take place, that he did not believe that the Sri Lankan military should be exposed to an international inquiry. His efforts were, in fact, to make sure that, if at all, an internal inquiry takes place, but not an international one. So, I was critical of that position because that is not the position that I agree with. So, when I heard the speech of Mr. Rahul Gandhi and when Mangala Samaraweeras name came to mind, I was wondering how it could have come to my mind. After all, I was critical of him, I had critical ideas of him and that was when I realized that his name came to my mind because of what he said after he left the mainstream political parties. I have seen and heard several of his interviews both in Sinhala and English - I do not miss them - and realized that it was an unhindered Managala Samaraweera who was speaking after he came out of these mainstream political parties.

He had a sense of freedom, where he expressed a vision for Sri Lanka, that for the first time, I think, I could have thought of sharing with someone who belonged not only to the majority community, but also with someone who had been so prominent in office and politics in general. I saw in him, after he left mainstream politics, a man who thought that this country was getting destroyed, a man who thought that if this country went down the path of the last 74 years, then we are going to scrape the bottom of the barrel. A man who thought to be a patriot, a genuine Sri Lankan and has the best interest of Sri Lanka at heart is not to promote divisive politics, but rather pursue a vision for Sri Lanka which can unite all, for people like Gajan Ponnambalam also to say, Well, hang on here. This vision that this man talks of has a place even for me and my vision, where I want the Tamils in Sri Lanka to belong". That, I think, was the greatness in the man. I heard so many speeches here today and have read so many condolence messages of him describing him in so many terms, but it is the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, after he left the mainstream political parties, who was free enough to voice his own genuine opinion of the direction in which this country must take that I could find myself subscribing to. In that

887 888

[

2022 11

sense, Sir, in a House that is so divided, in a country that is so divided, to have a man, in fact, creating such positive impressions, I think, is a remarkable thing. It is a quality that, very unfortunately, I do not see in anyone in this House, a quality that, I think, this country is very sadly missing. It is the only quality, in my view, Sir - a quality and a vision that say that we have had enough of the past - that can save this country. We must have a clean break and then we must think anew; we must not be afraid of thinking anew because we have hit rock bottom in following the past. And, that sort of logic, if it does not arise any time soon, then, Mangala samaraweera - his personality, his ideology and his vision - and his contribution, it can only be said, would be a waste and that would be tragic. Sir, let me say, that that logic gives me a great sense of satisfaction.

I did not know the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera personally. I had the good occasion of meeting him three times and having conversations with him. I must tell you that the first time was in 2001 when I first got elected and came to this House. At that time, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera was a Member of the Opposition and the Hon. Ranil Wicremasinghe was the Prime Minister.

Then, the President was Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe had signed a Ceasefire Agreement with the LTTE. I was only about 26 years of age when I came to this House and there was such an amount of enthusiasm in the North and the East that something would finally come about with regard to a political solution. But, when I came to Parliament, there was an Opposition, to which the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera belonged, which was vociferously opposed to that Ceasefire Agreement and that peace process. When you heard the speeches of the Opposition, it was quite frightening; quite honestly, as a new Member of Parliament, it was quite frightening and very disheartening. In those circumstances, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera met me down the Opposition corridors and I did not want to speak to him because, you know, at that time, you take politics quite personal, that when you have Members of the Opposition express such opposing views to you, to what you expect out of this peace process, then, you somehow do not want to associate with them. But, he actually made it a point to come up to me and say, Do not worry Gajan, things will ultimately work out. He said that purely because of this impression I had of the Opposition at that time. Unfortunately, things did not work out. But, that was the man, he reached out to people who he thought were vulnerable, needed help, needed a hand of reassurance to see something positive come out of this mess. And that vision, this country must start to groom because if that does not happen, I am afraid, we would go down the precipice.

So, Sir, it is in that sense that I am able to take part in this Vote of Condolence of a man whom I, although not known personally, would certainly go on to respect to the utmost, a man, if he had survived, I have no doubt, would have created a new movement, a new vision and potentially a new beginning for this country. But, sadly, today, we have to instead mark our condolences on his death.

Sir, we certainly would like to extend our deepest condolences to his family, his friends and his followers and also appeal to the people who thought of him as a visionary and who felt so badly hurt with his demise not to give up and to stay on that path. If the ideology that the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera expressed after leaving the mainstream politics is going to be followed, then certainly, they will have partners on the side of the Tamils and, I am sure, on the side of the other minorities - the Muslims and the up-country Tamils - as well.

I thank you, Sir. [.. 12.16 ( ) (The Hon. Vijitha Herath) , . . 90 . , . , . .

Sir, Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.

Hon. Speaker, that is a quote by the late Martin Luther King, the civil rights leader of the USA. I have no other words than these to constitute the life and the work of my dear Friend, the late former Minister Mangala Samaraweera, whose life echoed those values of Martin Luther King.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) () . [1.40 p.m.] ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Sir, I did not know Mangala Samaraweera then other than that he was a distinguished old Royalist. My first encounter with him was a spat; I criticized him and called him a "fashion designer" for what he was trying to do with economics long time back. And then he hit me back hard, called a press conference and decimated me. Many years later, I met him at "The Bayleaf " and Harpo Gooneratne said, Harsha, Mangala is there. I think you should go and talk to him, meet him. So, I went up to him, he gave me a hug and I returned it. He said, Harsha, there is no need to fight, is there? Let us have a drink. That is how I actually physically met him for the first time.

I am honoured and privileged to speak a few words about that man whom I admired and wish I had the opportunity to work with him for many more years to come in the future. When we worked for the campaign of the last Presidential Election, at which the Hon. Sajith Premadasa contested and which the Hon. Nalin Bandara Jayamaha spoke about, we proposed to strengthen the reforms we had initiated for the nation as a whole, which had fallen victim to ill planning of both the economy and the society. Mangala, even though he faded out towards the end of that campaign and decided later not to contest the General Election, then reignited his ideology, which the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe spoke about earlier, with young people through the movements called the "Radical Centre" and the "Freedom Hub".

Mangala was always a trailblazer and most Hon. Members who spoke about Mangala today mentioned that fact. He feared no one and was a man who had the courage of steel, if you may substitute with something that we use in normal parlance, to stand for what he believed in.

The reforms he started on the economy were truly significant. He understood the meaning of fiscal discipline. I recall, Hon. Chair, the debates at the Government Group meetings on certain issues dealing with finance, and some Members would argue with him saying, You do not know what you are doing! You have to give jobs, you have to distribute this or that. He would listen and reply, I know what I am doing and would continue to go ahead and do what he planned to do. Since the 1950s, it was only during Mangala Samaraweeras stint as the Minister of Finance that Sri Lanka saw a primary surplus in 2018 and 2019, helped by our Colleague, the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne. It was a huge deal. You know, he was not an economist; we all knew that. But, he was a hell of a smart man. He was able to figure things out very quickly. Having held ministerial portfolios since he was a young man, he knew how to get things done. He was able to figure things out and with

regard to the economy, he listened to advice. Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga or "Sam", as we used to call him, would discuss things with him every day. He would go to him with a big file and tell him, Sir, the issue is this or that. He had a great team at the Ministry of Finance, which he respected, but would not always blindly agree with.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . .

( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Thank you, Sir.

He would ask, Why?" or "Who? I recall one instance. We were trying to get the National Salaries and Cadre Commission to approve the 1,997 staff of the "Suwa Seriya" ambulance service that we had started. It had taken eight months and one particular position was not defined properly. That position was called Pilot and they said there cannot be pilots driving vehicles! Pilots, you know, fly aircraft.

After nine months of discussion, I had no choice, but to go to Mangalas office. I opened the door - he was with some people - and basically let out my frustration and said, Go and do it yourself! If you are not able to fix this for me, I am walking out! or something like that. Then, he said, Harsha, calm down. Let us sort this out. That is how he was able to fix problems which were almost unfixable.

He had other advisers. Deshal de Mel is a competent young economist and somebody he relied on. Then, the late Mano Tittawella was with him for a while. He also consulted many other people. Of course, he had people like Ruwan Ferdinandez and all those media folk who knew everything and how to communicate. He relied on them for advice. He was a great communicator himself, perhaps, the best we have seen. Like I was saying, he consulted various people - CEOs, senior professionals, business people and the Chambers. That is how he figured out the game plan to put this countrys economy on the right trajectory. Then, he also had Malik. Malik Samarawickrama, I think, was one of his closest Cabinet Colleagues, both of whom were liberal reformists and oriented strategists. I recall going to see him in his office a multiple times and at the back of his office, there was a little room called the pantry or the lunch room. If I would go to see him during lunch, I would see Malik and him sitting there enjoying takeout "sushi" on a multiple occasions.

Mangala always welcomed the well-articulated professional advice of Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, who was never a politician, but yet, a prudent monetary-policy man. He, along with the Deputy Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe, would on many an occasion have rather heated debates in the regular Monday morning meetings at the Temple Trees chaired by the then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe. For juniors like us, it was

897 898

fascinating to watch and learn how things were resolved with national interest at heart.

I recall vividly the series of events during the coup in October, 2018. Eran and I joined Mangala in the early morning breakfast media conferences we held at his Stanmore Crescent house. He was aghast at how the illegal Government was messing things up. After the legitimate Government was reinstated and Mangala again became the Minister of Finance, the economic situation looked bad. I recall very well Mangala telling me, Harsha, there is a US Dollars 500 million bond that needs to be paid in a week!" The illegal Government had kicked the IMF Agreement aside. Government securities to the amount of, I think, US Dollars 500 million had flown out; credit ratings had been downgraded. Mangala said, We need to get back on track. We need to speak to the IMF and get back on the programme. We need to think about the future. He wanted the credit ratings to come back up

Then he said, Let us go and meet Christine Lagarde and he invited Dr. Coomaraswamy and myself. I recall that it was a very cold winter morning where we were supposed to have the meeting. You know, Sir, due to four feet of snow, DC was closed. It was not like Toronto in Ontario, Sir, where you were, and even with four feet of snow, the city would run. I remember that meeting vividly the next day where he met Ms. Lagarde. They had so much respect for him and agreed to all his requests! I realized what a great politician he was at that meeting, how he was able to speak to the leaders of the world, get his point across and get them to agree.

Not only with Ms. Lagarde, but as his junior at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sir, I had an amazing opportunity to be part of the many discussions he had with global leaders. I get goosebumps when I think about those meetings. He had a few favourites though. I think his most favourite among all those dignitaries he knew was Ms. Samantha Power, a member of President Obamas Cabinet. I remember what happened one evening after the dinner at Mangalas house at Stanmore Crescent. The Hon. J.C. Alawathuwala mentioned how Ms. Samantha Power, though she had so much of work and was in the middle of writing some major volume, took a day or two off just to fly all the way down here for the celebration of Mangalas 30 years in politics and book launch. We had an amazing discussion. It would have been 1.30 or 2.00 o clock in the morning when we stopped. The discussion was about American politics. He discussed matters from Alexander Hamiltons days. - [Interruption.] I know Sir, you are telling me that I have to hurry up and wind up.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The late Hon. Mangala Samaraweera was so popular that there are about 30 speakers lined up to speak today. So, we need to be mindful of the time, Hon. Member.

Thank you.

( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Okay, Sir.

It was not known, but much later was divulged by Ms. Power how he, behind the scenes and on a personal basis, actively worked on getting the Pfizer vaccine to Sri Lanka. She wrote about it in her tribute when he passed away.

Working with him was such a pleasure. I have said it before, Sir, but I will say it again: Mangala was my best boss, given how senior politicians try to take credit for the things their juniors do. I want to give you one example. It was April, 2017. We were working really hard to get the GSP Plus back. Everything was on track and then, a Resolution was brought by two MEPs to deny Sri Lanka the GSP Plus concession. He told me, Go and meet these people. Deal with it. I will sort out everything from here. You speak to them. All his connections, he put to use. I recall how Nirj Deva, who was an MEP from the UK, Rodney Perera, who was our Ambassador in Brussels, and all the diplomatic community there came to Mangalas rescue - I was just a point man to manage the situation- and we beat Resolutions 436 to 119. I was ecstatic and I recall calling Mangala from the canteen in the European Parliament. I said, Mangala, Mangala, we got it! Why do you not announce it? He said, Harsha, it can wait till you come. You come and have a press conference and announce it. Which politician in this dog-eat-dog world would do that, Sir? That was Mangala Samaraweera. In fact, I became his friend more than a work colleague. Sir, I will take only a couple of minutes more and stop.

He had enjoyed time at his home on a couch, maybe, with a couple of others, a dog and a few scotches, having a lengthy discussion on politics. I only wish I could have worked with him a lot more after the next change.

Even though some of his ideas did not quite gel with that of our new political party, I am one hundred percent certain that we would have somehow found the way to work together. After all, he dedicated his life to pursue a vision for a multiethnic, multireligious and multilingual Sri Lanka, which, he always said, would guarantee equal rights, justice and dignity for all. Dear Mangala, wherever you maybe, let me give you my word, that it is my vision too.

In closing, Sir, I wish to convey my deepest condolences on his death to his sister Jayanthi who was, like the Hon. Rauff Hakeem said, always with him, continued to be at his side and all others who were part of his family. He was a liberal man created for himself.

May Mangala attain the supreme bliss of Nirvana!

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . Let me reiterate that the speakers list is very long today. Therefore, I kindly remind every Hon. Member to make their points as short as possible, though we can talk about our Friend, the late Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, for not just days, but for weeks.

The next speaker is the Hon. Eran Wickramartne. [2.06 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Presiding Member, the late Hon. Mangala Samaraweera and my elder brother Chrysantha Wickramaratne were classmates. I came to know Mangala as a politician. I had the unique opportunity of being his State Minister of Finance when he was the Minister of Finance. Mangalas achievements in politics as a Minister, as a Foreign Minister in postwar reconciliation, in building Sri Lankas international image, getting the GSP plus back to Sri Lanka, getting the fishing ban removed - these are all part of history now. He took over as Finance Minister but he had a secret. He had a team and he had friends. Dr. R.H.S.Samaratunga and the officials were really the backbone of what he was doing. He had people like Mr. Mohamed Ali Hussen who handled the media. He had Mano Tittawella, Deshal de Mel, Daniel Alfonso and many others who were advisers and some of those were young people. He had many friends too who really contributed - Krishantha Cooray, Malik Samarawickrema and Ruwan Ferdinandez of his team particularly come to my mind. Mangala took over as Finance Minister in a very difficult environment. We had the worst drought in 40 years. The debt service payments were enormous. Governments revenue was at its lowest - it was at about 11 per cent. Government expenditure was 17 per cent to 20 per cent of which salaries, wages, interest payments, welfare and transfers were about 16 per cent and he had no discretion over those. But Mangala had a principle. The principle he had was, Remove the disincentives; let businesses make money. Tax them and provide social services. His achievements were - the new Inland Revenue Act of 2017, which was a landmark legislation; income tax to corporates collapsed just to 3 bans; SMEs got less than Rs. 500 million turnover; 14 per cent tax - the lowest in the world; Withholding Tax on professionals, doctors, lawyers; expanding the tax net from Rs. 1 million to

903 904

[

2022 11

Rs. 1.6 million. This was Mangalas achievement. Revenues in 2019 went up by 44 per cent. For the first time, after 1954 and 1955 - only in 1992 Sri Lanka had a primary surplus - that is, revenue was more than its normal expenditure. Mangala Samaraweera had surpluses in 2017 and 2018 which was no mean achievement in 60 years. The budget deficit was at its lowest - at 5.5 per cent in 2017 and 5.3 per cent in 2018. Since 1997, only in 2013, it was 5.4 per cent. Those were the achievements of the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, the Finance Minister.

, . " , , " . , , " , " .

His philosophy was not price controls but targeted subsidies. In 2017, he began to eliminate para-tariffs within five years. In 2017, he eliminated 1,200 lines of para-tariffs in one Budget Speech. Monetary policy legislation, basically, the Monetary Law Act was prepared. Greater independence to the Central Bank but with accountability of the Monetary Board; disciplines on deficit financing on money printing and legal framework for inflation targeting - all were planned when the government changed. Mangala got me as the State Minister of Finance when he was going into the Finance Ministry. He did not want to go into the Finance Ministry, but the Hon. Prime Minister insisted that he should go there. Mangala was not an economist; he was not an accountant; he was not a finance specialist; but Managala was a true leader. He listened to the experts and came to his decisions based on the technical advice. The Constitutional coup in 2018 disrupted the further reforms he wanted to do in the Customs Department and the Excise Department. He was contemplating a rule-based system for this country and to take away discretion.

I would like to conclude on this. Mangala Samaraweera was a true patriot. He wanted to clean up Sri Lankas global image. In 2018 he said, We must have the Ahanna' programme - 'Listen to people'-, create reconciliation and unity among the diverse cultural groups of this country. "Gamperaliya" and the "Enterprise Sri Lanka" were strengthening the weak segments in our society. On his 30th anniversary in politics, he came up with the theme Khemage Koluwa" - "I am Kehema's boy." It showed his respect for his mother and the influence that the mother had on him. When he was the Minister of Mass Media in 2018, ?

. [3.07 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) Hon. Presiding Member, members of the late Hon. Mangala Samaraweeras family, I inquired this morning from the Secretary-General of Parliament whether I can be on the list of speakers to say a few words on the Vote of Condolence of the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera and I was very promptly informed that the list is long and I will

921 922

have to wait, at least, till lunch time to add a few words. Generally, when we take a Vote of Condolence, the list of speakers are not that long and also the number of speeches are fairly short. But today, when we speak of someone like the late Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, I think, the whole day will be taken up and maybe, a following day also might be required if we go to accommodate the entire list of speakers who wish to speak. That shows, Hon. Presiding Member, the level of respect, the level of dignity that he earned as a Minister, as a Member of Parliament and as a human being. The level of respect and regard he had, independent of the political background, says a lot about his character and it is displayed by the fact that there are many speakers including young Parliamentarians, new Parliamentarians and senior Parliamentarians listed to speak on this Vote of Condolence.

Sir, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera was known as a kingmaker and also he was a master of media; some would say he was a spin doctor, a master strategist and a political maestro. I remember meeting Hon. Mangala Samaraweera when I was very young, in 1990, when I was back from the boarding school for a holiday in Sri Lanka. He was having breakfast with my father, the late Hon. Gamini Dissanayake. After he left, I remember asking my father who that young smart gentleman was. He said, Oh! That was Hon. Mangala Samaraweera. He is a young, up-and-coming Member of Parliament from the SLFP. So, I thought to myself, my father being a senior prominent Minister in the UNP Government, why was he entertaining, why was he having politicians and Members of Parliament, especially, from the SLFP. But he said, Son, keep an eye on Mangala. He is a man to watch. One day, he will be a national leader in this country. Those were the words of my father regarding Mangala Samaraweera and after that, I did not meet him. My father was assassinated in 1994 and thereafter, I remember my mother, Srima Dissanayake, called uncle Mangala many, many times to get his support to set up the Gamini Dissanayake Foundation. He helped our family immensely to set up the Gamini Dissnayake Foundation. Whenever my mother used to call him and say, Mangala we need your help; we need to get this passed in the Cabinet; we need to get a video of Gamini done; we need to get some pictures from the Ministry, will you help us?, immediately, I repeat, immediately, within a matter of days, it was done. My mother did not need to speak to him again and again to remind.

May his memory never be forgotten. So, please, set up a foundation in his name and carry out his good work. A persons name, his legacy is what is important. I join across the Isle in proposing the family that you set up a foundation of this nature so that his good work and his good name can be carried forward.

I can say many things. However, I yield the Floor. I remember the last time I spoke to him last year before I went overseas for a short holiday. As usual, I called and asked him, Hello, Uncle Mangala, how are you doing? He said, Good, Good. I asked him, What are you doing? He said, "I am really going to think outside the box and set up something that is needed for this country. We should not continue this traditional politics which has been done in this country." I said, Great Uncle Mangala. Let me come and see you after I come back from overseas. But, I did not get that opportunity, unfortunately. I wish I did. His vision, his work and his public service - I do not think any other politician can match him. He truly was a professional politician, a professional Minister of very rare quality in this country.

Then, on behalf of the Tamil people of this country, I am indebted to the late Hon. Mangala Samaraweera. Around the period 2005, 2006, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera wrote to the then Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa twice - correct me if I am wrong, there are senior Members here - based on the way the war was conducted. The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera was not happy with the way things were going on, the way the war was conducted. He wrote twice to the then Prime Minister, the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, which resulted him being getting sacked from that Cabinet. I think he lost the portfolio of Foreign Minister for writing those letters. Thereafter, in 2015, in the Good Governance Government, he was again the Foreign Minister. I think he initiated some efforts to reconcile the divided country; he initiated some efforts to bring Sri Lanka the glory that it was always supposed to achieve. I think, through reconciliation, he tried to bring about some change. He even started dialogues with diaspora. Certain diaspora groups that are being banned right now, he even went and met them and started dialogues with them. Unfortunately, the reconciliation efforts that he started, he could not successfully conclude.

But, later on, in 2017, when he was appointed as the Finance Minister, we have to thank him from the North and the East, he had allocated a large amount of money for the war-affected North and East. So, on behalf of the Tamil people also, I must say that he was truly a friend to the marginalized people; he was a true friend to the Tamil community. So much so, it is the marginalized and the Tamil community that held the first remembrance programme for him after he passed away. Because the COVID-19 situation was quite bad, the first programme

that spoke about his life was held online and it was arranged by the Jaffna Sangam. In Tamil, Jaffna Sangam is a LGBTIQ-oriented group. They are the ones who arranged the first zoom meeting. It was on zoom and I participated in it. So, that goes on to speak how much an impact the late Hon. Mangala Samaraweera had made to the Tamil community and also to the LGBTIQ community. So, once again, I think, Sri Lanka has lost a great son of the soil and the Tamil people have also lost a great friend in the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera.

Thank you.

[4.48 p.m.]

( - ) (The Hon. Jeevan Thondaman - State Minister of Estate Housing and Community Infrastructure) Firstly, Hon. Presiding Member, I would like to apologize to you, as even though I had to speak in the morning, due to unforeseen circumstances, I was delayed and I feared that I would not have the opportunity to say a few words about the late Hon. Mangala Samaraweera. Having been given the opportunity, I feel that it is my honour and privilege to say a few words.

Sir, even though I did not have the privilege of knowing the late Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, he was a very near and dear friend of my father, the late Hon. Arumugam Thondaman. Even prior to the involvement in politics, they shared a very close friendship and this continued on to the time of Cabinet Ministers. I recall my father reminiscing about the late Hon. Mangala Samaraweera on multiple occasions, especially when they used to stay at our ancestral home in Wavendon Estate in Ramboda and amongst other things, my father respected the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera.

Sir, due to lack of time, I would just like to say that the country has lost a true son of the soil. As far as my speeches are concerned, I always, emphasize on the need to be a Sri Lankan, putting country before God. One

person whom I idolize in that manner is the late Hon. Managala Samaraweera. I remember right after the death of my father, he came, sat down next to me as a perfect leader and told me not to worry and the future will be bright, provided I am genuine to the people. Sir, I remember that right after I was taking Oaths as the State Minister, he was the first one to have called me and said, You owe a duty to the people first and politics comes after that. And he will be missed especially in times like this - in difficult times - where we would look for some direction. He was a man of a very warm and affectionate nature. His simplistic approach to solving issues will also surly we miss.

Finally, I would like to say that the late Hon. Managala Samaraweera had always called a spade a spade and he was a role model for youngsters throughout the country, and the group that is going to miss him the most is, I would say, the youth of tomorrow as they would not get to know what a great person Mangala Samaraweera was.

So, I would like to offer my sincere condolences to aunty, Jayanthi Samaraweera, and to the rest of family. Even though he is no more with us, through his memories, he will continue to live.

Thank you. [.. 4.51
