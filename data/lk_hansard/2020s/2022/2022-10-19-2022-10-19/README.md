(a) Will he admit that - (i) the limestone Industry is carried out in

Vijaya Sri Gama, Akkara Thiha and Ambakote Divisions;

(ii) attention should be paid to the research observations made on the impact of the said industry on the earthquakes that occurred in the Digana area; and

(iii) the aforementioned observations and environmental laws should be taken into consideration when licences are issued?

(b) Will he state -

(i) whether he is aware of the property and environmental damages caused in the above-mentioned areas;

(ii) whether research findings have proved that the aforesaid industry had an adverse impact on the earthquakes occurred in those areas; and

(iii) whether attention will be paid to the proved facts of research when the licences are issued?

(c) Will he also state -

(i) the number of licensed limestone industrialists in the above-mentioned areas;

(ii) the number of unauthorized industrialists;

(iii) the cause of action that would be taken against them; and

(iv) the number of houses that have been directly and indirectly affected due to the said industry?

(d) If not, why? ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed - Minister of Environment) Hon. Speaker, the Answer is as follows: (a) (i) The Geological Survey and Mines Bureau and the Central Environmental Authority have reported that limestone quarrying activities are carried out in the areas concerned.

(ii) It has been reported that attention has been focused on this matter and that the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau has conducted a study together with a special committee comprising university professors in the aftermath of a series of tremors that have occurred in the Digana area since August, 2020 and that although it has been concluded that no direct relationship exists between the tremors which have occurred in the area and the limestone quarrying activities, the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau has recommended that no limestone quarrying be conducted within a buffer zone of 100 metres from the Victoria Reservoir, considering the effect on it.

Accordingly, the Central Environmental Authority has reported that the following recommendations have been implemented by the Authority:

The 100 m Reserve Area in which damage has been caused should be rehabilitated as per the instructions of the Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority as it belongs to the said Authority.

Licences or permits should be issued for mining outside the 100 m Reserve Area only.

The depth prescribed for conducting mining outside the 100 m Reserve Area should be marked (from a fixed point on the mining site).

(iii) The Geological Survey and Mines Bureau has reported that the above-mentioned conclusions and the environmental laws should be taken into account in issuing legal licences while the Central Environmental Authority has reported that the recommendations given by the special committee referred to in (ii) above and the environmental laws are taken into consideration in issuing Environmental Protection Licences for mining within the area concerned.

(b) (i) It has been reported that the Central Environmental Authority has issued Environmental Protection Licences for managing the environmental problems that occur in mining, giving continuous attention to that aspect while the lime kilns and processing activities are also subjected to monitoring by the Central Environmental Authority.

In addition, it has also been reported that the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau has, through conducting blast tests, taken action to provide technical solutions to the problematic situations that emerge during mining activities.

1681 1682

(ii) The Geological Survey and Mines Bureau has reported that as a result of a study which the Bureau conducted together with a committee of experts, it has been concluded that there is no direct relationship between limestone mining and the earth tremors that occur in the area concerned.

(iii) The Geological Survey and Mines Bureau has reported that according to the conclusions of the research, there is no direct relationship between limestone mining activities and the earth tremors. Nevertheless, licences or permits are issued in accordance with the facts observed and conclusions reached in issuing licences or permits.

(c) (i) The Geological Survey and Mines Bureau has reported that 13 licences have been issued by now for limestone mining activities in the area concerned.

(ii) The Central Environmental Authority has reported that having the Environmental Protection Licence and the Mining Licence is essential in issuing explosives for the mining process, which precludes illegal mining activities and according to the records of the Central Environmental Authority, no illegal mining activities have been reported.

(iii) The Central Environmental Authority has reported that Environmental Protection Licences have been issued for industries which carry out mining for grinding and processing of limestone/dolomite within the areas of Kundasale and Digana and that no illegal industries without Environmental Protection Licences in possession have been identified and if identified as such, legal measures necessary under the National Environment Act, No. 47 of 1980 are taken.

(iv) The Geological Survey and Mines Bureau has reported that under the conditions observed by the blast tests that have already been conducted, no direct or indirect impact on houses by the earth tremors that occur during a blast or the high pressure of the blasts on the air has been observed and that conducting minimum blasts in view of the low level of hardness in limestone/dolomite and the topography of the site together with using rock breakers for the secondary fragmenting have become causes for this. However, it has been reported that although some sensitivity was felt due to dust experienced during the transport activities necessary for the industry and using of grinding machines and the resultant noise, the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau has taken steps to maintain that

impact at a level not so harmful by way of licensing conditions and field visits while the Central Environmental Authority and the Bureau have made a direct contribution to avoid such a situation.

(d) Does not arise. ( ) (The Hon. Wasantha Yapabandara) Thank you very much, Hon. Minister.

2022.10.06 : 2022. 10. 06 : DRAFT RESOLUTION ON SRI LANKA ADOPTED ON 06.10.2022 AT UNHRC: STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS ... ( ) ( ... - ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry - Minister of Foreign Affairs) Hon. Speaker, as this House is aware, the United Nations Human Rights Council - HRC - in Geneva adopted by vote the Draft Resolution titled Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka on the 06th of October, 2022 during its 51st Session. The Resolution was tabled by the Core Group comprised of the UK, USA, Canada, Germany, Malawi and North Macedonia. Out of the 47 Members of the Council, 20 countries voted in favour of the Resolution; 20 abstained at the vote and seven voted against the Resolution. We have made it very clear that Sri Lanka rejects this Resolution.

I wish to remind that since the end of the ethnic conflict, our country has faced eight such adverse Resolutions at the Human Rights Council, beginning in 2012, irrespective of the political party in government and change in leaders. Each Resolution is stronger than the one before. While progress has been made, today, the country continues to pay a heavy price for defeating terrorism and for not walking the talk by providing closure to its own people in the areas of reconciliation and human rights. This indeed is sad, given our long-standing democratic and constitutional traditions as well as our sustained and determined efforts to promote and protect the human rights of the people of Sri Lanka.

Sir, the Government continuously engaged with relevant interlocutors, in particular, the Core Group, on reaching a consensual outcome at the Council. We have been transparent and open and have engaged with sincerity while maintaining our firm position of non-compromise on external interference in the domestic affairs of the country. However, the Core Group made it abundantly clear that they will introduce a new resolution to continue with the implementation of the Sri Lanka accountability project as well as introduce new elements related to recent developments in the country

We can only assume that the hard stance taken by the Core Group meets the objectives of advancing their

1719 1720

2022 19

domestic political considerations as the Resolution itself is unhelpful to move our country forward. In light of their insistence on having OP 8 in the Resolution, which has wide-ranging legal and political implications for all countries, we had no option other than to vehemently reject and oppose the Resolution. We cannot and will not accept the superimposition of an external mechanism that runs contrary to our Constitution and which pre-judges the commitment of our domestic legal processes.

Sir, I led the Sri Lanka Delegation to the 51st Session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva and was accompanied by the Hon. Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms. During this visit, we met the Members of the Council and the Acting High Commissioner for Human Rights and briefed them on the progress made by the domestic processes related to human rights and reconciliation. We also conveyed our opposition to the external evidence gathering mechanism, stemming from Resolution 46/1 of 2021 and strengthened by the current Resolution.

In addition, I have met with the diplomatic community based in Colombo, personally met, spoken to and written to the Foreign Ministers of relevant countries and apprised them on the situation in the country. From my engagements, it is extremely clear that the vast majority of the Members of the Council do not see the necessity for this Resolution against Sri Lanka. They understand our position and fully support us. Though they are with us in heart and mind, they cannot freely express their position in a vote. The intense and heavy pressure from the powerful sponsors of the Resolution is no match for Sri Lanka and likewise, no match for many Members of the Council. It is abundantly clear that this Resolution is yet another example of the divisive and political nature of the Human Rights Council, which is contrary to its founding principles of universality, impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity.

The North-South divide particularly on human rights is of utmost concern to many and that was truly evident during my discussions, both here and in Geneva. It is also reflected in the list of co-sponsors of the Resolution and in the voting pattern.

Over half of the Members of the Council did not support the Resolution with seven countries voting against the Resolution and 20 countries abstaining on the vote. Twenty countries voted in favour of the Resolution. Some have been questioning why the number of No votes have come down. It is notable that certain countries which voted against the Resolution last year are no longer Members of the Council this year. It is also clear that the number of votes supporting the Resolution have also declined and I am well informed that the sponsors of the Resolution did not receive the number of votes that they expected.

This clearly indicates that a large number of Member States of the Council are not enthusiastic about this Resolution. We thank all the countries which abstained or voted against the Resolution.

Thirty eight developing countries, out of which 11 are Council Members, spoke in support of Sri Lanka at the Interactive Dialogue held on the 12th of September. During the informal consultations on the Resolution, 15 countries spoke in favour of Sri Lanka and during the voting process, six countries spoke in favour of Sri Lanka. The countries which supported Sri Lanka at the Council pointed out that at this critical time, when the people of Sri Lanka expect demonstrations of global solidarity and support to face its economic challenges, which are not entirely of Sri Lankas own making, it is questionable why this Resolution was tabled.

Sri Lanka is grateful to the countries which withstood pressure by the sponsors and demonstrated their support to Sri Lanka during the vote or by speaking in support of Sri Lanka during the proceedings. We are aware that some of the countries which stood by Sri Lanka at this vote, withstood immense pressure. We thank all the countries who braved such adversity to reject the Resolution. We regret that the proponents of the Resolution have extended the mandate of an external mechanism with funds of millions of US Dollars at a time of severe financial constraints faced by the UN. The OHCHR has requested for approximately US Dollars 6 million to man this mechanism. Many countries raised serious concerns on the budgetary implications of this Resolution, which is an unhelpful and misdirected drain on the resources of the UN and the Member States, including that of the donors in the midst of an ongoing global crisis.

We also strongly objected to the Draft Resolution pronouncing on domestic issues which are unrelated to the Council. Sri Lanka has, over the years, followed a tradition of close and constructive cooperation with all UN human rights mechanisms even during the period of the conflict. Our experience in dealing with violence and terrorism has made us acutely aware of the need to demonstrate Sri Lankas commitment to openness and accountability in the promotion and protection of human rights even under difficult circumstances. As a responsible member of the international community, Sri Lanka will continue to engage constructively with the UN and its agencies in a spirit of cooperation in keeping with the domestic priorities and policies as well as the international obligations and undertakings.

Sir, no country has a greater interest in bringing about reconciliation, promoting and protecting human rights among its people than Sri Lanka, a point that has repeatedly been emphasized during the proceedings of the Human Rights Council. No sovereign government is bound to work according to external prescriptions, but be guided by the democratic aspirations of its own people.

Sri Lanka has a well-established, time-honoured legal system which is capable of ensuring dispensation of justice according to the Constitution of Sri Lanka.

The Government remains committed to protecting the armed forces and the police, who have made immeasurable sacrifices to defeat terrorism, protect the territorial integrity of the country and regain for all people of Sri Lanka the most cherished of all rights, the right to life.

1721 1722

Sri Lanka had overcome many challenges in the past. We ended decades of separatist terrorism, successfully managed the human-health dimension of the COVID-19 pandemic and despite economic challenges, succeeded in maintaining a high rank in human development. We aspire to build on the economic, political and social stability restored in the recent months with the support of all our people and through outreach to the overseas Sri Lankans in a just, fair and inclusive society which realizes the full enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedom.

The time is now opportune for us to get together and make good on the promises given to the people in the areas of reconciliation and human rights over successive governments. We need to look beyond the Resolution and continue, with vigour, the work that has been initiated in that area.

It is important that we deliver on the promises we have repeatedly given to the international community and win the people who belong to the Sri Lankan origin in various parts of the world. The process towards replacing the PTA with a comprehensive national security legislation must continue. The introduction of the constitutional amendments and a legal framework which will strengthen democratic governance, participation and the rule of law as well as independent institutional oversight must be implemented.

A domestic truth-seeking mechanism, as envisaged by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry for Appraisal of the Findings of Previous Commissions and Committees on Human Rights and the Way forward, must materialize. We must provide a platform where people can have their grievances addressed and find closure, however difficult the process may be. We are of the firm view that any solution should be within the constitutional framework of a sovereign Sri Lanka. We seek the cooperation and understanding of all sectors of society and all political parties in carrying this process forward. By doing so, we will prevent external people from meddling in our own affairs. Therefore, it is important that all governments, including our Government of today, deliver on the promises we have made with regard to a truth-seeking mechanism. So, I invite all parties represented in this Parliament to come forward and agree on a mechanism so that we could resolve our problems within this country. We also invite the Sri Lankans belonging to all races, religions and ethnicities who are living in various parts of the world to come forward and march towards building a united Sri Lanka. It is very important that we have multiparty consensus on the truth-seeking mechanism. Sir, I would urge your good office to take the lead and call for a meeting of all the Party Leaders so that we could agree on the mechanism and deliver domestically, which will prevent an external mechanism, protect everyone and in the meantime, give an opportunity for the people who are grieving to come and tell their stories as well as it would be a platform for the people who have been unfairly accused of to come and redeem themselves. It is important that we do that and if we do not, this mechanism will go out of the country.

Sir, it is also my duty to mention that none of the African countries had voted in favour of the Resolution and only one country in the whole of Asia had voted in favour of that. Therefore, it is not a game of numbers, but it is important for us to deliver our promises through a local truth-seeking mechanism so that we need not get others involved in this whole process. In the meantime, we are also continuing to engage with our friends both in the Western and Eastern theatres to promote Sri Lankas standing in the international community. Thank you. ( ) (The Hon.

Minister, you made a Statement, which reflects your failure diplomatically because you accepted that a lesser number of people have voted for us. You have also failed to address in your speech about the new allegations that have come up, which do not relate to what happened earlier. Up to now, we were only grappling with the issues that had happened during and after the war, but this time, the UNHRC has brought allegations regarding the misuse of the PTA. Also, there is an allegation about economic crimes, which this Government has not addressed and if you do not address those, this Government is not going to have any credibility. So, you have created more problems for us. Therefore, please address those issues and tell the House what you have done regarding the allegations, about economic crimes and the misuse of the PTA.

review, I want to draw your attention, Hon. Minister, to certain provisions in the Bill which are extremely dangerous and very worrying. There are many provisions in that Bill which need to be addressed. However, there is one area in particular that I would like to draw your attention to and that is with regard to compulsory rehabilitation. That has been included in that Bill, which is not to be taken up for debate today, but if it is to be taken up later, please make note that those areas should be paid attention to.

As you know, rehabilitation for drug addiction is an area of specialized concern, which has a lot to do with physical and mental health and also socioeconomic conditions. Compulsory rehabilitation is a concept which is extremely controversial and in this Bill, it has been proposed that even children under 18 years arrested under certain conditions should be sent for compulsory rehabilitation. If this Bill is going to be taken up, I urge you to take a serious look at the Clause on compulsory rehabilitation because it is not something that is in line with the international standards on human rights or treatment for drug addiction. These concepts that have been included in this Bill, I think, point to the larger problem of law and order and justice in this country, particularly considering things like crime, punishment and rehabilitation. This also links, I think, to the most damaging international indictment on the country in terms of what happened in Geneva recently. We will have to acknowledge the fact that, internationally, we are at the lowest ebb today when we consider how we are being ranked with regard to important concepts like law and order, democracy and justice.

The Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, when he spoke today, also talked about the fact that we are caught in a web of international or global politics. That is true. I think there is no denying of the fact that the human rights regimes and human rights institutions work within that international order and that those agendas will always come into play. As sovereign countries, we need to know how to position ourselves, taking into account that reality. But, the fact of the matter is that it is not the international or the global context that has brought about these problems for our country, but the practices of our own governments. For several years, serially, the governments have failed to put in place trustworthy and acceptable mechanisms for accountability and for ensuring justice in this country. That is why we are constantly and consistently subjected to these kinds of indictments by the international human rights community.

More than the international human rights community, our concerns should be about the citizens of this country. The citizens of this country no longer have trust or faith in this system. We keep talking about domestic mechanisms, but it is a fact that today, domestic mechanisms are completely untrustworthy or unacceptable to the citizens of this country.

The Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, in Geneva, spoke, for example, of how sacrosanct the right to free expression is. I actually looked up the specific meaning of that term "sacrosanct" and it means something that is

sacred, something that is holly. I think ever since this President was voted into power by 134 Members of this Parliament, we can see how sacrosanct the right to free expression has been. In fact, just yesterday, we saw how sacrosanct this Government considers the right to free expression.

Seven student activists have been arrested yesterday for just attempting to express themselves. There are two student activists held under the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act. Ever since the last couple of months, no citizen of this country who tried to express himself has been allowed to do so without being attacked by the police. These are the reasons why we are facing today the kinds of condemnation internationally in the midst of an economic crisis, where we are going around with a begging bowl expecting the international community to bail us out.

So, the fact of the matter is that the citizens of this country have no trust or faith in the ability of this Government to deliver justice, uphold law and order or to ensure democracy. The feeling amongst the citizens of this country is that the system of law and order and the democratic institutions are just there in name and are there to protect the Government, the very violent and corrupt Government, that they are certainly not there to protect the citizens of this country. That is the feeling the majority of the citizens of Sri Lanka have, that the law and order system in this country is actually upholding a corrupt and a violent regime and that it is not there to deliver justice to the people of this country. Ultimately, the aim or the reason for us to have law and order and a system of justice in this country is to see how those systems can deliver justice to the citizens of this country, not just to the powerful persons who are part of the Government. So, any justice system needs to think about how punishment must be objective, reasonable and proportionate and how legal decisions should be implemented through unbiased procedures, and this is exactly what is lacking in our systems of law and order and justice in the country right now. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . () ( () () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya) , .

So, it is in that context that we are facing the condemnation of the international community at a moment when we are seeking their help to resolve a very critical economic crisis. So, establishing that trust is one of the conditions for establishing political stability in this country and as long as we are unable to do that, we will not be able to intervene to resolve the very serious economic problem we are currently facing.

Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Charles Nirmalanathan) 08 . , . ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , .. . 8 . [2.02 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, before I move on to the substantive part of my speech, I wish to specifically mention this since the Hon. Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms is present. Sir, there was a Gazette Notification issued in December, 2020, by which the previous Minister of Justice and the Ministry approved all examinations in the Law College to be conducted only in English. I think that is a gross injustice that is going to be committed because from 1956 onwards and certainly after the 1960s, the system this country has produced has been to work against English and the greatest institution which supposedly upheld the Swabhasha system was the judicial system, except in the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, which, in my view, if you are, in fact, going to be committed to your native languages, must also be in Tamil and Sinhala. However, suddenly bringing in this Gazette Notification, I think, has caused a lot of panic. I have been inundated by phone calls over the last couple of days from Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim law students, some of them actually saying that they want to commit suicide. So, I think, this is extremely unfair. You must intervene, Hon. Minister. I am someone who is very much in favour of English because I have had an English education and I know the advantages one gets from that. But, there is a way to go about it; you cannot just wake up one day and take a decision and put people in utter jeopardy. Students have to try very hard as it is not easy to get into the Law College and once they come in, passing out itself is very difficult. So, I think, to suddenly bring this and burden them is grossly unjust.

Then, I wish to comment very briefly, Sir, on some of the comments made by the - () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Hon. Member, may I explain?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, could you pause my time? - [Interruption] Okay. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Hon. Presiding Member, in fact, this issue was raised by several Hon. Members from both sides of the House and there was a difference of opinion. It was argued that since all the other faculties like the medical and engineering faculties conduct their examinations in English, why can the Law College not do the same. But, I pointed out that unlike to the other faculties, to the Law College, the students enroll through only one avenue - a competitive examination. Most of those students came and met me and pleaded me to change it, saying that they can understand English, but it is difficult for them to write in English. I informed of this matter to the Hon. Chief Justice, who is the Chairman of the Council of Legal Education. After having consultations with the Board of Studies, they informed me that they wish to continue in the same way, in the English language.

But, this morning also I said that, again, I am going to discuss this matter with the Council of Legal Education and try to reach a compromise, at least for a particular period, the students to be accommodated under the Swabhasha policy. Sir, I will definitely attend to that issue. Thank you. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I thank you, Hon., Minister.

Since I have got six more minutes, Sir, I now wish to comment about some of the statements made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs in his Ministerial Statement this morning. Though it is not relevant to this particular Debate - the Minster of Justice is here - his Statement effectively affects the affairs of the Ministry of Justice. Sir, one of the cornerstones of justice is natural justice. That is, the people concerned with a particular judicial proceeding must feel that the system is just, that when they go through a certain process they should feel confident that when they come out of that process, whatever decision given at the end of it, they can accept. It might not be for them, but if they have faith in that system, that whole system would work. Unfortunately, Sir, when it comes to matters concerning the ethnic issue, the judicial system has failed. That is not something what I say - I am a political party leader and I can be partisan about it - but what very many completely neutral institutions have said repeatedly and what the Hon. Members of this very same House, who are highly respected, have said this morning.

The reality is, unfortunately, the judicial system, especially when it comes to the ethnic conflict and its ancillary matters, is completely partisan and cannot be trusted. Now, I am making these comments purely on the ethnic question, but if you ask the Hon. Members of the

1775 1776

2022 19

JVP or the NPP who spoke today, they will also tell you that their position is that it affects their own constituents too. So, when there is this serious credibility concern, to expect a domestic mechanism to have credibility is just not going to work, Sir, and that is a fact.

The only way in which victims can feel that justice is done is by having a credible criminal justice process and that can only happen, in my view, if it is an international one because, very unfortunately, the ethnic conflict is polarizing. The comments made by consecutive High Commissioners for Human Rights have been that the judicial system pertaining to accountability issues with regard to the war and its related matters is so politically corrupt and corrupted that it cannot possibly be expected to deliver justice. So, that is the bedrock on which these Resolutions in Geneva had been passed. I am a great critic of the Resolutions. My view is that the UN Human Rights Council cannot function unless the country concerned cooperates. So, if Sri Lanka is not willing to cooperate regarding whatever Resolution that is passed, that is the end of the matter. So, the victims are left high and dry. Those Resolutions with regard to Sri Lanka had been passed since 2012, but nothing has happened and today, the only thing the Minister of Foreign Affairs has said somewhat differently is that he is thinking in terms of a truth commission. We all know, Sir, that the country which everybody venerates with regard to a truth commission is South Africa. Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who was the main brains behind the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, himself said that he was disappointed with the South African model because, ultimately, it did not have any prosecutions; the people who had committed heinous crimes, at the end of the day, eirther just came before the Truth Commission and confessed or the victims came and cried and that was the end of the matter. Grave crimes were swept under the carpet and that was the serious disappointment that Archbishop Tutu had expressed. And, that is the model Sri Lanka wants to adopt, a failed process in South Africa because it did not follow through criminal justice prosecutions; that is the model the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs wants Sri Lanka to pursue. So, my view, Sir, is that his Statement this morning proves beyond doubt that Sri Lanka and its system will never produce justice for the victims of grave crimes that had taken place.

So, it has to be an international mechanism, if at all, for the victims to have some sort of recourse to justice. We have repeatedly said that Sri Lanka, if it has nothing to worry about, should face it. When I say that we want the ICC to investigate Sri Lanka, people immediately turn around and tell me that the LTTE should also be investigated. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I am winding up, Sir.

We are not worried about the LTTE being investigated; we are not worried about Tamils being investigated. If we can stand up and tell the truth and if we can prove the truth, we are not frightened to appear before any court. Why are you all frightened to appear before court? Why are you all frightened to appear before the International Criminal Court and clear your names? Unfortunately, because of a considerable number of members of the armed forces, the entire armed forces, even people who have nothing to do with the war, are being considered war criminals. So, why do you all not want to clear your name? You clear your name and that is good for you as well. So, our view, Sir, is that this Statement is yet another justification, yet another proof that Sri Lanka will never produce justice. The Hon. Ministers idea of a truth commission is yet another perfect example how Sri Lanka wants to push under the carpet anything that has to do with justice and cover it up.

Sir, the Answer is as follows:

(01) Despite being a small island nation in Asia, Sri Lanka, along with Western Ghats, is recognized as one of the 36 biodiversity hotspots of the world. With a high dependence on its biodiversity for tourism and other social and economic activities, the Island is also home to a large number of endemic species: fauna and flora that are found nowhere else on the Earth.

As it is in many other countries, Sri Lankas biodiversity too is endangered by the increase of harmful human activities such as habitat encroachment and fragmentation, unsustainable use and management of natural resources, pollution and the introduction of invasive alien species.

Since 1994, Sri Lanka has been a party to the Biodiversity Convention of the United Nations and is in the process of mainstreaming biodiversity into planning of national development policies. The Ministry of Environment plays the role of National Focal Point - NFP - to the Biodiversity Convention.

The challenges or threats to biodiversity in Sri Lanka are as follows:

factors pose threats to biodiversity. This results in certain species in the planet becoming extinct over time. This is called biodegradation. It can happen in several ways:

Encroachment into forests for agriculture causes habitat loss and fragmentation

Illicit felling of timber resulting in loss of ecosystem services and habitats for species

Other localized encroachments into forests, wetlands, coastal and marine systems due to housing, tourism facilities, village expansion/ establishing new villages,

1849 1850

urbanization, for development of commercial facilities and access roads, prawn farming or aquaculture and salt production involving clearing of the coastal ecosystem - mangroves, salt marshes et cetera - and establishment of inappropriate tourist infrastructure that adversely affects the environment.

Forest degradation due to firewood collection and damage to undergrowth, cattle grazing, die-back of forest species and over extraction of minerals

Changes in water regimes and sedimentation due to dam construction, major and mini-hydro projects that alter water regimes, poorly planned irrigation structures, encroachments into river reservations and proliferation of agro-wells.

Lack of strategic use of land during development, resulting in loss of critical forests and important wildlife habitats and wetlands.

spread of Invasive Alien Species (IAS)

Over exploitation of species

Destructive practices during resource extraction

Pollution resulting in loss of ecosystem services and habitats for species

Increasing human population and contacts with wildlife (Human-elephant conflict and human-wild animal conflict)

Climate change and other major natural disasters i.e. human-induced global climate change, tsunami, floods, droughts, coastal erosion and natural outbreaks of parasites and pests.

The Ministry of Environment provides policy directions towards conservation of biodiversity.

In order to address these challenges, the Ministry of Environment developed the National Biodiversity Strategic Action Plan (NBSAP) and the National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP). They are being implemented. It is the main policy instrument we have for guiding us on conserving biodiversity of the Island and using it for sustainable development as well as sharing benefits generated by it among the general public in a justifiable manner.

In addition to the above, the Ministry of Environment has formulated policies and Acts to address the biodiversity issues of the country in varying degree. They are the National Policy, the Strategy and Action Plan on Invasive Alien Species (IAS), the National Policy on Biosafety, the National Policy on Conservation and Sustainable Utilization of Mangrove Ecosystem in

Sri Lanka, the National Policy on Access to Genetic Resources and Benefit Sharing (ABS Policy), the Traditional Knowledge Policy, the Draft Alien Organisms (Control) Act and the Draft Biosafety Act for facilitating to overcome the above challenges.

(02) Sri Lanka is affected by a number of climatic hazards and extreme events and those are projected to worsen with climate change. Being an island with a mountainous central region, Sri Lanka has been affected by floods, droughts, landslides, coastal storms and erosion, cyclones and storm surges. During the past decade, the frequency of droughts, floods and cyclones has increased.

In this respect, the Ministry of Environment, being the National Focal Point to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), has assessed the climate vulnerability in 2010 using the vulnerability formula of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Further, a climate risk assessment has been conducted in 2018 to identify the vulnerability of climate change impacts in the country using the risk formula introduced by the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Accordingly, the most vulnerable sectors to adverse effects of climate change have been identified. Among them, agriculture, fisheries, livestock, human health, water, coastal and marine biodiversity and ecosystems, tourism, human settlement and infrastructure are the most vulnerable sectors to adverse effects of climate change. Geographically, the central highlands, dry zones, wet zone as well as the coastal region have been identified as the vulnerable regions for different climate- induced disasters.

In order to build resilience in the above sectors and geographical areas, the Ministry of Environment has prepared the National Adaptation Plan and at present, it is being implemented by different stakeholders. Further, in the Nationally Determined Contributions - NDCs - submitted to the UNFCCC, these sectors have been incorporated for building resilience with the support of external parties.

Furthermore, in response to the challenges posed by climate change, Sri Lanka has taken several steps by introducing national policies (the National Climate Change Policy of Sri Lanka 2012), strategies ( the National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy 2011-2016) and action plans such as the National Adaptation Plan for Climate Change Impacts of Sri Lanka 2016-2025.

I wish to emphasize that addressing climate change has taken place in Sri Lanka in a highly scientific and technical manner since 2010 and it is being continued.

(03) Mid-term and long-term measures have been taken to conserve Sri Lankas environment.

Every country in the world has made a policy intervention as a long-term programme to protect its environment. Sri Lanka has also recognized this need well and presented an environmental policy as a national policy. Identifying long-term, medium-term and short-term strategies and activities for the implementation of the National Environment Policy - NEP - is an essential task. For this, a National Environmental Action Plan - NEAP - has been prepared with the consultative participation of all stakeholders.

1. National Environment Policy - NEP

Since the publication of the National Environment Policy and Strategy in 2003, new environmental challenges have emerged. Significant changes have taken place nationally and globally affecting our environment. The economic, social, and cultural factors which contribute to climate change have evolved and the scientific knowledge of the subject has grown significantly.

Accordingly, the necessity of updating the NEPs had been stressed by many parties, highlighting the changing priorities of environmental management. The Ministry of Environment, considering these changes that have taken place since the formulation of NEPs in 2003, recognized the necessity of updating the NEPs focusing on major thematic areas.

The Ministry of Environment has taken necessary steps to formulate a National Environment Policy - NEP - focusing on key thematic areas. The NEP is based on principles of environmental management.

In this regard, the Ministry of Environment has formulated the National Environment Policy in line with the current and future environmental trends following a wide range of consultations of experts and stakeholders and calling for public comments and views of the Members of Parliament.

The National Environment Policy has been approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on 20.06.2022. The NEP will be unveiled soon after the printing process is completed.

2. Preparation of the National Environment Action Plan - NEAP

The National Environmental Action Plan (2022-2030) has been prepared by the Ministry of Environment by paying attention to the environmental challenges of the Twenty First Century and in accordance with the Sustainable Development Goals - SDGs - of the United Nations as well. The strategies and action plans required for the

Policy is provided by this Plan.

This National Environmental Action Plan - NEAP - which has been prepared as an active action plan in collaboration with all institutions of stakeholders has been prepared so as to combine with the annual action plans of all relevant institutions, as required.

The environmental protection and development can be introduced according to the agreements of the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement. This Plan has been prepared on the interactive procedure, in which the relevant main parties have participated and includes nine themes and three cross-cutting areas.

Accordingly, the relevant facts relating to the main nine theme fields such as water, air, land, biodiversity, climate changes, coastal and marine resources, waste management, urban and human settlement and industry and the three cross-cutting themes such as co-ordination, knowledge management and utilization of resources have been covered through this Action Plan.

The responsibilities vested in the Ministry of Environment relating to the National Environmental Action Plan are included in the activities such as fulfilling the prominent duty relevant to implementing and supervision, reviewing of subject matters of the Plan and conforming to those matters, providing necessary guidance to the institutions which are responsible for the implementation of all activities identified. It includes a procedure for the implementation and supervision of the National Environmental Action Plan and by this procedure, the necessary direction for proper implementation of that Action Plan and reaching of expected targets are carried out.

Currently, the National Environment Action Plan is being translated into the Sinhala and Tamil languages and will be institutionalized after obtaining the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers.
