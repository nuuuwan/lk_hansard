Hon. Deputy Chairman, what is the definition of "terrorism"? "Terrorism" is massacring of innocents to achieve a political aim. So, whether the cause for terrorism is justifiable or not, terrorism cannot be justified. Also, we know that terrorism is no more a local or a regional problem, but a global and a transnational problem. So, there has to be a concerted effort on the part of the international community to address that menace. When we had crushed the most ruthless terrorist organization in the world, instead of praising, certain countries are trying to punish us.

During a Debate in the House of Commons on a Motion on Sri Lanka, 11 MPs wanted Magnitsky-style sanctions on Sri Lanka including referring our military personnel to the ICC, while demanding to reduce military spending. They all talked about human rights violations, war crimes and demilitarization in Sri Lanka. Who are those MPs? One MP had objected to the UK banning the LTTE in 2000, another has attended the World Tamil Conference and all are in the All Party Parliamentarians' Group for Tamils. One MP is even referred to as White Tiger. So, this is nothing but a contract of the separatist Tamil diaspora in the UK and to secure their votes to enter the House of Commons. All those British MPs demand to reduce military spending in Sri Lanka. But,

you know that the Iraq War cost the UK taxpayers Pounds Sterling 8.4 billion. The Chilcot Report concluded that the Iraq War was both wrong and illegal. Also, the war in Afghanistan cost the UK taxpayers Pounds Sterling 21.3 billion. So, they spend so much of money to invade other countries and ask us to reduce our military spending. It is like the king crab asking other crabs to walk straight.

They also talked about demilitarization in Sri Lanka. The British troops remained in Germany since 1945 after the World War II and more than a million British soldiers have lived and served in Germany over the past 75 years. So, how much has it been costing the UK to place their troops in Germany since 1945? Therefore, I would like to ask those MPs, do you have a moral right to demand demilitarization in Sri Lanka when you have deployed military troops outside your country for decades?

The UK defended its troops engaged in all their illegal wars since 1990 in more than 12 countries. I must also remind all those MPs about the statement made by their former Prime Minister Theresa May. She said, I will go to the extent of even amending or altering the human tights laws when it comes to the protection of my soldiers fighting terrorism. So, such is the attitude of their leaders towards crushing terrorism, but after we crushed terrorism, they want to take our soldiers to the ICC. Do not make the House of Commons a laughing stock in the eyes of the educated and peace-loving world community.

They also talk about war criminals in Sri Lanka, but they make the UK a safe haven for a most heinous was criminal, Adele Balasingham. She was responsible for training, arming and tying a vial of cyanide around the necks of innocent Tamil children, especially girls. She lives happily in Surrey after training thousands of young girls to face death. So, I would like to tell those MPs, before you talk about war criminals in Sri Lanka, first stop harbouring Adele Balasingham, who is an established war criminal, on UK soil and prosecute her. The inaction proves UK's double standard.

When talking about human rights violations in Sri Lanka, I must also remind those British MPs of the blatant human rights violations committed by their great-great-grandfathers in Sri Lanka in the 19th Century. When our freedom fighters were fighting against the British invaders, how did the then Governor Robert Brownrigg react? He ordered to kill all the Sinhalese aged 18 to 35 in Uva Wellassa. He destroyed all the paddy fields; he destroyed all the tanks; he destroyed all the cattle; he cut all the fruit trees and then, put poison into all the drinking water wells. That is how he crushed the freedom fight. It was debated in the House of Commons at that time and they even condemned their own King for having a representative who knew no decency - Robert Brownrigg. It is recorded that that was unimaginable horror and ruthlessness of the British and also that Lieutenant MacLaine and Lieutenant Hook, who were in the 73rd Regiment of the British Army, wanted to watch a Sinhalese hanged every day while they were having breakfast. So, that was the attitude of the British army personnel when they were here and they are now trying to

279 280

teach human rights to us in Sri Lanka. So, to all those 11 British MPs who are worried about human rights violations in Sri Lanka, I say, firstly, tender an apology to us for the heinous crimes you committed against our people and our country; secondly, return all the treasures and the ola leaf books you looted from us during that time, including the world famous Tara Devi statue and thirdly, pay compensation for what our people suffered during the subjugation. After that, you are welcome to discuss the human rights violations, if any, in Sri Lanka.

I would also like to say that we are a nation which protects not only the rights of humans, but also of animals and birds. We are a nation nourished by Buddhism and are proud to have the first wildlife sanctuary in the world. In the 19th Century, in 1818, during the freedom fight against the British, when more than 500 British troops surrendered, General Monarawila Keppetipola did not kill them or took their weapons. He allowed them to go back to their barracks with no harm. He said, We do not want to kill unarmed and surrendered soldiers. Sir, General Keppetipola was a heroic fighter. After he was captured and executed by the British, his cranium or skull was sent to the London Medical University of Edinburgh for experiment. The British wanted to find out how he had got that extraordinary strength, the willpower and the fearlessness for death. So, that was General Keppetipola in the 19th Century. In the 21st Century, our generals, too, did not harm the LTTE cadres who surrendered. Instead, 11,600 of them were rehabilitated and sent back to the society.

Those 11 MPs must go through the memos sent by Lieutenant Colonel Lawrence Smith, the US Defence Attach and Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Gash, the UK Defence Attach in Colombo during the war. They had first-hand information unlike the third-party sources quoted by those British MPs. Both Defence Attachs quelled the allegations of the surrendered being killed and the bogus figures of the dead. Lieutenant Colonel Gashs report confirmed that the LTTE was keeping civilians as hostages and human shields, the LTTE was controlling the No-fire Zone and that they confiscated the food and medicine sent for the civilians. I would like to tell those MPs, that was your own man reporting from Colombo during the war. So, you all should be ashamed to level these types of false allegations against the Sri Lankan military. Finally, I would also like to tell those British Parliamentarians not to play to the gallery of the separatist Tamil diaspora for their votes to enter the House of Commons and that august Assembly, the House of Commons, is not a place for selfish, highly biased and hypocrites like you.

Hon. Deputy Chairman, give me a minute to speak about the latest UN Resolution 56/1. The UNHRC deliberately mishandle this issue to punish Sri Lanka. The war against the LTTE was not a civil war, but a non-international armed conflict. It is also mentioned both in the Darusman Report and the OISL Report. As per the Geneva Convention, the applicable law for a non-international armed conflict is the International Humanitarian Law, not the International Human Rights Law and the applicable legal framework is Additional Protocol II of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention. It specifies the types of violations and in penal prosecution, it says that the accused has to be informed without delay and only the person who committed the offence should be convicted, which means command responsibility is not recognized. Anyone charged with an offence is presumed innocent until proven guilty.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Hon. Member, please wind up.

281 282

) ( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera) Give me just thirty seconds, Sir.

Punishment should be guided by the relevant countrys Penal Code. Therefore, the countries which have rejected visa to senior military officers have acted with scant respect to the international law I mentioned earlier, which was ratified by all the members of the UN.

The external mechanism established by the UNHRC to gather evidence against Sri Lankan military officers was an act contemptuous towards its own UN Charter. The subsequent inclusion of economic crimes in a Resolution which originated due to alleged human right violations in a war is nothing but hilarious. All our Governments are also at fault for not driving that point at the UNHRC. I myself did it alone in Geneva with the help of patriots. We still have time to shake up the UNHRC.

Today, we are discussing the Votes of the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of Technology.

Sir, I want to speak about the issues relating to the Ministry of Technology. Information Communication Technology is very important because it generates a huge export income for this country. It is estimated that the Information Technology industry brought in about US Dollars 1.7 billion in 2021. The Central Bank's estimate is, of course, lower that that - it is about US Dollars 1.1

billion - and other government estimates say that it was US Dollars 1.4 billion. Anyway, it is a big revenue and at the moment, it is only second to the revenue earned by the garment industry. Its potential is much higher. They say that, maybe, by 2024, it could increase to US Dollars 3 billion. So, its potential is very high. Therefore, we have to encourage that industry as a foreign exchange earner.

The Government proposes to increase the tax on export-sector companies up to 30 per cent. I think you should consider that particularly when it comes to Information Communication Technology exports and encourage that industry. Whether it is software, IT services or offshore businesses coming into Sri Lanka, they should be encouraged because potentially, that industry is much larger than the garment industry and the other industries we are looking at today. So, it is much larger; the potential is so great. Therefore, the Government should look at it; the Governments role in it is very critical and important.

If we look at the President's Budget Speech the other day, he expressed his dissatisfaction at government institutions not actually promoting technology. I am sure there is dissatisfaction that he said something to the effect that he might appoint a committee to go into it. The President, when he was Prime Minister, did the same thing 20 years ago. Then, he had the Hon. Milinda Moragoda as Minister and he appointed a committee. I was the head, the Chief Executive Officer, of a bank at that time and I was appointed the chairman of that committee. The committee met and we came up with a programme called "e-Sri Lanka". Under that programme, we created the Information and Communication Technology Agency. We are glad that that Agency is there now. Recently, the QR code-based fuel pass was created by the Information and Communication Technology Agency - ICTA - and was implemented in partnership with two private companies. Over 6.2 million citizens are now using that bordered system. If we look at enhancing ICT literacy, the preliminary works of the programme started in 2004 and the literacy rate went up from 7 per cent to 35 per cent by 2013. And more recently, we know that the ICT literacy rate has gone up even higher.

Then if you look at the "Technology Startup Ecosystem", it has grown tremendously from 32 million to more than 228 million with thousands and thousands of jobs having been created. I remember that at the beginning, we created the "e-Sri Lanka" programme, the ICTA and the HSBC call centre. At that time, I remember serving on the BOI Board as well as a head of a bank and WNS and others were also brought into the country. So, there was tremendous potential right from the beginning. I remember discussing and trying to get Microsoft also to come into Sri Lanka and we even managed to get them to open an office in Sri Lanka. We arranged a handshake between Bill Gates of Microsoft and the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, the then Prime Minister, when he went to the United States of America and was with President George W. Bush and it is then that the Government was changed by a decision of President Chandrika

293 294

Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. The whole intention of engaging with Microsoft was to actually get them to put up a factory in this country at that time because we wanted to change the destiny of the economy of this country.

The ICTA had also been involved in creating the Government Information Centre, 1919. Lots of people know that. Presently, more than 150,000 calls come per month to that Centre. We also know that ICTA had worked on interoperable standardization of Sinhala and Tamil languages, which is very critical and important. It also has launched an e-Revenue Licence system and more than 63 lakhs of people are on the licensing system. You go online and get your revenue licence issued through that, and the revenue it generates at the moment is Rs. 11.4 billion.

In terms of law, we have had the Personal Data Protection Act, the Computer Crime Act and the Electronic Transactions Act introduced. Also in terms of law, we are basically benchmarking ourselves against the international standards. That is what has actually happened during this period. We have joined the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, being first among the Asian countries, and also the UN Electronic Communications Convention. So, strides have been made. We have deployed the first digital signature-based authentication system, LankaSign. Now, if you want to get a copy of a birth certificate, a death certificate or a marriage certificate, within 10 to 30 minutes, you can get it. That shows how far it has advanced.

Working with the Ministry of Health, ICTA has also developed the Hospital Health Information Management System. In this system, all the national hospitals, provincial hospitals, teaching hospitals and district hospitals have been included and it has over 7 million registrations. In Sri Lanka, if we take medical health, normally when someone in the family is ill, we ask somebody else about a specialist and take the patient there. There is no family medicine system in this country like in very advanced economies. Therefore, we need to get that in place and technology becomes an important part of it. Here, the foundation has been laid for that as well.

Over 25,000 government servants have been trained and 650 CIOs and leaders have been trained for that.

Then, business incubators have also been started. There are many achievements; many international awards have been won. But, I would like to quickly say this. All of these have a digital infrastructure for Government and that is currently established by ICTA and operated under ICTA.

The whole idea of Lanka Gate middleware infrastructure is to have one government operation. Under Lanka Government Cloud, 200 software solutions are

there and over 100 government institutions are basically hosted in it. The Government network, Government SMS and Lanka Government Payment Service come under it. That architecture is very important.

Sir, I would also like to say this. When ICTA was created - the problem in Information Technology is, it is very difficult to get the best people for the typical government service because the market rates are much higher attracting the best people - a unique model was adopted. That was done under the direction of the then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and former Minister Milinda Moragoda. We all, the private sector and the Government, got together and came up with this Agency. But, today, there are challenges. I am not saying that it is a perfect organization because it was politicized as it proceeded. Therefore, the critical people need to be retained.

As my closing remarks, what I would like to say is this. We need to be extremely careful since it is an institution under the Government which facilitates and mediates on behalf of the Government, which takes care of the core digital infrastructure and also the whole concept of one Government.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is up. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Sir, I am going to conclude.

So, when it comes to ICT, the education authorities, government entities, international agencies, everybody needs to get together and work in close collaboration for digitalization of industries, innovations and creating the Ecosystem.

Finally, my message is this. If we think that we can just dispense with what we have - unlike 20 years ago, the whole Government depends on it now - that could create chaos. Therefore, I would say that if this institution has to be reformed, it has to be reformed or if it has to be replaced with a similar institution, in that process, you need to be careful that no government infrastructure is destroyed and that government infrastructure is kept in place because otherwise, even the exports of the country would be affected apart from the services provided to citizens.

Thank you very much, Sir, for the time provided. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .. . 13 .

Hon. Presiding Member, we believe that the Indian Ocean should be a stable region and open to all for peaceful reasons. So, the need for a code of conduct for the Indian Ocean is felt as a need of the hour. That would be important for international navigation and commerce in this Ocean. This Ocean, as a vital channel of sea communication, facilitates a large volume of energy, raw materials and food supply between the East and the West. Thus, it is imperative that we keep it safe. We do not want this to be an area of conflict and war or the playground of world military powers.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran. You have 11 minutes. [3.58 p.m.]

. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) I thought I had 12 minutes, Sir.

I thank the Chair for giving me this opportunity to air my views on the defence aspect of the Budget. The all inclusive defence expenditure for 2023 has increased to Rs. 539 billion. Why? Are we taxing our people so that the Government could spend so much money on the military? Is that what the people want? Or are we wanting to keep the Tamils under the military boot of the State and is that why so much of money is spent on the military? When are we going to decrease our defence expenditure and move on with economic regeneration? Is it not a fact that the structural root causes of the crisis included financing the war to deny the right of self-determination of the Tamils of Sri Lanka?

Sir, not recognizing the over 3,000 years continued existence of the Tamils in the North and the East of Sri Lanka, in order to repress the Tamils, the higher spending

325 326

on the military started in 1960. Sri Lankas military spending in 1960 was US Dollars 0.02 billion, constituting 1.18 per cent of GDP. In 1985, it increased to US Dollars 0.19 billion, constituting 3.16 per cent of GDP. In 2007, the spending was US Dollars 1.05 billion, constituting 3.26 of GDP and at the end of the war in 2009, it was US Dollars 1.52 billion, constituting 3.16 of GDP.

At the end of the war, anyone would have thought that the expenses on the military would decrease, but it did not. On an average, 2 per cent of GDP has been spent on defence annually from 2009 to date. So, there have been, thus, an increase in our military expenditure after the war than a decrease. Altogether, we have spent, from 2009 until 2020, US Dollars 18.84 billion after the war! In 2020, we spent 295 billion in Sri Lankan currency, in 2021, Rs. 331 billion, in 2022, Rs. 376 billion and we are expecting to spend in 2023, an all-round high of Rs. 539 billion. In all these years, education, health, agriculture and other very important ministries received much less. The salaries paid to the military every year almost equals the salaries paid to the public servants as a whole. As a percentage of GDP, Sri Lanka spent 1.93 per cent in 2020 on military expenses, whereas Japan, which is having external threats, spent only 0.99 per cent of their GDP.

Sir, our army is the 14th largest army in the world, but we do not face any external threat. Yet, our military personnel are said to be 331,000. As a percentage of the population in 2018, it was 1.46 per cent and was second only to Israel, which was having a 2 per cent strength. The Sri Lankan problem, if any, is not similar to that of Israel. It could be solved very easily, if not for the mindset of the political leaders, especially of the recent set who have had no hesitation in grabbing power even through blood. In fact, we could have saved so much of money and avoided so much of human suffering if politicians had not thought so parochially and in an ethnocentric manner and had solved this problem in the 1950s or the 60s. Even after the end of the war, a mentality has been created in the minds of the people that defence should be the most prioritized expenditure of the Budget. Therefore, no one, including the Opposition Parliamentarians, has raised objections so far to the increasing defence expenditure of the country. This state of affairs exists even today though some of our majority community Parliamentarians have started questioning such expenditure after the "aragalaya". Even at this juncture of the history of Sri Lanka where people are forced to undergo severe economic difficulties, defence expenses are on the rise. It was maintainable during the war to assert that defence should have been our topmost expenditure, but when such expenditure continues after the war, year after year, it is an indicator that peace has not arrived; it is an indicator that the powers that be have doubts in their minds with regard to their safety despite the vanquishing of all the protagonists.

The simple formula to bring peace is to sideline the extremist elements within us and implement a moderate solution acceptable to all, realizing that the Tamils have

lived continuously in this country from prehistoric times upon a determinable land mass with their own language, culture and civilization intact.

Bringing peace into this country is not a difficult task for a leader with a vision. If the ethnic problem could be solved, the defence expenses could then be reduced drastically and those could be used profitably on more deserving sectors of the countrys economy. Instead, we are trying to safeguard the country from an enemy still unborn and unseen. To face an unborn enemy, over 100,000 military have been stationed in the North and the East.

Speaking of the North, where I was the Chief Minister for five years after the war, the military has taken over several farms of the people there. They are cultivating them and pocketing the income, leaving the owners of such lands on the lurch with them being plundered out of their livelihood. The Army has misappropriated agricultural farms with 394 acres in Vattakachchi, 120 acres in Jeyapuram, approximately 500 acres in Thiruvaiaru, approximatel 400 acres in Mulankavil, 798 acres in Malayalapuram, approximately 100 acres in Muththiankattu and 100 acres of coconut land in Mukkuppam, all in the Kilinochchi District and also 672 acres in Vattuvahal, approximately 600 acres in Mullikulam, 150 acres in Viswamadu, approximately 300 acres in Pulumachinatha Kulam and 1,200 acres in Theravil in the Mullaitivu District. In addition, in Kokkuththoduwai in the Mullaitivu District, 25 acres were distributed for each family for cultivation of cashew. All those lands have been appropriated by the Army. Over 25,000 acres of land in the Mullaitivu District are also in the hands of the military. Then, approximately 500 acres of agricultural lands in Vellankulam in the Mannar District and private lands in the Chettikulam area in the Vavuniya District, too, have been taken over by the Army. From the agricultural lands in the Mullaitivu District, the Army receives an average Rs. 15 million profit every year. From the farms in the Kilinochchi District, the Army gets around a Rs. 13 million profit annually. Lots of precious agricultural lands which could bring in a substantial income for our people are, today, languishing in the hands of the forces.

In the Vanni, while appropriating peoples lands and making profits from them, the military have concocted various security concerns to justify their aggression and daylight robbery. They have made it out that unless our people work in their farms, they have no prospects of a decent livelihood. On the one hand, the Government prevented large-scale, profitable agricultural projects being run by the provincial council and on the other, today, the military has made people believe that they are their only salvation. If only we close up those army camps and hand over the lands to the local agricultural co-operative organizations, our farmers could feed not only the people in the Vanni, but the farmers in the Northern Province would also be able to contribute substantially to the agricultural needs of the entire country. In fact, they have done so earlier.

In the Jaffna District, over 3,000 acres of land are in the possession of the military. In an area of 3,262 acres,

327 328

[ .. ]

2022 24

there are 43 army camps and 98 army checkpoints. There are 41 military camps in the Kilinochchi District. In Addition, the military is bent on permanently taking over peoples lands in 68 places. Some of the soldiers have complained that they were recruited for war training, but are now forced to do menial jobs. In Vattuvahal in the Mullaitivu District, already an army camp exists on 672 acres of land. In Keppapilavu, the Air Force has appropriated 3,000 acres. In the Sannar area in Mannar, 100 acres have been taken over by the Army and a camp has been established. In Mullikulam, 600 acres have been taken over by the Army. In Puliyankulam in the Vavuniya District, the STF has taken over private lands and established camps. So, too, at the Maruthodai Junction in Vavuniya. In Oddusuddan in the Mullaitivu District, on 15 acres of private lands, the Army has built their camp. At the Oddusuddan Junction, 50 acres, including the cemetery area, have been seized and an army camp has been built. According to the 2019 statistics, 679 acres of private lands and 3,178 acres of State lands have been taken over by the military. But those are government statistics. In reality, very much more lands are in the hands of the forces. For example, opposite the Murukandy Temple on the A9 Road, 1,702 acres of land is held by the military. That is the land about which Hon. R. Sampanthan spoke in Parliament some time ago, pointing out that permanent buildings for the residences of the soldiers were coming up. No private persons are allowed to enter those lands. In 2017, our research organizations in the North concluded that over 30,000 acres of lands have been expropriated by the forces in the Mullaitivu area alone. All those are areas where Tamils lived for centuries. Our economy is imprisoned in those lands now.

There are many modern and useful changes that could be introduced to strengthen our agricultural sector in those areas. If we could use modern methods to save water, control floods, manage underground water, increase yields and to enhance physical resources in those areas, our farmers would benefit and consequently, the country would benefit. Instead, we are allowing the Army to hold on to peoples lands in a dog in the manger fashion. We could use some of those farms for inland seed production, training programmes and enhancement of agricultural technical know-how. We could, at the same time, advise and educate our farmers in the making of organic manure and related matters.

The Hon. Members would have realized by now why such large amounts of moneys are allocated to the forces. Inter alia, it is to keep the Tamil people under the military boot and prevent the Northern and the Eastern Tami-speaking people from economically regenerating. The Government prevents diaspora investments in the North and the East and continue to spend such large sums of money on their armed forces.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up.

. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Please give me one more minute, Sir.

The Government might consent to allow diaspora investments under a Unitary Constitution, but that is of no use to us. The Central Government alone will decide on what should be done with such investments. Going by the past, their decisions would prejudice the well-being of the Tamils of the North and the East. We need to have a needs assessment done in the North and the East to identify our priorities according to the needs of our people so as not to feed the Central Governments ethnocentric whims and fancies. To do that, we need to jettison the present Unitary Constitution and devolve power substantially to the peripheries.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) I am winding up, Sir.

It is our view that only a confederal Constitution could give the Tamil people freedom and elbow space to prosper. Hence, I would appeal to the Government to reduce their military spending, decrease their military numbers and use the money saved thereon on relieving the economic burdens of the people. Thank you.

[5.01 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, this morning, when I was entering the House, the President was on his feet making a speech. In the course of that speech, I heard him, if I am not mistaken, making fun of Mr. Wasantha Mudalige, the Convener of the Inter-University Students' Federation by saying that he is in university for the eighth year and what he meant by that was Mr. Mudalige was a failure, that he should have passed out and got out of university by now, but he is unable to do that. That honestly, Sir, is completely unbecoming of a President and the Hon. Wickremesinghe in particular, more than anyone else, must be sensitive to the fact that just because you do not succeed immediately, it does not make you a failure and it is actually when you give up that you will become a failure. The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe had not got elected as President; that was his dream. Even today, he is not an elected President, but tomorrow, he could be. Does that mean that he must give up? So, quite honestly, it is a disgrace that he, of all people, should poke fun at a young man, who, I think, is very serious, serious because he is putting his life in jeopardy. The stakes are high in

345 346

this. The fact that Wasantha Mudalige and Ven. Siridhamma Thero, as conveners of the two institutions they belong to, are being targeted in this way shows what serious leaders they are, and they are being deliberately punished for things they did not do, for no crimes at all. If they had committed crimes, Sir, there would be evidence. Every time the Supreme Court and now, the Magistrate's Court had asked for evidence, there had been no evidence given and they are also not indicted. Once the detention order lapsed because it came under such heavy criticism, now, new cases are being created so that they could somehow be incarcerated. Therefore, Sir, the question is, why is this targeting taking place?

So, here are young students who have a certain political ideology - we all have political ideologies and there is nothing wrong with having a political ideology - and who are prepared to stand up and demonstrate that this House and the President are acting against the mandate that was given to them two years ago. That is what they said when the previous President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was in power; that is exactly what they said when the previous Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was in power. Both of them accepted that position and resigned. That does not change the illegitimacy of this House and the policies that this House is trying to pursue with the mandate that the people gave two years back. That is the problem here; that is the crux of the problem. The mandate that the Gotabaya Rajapaksa regime got is being acted upon completely contrary to that mandate and that is the problem that this House and the incumbent President face.

When the people and the youth are prepared to stand up and call into question the actions of the leaders and hold them accountable to the mandate they gave them, they would be crushed and for that reason, you need the PTA. You can tell your international partners that you will not use it, that you are going to repeal it, but you are using it to the hilt because we all know with the PTA, there is no justice, no law, no order and that it is completely to be used at the whims and fancies of those who are ruling, the police and the military. We, the Tamils, more than anybody else, know that. That is why, Sir, we stand in solidarity with those youth, with those people who are, in fact, struggling. They were struggling in a non-violent way. Why do you not say that also?

When the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe became Prime Minister, he invited people to continue to struggle, probably because he wanted to oust the President. "So, come and struggle", he said inviting foreigners to come and join the struggle. At that time, it was not terrorism. But, when did that struggle turn violent? Who created violence first? The Members of this House; it is the Members of this House who instigated violence. But, that part of it - the counter-violence - is completely forgotten. You have destroyed their economy; you have destroyed their livelihood and today, they can only afford one meal a day! That, their way of life, is not destruction; that is fine! All that is allowed! But, we in this House, particularly the Members opposite, must be protected. So,

you use the PTA. Sir, this Government and this House are making the same mistakes, which are going to radicalize the society. This time around, that sort of change in society is not going to be the way that you managed to crush in the past; it is not going to be the same. The PTA must be repealed and must never be replaced because at the hands of the undemocratic, selfish robbers who sit opposite,

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

the PTA will always be used for selfish reasons, Sir.

Today, we are debating the Vote of the Ministry of Defence among others. This Ministry is the curse of the Tamil people, Sir! We have no qualms in saying that. We hate this Ministry; it is singularly the most hated arm of Government that we can think of! Today, under the Ministry of Defence, you have a military, a Navy and an Air Force who have their presence in the North and the East to such an extent that 1:14 is the ratio. The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran very eloquently gave details of the sort of oppressive occupation that the military apparatus is engaged in. It has nothing to do with just having camps; it is robbing people of their lands. Even today, they are trying to confiscate lands. President Ranil Wickremesinghe invites us for talks and at the same time, he asks the Governor to hold meetings in the North to confiscate lands from the Tamil people so that the military could use those. That is what is happening.

I ask you, Sir, to touch your conscience and say, if we are a witness to the way in which genocide was committed, as we say, if we are a witness to the way in which we surrendered our relatives to the military and today, they are not accounted for, if we are a witness to rape committed by the military and the armed forces and if they have a physical presence in a ratio of 1:14, what do you think we will want out of that?

Do you think we will be happy with their continuing to be amongst us after we know that they have committed crimes? Do you think we will be happy and will actually want them to be with us? No, we do not; none of us do. We want them to get out. If the military has to have a presence, we want to make sure that that military has not committed any crimes, we want to make sure that the institution of the military would be accountable to a point that if, in fact, wrong has been done, those people would be held accountable. But, what has been happening for the last 14 or 15 years after the war? Making a complete denial of such crimes. Sir, you can deny; the Members opposite can deny; even the Sinhalese Members in this House can deny, but at the very least, if you truly believe that the Tamil Members and the Tamil people are lying about the crimes that were committed, then why can you not have an investigation and prove your innocence? Why can you not do that? Your denial only proves even more that even you know that those heinous crimes have occurred. But, everything can be swept under the carpet to, in fact, sustain this racist Sinhala-Buddhist ideology that is so pervasive in this State structure. So, that is why we hate it.

Sir, 15 years after the war, there are LTTE suspects who are still struggling to live. Their relatives are frightened to give them jobs because the military will target the relatives also. So, with great difficulty, they manage to find daily wage-earnings. And, what does the military do? At their whims and fancies, they ask those persons to come for questioning; they ask them to come to the camp. Those people have no choice, but to drop their work and go to the camp. The people who employ them, then, sack them. Their families are destroyed by this. But, it is happening on a daily basis, Sir. You are destroying the soul of families by doing this harassment. Is it fair? All of it is being done by the military and the TID. I mean, it is ridiculous!

In Trincomalee, in Kadakkaraichenai, 18 acres of land are illegally being occupied by the Navy. That land belongs to ten families. All the ten families have been summoned by the Navy to come to the Fourth Floor. Why? To threaten them to willingly give up the land. So, whatever reality the vast majority of the Members of this House may see with regard to the military in the South, it is completely the opposite the people of the North-East see happening there, completely the opposite. And, if you are not prepared to recognize the rights of the Tamil people and want to carry on with your racist actions of the past, then you need that military because the Tamil people are not going to give up the struggle for their rights.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member you have two more minutes. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I have three more minutes, since only 14 minutes have gone out of my 17 minutes, Sir.

The Tamil people are not going to give up the struggle for their rights. And, in order for you to continue with this oppression, your military has to be strengthened. You have no choice. Even if this countrys economy can be revived not only by cutting down the military expenditure, but also by using those innocent young people, not the criminals, to productive use, at the same time by finding a political solution so that you can get the members of the Tamil diaspora to come and invest in a great way in this country, even though you have that choice, you would rather choose that racist ideology which tries to make this Sri Lankan Island only for the Sinhalese Buddhists and to defeat anybody who could challenge that ideology and face bankruptcy rather than change your bankrupt ways. And that foremost institution which is destroying this country, which destroyed it in the past, which is corrupt and which will continue to destroy it, you all will go on nurturing.

Sir - I say this with utmost respect - the day you all will change the way in which you look at how a military ought to be, the day you realize that the military is not there for the politicians but for the people and for their rights and not to stand against them will be the day this

country will truly prosper. Till then, it will be the cesspit that it is now and will become worse. Till then, every Member of this House will want to send his child abroad to study and earn well and it is only the ordinary man, whom you are districting with your racism, who will ultimately continue to suffer.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) And, that is why, Sir, we, as a community, as a nation which has been battered, battered because we stood for our rights, when the South decides to stand for their rights, will always support them.

Thank you.

So, I still stand by that and I also did not say 14, but I said, "10 families"; I said, "10 families that I am aware of who owned 18 acres." That is what I said. I corrected myself with regard to TID and I said, "Fourth Floor." So, I have not mislead this House. The second thing is that you are entitled to your opinion in calling us names.

So, please address your mind to that. Maybe, the Hon. Mano Ganesan said that the Tamil people are being targeted. I also know that they go to Tamil houses. They may be gathering other information also. But, in the case of gathering information - this is another issue that you must address yourself - the Human Rights Commission had also said that the provisions of the Police Ordinance are not applicable. So, address your mind to that, please. There is a court ruling that you cannot get this information from householders.

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) Hon. Member, after I answered that question and went home the other day, my family said that even our household had been issued with that form. This is done purely to see whether any criminals from somewhere else have escaped from that area, come to Colombo and are residing here. That way - I can give you the figures - we have been able to identify so many wrongdoers. .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Minister, look at the court ruling and comply with that please. That is, CFR 412 of 2007.

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) When was the court ruling given, Hon. Member? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) In 2007.

385 386

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) I will check on that. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That was the time when the war was raging; that was the time when the state of Emergency was in force. Still, there was a ruling that you cannot do it.

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) I will check on that. But, I am not sure whether it is still applicable, if it was in 2007. Now, we are in 2022 and in 2008, 2009, 2010, right through, that has been done. No one had objected to that at that time. - [Interruption.] No, what I am saying is, if there was a court ruling, I am sure you all would have brought it up at that time.

( ) (An Hon. Member) Yes, definitely. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Chairman, - ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Yes, Hon. Sumanthiran? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) In 2007, after that Parliament came into existence, all the MPs of the Northern Province filed a Fundamental Rights case and in that, the Attorney-General came and conceded that that was wrong. That is also on record. His Lordship Buwaneka Aluwihare, who is now in the Supreme Court, was the lawyer who came on behalf of the Attorney-General and conceded that that was wrong and they would stop that practice. So, I am only bringing it to your notice. Please, look into that fact.

( ) (The Hon. Tiran Alles) Okay, thank you.
