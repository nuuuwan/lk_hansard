PUBLIC FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) 2023 .

. . .

. . I just want to make mention of the main component, Section 2, of the Executive Summary of "The Committee on Public Finance Report on the 2023 Budget - Assessment of the Fiscal, Financial and Economic Assumptions". . , . .

, . , . outsource .

Sir, since the Hon. Prime Minister is also here, I would like to quote the third paragraph of the Executive Summary of this Report:

"Section 2 discusses the economic and financial assumptions underlying Budget 2023 and the key risk factors associated with these assumptions. The two main macroeconomic assumptions used in the formulation of the Budget are real GDP growth and the inflation rate. Real GDP growth rate for 2023 is assumed to be a negative 3 per cent. Given the current economic crisis, achieving a positive 5.7 percentage point change in real GDP growth from the lowest growth of -8.7 per cent observed for the past several decades may prove challenging. The COPF observes that possible downside risks to the real GDP growth rate assumption can arise from GDP sectoral forecasts and changes in aggregate demand. On the production side, the industry sector is expected to record a subpar performance, particularly given the weak global growth forecast for 2023."

As you know the entire global growth forecast is falling. It further states, I quote:

"On the demand side, contractionary monetary policy coupled with tight fiscal policy is expected to dampen investment and consumption, posing a risk to the economic recovery."

Here, what we are trying to point out, Sir, is that with interest rates now at 36 per cent on the temporary overdraft and leasing rate at about 40 per cent plus, it is going to be extremely difficult for industrial sector to grow. Then, it also goes on to state, I quote:

"On inflation, COPF is of the view that an annual average inflation rate of 30 per cent assumed in the Budget 2023 is plausible."

With regard to inflation, the assumption for this year, Sir, is 30 per cent; 30 . . . . 30 .

1155 1156

Then, the Report states, I quote;

Although the latest data indicates a deceleration in inflation, global inflationary pressures together with supply chain disruptions, will keep inflation at elevated levels in 2023. This section also looks at other assumptions such as the expected export growth and the profitability of the financial sector underlying the budget estimates.

About Section 3, it states, I quote:

"Section 3 provides an analysis of the revenue and expenditure estimates in the 2023 Budget and evaluates them against the assumptions underlying these estimates and the policy measures undertaken in the budget. Given that tax revenue increase in line with nominal GDP growth, policy changes and improvements in tax administration, revenue categories are assessed in terms of changes attributed to nominal growth and changes attributed to policy measures and better administration.

So, what we are saying is that because the inflation is so high, there is going to be a natural growth in your revenue, but getting an additional revenue beyond inflation is a question, given the falling growth rates we are expecting.

The next point I want to highlight, Sir, is this.

On the expenditure front, although the Budget 2023 maintains recurrent expenditure at current levels, this is mainly driven by the reduction in non-interest recurrent expenditure.

What I am going to quote next is important.

Against the backdrop of the economic crisis and high inflation, it may be difficult to maintain certain categories of non-interest recurrent expenditure such as salaries and wages at given levels in 2023. As interest payments are expected to rise considerably, primarily on account of domestic borrowings, COPF is of the view that there is a rollover risk associated with short-term domestic borrowings given the current high yield rates on Treasury Bills. The main risk associated with the foreign interest payment estimate is that it is heavily reliant on the progress of debt restructuring negotiations.

. . 2023 30 suspend . . 31 40 . 40 .

domestic debts . highlight . . . - 3- . 33 . . .

. . . .

.

. . Ordered to lie upon the Table. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe - State Minister of Finance) . . . . that is the main reason why we cannot borrow for about three months. There are so many speculations. People speculate, some, unknowingly and some others, knowingly. So, the moment you speculate, people would not come and invest in bonds for over three months. Your point is taken, but it is also the responsibility of Parliament not to speculate on domestic debt, on which we have not taken a decision yet.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) . . . If you are in the call money market, it is based on perception. - confidence - . . ; speculate . .

. . . . speculate ; . We are just pointing out, Hon. State Minister of Finance, that you have to make sure that you act on your words, without uttering mere words.

Thank you.

Hon. Presiding Member, first, I would like to clarify to the House that I am not protesting against the Government or any particular individual by being in this black attire. I have already written to the Hon. Speaker, the Chief Government Whip and the Chief Opposition Whip that I am making a pilgrimage to Sabarimala and that this would be the attire that is necessary for it.

In his Budget Speech, the Hon. President was referring to the reforms he proposes to bring to the plantation industry. They are fine. But, I must tell the President that unless and until you take the all important human element - the plantation workers - into account, you cannot bring any reform to that industry. So, that is important.

We need a new Constitution so that it could address not only the problems of the Sinhalese, the Tamils and the Muslims, but also of the LGBTQ community. Today, we are in a world where the LGBTQ community is also getting all their rights. But, what are we doing in Sri Lanka? We are looking down upon that

community. So, let us include the LGBTQ community also as a community which has lost its rights. When discussing about a new Constitution, let us see that all the religions and all the communities, including the LGBTQ community, get their rightful place in the society.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. You have 17 minutes.

[4.05 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Presiding Member, the Debate on the Second Reading of the Budget presented by the Minister of Finance, who also happens to be the President, is ending today. I have consistently recorded my opposition to President being the Minister of Finance. From 2010 onwards, in this House, whenever the President, in his capacity as Minister of Finance, has presented a Budget, I have recorded that protest and I wish to record that today as well. When a person who is not a Member of this House presents the Budget or is the Minister of Finance, that seriously curtails this Houses ability to be in total control of public finance, as the Constitution stipulates in Article 148.

This also exposes another thing this time. That is, there is a Twenty First Amendment to the Constitution that was brought in and said to be going back to the Nineteenth Amendment - that is, doing away with the Twentieth Amendment - which, as we pointed out during that Debate, does not really do that. Under the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution, the President could not hold any Ministries, not even the Ministry of Defence. Only for the tenure of the President at that time - personal to President Maithreepala Sirisena- three named Ministries were permitted in the Transitional Provisions. Thereafter, the President could not hold any Ministries. But now, the President actually can hold any number of Ministries; in fact, he can hold all the Ministries. So, this is another occasion on which we can expose that lie to the country, that some reform was made, that Executive powers were curtailed through the Twenty First Amendment, but no, no such thing was done. Even the one positive thing that is being touted is the re-establishment of the Constitutional Council. That also, we pointed out, is a political body, that it is not the Constitutional Council under the Seventeenth Amendment, that more of its Members are from this House, which makes it political, and that body is tasked with the appointment of, amongst others, Independent Commissions.

In the last couple of days, we found how the supposed Independent Commissions' Chairmen had behaved. We saw the Charman of the National Police Commission going to the VIP lounge to receive a person who was chased out of this country for fraud and large-scale corruption. Who else, but the Chairman of the National Police Commission was there bowing to him and welcoming him back! A few days before that, we heard the Chairman of the Office on Missing Persons saying that only a few people went missing and all of them are living abroad.

That very Office was established to investigate into missing persons. All of the Government Commissions, there were many, had reported that over 20,000 people had gone missing; that is a conservative number. But, the Chairman of the Office that was appointed to go into that, supposedly an independent office, says nobody has gone missing. Then, the Hon. Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms explains saying, "No, he is wrong because he has not understood the Governments priority. The Government has prioritized reconciliation measures which must deal with the issue of disappearance also and unfortunately, this Chairman does not seem to know that." That creates another problem. Why should a Chairman of an independent office know what the Governments priorities are, if he is independent? Why should he comply with what the Government wants to do today? The Government would not want to do that tomorrow; the Government changes its mind day to day. If it is an independent office, he has been tasked, by law, to make investigations into the tens of thousands of disappearances in the country, but that is what its Chairnan says. So, the Twenty First Amendment was just an eyewash and really did not make anything independent in this country nor did it strip the President of any Executive powers.

That said, let me turn to the Budget Proposals. I want to concentrate on one matter and that is with regard to the EPF. The EPF is Sri Lankas single largest fund. That fund has been dipped into and there are serious allegations of fraud and corruption in the way investments have been made out of this fund. There had been five forensic audits conducted, but no action has been taken to date. The last Annual Report of this Fund published was for 2016. Forensic audits had revealed massive frauds into the earnings and savings by the working force of this country, and not a muscle has been moved; nothing, to date, has happened with regard to taking action on that. I am highlighting this because the economic crisis we are facing in this country is primarily due to corruption and that is why the IMF, in its Report, said there are corruption susceptibilities and that is one of the challenges for the IMF's implementing of its programme in this country. The President or the Minister of Finance, in his Budget Speech, said that that - corruption issues - will be dealt with. But, where? Nothing has been done.

The other issue is with regard to the office of the Attorney-General, who advises the Government, appears on behalf of the Government and defends the Government. Even when the Right to Information Commission orders the Central Bank to divulge certain information, the Central Bank appeals and the Attorney-General appears for them.

All these are public funds, monies of the people of this country. There is absolutely no transparency. Evidently, large-scale corruption and fraud, all that is covered up by the Government, the Central Bank, the EPF and the Attorney-General gives absolute sanction to cover it up. With that background, how do we get out of this economic crisis? The Government pays lip service, but every action of the Government demonstrates the opposite.

1283 1284

Earlier this morning, the Hon. Anura Dissanayaka cited the case of a Minister who asked an Ambassador for a bribe. That was reported; he was suspended from the Cabinet; he got a committee of his choice appointed, which exonerated him, and he is back in the Cabinet. To add insult to injury, that very Minister has been appointed as the Presidents nominee on the Constitutional Council! The Constitutional Council, which is supposed to appoint independent Commissions, hand-picked him because there is no one who is up to that mark in the Cabinet, who has the brass to go and ask an Aambassador for a bribe! I suppose the other Ministers are a little less corrupt. So, you have to pick the most corrupt to appoint to the Constitutional Council. Then, you have a convicted extortionist as the Chief Government Whip.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

So, how do we tell either the IMF or anyone else that we are dealing with corruption? The Government has really no intention of doing any of that sort; the President, too, has no intention. Those are Presidents appointments. So, you say one thing, but do just the opposite.

There is a book written by Mr. V.P. Vittachi on President J.R. Jayewardenes conduct, a small blue colour book which I have read some time ago. It is called Sri Lanka: What Went Wrong? Mr. Vittachi coins a word and calls it plonking. He says, President Jayewardene will say, I am turning right; this is the right way to go. I am turning right, now and he will turn left. While travelling left, all the time he insists, No, no, I am travelling right. That is plonking. The incumbent President learned his political lessons from President Jayewardene and one wonders whether that is what he is now practising saying, We are dealing with corruption, but doing the very opposite to what will eradicate corruption.

The Tamil National Alliance Parliamentary Group met today and took certain decisions with regard to this Budget. We have highlighted various shortcomings and matters that are contrary to the well-being of this country, particularly the high percentage of allocation to the defence sector. The countrys economy is contracting; various fundamental service sectors are contracting and reducing whilst, in the last two years, the allocation to the defence sector has increased by 12 per cent!

That is not just salaries and Recurrent Expenditure which is necessary. You must visit one of the camps to see the high life that goes on there. To test it out, a few days ago, I went with the Hon. President and had lunch at the Air Force Base, Vavuniya. The lunch was of a standard that is higher than what you can get in a seven-star hotel; nothing has come down. No one wants to touch that; the ceramic ware, food and everything, nobody wants to touch. But, you are telling the country to reduce

expenses. Seventy per cent of our people have dropped one meal and 50,000 children are in danger of malnutrition! The Government might deny it, but those are the real facts. And, you want to keep the military happy; you do not want to upset them so that you could suppress dissent and the people who protest that they do not have food to eat. So, all of that is there.

And, at a time like this, one would have expected a programme through this Budget to lift this country out of the economic crisis, but that is not there. So, we are opposed to this Budget. But, for one reason, we took a decision today not to cast our vote in opposition.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am concluding, Sir.

That is, due to the reason that the President has, in the last couple of days, repeatedly said that he is taking steps to resolve the long-standing Tamil national question. Although we are sceptical - it is not because we trust it - we do not want to be blamed for opposing a President when he says, I want to solve this. Come, let us sit down and talk. So, for that very reason, we will, today, not cast our vote against this Budget. Thank you.

The Determination further states, I quote:

"ln a welfare state, public finances must sustain free public services such as education and health and other subsidized services. We are of the view that there is no logical reason as to why judges should not be called upon to contribute on a non-discriminatory basis, directly or indirectly, to the State coffers along with other members of the public despite the differences identified above. These

1313 1314

differences do not have a rational relationship to the purpose of taxation, which is to increase government revenues. The public services provided through public funds are available to all judicial officers."

Then again, it also goes on to state, I quote:

"We are of the view that the reasoning in the above cases is logical and instructive on the issue of taxes on the salaries of judges. When a tax is applied across the board, as in this case, without directly or indirectly targeting the judges, it cannot be said to be an intrusion into the independence of the judiciary. Taxes are one of the main revenues generating measures to enhance public finance. Public services such as free health and free education in this country are run with public finance. They are open to all citizenry including judges of the superior courts and Judicial Officers within the meaning of Article 111 M of the Constitution. ln fact, the decision of this Court in Chathurika Silva is premised on the legitimate expectation that judges have of admitting their children to State schools. Hence there is no logical reason to exempt judges from making their contribution to the public coffers along with the other members of the community. To that extent, the classification is Judges should have the same obligations as other citizens on taxing matters."
