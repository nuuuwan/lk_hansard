( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees)Hon. Member, you have two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka) I must tell her that LTTE was a dastardly terrorist organization. They murdered innocent civilians. They murdered Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims and even went onto murder the Indian Prime Minister. They used suicide cadres to kill politicians; they killed even Tamil leaders. They killed innocent villagers; they chopped mothers and babies cold-bloodedly. They killed the devotees who had gone to worship and attacked places of worship. They destroyed the economic centres.

Madam, you have heard only one side of the story from those who are supporting the LTTE or those who are representing them. We request you to do justice to us. Otherwise, you will be disgracing the decorum of your office. I am very humbly asking you whether you are angry with us because we eliminated the LTTE and eradicated terrorism from this country.

. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , .. ! .

[4.31 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) , ! Sir, I am glad to speak just after the Hon. State Minister who cried wolf before he concluded his speech. On the last occasion, in the last Session of Parliament, also he cried wolf about another matter. He spoke in Parliament and said that there were secret meetings that were being held, convened by me with regard to the state of the economy of the country. Unfortunately, - ( ) (The Hon.Shehan Semasinghe) Hon. Member, I did not say that. .. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) When you spoke, you said there were secret meetings being held. - [Interruption.] All right! Okay, okay. You said I was convening secret meetings. ( ) (The Hon.Shehan Semasinghe) That is true. .. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) That, you said after I spoke to you about an hour before that and invited you for that meeting itself, which you chose not to attend, but you came in to the Chamber and cried wolf.

There were Members of the Government who attended that meeting. In fact, a respected Member of your Government, the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana, even signed the statement that came out of that meeting. There were two other Members, who are Chairs of the finance Committees of Parliament, attended that meeting. A closed-door meeting is not a secret meeting. So, just as you did the last time, today also you have cried wolf once again, saying that the campaign to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act - PTA - is with ulterior motives. I can assure you, Hon. State Minister, that when there was an attempt to repeal the PTA in the last Parliament, your party Members participated in the Committees in Parliament and it is a recorded fact that they said they support fully the repeal of the PTA. All that they objected to was that the Bill that was supposed to replace the PTA, which was called the Counter Terrorism Bill, had certain other draconian provisions which could have been used against trade unions and other organizations because there was a new provision that was brought in, by which organizations could be proscribed. I agreed with them at that point in time. So, we were all in agreement that the Prevention of Terrorism Act ought to be repealed. The draconian provisions in the Prevention of Terrorism Act

1333 1334

have no place in a civilized society. So, having agreed and worked together on that, having given assurances to the world, having given assurances to the European Union in particular that it will be repealed, now, when there is consensus almost throughout the whole country, not just from the Tamil people from the North and the East, but from all corners of this Island, when people have now realized how draconian, how oppressive this piece of legislation is, you are - ( ) (The Hon.Shehan Semasinghe) Hon. Member, can I make a clarification? .. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, all right. I will give you one minute to do that. ( ) (The Hon.Shehan Semasinghe) On the 17th of September, 2018, the Bill you are referring to, the Counter Terrorism Bill, was gazetted. Am I right? .. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes. ( ) (The Hon.Shehan Semasinghe) At that time, the Government which was ruling the country supported it. So, why did you not go ahead with it? .. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) I will answer that. Thank you. ( ) (The Hon.Shehan Semasinghe) If you say that there was consent from our end also, why did you not go ahead with that? ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you, Hon. State Minister. Your point is taken. Hon. Sumanthiran, please continue. .. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) I am thankful to the Hon. State Minister for raising that question. This is a question that a lot of people are asking me in the public realm as well and you have given me an opportunity of answering that.

We also found various negative features in that Bill and in a Parliamentary Committee, particularly in the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Legal Affairs (Anti-corruption) and Media, we corrected those provisions.

There were, still, some more objectionables even for us and the Minister of Foreign Affairs at that time, the Hon. Tilak Marapana, gave an assurance that at the Committee Stage, those also would be corrected. But, that was, as you rightly said, in September, 2018. In October, your party tried a backflip, a Constitutional coup in the country. There was instability right through November and December. After that, there was no possibility of going through that Bill and then, the Easter bombing happened. When the Easter bombing happened, naturally, people called for a strong leader, strong pieces of legislation, and I will come to my next point on that.

The Parliamentary Select Committee that inquired into the Easter bombing in September, 2019 came out with the Report which asked the question whether this was done in order to evoke in the country a call for a strong leader with the Presidential Election coming later in the year. That was only a question that was posed by the Parliamentary Select Committee, but it is being proved more and more to be the actual fact. There were intelligence reports that were available, not just three weeks before the attack, even one hour before the attack. The previous evening there were sources that were available, who are still alive because it came from a different country, but to date, not one muscle has been moved to take action against those who perpetrated the act. You took action to charge persons who neglected their duty, who allowed it to happen. That also must be done; I am not saying it should not be done. But, far more important is to go after the ones who planned, premeditated the acts and caused so much havoc in the country. Not one has been produced before court.

Now, before I sit down, I want to table* the letter dated 11th February, 2022, which Party Leaders in this House, including the Members of the Government subscribed to, saying certain steps must be taken to arrest the economic situation of the country.

I am not saying that because we say you should do that. Everyone is agreed that this should have been done more than a year ago. There is no coherence in the Government. You listen to the Minister of Finance and you cannot even understand what he is saying. There are several of his interviews. We are ashamed that that is the coherence with which the Hon. Minister of Finance of the country is speaking. The Governor says something totally opposite. You, Hon. State Minister, also holds a portfolio connected to finance in this country. So, there must be a coherent policy. This is a damage that is caused to the whole country. We all are willing to stand together and approach this situation. So, I urge this Government - since time is short, I am winding up - do not play politics

1335 1336

with the economic situation as you have been doing with the Easter bomb attack. This must be faced by the whole country together and we have demonstrated that we are willing to support the Government in addressing the situation.
