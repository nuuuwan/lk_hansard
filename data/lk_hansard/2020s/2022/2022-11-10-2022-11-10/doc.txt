VALUE ADDED TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL: DETERMINATION

OF THE SUPREME COURT

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I wish to announce to Parliament that I have received the Determination of the Supreme Court in respect of the Bill entitled "Value Added Tax (Amendment)", which was challenged in the Supreme Court in terms of Article 121(1) of the Constitution.

On an overall consideration of the provisions of the Bill, the Supreme Court is of the opinion that subject to the following amendments being moved at the Committee Stage of Parliament as proposed by the learned Deputy Solicitor General, the Bill, as a whole, is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution:

(i) Clause 3 The Insertion of the following proviso in Section 10(1) - Provided further, for the purposes of paragraph (vii), the requirement for the registration shall raise from the date on which this Amendment Act comes into operation.

(ii) Clause 4(1) The reference to September 30, 2022 to be deleted and substituted with November 30, 2022.

(iii) Clause 4(2) The reference to October 1, 2022 to be deleted and substituted with December 1, 2022.

I order that the Determination of the Supreme Court be printed in the Official Report of todays Proceedings of the House.

, COP27 , 2015 , -2015- COP26 , , 2050 1 5 , ,

Hon. Deputy Speaker, there has been no progress made since COP 26 till we went for COP 27. In fact, the target of limiting global warming to 1.5C by 2050 was being raised again even by some of the developed coun-tries and many countries in the G20. The G20 countries have not reduced their emissions at all. They have not, in any way, contributed the US Dollar 100 billion that they promised. We require US Dollar 350 billion a year, but we have not even fulfilled that pledge. So, in that sense, we went for COP 27 having a setback in the agreements and the achievements made at COP 26.

When we looked at COP 27 arrangements, we found that none of the developed countries or the G20 countries

2711 2712

[

2022 10

were there to have a serious conversation with others. Some of the leaders who came, came only for the opening day and though they were supposed to have made state-ments, those statements were made not at the main con-ference, but on the sidelines of various events that took place. Then, they all left. Actually, on the second day, the only senior leader we had from the European side was the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who was there taking part in the Global Shield initiative that they had initiated. We must thank him for that. Of the G20 leaders, the main position was taken by the President of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa. In that background, I myself from Sri Lanka and some of the other leaders had to condemn and criti-cize the stand that had been taken by the G20 countries, the G7 countries and the developed economies.

We cannot go on like this. There are serious issues that the world faces. If you listen to the speech made by the Secretary General of the UN, you would realize that in the next 20 or 30 years, the situation will become more serious. We listened to the Prime Minister of Pakistan. We studied the situation, where the melting of the Hima-layas has affected Pakistan. Not only them, but Nepal also said that it is going to affect them too. Then, it is going to affect India, where the Ganges runs through and in fact, it is also going to affect Bangladesh because both the Gan-ges and the Brahmaputra run through Bangladesh. It is going to affect Myanmar because the Irrawaddy and Sal-ween rivers run through Myanmar. Then, it is also going to affect the Maldives; it will go under water. It is going to affect us with part of our western coast going under water. Even places like Kanyakumari at the tip of South India will go under water. That is the threat that all of us are facing, but there is no response on that by the major countries.

So, we were discussing among ourselves that the only way out is to go for COP28 and lock horns with the G20 countries on these issues. The target is to limit global warming to 1.5C by 2050. We have to lock horns with them and take them on, which means we have to be ready to discuss it with like-minded countries. I am sure both the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Envi-ronment can do that. Most countries are waiting to do that. So, Sri Lanka has to join them. We must, as far as possible, support it and if necessary, on some occasions, take the leadership on this issue.

The second matter is, food security. We have gone through a problematic period. I must thank the countries which helped us. We would not have a major issue with regard to food security next year, hopefully. But in Afri-ca, the situation is pretty bad: 20 to 30 million people will be affected and there will be a large number of deaths in the Horn of Africa. There is no aid or assistance and it was also not discussed. In addition to that, some of them cannot grow food; others cannot get fertilizer to grow food because they do not have money. So, we have to help them. The other matter is, most of them are affected especially by debt. So, in my view, we should give assis-tance to those countries which have serious problems of food scarcity.

On the same terms, the IMF gave help to Ukraine.

Ukraine is fighting a war with Russia. But, these peo-ple are fighting the war of survival. So, we should ask the West to give them the same support that was given to Ukraine. These are major issues which should be part of our foreign policy and our environment policy in the coming years.

I was very happy when the Chief Opposition Whip referred to Geneva. I think The right to live of this gener-ation, the younger people who will be 40, 50 by 2050, and the unborn, of whom we are talking, is the very basic right. So, if you ignore the rights of the youth, the young-er generation, and the unborn, that would be the worst genocide which could happen. So, we hope, in time to come, while they are addressing issues concerning Sri Lanka, they will also be in a position to address this whole issue, which I would call genocide into genocide into genocide. So, we should raise that up.

Okay. I will tell you, both of you have a discussion and come to me with the agreed figures. We are willing to put more panels to start inquiring. That is the only way we can address their issues. Next week, we will have a discussion with the Members of Parliament from the North on the procedure, and, Hon. Member, I will also invite you.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) Although he is not from the North.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) He says that he represents the people of recent Sri Lankan origin living in Vavuniya. There is a fair number in that area settled by Mr. Sellasamy and now, he is tak-ing leadership on behalf of them. So, we have to discuss that problem and get it out of the way.

( ) (The Hon. Mano Ganesan) I am a Sri Lankan.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Yes, you are a Sri Lankan. Otherwise? You had more Sinhala votes, votes of three-wheeler drivers and all those, than some of the Sinhala Members here.

I hope my good Friend, the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam from the All Ceylon Tamil Congress, will also join us to settle this problem. Even if you go halfway, it would be a big thing.

We are also having a development plan for the North. I am getting an assessment done on the renewable energy potential in the North and the possibility of producing green hydrogen. If you produce green hydrogen on a competitive basis, the whole economy of the North would come up. So, we have to look into that because the bulk

of our renewable energy will be produced in areas from Puttalam all the way down to Trincomalee. There are other areas of development we are going to focus on. We started development from Trincomalee down to the East with tourism. So, there is a fair number of developments we want to do. Apart from that, we want to settle that issue. All of us are Sri Lankans. Therefore, let us all get together and make it a point to settle that.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) It would be too late.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) It would not be too late. We are working accordingly. Easily, the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva can go and ask them for that. He went and asked for that before he made his statement here.

So, we will keep you informed if there is any develop-ment. We have told you that they have given us targets;

those will not change. It is a four-year programme. We have to go to the original rate of 14.5 per cent or 15 per cent. We are looking into that. The Budget tries to accel-erate it so that we can have a higher growth rate and cer-tainly, more development and investments. So, we will look at the targets the IMF has given and see how we can increase revenue. That is what I want from this Budget. Certainly, on the Agreement, we will keep you informed.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) If the IMF Agreement is tabled before the Budget, it would be very helpful. Then, we will know where we are heading.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) The IMF says, Do not release it till we finish this round of negotiations. - [Interruption.] Do not worry. I will not put anyone into trouble.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) By that time, you can sign and seal the Agreement.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) The Agreement has been signed and finished. We must get the others to sign.

If there is a change, I will come back and tell you. But so far, we do not know what China and India has to say. I do not think -

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) The only thing is, when you were on this side, you were always asking for the Agreements to be tabled.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) I stand by that. But, there are three other parties we have to discuss with and also the private creditors. There was no intermediate stage. But, I can keep you all briefed. There are targets; those targets would not change. So, you can look at those and tell us your ideas.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) [12.39 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Deputy Speaker, the Hon. Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms has proposed many Amendments to the existing legislation to introduce important reforms in a variety of areas and he explained the details of what he proposes to do.

Before I move on to some of the substantive matters, I would like to digress initially to point out about a contro-versial issue that has arisen in the Sri Lanka Law College with regard to the conduct of its examinations. That sub-ject comes under the Hon. Minister and we have also briefly discussed in the House a few days ago about the new rule that had been promulgated by the Council of Legal Education, asking the Tamil and the Sinhala medi-um students, who follow lectures conducted at the Sri Lanka Law College in English, to sit for examinations and answer question papers too in English. This has cre-ated a serious problem for students who are from the ver-nacular language streams.

Sir, both Minister (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Pres-idents Counsel, as well as Former Minister M. U. M. Ali Sabry, Presidents Counsel, are vernacular-educated, prominent lawyers who have been given silk. I have also been a former Minister of Justice. Out of my own experi-ence, I can tell you that even when I entered the Sri Lanka Law College, I opted to sit for some papers in the Tamil language, my mother tongue, though I followed lectures in English because I was more confident in my mother tongue to sit for examinations. So, that opportuni-ty should not be denied to the students who wish to sit for papers in their mother tongue. On the pretext of this elit-ist approach to impose English literacy on the legal fra-ternity from their Law College days is a very futile exer-cise because we must understand that people will have to, over a period of time, develop their ability in English.

2725 2726

That is what all of us did. Therefore, I would once again plead with the Minister to reconsider that decision and would also urge the Council of Legal Education - I hope what we speak today will be conveyed to His Lordship the Chief Justice as well, as the Chairman of the Council of Legal Education - to consider that matter and give some kind of relief to the students who wish to sit for examination papers in their mother tongue since compre-hending questions and answering papers in the mother tongue is easier for some of those students who come from rural areas. All of us are clear examples for that. My Colleague, the Hon. Dilan Perera - he is the son of an illustrious lawyer - too opted to sit for -

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Even the present Principal of the Law College.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) There you are! So, several such examples are there. Therefore, once again, I plead that this matter be consid-ered. Sir, I do not want to spend anymore time on that.

Then, I would like to refer to a news article that ap-peared in The Morning newspaper of Wednesday, 09th of November under the caption SC rejects Muslim wom-ens bid to apply as Quazis, which states, I quote:

"The Supreme Court (SC) yesterday (8) refused to grant leave to proceed for two separate Fundamental Rights (FR) petitions filed by a number of Muslim women challenging the Gazette dated 7 October, 2022, which called for applications only from Muslim males to be considered for appointment as Quazis and as Members of the Board of Quazis.

What is most striking is this.

".. the petitioners had wanted the said Gazette Notification amended to lift the ban imposed on females to apply. The court did not provide any reason for the refusal."

Sir, that issue is a very contentious issue because the Supreme Court, on several occasions after having heard counselling support to grant leave, had refused leave without assigning any reason. For instance, when it came to the petitions on the Twentieth Amendment, a variety of counsels appeared for several days and after having heard all counsels, finally, the Supreme Court refused leave without assigning reasons. This is a very funny situation. I would like to urge that on such important matters, at least a brief reasoning be given by the Court to justify why leave is being refused, particularly when it comes to the original jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court. When I say original jurisdiction, that means, the jurisdic-tion on Fundamental Rights as well as on Constitutional matters, issues concerning the constitutionality of Bills before this House. Those are matters of original jurisdic-tion conferred on the Supreme Court. There, the litigants, the applicants or the petitioners do not have a right to appeal beyond that because the Supreme Court is the apex court.

Therefore, assigning reasons for the refusal to grant leave is something that should be normally done, not on all peremptory matters, but particularly on important mat-ters, though it is within the powers of the Supreme Court to refuse leave. Having heard counsels for days on, they do not assign reasons.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Therefore, that is a very unsatisfactory situation and I would like to urge that that matter be reconsidered.

Also, when it comes to Muslim personal laws, we have asked the Hon. Minister of Justice to give us the so-called Shabry Haleemdeen Report, which is still not made public, so that we, Members of Parliament, can examine it and ensure that all those reforms necessary for Muslim personal laws are brought forthwith without much delay. Then, we can have a closure to the contro-versy that exists regarding certain reforms for Muslim personal laws in this country.

Thank you.

2765 2766

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) The Hon. Member raised several pertinent questions. One is about the four detainees who had been pardoned by His Excellency the President. In fact, there was a tech-nical issue, Hon. Presiding Member. Some persons were under appeal - they have been convicted and they have appealed to the Supreme Court and were waiting until their appeals were disposed of. It is not permitted under the Constitution to grant pardon when an appeal is pend-ing. But with all that, we have granted pardon subject to the condition that they will withdraw the appeals.

The Hon. Charles Nirmalanathan brought to my notice about the other two detainees. Apparently when we granted pardon, we did not know that in addition to the jail sentence, there had been a direction by the Honoura-ble Court that they should also go through a period of rehabilitation, extending up to one year. Now, for that, I was told, the Commissioner General of Prisons had sought the opinion of the Hon. Attorney General, and we will accelerate the process.

With regard to the land matter, in fact, I have already constituted a committee, Chaired by the Secretary of my Ministry, consisting of all the Secretaries of the relevant Ministries and District Secretaries of all five Districts in the Northern Province. They are going ahead with that. Then, through the mobile services that we started, we were able to cater to around 12,000 returnees from India, who had issues with regard to the National Identity Cards, passports and birth certificates. I think, at least 75 to 80 per cent of the problems have been sorted; but still there are some pending issues and we are dealing with them.

As the Hon. Member pointed out, in fact I met a per-son today, who wanted to go overseas for urgent medical treatment. That person has paid the money for one day service of the passport, but the date given was 27th of December. So, what the Hon. Member raised is true; it is a very valid point. In fact, in the morning also I spoke to the Minister in charge of the subject and I was told that there had been some shortage of passport books. Certain-ly, we will attend to that on an urgent basis.

Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) How many minutes do I have, Sir? ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) You have five minutes, Hon. Member. [2.49 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) Hon. Presiding Member, there is an old saying that goes, Do not throw the baby out with the bathwater. The Hon. Minister of Justice is present here. I think, our system has failed. So, we are in a situation - I think we are in a unique situation, Hon. Minister - where we can actually think anew, think outside the box and bring in laws and regulations that can actually make that "system change" happen in this country. That is required. Hon. Minister, I know you are trying very hard. We have had several consultations with you in regard to the things that you want to do in your Ministry. So, let me first wish you well in those endeavours.

However, Sir, we are in a situation like - We are bankrupt. We are actual-ly economically bankrupt and also we are now politically and socially bankrupt. We have to fix this country. In this time of adversity we have a good opportunity. If both sides of the aisle can work together, we can actually fix this country now and have a system in place that we can be proud of and hand this country over to the next gener-ation.

However, is this the system change that was promised not so long ago? Look at the continuing scandals and allegations that are taking place even in this bankrupt state. Look at the coconut oil scandal that took place; look at the sugar scandal that took place. We, actually, as Samagi Jana Balawegaya and Samagi Tharuna Balawega-ya, went to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption and made a complaint. It has been two years now, but we still have not got any result as to

2769 2770

what is happening with that investigation. There is noth-ing that they have notified to any of us as to what is go-ing on with that investigation.

Hon. Presiding Member, we say that we are one coun-try with one system of law. However, sadly, we are like two countries with many systems of law - one law for the rich and the powerful and some other law for the poor and downtrodden villager who lives in a remote place in Pol-onnaruwa, Ampara or any other area. If a villager picks up a coconut from a neighbour's compound, then the full extent of the law will be extended to him; he will have to face the full consequences of it. This is what we must change in this country. If you look at the Easter Sunday attack, Sir, we are still waiting for justice. The families are waiting for justice; they are still crying at night won-dering what happened. Hon. Minister, if we are to move forward in this country, we need to solve these issues. I can understand the pain and the sufferings that those families are undergoing and I can relate to that.

Sir, look at the laws that need to be put in place. For example, we need laws in regard to contempt of court incidents and we need an anti-corruption laws in this country. In regard to Muslim divorce laws and Kandyan divorce laws, we need to have new laws in place, so that this country will have a unified system. But we are still waiting for all that.

Look at the number of rape incidents happening. Hon. Minister, a recent survey statistics on rape incidents re-vealed that Sri Lanka has recorded the highest number of rape cases in Asia. It is a very sad state. Again, look at the sufferings of school children and sexual abuse of school children. All in all, look at the plight of the school chil-dren today.

Also there was a story about animal cruelty doing rounds on Facebook, yesterday or the day before. The Director of a certain hospital has ordered that all the dogs be beaten and chased out. There was a dog that was about to give birth and the pups that were born were stillborn. There are several cases like this. We are supposed to be a Buddhist country, but the number of cases regarding cru-elty to animals are increasing. Therefore, we need to bring in laws to that effect. I do not know why it is not happen-ing.

Hon. Presiding Member, I will wind up by saying this. We look at Singapore, Dubai and other countries in terms of their development. They were able to develop because they had stringent laws; they had one law for everybody. When Singapore Airlines went on strike in 1980, Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew said, The rule of law will pre-vail. If the pilots are going on with the strike and if they are not working, I will use the full extent of the law and sack them. I will take in a new set of pilots and continue with the Singapore Airlines. I will not let Singapore Air-lines be grounded nor let the country fall.

So, I think it is time, we need to bring in laws that can actually be followed in this country, without using the police to hammer the Aragalaya or the boys that were in the Aragalaya. We must use the police actually to en-force law and order in this country.

Hon. Presiding Member, I know I have limited time, but Ill wind up by saying this. It is actually with a heavy heart that I see this country struggling to move forward. I look forward to seeing a change and hope that we can change this system by bringing in the laws and regula-tions that are required.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) 8

[3.46 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, I wish to restrict my com-ments to the Amendments that have been proposed to the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. Many who have spoken and written about that Bill have primar-ily concentrated on bail matters. I think the Hon. Minis-ter, when he introduced this Bill in the morning, also stat-ed that he would be moving some Amendments at the Committee Stage assigning cases involving over five grammes of drugs to the High Court and cases involving over ten grammes, to the Court of Appeal, if I am not mistaken.

2787 2788

[

2022 10

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) Cases involving up to ten grammes, to the High Court and above ten grammes, to the Court of Appeal.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Okay.

Sir, I do not want to take my time to speak about the bail provisions, but I do want to say a few words with regard to certain other provisions which, I think, are im-portant and I expect the Government to take them quite seriously. I make these comments, Sir, from a very partic-ular perspective. Former Justice, the Hon. C.V. Wig-neswaran, is here. We belong to two different parties; we do not get on politically, but when it comes to the issue of drugs in the North and the East and the way in which drugs are being spread in the society, I think we all, the TNA, the Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran, my party and I and even some Tamil Members who belong to the Govern-ment, maybe, not officially and openly, are in agreement that the militarys involvement in this process just cannot be denied. Unfortunately, the reality is that the military has not come out of the counter-insurgency mode and they continue to act on the basis of a counter-insurgency strategy and as a result, they are the biggest peddlers of drugs in the North and the East, particularly in Jaffna, I can tell you as a Member for the Jaffna Electoral District. By extension, the police are also in it. So, I make these comments from that specific angle. When we look at the Amendments that have been introduced and when we know that the military and the police are involved in this whole exercise, then, we find that these Amendments, if I may say so, Sir, are actually quite dangerous. So, it is in that respect that I wish to make some comments.

The first matter I wish to bring to the notice of this House is with regard to the provision that currently pre-vails, which is, at present, the police can send drugs to the Government Analysts Department for testing either di-rectly or through court. Sending them through court is something we have no qualms about, but sending them directly by the police, I think, is something that, once again, raises a lot of concern. I precisely look at it from the very specific angle of the military's and the police's involvement in the whole drug problem which prevails in the North and the East and the Hon. Presiding Member will understand as a lawyer that the chain of custody is fundamental in this sort of cases. Also, we all know that primarily because of tampering with evidence, cases fail.

So, in those circumstances, where there is so much of corruption and black money involved, I think the proce-dure of the police sending those productions or evidence directly to the Government Analyst must, in some way, be stopped. Court oversight , I think, has become very im-portant particularly in the North and the East; the sooner you bring it within court, the better it is for a fair proceed-ing. This, Hon. Minister, must particularly be taken into

account. When you consider 2020, if I am not mistaken, several members of the Police Narcotics Bureau were found tampering with drug productions which had been taken into custody and sent directly to the Government Analyst, where they had taken some quantity of those and resold it. If I am not mistaken, there are cases against them. So, that is an important matter that I wish to flag.

Sir, in the case of Nagalingam Chettiyar Kandasamy vs. the Hon. Attorney General, the Court of Appeal held "In a case of this nature, the prosecution not only need to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt but also ensure, with cogent evidence, that the inward journey of the pro-duction has not been disturbed at the all-material point." Then, there is another case, Perera vs. the Hon. Attorney General, in which the Court stated this: "It is a recognized principle that in a case of this nature, the prosecution must prove that the productions had been forwarded to the Analyst from proper custody, without allowing room for any suspicion that there had been no opportunity for tampering or interfering with the production till they reach the Analyst. Therefore, it is correct to state that the most important journey is the inward journey because the final Analyst report will depend on that. So, that is the extent to which the Court gives importance to the chain of custody, to the non-tampering of such evidence. There-fore, having court oversight, I think, will be fundamental in the case of justice.

The other provision proposed is Section 77A(5), which requires the judge to authorize the PNB or any other person authorized by the judge to photograph the evidence and then he can ask the evidence to be de-stroyed. When you have this very high risk of tampering of drugs produced to court and of judicial officers being involved in these drugs cases, not having these evidence protected and safeguarded until the very end of the trial proceedings is another matter that you really need to re-consider, Hon. Minister. I wish to flag those two matters at the beginning.

Then, I wish to come to the main part of what I wish to state. That is with regard to compulsory rehabilitation. Proposed Section 86(1) states that persons will not be prosecuted for offences under Section 52, possession and consumption, Section 54, selling, supplying and procur-ing, or paragraphs (b), (c) or (d) of subsection (1) of sec-tion 54A, which deals with manufacturing and traffick-ing, in the following circumstances: (a) where the quanti-ty of drug is less than one gramme; (b) where such person agrees to undergo treatment for de-addiction and rehabili-tation and (c) where the Attorney-General has stayed prosecution.

Sir, on the face of it, this provision seems progressive. In effect, there is no choice because anyone would prefer or opt to go through the so-called rehabilitation than to go through prosecution. In fact, there is substantive evidence that compulsory rehabilitation drives persons to relapse and hence, it is counterproductive. I am saying it with responsibility. So, under those circumstances, the notion of compulsory rehabilitation, I think, has to be looked at much more deeply.

2789 2790

Then, there is another issue. These rehabilitation cen-tres, at the moment, are found only in two places: Kanda-kadu and Senapura. The Hon. Minister knows that there are serious allegations of human rights violations in both these centres and they are managed by the military, not by experts. The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has, in fact, commented on this very negatively. As a Member of Parliament who represents the North and the East and who deals with the military in a very hostile manner on a very regular basis, what I can say is the less you have the military involved in matters they should not be involved in, the better. This is entirely a civil matter and it has nothing to do with the military. So, to have them involved is really not good and from a North and East point of view, we find it quite problematic.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) ,

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, I have 13 minutes.

Then, Sir, proposed Section 86(2)(a) empowers the police officer in charge to refer a person to a Government Medical Officer - GMO - to determine the extent of drug dependency. The GMO cannot determine the extent of drug dependency. It is a psychiatrist, a psychologist or an expert counsellor who can, if at all, do it. All that the GMO can do is to carry out a test, if at all, to see whether the person is under the influence of drugs, but not depend-ency. So, there, you have someone who is going to certify that a person is "dependent", not on a scientific basis, but most probably on his own personal experience and his prejudices. So, that again, I think, is something which needs to be looked at.

Sir, the following Section, 86(2)(b), is quite frighten-ing and it is most concerning because it bestows upon the police the power to refer a person to a designated treat-ment centre, if the GMO's report finds the person is drug dependent.

So, the person who is going to certify that a person is drug dependant actually does not have any expertise to do so and if he does it, if the GMO in fact says that a person is drug dependant, the police can directly send a person to a rehabilitation centre without any court involvement. So, in a place like the North and the East, where you have the military and the police directly involved in the spread of drugs, when the police have the power that has been given under this Amendment, you can just imagine, Sir, the disastrous consequences that the people will be put to.

I will conclude by just mentioning one more matter. That is, the way in which proposed Section 87 deals with children. With this Amendment, Sir - it might be seen

somewhat progressive at the superficial level - you are criminalizing children; this Section criminalizes children. The involvement of a child, who is under 18 years, in acts that are criminalized under this law will likely be due to various socio-economic circumstances and there would be several mitigating circumstances that will have to be taken into account in punishing them. Yet, instead of ad-dressing the root causes, enabling the children to rebuild their lives, this provision criminalizes children, who would have become involved in such acts due to poverty, discrimination and marginalization.

Therefore, Sir, I think the Government should have a deeper look at these specifically because - I am saying this with responsibility - of the militarys and the polices involvement in the issues with regards to the spread of drugs in the North and the East. These Amendments that have been proposed might, in the overall context, be seen as something that is required for the country because of the drug menace that is increasing, but, actually, when the police and the military are, in fact, accused of being in-volved in it, when you look at it from that angle, I think they are very dangerous and require a deeper look into them.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) 6

[5.00 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for the time given to speak on these very important Amendments that have been presented today.

I wish to flag just two issues. One is with regard to an Amendment in the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Bill. There is a concern that now, the bail application has to be made to the Court of Appeal instead of the High Court. That is a very serious issue. This is not a question of making bail stringent. You are moving the - [Interruption.] Yes, but whatever it is, it is a question of access to justice. I am saying that because the Court of Appeal sits only in Colombo, whereas now, with the Pro-vincial High Courts, you can go to your provincial capital - in lots of instances, High Courts sit in more than one city or town in that province - and make an application.

2809 2810

This is very important. This is not a question of being lenient towards possession of dangerous drugs, but about anybody, who is accused of this offence, being able to go to court. Access to justice must not be denied. We know of instances where, in framing people, various mishaps take place. So, they must be able to approach court and that must never be made difficult. It is only after the Thir-teenth Amendment to the Constitution that the first ap-peal, even on a district court matter, can be made to a court in the province. Before that, even if the district judge made a small mistake in the course of the proceed-ings, they had to come to Colombo and make an applica-tion. So, with devolution - we talk about Executive pow-ers and the Legislative powers - with regard to the Judici-ary, a salutary feature came in with people having access to justice in that way, at least, in the first appeal. So, I appeal to the Hon. Minister of Justice not to remove the jurisdiction to grant bail in this way, concentrating it to one central place in the whole country because that is denial of justice to people and also it is against devolu-tion.

The second matter that I want to flag is with regard to the proposed Rules under the Prisons Ordinance. They are totally out of order. Several rights that the prisoners have enjoyed for more than 100 years are being taken away and another novel concept is sought to be brought in. If there is a concept that is against incarceration of people, then I would support it because I think incarceration de-humanizes people. There can be exceptions to violent criminals et cetera, but ordinarily, as a punishment, to incarcerate people, I think, is very regressive and that whole thing must be changed. But here, there is no change in that; punishment is still said to be incarceration. But, there are categories of prisoners. What are the cate-gories? Categories are, those who can afford to pay. You are creating paying wards. I heard the Hon. Dilan Perera also saying this. We cannot escape wondering whether some in the government ranks are preparing places for them in the prison. They know that they are going to spend a lot of time in prison. So, they are creating luxuri-ous apartments in prisons already so that when they go there, they can live in comfort. It looks like that. So, this goes against the fundamental principle that when you mete out punishment, all citizens, particularly, the citi-zens who are under the care and control of the State, must be treated equally. Of course, the conditions in the prisons are bad, but the answer is not to alleviate those hardships for the few who can part with some money. That is wrong; that is fundamentally wrong and no country should ever do that. Therefore, I bring it to the notice of the Hon. Minister that those Ordinances which create these differences in class of prisoners must be abolished.

Thank you. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) ,
