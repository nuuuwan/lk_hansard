( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . [ )] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Sumanthiran? - [Interruption.] There is a point of Order being raised. Hon. Sumanthiran, please raise your point of Order.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I raised the issue of the Proclamation on the State of Emergency being approved by Parliament yesterday

and I raised it at the Party Leaders' Meeting also. The Hon. Leader of the House stated that it will be put to vote today. The revocation of the Proclamation on the State of Emergency has no bearing on this. Whenever the State of Emergency is proclaimed, that must be approved by Parliament. A subsequent revocation has no bearing on that. The Government may be running scared to have a vote taken in Parliament. But, they cannot escape from the Constitutional duty of having the Proclamation on the State of Emergency placed in Parliament and a vote taken on it. Now that the Standing Orders have been suspended, I am insisting that we put to vote the Proclamation on the State of Emergency, as made by the President on the 1st of April, 2022.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Speaker, I have a right to reply to the doubts created by the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. At the Party Leaders' Meeting yesterday, the Hon. Sumanthiran did raise this issue and on behalf of the Government, I very clearly stated that the Regulations on the State of Emergency would be tabled in the House today. The Vote can be taken on any other day. We know the Constitutional provisions and when the Regulations will lapse. But, the question raised was whether the Regulations on the State of Emergency would be placed before the House or not. It had been read out by you, Sir.

The second Proclamation revoking it was made last night. The Security Council chaired by His Excellency the President met and revoked it so that it does not exist any longer from mid-night. We know the Constitutional provision. I agree with you, the State of Emergency had been on for two, three days. So, on that basis, we had placed the Proclamation on the State of Emergency before Parliament and the other new Proclamation will also be placed before you.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) . . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Wait. - [Interruption.] We cannot run Government in the way you want. We will run it according to the Constitution. I agreed and assured that we will conduct the Business of the House according to the Constitution, but not on the whims and fancies of you all.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You cannot just promulgate and withdraw it. You are scared now. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. Speaker, -

)

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. Speaker, I would like to associate myself with the sentiments of the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. Actually, this administration brought about the State of Emergency, curfew and banning of social media as a draconian attempt to bring in dictatorship into this country. You do not have autocracy or authoritarianism in this country; this is a democracy. The Leader of the House should understand that. You have to provide an explanation why the State of Emergency was brought in, why curfew was enacted and why social media was banned. What is the reason? - [Interruption.] No. Just because you had a mandate of 6.9 million people or 6.8 million votes, you cannot act with impunity, you cannot behave in an arbitrary manner and you cannot act like a dictator! - [Interruption.] You owe an explanation.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, I owe an explanation and I explained it to him; I explained to the whole House why it was promulgated. - [Interruption.] If he does not understand Sinhala, I can explain in "Ingreesi", if "Ingreesi" is wanted.

, . "You owe an explanation" [ )] ) . ) ; . [ )]

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Next, the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam. You have ten minutes.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, we are discussing today the present crisis faced by the Sri Lankan State. It is not just the Government, but, in fact, the whole State that is in crisis. Even if this Government, at some future date, is forced to accept that it has to leave office and a new Government is formed, that new Government, whichever may be, will be forced to pick up the pieces and that is what the State is in; it is in pieces.

The reaction that we have outside Parliament - on the streets, in ordinary villages, in big cities mainly in the

149 150

)

South but also certainly in the North-East - is that this situation has arisen because this Government has primarily failed in its duty to govern. They have failed because of the incapacity to govern. When the Government was making mistakes, when those mistakes were quite obvious, the Opposition consistently pointed out alternate processes that could be taken. But, the Government chose to ignore them. Simply because they had a two-thirds majority in this House and a President who won with a majority of 1.3 million, this Government thought they could do anything, they could get away with anything and more than anything else, precisely because they had such a mandate, they are actually capable of dealing with a situation that the Sri Lankan State has probably, arguably, never faced in the past. Well, they have failed and that failure has been understood by the general public and that is why these very same people who gave this Government a 1.3 million advantage when they voted for President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and who gave this Government a two-thirds majority, today see no other way than to demonstrate to this Government that they have withdrawn those mandates, that those mandates, they wish to withdraw and they want this Government to understand that message. In a democratic country, in a democratic system where you have elections every five years or four years - in Sri Lanka, it is five years - when a mandate has been given, but the people decide that that mandate must be withdrawn, that they want to withdraw it, the only way in which they can show it is, in fact, by getting on to the streets and that is what they are doing.

So, if there is to be any form of accountability, the fact that the President must go, resign and this Government must also resign forthwith must be something that is above question. It is our reading, Sir, that the public's outcry can be contained, managed for the future only if the Government gets this message straightaway. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa must resign and this Government must leave! But, there is a gap. Unfortunately, we are constrained by what is known as the Constitution and this Constitution does not provide for the crisis that is at hand. What we have within this House is not reflected outside this House or rather, what is reflected outside this House is not reflected in this House because this House is two years old, this House is outdated and the people outside, who actually voted Members into this House, feel disenfranchised.

So, in that case, under the Constitution, if the President has to go, has to resign, that means, it is this House which has to appoint someone from within this House. But, this House, as I said earlier, is redundant. A two-thirds majority, this Government cannot even dream of, if there is an election tomorrow, Sir. Therefore, this House cannot be expected to appoint a President even if Gotabaya Rajapaksa resigns and it is for that reason that we say there must be certain interim measures.

Firstly, if the public outcry and the crisis that is leading to a situation which could become completely ungovernable are to be, in some way, contained, we need

to have an assurance coming out of the Presidents own mouth that he will go immediately. Secondly, we need assurance that this Government will also go. Thirdly, we need a date, a date within the next three months, fixed to face a Parliamentary Election. Once these three assurances are given, we can sit down and see how we can go about in those interim three months until that election takes place and a Parliament and an Executive that are representative of the opinion of todays people could, in fact, govern.

The fact, Sir, is that the Opposition also does not want to govern right now because they feel that they do not have the required numbers in Parliament. Just because you have some 40 odd Members standing up yesterday and announcing that they are independent - I mean, they did support the President and this Government on every issue blindly and it is only today, when the people are on the streets and are up in arms, that they are trying to demonstrate their independence - that independence cannot be taken into account and no reasonable thinking person in the Opposition would be confident enough to take on the mantles of government unless their numbers and their interests in this House are assured so that they can take the tough decisions that ought to be taken, if this country is ever to recover.

Finally, Sir, I also wish to plead with the ordinary Sinhalese people who are protesting today. For the first time in the history of this country, they are protesting not only against the economic crisis, but also against the way in which the Government and the State is acting. For the first time, you have the might of the military being unleashed against them, the might of the State being unleashed against them and they are beginning to see how dangerous it is and how disenfranchised they feel in a situation where politicians only think of themselves, where the politicians have lied to them for decades, not just over the last two, three years, but for decades, and where they have realized that they have been robbed. It is not the North and the East or the Tamil people who have been robbed, but they who have been robbed for 74 years! We have been telling through our mandates given in the North and the East that we have been robbed.

But today, even they, the Sinhalese people, are being robbed and that is why they are on the streets. This moment is a golden moment to make a change in this country, which will result in a totally new beginning where Sri Lanka can actually represent all its peoples, where Sri Lanka can celebrate its multiple identities as a Tamil-speaking nation and a Sinhala-speaking nation. That reality must not be ignored. You have, for the first time, this opportunity where the Tamil people are willing to support you in that change. But, you also must support us. We will agree to the abolition of the Executive Presidency, but you all must agree to restructure Sri Lanka, recognizing the Tamil and Sinhala-speaking nations on federal lines. Your unitary concept is outdated; you had it for 74 years; you had it for the last 12 years even after the destruction of the LTTE, but you have failed using that very same State structure. So, for Gods sake, wake up! Apart from what these politicians have cheated you about, they are also cheating you when they say that federalism is for separation. It is not.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up now. .. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I am winding up, Sir, with this one simple point. The Hambantota District had to wait for a President Rajapaksa - they are, probably, the second most important family amongst the Sinhalese today - for it to be developed. But, it had to wait for a Mahinda Rajapaksa or a Gotabaya Rajapaksa to develop it to what it is today. Should this development not take place regardless of the district? Should this development not take place all over the Island? Should it only take place when a particular personality is in power? If it is to take place equally all over, you have to get rid of this notion of a Unitary State; you have to take power to the grassroots.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up now. .. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I am winding up, Sir.

You have to gather the principle of subsidiarity and the only concept which can make sense, even for the question of development, is one of federalism. You must live up to that reality.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Hon. Member, please respect the Chair. ( ) (The Hon. Harin Fernando) I will respect the Chair, but not you. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The tradition is, the second largest party in the Opposition gets to speak second from the Opposition side. From morning, we have not got the opportunity to speak. There is no logic in this, to have the SJB speak every second time. The SJB is not a privileged party in this House. We must have our turn properly.

( ) (The Hon. Harin Fernando) Okay, please speak. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Right. Thank you.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, today, we are discussing the situation in the country. What is the situation in the country? The situation in the country is that people cannot live, people have no food to eat, people do not have fuel and children cannot go to school. So, they have come on to the streets. That is the situation in the country.

Then, in order to handle that situation, what has the Government done? The Government has resigned; all Members of the Cabinet have tendered their resignation. What does that mean? That means, they accept that they are unable to govern the country. That is the only explanation one can give for the Members of the Cabinet, wholesale, to have tendered their resignation. When that is the real situation, the Hon. Members in the Government rows, one after another, are standing up and saying that they still have the mandate to govern. Then, why did you resign? If you thought that you still have the mandate of the people to govern, why did you all, wholesale in one letter, resign from your portfolios? Having conceded that you have failed, you are now standing up here talking big when the country is in a very serious crisis. So, you must go and when I say that you must go, the leader must go.

After all of these days, you have not understood what the people are saying. If you think that removing the Minister of Finance or a State Minister tendering his resignation with effect from of 01st of May or some other measure is sufficient for that, it is not. They have a serious issue with regard to the finances of the country. And after saying, We will not go to the International Monetary Fund, you have eventually caved in and have gone. Yesterday, the IMF had issued a statement. I am

going to read it from the Reuters news report. It states, "IMF staff is looking forward to programme discussions with the authorities, including during the visit of the newly appointed Finance Minister to Washington later this month". Now, where is the newly appointed Finance Minister, the one most important post there must be in Government today? If you are to deal with the situation out there, if you are to deal with the dollar crisis, if you are to deal with the escalating prices, if you are to deal with the shortage of food and the shortage of medicine, you need a Minister of Finance and you do not have a Minister of Finance. And, you have decided to go to the IMF, but who is to go as Finance Minister? Your Secretary to the Treasury has resigned; there is no Minister of Finance, no Secretary and no money in the Treasury. You have brought this country into bankruptcy! That is what you have done. You have brought this country into bankruptcy.

Sir, I am reminded of something I learned with regard to the word bankruptcy. In ancient Greece, there were lenders in the market place who sat on benches, "" in Sinhala. The word "bankruptcy" came from that. they lent. They lent more than they could actually afford. At the end of the day, when they did not have money to give back, people came, took that bench and broke it into two - bancus ruptus. That is how the word "bankruptcy" came into being. So, people have now come to take your chair, your throne - what you thought the Rajapaksa Throne - and they are breaking it into two; they are chasing you away from the Government as the trader's or banker's bench had been bancus ruptus and was chased away. That is what they are doing because you have made the country bankrupt.

How did that happen? Yes, it happened over a long period of time. You blindly borrowed to fight a war. Why did you have to fight a war? You had to fight a war because you did not keep your promises. If the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact had been implemented, if the Dudley Senanayake-Chelvanayakam Pact had been implemented, the Tamil youth would not have taken up arms. You did not keep your promises and that is why you had to fight a war and why you had to borrow so much. Now, the time of repayment has come. But, the last trigger, the trigger that sent you down the slippery slope from which you are unable to climb back up happened in December, 2019 when President Gotabaya Rajapaksa became President and wanted to hold a Parliamentary Election very soon. He thought, Okay, with this wind, we will capture power and come into Parliament as well and announced a series of tax cuts, lowered the rates of VAT, increased the threshold for Income Tax, Corporate Tax et cetera.

Now, the analysis shows that by that one act alone, 25 per cent of the revenue to the country was lost. Twenty five per cent! What is worse, 33 per cent of the taxpayers got out of the tax net! That is how everybody reckoned that you will not be able to meet the Balance of Payment, and your ratings dropped. Today, at the Committee on Public Finance, it was confirmed that in April, 2020, we were shut out of the financial markets, that we were blacklisted. Two years ago, we were blacklisted, but you

157 158

)

did not tell that to the people. Your mismanagement and your keenness to win the election by giving freebies and sweeteners to the people caused it. Once you were shut out of the international financial markets, it was the slope from which you could never climb back. That is why the country is in this situation.

At least now, people have woken up. That is why they are saying, Go, Gota, go home!. That is why they are calling on the President to go because it was the act of the President that triggered this collapse. He must go! If this is a democratic country, if you have ears to hear, listen. If anyone in the Government ranks actually has ears, tell your President to go. The Constitution has made provision, when the President resigns, as to how the country will be governed. All that will happen, but until he goes, people will not relent, I can tell you that. This is not something that any political party has organized. I must tell the Chief Government Whip not to try what President J.R. Jayewardene tried in 1983, to put the blame on the Left forces of the country, driving them back underground. That is what happened to the JVP who had joined the mainstream by then. President Jayewardene called them "Naxalite forces". The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara went underground; Mr. Vijaya Kumaratunga was arrested and the JVP also went underground.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am winding up, Sir.

Today, this morning, the Chief Government Whip tried that with the JVP. Please do not do that. No political party has done this. This is a peoples movement. This is something unprecedented; this country has never seen this before. That is why you are shocked. This is happening organically and people will not relent until Gota goes home. Thank you.
