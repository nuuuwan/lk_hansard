. . , . At a special meeting, I, as Minister of Education of the Government of Sri Lanka, signed a declaration to join the Global School Meals Coalition with the World Food Programme Representative Abdur Rahim Siddiqui, who pledged his commitment towards providing healthy meals to school children. . .

, ? The Global Economic Prospects Report very clearly shows that there is inequality growing across the world. This is what COVID-19 has brought about. , , . . . . . . , some of the key areas in the Report of Global Economic Prospects of January, 2022. It states, Compounding this rising inequality, the world is undergoing a phase of exceptional uncertainty. Also it states, "To soften the increased global inequality, this report calls for a concerted effort to mobilize external resources and accelerated debt relief." - debt relief, moratorium et cetera. These are called for by all the parties, which they have come to the conclusion is the solution for this world economic setback. The economy will grow, but at a very slow rate. Domestic economic growth and innovation are a must. Sir, I would like to table* the table relating to "South Asia country forecasts" in Global Economic Prospects Report - January, 2022.

, , , . .

, , . . , . ? ,

. . , . It is also an economic theory; it is not only a saying or a proverb that would last for centuries, but also an economic theory.

. . . . . I do not want to take much time. , , , .

I would like to state, as a former Minister of Water Supply and Drainage, that ten years ago, I also took initiatives to revive this "A River to Jaffna" Project. When President Gotabaya Rajapaksa delivered the Throne Speech on 18th January, 2022, under irrigation, he declared the progress of the "A River to Jaffna" Project. In September, 2021, when President attended the 76th UN General Assembly in the US, he expressed his willingness to invite all parties for a discussion to develop this.

I would like to recall that this project has a history of more than 100 years. In 1954, Engineer S. Arumugam of the Department of Irrigation published the concept of this and his son, Engineer Thiru Arumugam, continued this process. Engineer Thiru Arumugam lives in Australia. I invited him, when I was the Minister, to Sri Lanka and along with the TNA Members of the North, we had a long discussion on this project. Engineer D.L.O. Mendis made presentations, continually agitating for this cause supported by Engineer Gunawardena of the Department of Irrigation.

There are so many private research organizations. They have conducted so many researches, based on which they make various forecasts. That is a different thing. Those only serve the private sector; they guide most of the private sector investments. But, organizations which have State-to-State dealings and international bodies that deal with Sri Lanka have much more trust and confidence in us because we have been continuing our support and requesting for the support of those organizations, to which they have responded positively.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe?

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, when the President announced that he was going to make a Policy Statement, during the few weeks that passed, I spoke to the Hon. Leader of the House and we agreed on an Adjournment Debate on His Excellency the President's Address to Parliament. Then, I wrote to you, Sir. Subsequently, I spoke to you and you were in Matara. We agreed that we would meet on Tuesday. So, when we met on Tuesday, we discussed the matter. The Hon. Leader of the House was only ready to give us one day, but finally we agreed on two days. I must say that the Chief Opposition Whip also argued well and finally, after it was over, we spoke to the Hon. Leader of the House again and ended up having three days. So, regarding that, we have no issue.

Then, the Hon. Leader of House wanted the Adjournment Motion to be moved by the Government. To that also, I agreed. Though I, in fact, asked for the Adjournment Motion, we agreed because that is the traditional practice. So, I said, We will speak later. I asked for two and a half hours for all the Leaders of the parties outside the main SJB Party. Now, I find, for

171 172

instance, that the Hon. Sumanthiran had only 15 minutes. The Hon. Anura Dissanayake also told me that he had not been allotted his 20 minutes. According to convention, I should have spoken first and I also have the right to, but I gave that also up. Then, Sir, I asked that I be given the first speech today. I find that I have not been given the first speech today. Anyway, I do not want to disrupt this. I will take the third speech, but as I said earlier, I will take my half an hour. Unless you have to carry me out, I will be taking the half an hour to speak. If the Hon. Leader of the House also agrees, I will speak. The remaining matters, we will take up with you tomorrow, Sir.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you. [.. 10.52 ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa -Leader of the Opposition) , . . " " . , " " , . , . , , , , , , , , , . . , ; . , .

My good Friend, the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam is there. I regret to inform you that yesterday, the Hon. Sumanthiran spoke on this matter and said, We are not prepared to drop our policies; we are not at all prepared to deviate from our policies. Our people have given us a mandate. We act only on that mandate and are not prepared to go against that mandate. So, that means, they are not prepared to deviate from that line of actions or the policies and support the President and the Government to solve the problems of the people in the North and the East. , .

[1.54 p.m] ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Sir, after a bizarre Prorogation of Parliament, the President comes to Parliament and states in his Policy Statement, I quote:

"We reject racism. The present Government wants to safeguard the dignity and rights of every citizen in this country in a uniform manner. Therefore, I urge those politicians who continue to incite people against each other for narrow political gains to stop doing so.

It is really an irony that the President of the country is saying such a thing. By this statement, he is really accusing other politicians of inciting racism. This reminds me of a famous character from Lewis Carrolls "Alice in Wonderland", who declared, "If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense. Nothing would be what it is, because everything would be what it isn't."

This is what the President is really dreaming about. Having run one of the most bigoted, prejudicial electoral campaigns in living memory, this ruling administration crafted a policy for Sinhala hegemony in this country. A Task Force for preserving archaeological treasures uses its mandate to erase religious and cultural symbols in the regions of the Island, where ethno-religious minority communities have inhabited over the years. This is what they have done.

The One Country, One Law Presidential Task Force is extending hegemony in terms of law despite the reforms that the Minister of Justice is trying to bring in.

Ignoring protests from the scientific community and advice of the World Health Organization over the burial of Muslim COVID-19 victims, the Government forced Muslims who succumbed to the coronavirus to be hurried into crematoriums, claiming that burying those might contaminate groundwater. That is actually what this President and this administration had done, and he is advising others like us about not being racist.

The Tamil community has also suffered for long. President Rajapaksa further stated in his Policy Statement, I quote:

The people in the North and the East who had been battered by the war for a long time wanted economic security, above all else.

He called on the Members of Parliament representing the people of the North and the East to support this Governments efforts to improve the living conditions of the people in their areas. But, what remains to be seen two years after his taking over is that he has not had a single conversation with the largest Tamil party here, the Tamil National Alliance. Not even a single conversation!

The Catholic community has demanded justice for the Easter Sunday bombings, where over 260 people had died. Their priests demanding justice have been hauled before the CID and are being questioned and harassed. All this reminds me how the Editorial of today's "Daily FT" refers to the President's Policy Statement. I quote:

.... a well-crafted policy statement designed for a different leader speaking of a different country. In that country, there are no food and fuel shortages. Its citizens are prosperous and healthy. In that country of the Presidents fantasy, the lights are still on. It is a land that has achieved vistas of prosperity

This Editorial really puts it strongly and better than I have tried to articulate some of the contents of his Policy Statement.

His Excellency President Gotabaya Rajapaksa won the Presidential Election, 2019 with 52 per cent of the popular vote. Then, his party won the General Election, 2020 with 59 per cent of the popular vote. On both occasions, the same Manifesto was presented to the people and people voted for that Manifesto. It is true that we lost some time due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is very clear from the Policy Statement delivered by His Excellency the President to this august Assembly that the Government has not changed its core policies; the direction remains the same.

During the period 2020/ 2021, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able to complete more than 300 key projects all over the country. We also undertook the development of 100 smaller cities, covering every district and those projects will be completed before march this year.

, , . .

If we compare Sri Lanka with many other Asian countries which have moved forward with better success, we can see that industrialization is an area where we have not been able to make much progress. When the open economy was introduced to Sri Lanka in 1977, the contribution of our manufacturing sector to GDP was around 22 per cent. Today, it has come down to 16 per cent. If we compare this with other strong economies in Asia, we can see the difference. Singapores manufacturing sector contribution to GDP is around 22 per cent. In Malaysia, it is around 22 per cent, Thailand, 25 per cent, China, 26 per cent and Taiwan, 37 per cent. So, it is very clear, when we look at the global experiences, where we have missed out. When you look at those countries which have developed, you would see that they all have very strong industrial bases and that they have been successful in reducing the trade deficit and the Current Account deficit, two problems that we are currently struggling with.

Actually, there is nothing to prevent us from being a successful manufacturing country. Sri Lanka is already producing some of the best global brands in several industries. Particularly in high-end apparel products, we are considered one of the best in the world. If the apparel industry can achieve world-class in manufacturing, then other industries should also be able to do the same. We have repeatedly pointed out that our manufacturing industry should focus on value creation rather than trying to compete on cheap labour.

Recently, an American investor was talking to me about the design capabilities of Sri Lankan electronic

221 222

[ (

2022 20

manufacturing companies. He showed me an electronic chip designed by a company in the Biyagama Zone and said he could not find a company even in India which could develop a product like that within a very short period of time. I was surprised. I did not even know that we have companies with such capabilities in Sri Lanka. So, why can we not encourage such companies to expand?

[3.38 p.m.]

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, I think since the departure of the British, Sri Lanka is facing its most darkest economic crisis. At the rate at which this country's economy has been on the decline and continues to do so and unless the incumbent Government changes its course rapidly and most effectively, this country will go into bankruptcy. Those are the predictions. You might not default in paying debts, but you will run your reserves to the ground if you pursue your policies. That was the reality, Sir, when the President decided to prorogue Parliament.

So, one would have obviously expected that through the Prorogation, which was for over a month, and when Parliament was again summoned, that the President would have answers, not just to the economy - obviously the economy is the most vexed issue that the country faces today - but also in attempting to solve the problems of the economy, the Government would also fundamentally address the structural issues that the State of Sri Lanka has faced since the British departed. Without making a radical rethink of where you want to head, you are not going to change anything. I quoted, earlier on, Albert Einstein, who said that by doing the same thing over and over again, you cannot expect change; you have to, in fact, bring about change in order to achieve those changes.

So, in that respect, Sir, as member parties which represent the North and the East, we also expected the President to have a different vision on how he is going to

239 240

address the question of the ethnic conflict and wanted to know whether he has had a change of heart in that regard because after the Prorogation of Parliament, one of the key issues he has to face today internationally is the creation of a new Constitution that is acceptable to all peoples of Sri Lanka. And, in a situation where the last three Constitutions had been completely rejected by the Tamil people and where the Tamil people had been completely left out, obviously if you want to put this country on a proper footing, then the most fundamental, structural question that this country has been facing for the last 74 years has to be addressed and resolved.

Sir, with regard to the North and the East, this is what the President had to say, I quote:

The people in the North and East who had been battered by the war for a long time wanted economic security, above all else. They wanted a good education for children, job opportunities for young men and women, market access for the self-employed and entrepreneurs, as well as water for drinking and agricultural purposes, housing facilities, hospitals, roads, and other infrastructure facilities. We regard Governments prime responsibility towards reconciliation as providing such facilities to these people without discrimination." He goes on to state, I quote:

Therefore, I urge the Members of Parliament representing the people of the North and East in this Parliament to set aside various political ideologies, at least temporarily, and support the Governments efforts to improve the living conditions of the people in your areas.

Sir, in that paragraph, the President says that the mandate the people had given is, in fact, for economic security and that that is the mandate which is predominant and because of that, he is asking these Tamil parties that represent the North and the East, which are not part of his Government - all the other parties or individuals that were elected are, in fact, with his Government - to forget their polices and their various mandates. Hence, look at the mandates that we got. This Government claims a two-thirds majority; at the last Parliamentary Election, they got nearly 60 per cent of the votes. But, if you take the North and the East, Sir, the Tamil parties seated in the Opposition, which went before the people asking for a federal solution on the basis of the recognition of the Tamil nation, got a mandate that was very much stronger than the 60 per cent this Government has. In fact, the mandate that was given by the Tamil people for the 13 Members who are seated in the Opposition was well over 75 per cent! But,

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] in asking the Tamil parties seated in the Opposition to suspend and forget the much stronger mandate given to them by the Tamil people for [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] to be pursued against the Tamil people. And mind you, when you consider even the five Tamil Members

who got elected and are seated with his own Government, at least three of them certainly got elected from the Northern Province on the basis that they are for the recognition of the Tamil nationhood. In fact, the Hon. Douglas Devananda, in every single poster he pasted in the North and the East at the last Election, asked for the Tamil people to vote for him to make sure that the Tamil nation rises. That was the slogan they used. So, this is a mandate that cannot be compromised; it will never be compromised and it is a mandate for which people had given their lives in thousands.

It is a cause that, even after genocide was committed, people still voted for and repeatedly are voting for. Therefore, you cannot expect that mandate to be given up and if any Tamil Member seated in the Opposition thinks that he could give up that mandate and support a Unitary State, he will also get the required result at the following opportunities. So, what we need, Sir, is a sea change and that sea change is obviously not going to come from the Government benches; that is obvious. It has to come from the Opposition. But, is that change, that vision there in the Opposition? Unfortunately, no. The present SJB thinks that the way forward is to try and outwit the Rajapaksas in their own campaign and to try and commit themselves to a Unitary State which is even more centralized.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . .

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I am winding up, Sir.

You have policies which are so racist, that you have Members like the Hon. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka who stands up and says that memorialization should be banned. So, this is the sort of Opposition we have and the Leader of the Opposition must commit himself to policies that are genuinely an alternative to the Tamil people, that they will not vote on a basis of simply defeating the Government and electing an Opposition, whoever that may be. Those days are gone. If you are going to change this country, you have to change it fundamentally and fundamentally" means that you also have to change the structural confines of this country.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . .
