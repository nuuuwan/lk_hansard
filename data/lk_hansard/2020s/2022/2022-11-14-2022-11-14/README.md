ENGLISH TEXT OF THE BUDGET SPEECH - 2023

Sri Lanka, Towards a New Beginning

Approach

Honourable Speaker, a glimmer of hope emerging from the economic abyss is currently visible as a result of the strenuous and difficult actions we have adopted during the past few months. After the era of waiting in queues for days and protesting in various occupied places, our sufferings have been eased to some extent and we have reached an era where our peace of mind is much settled.

Negotiations with the International Monetary Fund are currently in progress. We are in dialogue with India and China on debt restructuring. We are confident that these discussions will lead to positive outcomes.

Inflation could be controlled to some extent due to the actions taken in the recent past. Similarly, the rupee is strengthening. We expect to sustain these developments. I am confident that by moving along the same path, we will be able to stabilize the economy within the next year.

But we cannot be satisfied with that. We must start a new journey.

Presenting the Interim Budget Proposals last August, I mentioned that the purpose of the Interim Budget Proposals is to lay the basic foundation for transforming the economic pattern that has existed so far in our country. I mentioned there, that the process of building a new economy suitable for the modern world would be started through the Budget Proposals, 2023.

Seventy-five years after Independence, can we be satisfied with the status quo? Where did we go wrong? How did we go wrong?

I was born in the Independent Sri Lanka, one year after the Independence of Sri Lanka. At that time, Japan had the most developed economy in Asia. It is well known that we were the second. The per capita income in Sri Lanka is US Dollars 3,815; Japan's per capita income is US Dollars 39,285.

I recollect another personal experience. In 1991, when I was the Minister of Industry, the Minister of Industry of Vietnam came to Sri Lanka. He wanted to study our open economic system and industrialization strategies. I made him aware of those. He was given the opportunity to discuss with the officials of the Greater Colombo Economic Commission. In 1995, Sri Lanka's foreign reserves were US Dollars 2.1 billion. Vietnam's foreign reserves were US Dollars 1.3 billion. The Minister of Vietnam studied our methods and went to his country. What is the situation today? In 2021 Vietnam's foreign reserves were US Dollars 109.4 billion; Sri Lanka's foreign reserves were US Dollars 3.1 billion.

Let us look back. Let us take off the coloured political glasses. Why did we get it wrong? Where did we go wrong? Did we get things wrong? Or did we make things wrong?

Today, our country has several main revenue generating sectors. One is the plantation economy. The others are the Free Trade Zones, garment industry, tourism and foreign employment. Looking at those, after Independence, we have been able to create only a few avenues for the country to earn foreign income. Beyond that, why have we not yet been able to create large-scale foreign income-generating sectors? This is something we should think about carefully.

Over the past period, have we been excited and happy for things that can be seen on the surface for the moment, not for things that will work for the future. People were happy when successful private businesses were nationalized. People were happy when free rice was given. Governments that took such decisions became temporarily popular.

Because of this, we were satisfied with installing an electric lamp on the street. But we did not think deeply about increasing the electricity generation.

Is long-term development of a country based on popular decisions or on the right decisions? In many cases, popular decisions were taken instead of correct decisions in our country. Even today many people try to make popular decisions.

What was the result of this popular ruling tradition? To build a relief economy and a relief mentality across the country. People are used to getting concessions. Governments do not work to create opportunities for people to develop; only to provide relief.

Reminiscing the Nineteen-fifties, Lee Kuan Yew once mentioned the following. In Singapore I followed the hard, but right path. Sri Lanka's Bandaranaike followed the popular path.

There is no future for the country by continuing on this popular path. There is no prosperity for the country by giving concessions while being in debt to others. So, let us get out of this situation now. Let us change our thinking patterns.

So let us think anew. Let us create innovative approaches to move the country forward. 1977 Approach

In 1977, the J.R. Jayewardene Government took a positive step to change the economic perspective that existed until then. Instead of the failed, closed economy, a different path was chosen. Instead of giving concessions, he created an economy that gave opportunities. Concepts like providing free rice were completely discarded. Instead, new opportunities were created to move forward with ones abilities. The economy opened up. The country woke up. Poverty decreased. The middle class expanded.

109 110

But the economic base created in 1977 could not be advanced rapidly. Due to external factors such as civil conflicts, that journey was hampered. Necessary changes and reforms were not made in accordance with the times.

Instead of increasing the government income and raising foreign investments, government expenditure was increased beyond its limits. A lot of money was spent to maintain loss-making State-Owned Enterprises. A lot of unnecessary expenses were made for political gains. All this was done not with the income earned from the country, but by being indebted to the world.

The Buddha has preached this idea about borrowing in theSamachchapala Sutra: Borrowing should be for investment, not for consumption. But, what did we do? We borrowed the hard-earned money of other countries of the world and spent it on our consumption. We got lazy day by day. People got used to getting everything from the government. The government worked to provide everything to the people. We were not thinking about what should happen to the country. A society that only thinks about what the country should give to its citizens was slowly created. What we were doing was like having a feast while borrowing money from others.

Because of this, the economic base and direction of 1977 changed completely.

Aspirations of the Youth

For 75 years after Independence, we have been speaking about protecting national resources. They are campaigning for the preservation of national resources and also fighting. But have we really protected our real national wealth? Has a future been created for the real national resources?

The real national wealth of our country is the youth. Can we be satisfied with the work we have done so far in order to create educational, social and economic opportunities for the youth? If we have done a proper role to protect the youth, why are they queuing up to leave the country?

Many people think that national resources are physical things like the Trincomalee oil tanks. Thinking like that, they do not take care of them; even when they are decaying, they keep them. At present we are bearing the cost of 420 government institutions and enterprises. The annual loss of these major 52 SOEs is Rs. 86 billion. I hope to table the list of institutions in Parliament in two or three days. Has the country benefited from these institutions for many years, or has the country suffered?

While we focus on these institutions and enterprises thinking that they are national resources, we have lost our attention on the real national resources of the country. The hopes of the young people are melting away and some leave the country.

These young people hope for a better day. They hope for a good country. A new approach, a new programme

that goes beyond traditional political methods such as agitations, struggles and strikes is expected.

A look at the public gallery today shows a significant presence of young people. They all hope for a better tomorrow - a high society and a change in system.

We are creating the new economy for these young people, for their tomorrow.

The new basis of the economy

The economic base created in 1977 is no longer relevant. It does not fit the present day. It is now broken; just like the closed economy that once functioned in our country. The economy created in 1977 has also failed. So we have to think about the present anew. As Sugathapala de Silva has shown in the play "Marasad"; we should turn inside out like a pillow case and look at the world with new eyes.

Current world trends are different. World economic thinking is different. The way the world economy behaves is different. Therefore, we have to prepare a new economic base to match those new trends.

I would like to outline two parts from two articles I read on social media the other day. Gamini Viyangoda says;

"Be careful when someone that has caught the question by the tail says that they have the power to build the country. It is a lie when they say that they will put thieves and corrupt people in prison as soon as they come to power. It is a lie when they say that they will create a country free from corruption and waste. Although all these are essential for the development of a country, we must realize tomorrow, if not today, that the answer to the question of the present day Sri Lanka lies in a more complex and difficult range.

Chintana Dharmadasa mentions this;

"This is why we have to think again. The struggle is not outside us. It is within us. We have to do everything we can to win this economic struggle. We can uplift the people who are suffering from extreme poverty with an economic force that we rekindle. At this moment, that is where the mission for the real people lies."

So let us understand the difficulty and the complexity of this crisis. Let us create a force to wake up the economy to emerge from the crisis.

Through this Budget, we are trying to lay the new foundation of the Sri Lankan economy that can create that force.

Here, I would like to outline some of the main points that we will focus our attention on.

Due to the economic crisis we faced in the recent times, the whole country faced many difficulties. People could not put the food on the plate for the day. Jobs were

111 112

[

2022 4

in jeopardy. Income was lost. Businesses collapsed. It has not yet been possible to completely get rid of all those difficulties.

People faced such difficulties with the hope of rebuilding the country in their hearts. All of us made those commitments and are still making commitments with the aim of reviving the country. The benefits of the new economy we are building must be equitably shared among all those who are committed to the country. Equal opportunities should be created for all. It is not an economic system that makes only a small group of society rich, but an economic system which elevates the entire society.

When Sri Lanka was a low-income economy, the basic necessities of life enjoyed by the people were minimal. But been elevated to a middle-income economy, the standard of living also naturally rose. This is a normal situation. It is the same even at home. As the household income level rises, the standard of living also rises.

In preparing the new economic base, we should focus on the lifestyles that the society is familiar with. A new journey must be started so that these lifestyles do not fall to a lower level again.

Especially today's youth who deal with the world on a technological basis expect their lifestyles to rise day by day. Therefore, it is necessary to create a way of life that stimulates lifestyles that rise day by day through the new economic base.

Therefore, we have to create means of livelihood that goes beyond the current level of per capita income. We have to find a way to raise per capita income to match the lifestyles that young people aspire to live.

In this system we focus on taking care of the poor and the vulnerable groups. It is necessary to examine whether all sections of the society are receiving equitable benefits through health services and free education that is currently provided as well as other welfare programmes. These services should also be made more efficient. Maximum benefits should be obtained from the resources spent for this purpose.

If we forget that we are facing a huge economic crisis, we would not have a way forward. It is by realizing the current situation, we need to prepare the way forward. Therefore, in the midst of this crisis, it is important to pay special attention to how our welfare programmes could be implemented more effectively.

Parallel to this, entrepreneurs in the private sector should be promoted. Private entrepreneurs in our country continued to grow from the mid-19th Century to the mid-1950s. But with the nationalization of their businesses, private entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka almost completely collapsed. As a result of the open economy introduced in 1977, there were again private entrepreneurs, but they were not adequately provided with the necessary facilities.

Many people in the country did not look at entrepreneurs with a good attitude. Entrepreneurs who contributed to the country's economy were considered villains. In most of the tele dramas produced in Sri Lanka, the village shopkeeper -Mudalali - was portrayed as an evil character. From the small entrepreneur in the village to the large-scale entrepreneurs, everyone was treated as exploiters.

We must change this situation. Private entrepreneurs should be encouraged. New entrepreneurs should be created. All the necessary facilities should be provided to them. A policy environment should be created to make their work more effective.

While encouraging private sector entrepreneurs, we should focus on regulating economic activities, investing in infrastructure, correcting market failures and maintaining law and order.

I would like to define the new economy that we are going to build as a social market economy or an "open economic system of social protection".

In this new economy, we focus on three main things:

1. An export oriented competitive economy 2. An environmentally friendly green and blue economy 3. A digital economy

Creating such a new economic foundation is a challenging task. Such a new economy cannot be created merely by making changes in the tax system. New sources of revenue should be found. New areas should be identified. Massive economic reforms and restructuring should be carried out.

We hope to base two unique points here.

The first is, economic reforms and reorganization and the second is, economic modernization.

We must achieve rapid economic growth. The entire potential of the country should be tapped. Re-examination of the country's resource base as well as the reorganization of it is also important here. Education, health, agriculture and marine resources, industry, trade and investment, defence, foreign relations et cetera must all be modernized. We should carry out this socio-economic transformation taking into account the global phenomena. In particular, special attention should be paid to climate change.

We will soon present the new legislations and legal amendments to Parliament that are necessary for economic transformation.

It is essential to establish a common social agreement for economic management as well as between various parties involved in the industrial and social relations system. The Legislature, the Executive, the Judiciary, professional groups, mass media, religious groups and various social organizations should be involved in this.

113 114

This common unity is extremely important to maintain long-term social harmony and to move towards rapid economic growth without collisions.

We expect to achieve the following goals, initially through the social market economy or social security open economy that we are creating.

High economic growth of 7 to 8 per cent Increasing international trade as a percentage of GDP by more than 100 per cent Annual growth of US Dollars 3 billion from new exports from 2023 to 2032 Foreign direct investment of more than US Dollars 3 billion in the next 10 years Creating an internationally competitive workforce with high skills in the next ten years

In order to achieve these goals, we need to create a competitive and a high-performance modern economy - a modern, export-oriented, competitive economy led by the private sector. A private sector-led, export-oriented, competitive modern economy. We are starting our journey for that in 2023 with this Budget. By the year 2048, which marks 100 years of Independence, the background for the new approach and new work order to make Sri Lanka a developed country will be prepared by these Budget Proposals.

But these Budget Proposals are different from traditional Budget Proposals. We are often used to get reductions in prices of goods, salary increases concessions et cetera through Budget Proposals. We would like to see Budget Proposals that appear to be relief on the surface even if it means indebtedness to the world. We lost our way because of taking that popular route. Now we can no longer go down the wrong paths and despair.

We are not having a wedding by being in debt to the world. What we are doing with this Budget is to lay a foundation that we can stand on our own strength and to open an approach to create a new economy.

If we build the future through the foundation we create through this Budget, we will be able to enjoy a comfortable economic environment by the end of 2023. The benefits of that economy will flow throughout the country.

I would like to emphasize another point here. The economic reforms we are bringing are not limited to the reforms agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund. The economic reforms proposed by the International Monetary Fund are limited to economic stabilization only.

We are doing these reforms and reorganizations to build a new economy. It is a need of the country, something that the country needed for a long time.

It was a role that many governments have opted to ignore with popularity in mind. We will play that role for the country.

So, I would like to present the 2023 Budget Proposals from here onwards.

Macro-fiscal Framework

a) Our fiscal stabilization programme envisages increasing government revenue to around 15 per cent of GDP by 2025 from the 8.3 per cent of GDP as at end of 2021.

b) The Government is targeting a primary surplus of more than 2 per cent of GDP in 2025 and expects to improve upon this level thereafter.

c) We aim to reduce public sector debt from around 110 per cent of GDP as at end of 2021, to no more than 100 per cent of GDP in the medium term.

d) It is expected that inflation will be brought back under control to a mid-single-digit level in the medium term.

e) In line with this, interest rates are also expected to reach a moderate level gradually.

f) Once macroeconomic confidence is re-established and foreign exchange reserves are replenished through foreign financing, the adverse pressure on the exchange rate is also expected to abate.

g) With the implementation of a series of growth enhancing structural reforms, the medium-term economic growth is expected to return towards 5 per cent in the medium term and accelerate to a higher level thereafter.

Trade and Investment

Agency for External Trade and Investment

As Sri Lanka is facing forex shortages due to ongoing economic crisis, the inflows of forex should be reviewed. It is noted for some time that the coordination issues associated with the government agencies working for the external trade and investment affects the performance of the country's exports. Besides, there are several incentive programmes being implemented by the government agencies to encourage exporters at present. Therefore, it is important to set up a single agency enabling to create a conducive environment for promoting investment and external trade. Accordingly, a new agency will be set up in place of the Board of Investment, Export Development Board, Sri Lanka Export Credit Insurance Corporation, National Enterprise Development Authority et cetera with the enactment of a new law. For this purpose, I propose to allocate Rs. 100 million.

New Economic Zones

I propose to set up New Economic Zones in the Western Province, the North-Western Province, Hambantota and Trincomalee with a view to attracting foreign investments. Accordingly, steps will be taken for setting up of relevant infrastructure conducive for such investments. Investments and industrial zones currently operating under various government agencies will come under the New Economic Zone programme for which a new law will be enacted soon. Besides, alternative mechanisms to the current practice of attracting foreign investors based on the tax concessions should also be examined. Rs. 300 million will be allocated for the propose of this programme.

115 116

[

National Productivity Commission

I propose to establish a National Productivity Commission as an independent institution to investigate/study productivity issues based on quantitative and qualitative data and recommend trade adjustments schemes, to advise the government on microeconomic policies related to industries, and commerce and trade, to provide recommendations on the elements/aspects needing changes to the existing regulations on social and environmental issues, to train and guide the employees in industries that are closing down due to economic instability and the difficulty of adapting to new technologies, enabling them to find new job opportunities and if not, propose a compensation mechanism for employees who lost their jobs. The operations of the National Productivity Secretariat will also be incorporated into the proposed Commission. I propose to allocate Rs.100 million for the implementation of this Proposal.

Enhancing Access to Global Markets

It is essential that Sri Lanka expands its market access whilst developing domestic supply capacity. Global trade is today driven by regional and global production networks such as ASEAN, where Sri Lanka has not yet been engaged to obtain benefits. Policy measures will therefore focus on enhancing Sri Lankas ability to compete in global markets through innovation, efficiency and quality.

Towards this end, Sri Lanka has resumed efforts to integrate with key markets such as India and China. Sri Lanka will also resume trade negotiations with Thailand, which along with the FTA with Singapore, sets the steppingstone for Sri Lanka to engage in dynamic regional trading arrangements such as Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).

I also propose to establish an International Trade Office to deal with all the international trade negotiations. This will initially be established under the Ministry of Finance and subsequently, it will be amalgamated to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA). Accordingly, the MFA will be renamed as Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade.

Logistics Infrastructure Development Programme

Performance of the logistics infrastructure is another barrier for exporters, importers and investors. Therefore, I propose to introduce a three-year Logistics Development Programme during the period 2023 to 2027, targeting to improve the logistics performance of Sri Lanka among the first 70 countries.

Investment Friendly Environment

There is a need for simplifying and making existing arrangements efficient to create a more business-friendly environment. Accordingly, measures are required to reduce costs, procedures and time and to improve transparency, enabling to create a healthy business

environment. Hence, I propose to allocate Rs. 200 million to the Ministry of Investment Promotion to introduce the necessary reforms in this respect.

New Labour Policies

Reforms in the labour sector is long overdue, in which both the employee and employer should be protected in a manner to efficiently carry out productive economic activities. In a competitive export-oriented economy, both parties should productively participate in the promotion of countrys progress. The laws, policies and institutional arrangements in the sector should not stall entrepreneurial abilities and business development. In fact, the environment should be conducive to make use of individuals talents while entrepreneurs risk-taking behavior too should be properly rewarded. The countrys labour laws being outlived and fragmented, I propose to enact a new, updated and unified labour law in a manner to benefit both the employer-employee segment and the economy.

Lands for Agricultural Exports

A vast amount of land belonging to the Janatha Estate Development Board (JEDB), the Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation (SPC), and the Land Reform Commission (LRC) remains without being cultivated or productively utilized for a long time, due to various reasons: legal issues, institutional conflicts, lack of capital et cetera There are possibilities of productively using such lands for the betterment of the economy. Accordingly, a programme will be devised to allow investors to productively utilize them in a manner to increase both the production and exports. Hence, it is expected that large parcels of unutilized/unproductively used lands will be leased out on long-term basis to grow exportable crops. Further, a new law to facilitate the proposed agricultural land lease programme will also be presented to this House.

Disposal of Government Lands

Although preliminary activities related to the disposal of government lands are carried out by District Secretaries/Government Agents through Divisional Secretaries/ Additional Government Agents, such duties were also allocated to the Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority and the Land Reform Commission which were established for special requirements at a later stage. It is reported that there are occurrences of discrimination and malpractice as preliminary activities related to disposal of lands are done in various ways by the respective entities. Therefore, as the aforementioned special requirements have already being met, a programme will be prepared during the next year to enable preliminary activities in relation to the disposal of all government lands including the disposal of lands under the above two institutes only by the Divisional Secretaries.

Digital Technology

The country sees the benefit of using digital technology in various economic activities and service delivery systems. Its beneficial effects were seen very recently with the introduction of the QR system in

117 118

petroleum distribution by the Ministry of Power and Energy. Hence, I propose to appoint a Committee involving experts and relevant officials in the industry to examine and report to the Cabinet of Ministers on the requirement for furtherance of the digital technology industry, including required policy environment, laws, institutional support and facilities.

Effective Use of Sri Lanka's Mineral Resources for National Development

It has been observed that the contribution to national development by Sri Lanka's mineral resources remains at a very low level. Therefore, it is proposed to appoint a Committee comprising the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Environment, the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau, the National Agency for Public Private Partnership (NAPPP) and related institutions to formulate and implement an appropriate policy on how the known mineral resources could be effectively utilized for national development. The Committee report should be submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers in three months time.

New Department for Cinnamon Industry

Since the export of cinnamon products traditionally occupies a leading position, measures should be taken for the furtherance of this industry. Sri Lanka's cinnamon products have developed a unique identity globally and its export of value-added products should further be encouraged. Therefore, I propose to establish a separate Department for the development of the cinnamon industry in Karandeniya area where cinnamon cultivation is widespread. Rs.200 million will be allocated to implement this Proposal.

New Project/Programme Appraisal Scheme

Many development projects/programmes in the past have not produced the desired results due to lack of proper identification and a systematic appraisal system being adhered to. As a result, the Government had to use the tax revenue mobilized from other sources to repay the loans taken for such projects/programmes. Subsequently, this has come to an unsustainable level for the economy also leading to create debt management issues confronted by the Government today.

Accordingly, new projects/programmes to be considered in the future should be submitted to the National Planning Department after conducting a feasibility study to include financial, economic and technical aspects by the line agency/Ministry. Then the National Planning Department, having examined the respective projects/programmes, should submit them to the National Development Committee with its recommendations. The Committee should re-examine the projects/programmes to ensure policy consistency, viability, inter-sectoral alignments, priorities et cetera before being recommended to the Government. The composition of the National Development Committee will consist of members with relevant expertise drawn from the public and private sectors.

Tourism Industry

Promotion of Marine Tourism

New programmes have been introduced in many countries in various ways to attract tourists. However, there is a lack of approaches to develop maritime tourism, considering advantages of the location of Sri Lanka. Therefore, three maritime zones in the Eastern, Southern and Western Provinces will be identified and the related infrastructure in those areas will be developed. Accordingly, identification and development of the safety sea areas for tourists to engage in sea-related activities in the shallow seas, the development of related infrastructure, including anchoring bays for parking light yacht, necessary facilities for diving and other related activities and food courts are required in this respect. The required funds for this purpose should be provided by the Tourism Development Fund. To initiate the process, I propose to allocate Rs. 50 million from the 2023 Budget.

I propose to facilitate promotion of adventure sports such as water rafting in order to popularize Sri Lanka as a destination for sports tourism.

General Education

Providing Internet Facilities to Schools

It is necessary to provide internet facilities to the schools for the advancement of education system with the latest technology. Therefore, as the first step, free internet facilities to 1,000 senior and junior secondary schools located in remote areas will be facilitated by the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission. This is under the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility of private sector institutions and institutions that provide internet facilities.

Improving Facilities in Rural Schools

We have learned that the existing health and hygiene facilities in some rural schools are not sufficient. Accordingly, a provision of Rs. 200 million will be made for the construction of sanitary facilities, particularly toilets with proper water facilities or to provide water facilities for existing toilets in 139 provincial schools and 23 National Schools, as well as in rural schools with minimal facilities.

Higher Education

Increasing Merit-based Admissions to State Universities

In admitting students to State universities, only the Art stream students are selected on island-wide merit basis currently. However, 40 per cent of the students are admitted on the basis of island-wide merit in Commerce, Technology, Science and Mathematics streams. In this context, a large number of students who demonstrate high performance are deprived of the opportunity to enter university. And also they suffer great inconvenience and

119 120

[

2022 4

injustice, and lose their opportunity to contribute for the countrys development. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce remedial measures to overcome this situation. Accordingly, I propose to gradually increase the percentage of admissions to State universities on island-wide merit basis from 40 per cent to 50 per cent effective with the academic year 2023/2024. Accordingly, the Ministry of Education should take action to amend the system of admission to State universities.

Postgraduate Education Opportunities for Doctors

The postgraduate studies for doctors, which are confined to the University of Colombo at present, should be expanded to provide opportunities to more doctors. Accordingly, I propose to establish postgraduate study programmes for doctors in Peradeniya, Ruhuna and Jaffna Universities as well. Hence, those universities should take necessary action to establish legal and procedural arrangement to implement this Proposal. Accordingly, I propose to allocate Rs. 60 million to implement this Proposal. I also suggest to prepare a national policy for postgraduate education locally for the doctors.

Quality Assurance and Accreditation Board for the University Degrees

I propose to set up a Quality Assurance and Accreditation Board to ensure the quality and accreditation of degree courses conducted in universities. Under this, it is expected to ensure the quality of all degree courses. Accordingly, the Ministry or the Minister in charge of Higher Education should take necessary steps to implement this Proposal with the necessary legal provisions. For this purpose, I propose to allocate Rs. 100 million.

Foreign Scholarships for A-Levels Qualified Students and Graduates

I propose to provide 75 scholarships for the Advanced Level qualified students who receive excellent results at the 2022 A-Level examination to follow degrees in foreign universities based on their chosen subject areas to mark the 75th anniversary of Sri Lanka's Independence. Accordingly, a proper programme should be prepared by paying attention to the selection of relevant foreign universities, entering into MOUs with them, selecting students, providing necessary facilities to the selected students, et cetera. I propose to allocate required funds from the President's Fund.

In addition, I also propose to provide opportunities for 75 graduates with excellent degree performances at state universities from selected degree courses to follow postgraduate degrees in recognized foreign universities. The required financial support for the purpose will also be obtained from the private sector and foreign donor agencies. The youths selected under this programme should contribute to the development of the country after completing their postgraduate degrees.

New Faculty of Medicine

Currently, there are 11 medical faculties in Sri Lankan universities and 2,001 medical students have been enrolled for the academic year 2020-2021. To further increase this number, I propose to set up a new medical faculty under the Uva-Wellassa University. I propose to allocate Rs. 200 million for the establishment of this medical faculty.

Separate Institution to Study History of Sri Lanka

I propose to establish an institution to undertake and facilitate research on the history of Sri Lanka. Accordingly, I propose to allocate Rs. 50 million for this purpose.

Reforms

Public Service Reforms

There are around fourteen hundred and fifty thousand (1,450,000) public servants currently working in the various government agencies. Hence, a large portion of the government revenue has to be spent on their salaries and wages. Therefore, it has become a challenge to allocate resources for other public purposes, including developmental purposes. Therefore, I propose to appoint a Presidential Commission to review all the aspects of public service in line with current requirement and make recommendations including necessary reforms.

Presidential Commission on Taxation

It has been difficult to allocate resources for health, education and other important sectors due to the lower level of government revenue generated from taxes in comparison to other countries. Accordingly, measures should be taken gradually to increase the State revenue in the next few years. As such, I propose to establish a Presidential Commission on Taxation to study and make recommendations on the functioning, coordination and changes to be made in the tax structure, the institutions, procedures et cetera This Commission will also examine the requirement for setting up of a centralized institution for managing government revenue.

Promotion of Electronic Payment System

I propose to make it mandatory for all the government payments to be done electronically (online) with effect from 01.03.2024 including cash grants to the respective recipients as well as the payments for obtaining services from various government agencies by the public. Accordingly, all government agencies should also take action to prepare a programme enabling online payments for those services and introduce the necessary legal changes as well. In this regard, required assistance should be sought from the IT Service Officers currently working in ministries and departments. I propose to allocate Rs.200 million for the implementation of this policy.

121 122

Setting up of Data Protection Authority

As we develop our digital economy, there is a need to regulate the processing of personal data in order to safeguard privacy of our citizens from adverse impact of digitization. The Government is committed to implement the Personal Data Protection Act, No. 9 of 2022 and will take steps to set up the Data Protection Authority in 2023. The new regulator will be independent and engage with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Securities and Exchange Commission, TRCSL and all relevant sectoral regulators to ensure proper governance of personal data.

Insurance Coverage for Private Sector Employees

It is noted that the number of private sector employees who lose their jobs due to various reasons is on the increase. As this has become a very complex social issue with the current economic crisis, I propose to provide an insurance coverage to provide a monthly allowance for a maximum of three months covering the period from the loss of employment and re-employment and to establish an insurance fund for this purpose.

Further, a large number of people are benefitted from the Agrahara health insurance system provided for government employees and I propose to provide similar health insurance to private sector employees as well.

A contribution is provided to the Employees Trust Fund by the employers on behalf of private sector employees. Therefore, it will be a duty and a responsibility to provide some relief from the Employees Trust Fund. Accordingly, it would be appropriate to allocate a certain amount from the Employees Trust Fund for the proposed health and insurance coverage.

Accordingly, the Employees Trust Fund Act should be amended incorporating these two schemes under the Employees Trust Fund.

Food Security

Electronic Scheme for Food Safety

It is necessary to maintain an up-to-date data system for planning and implementing activities relating to food safety. Accordingly, information on all agricultural and livestock products of the household units should be obtained through an online process and the National Food Security Programme should be planned accordingly. This programme should be implemented by the National Food Security and Nutrition Unit.

Development of Inland Fisheries Industry

In order to increase the nutritional level of the public, the opportunity to obtain more fish products should be increased. Accordingly, I propose to allocate Rs. 100 million to increase the capacity of the existing fish breeding centres to facilitate inland fisheries industry.

Increasing Government Revenue

Tax Policy Measures

The need for increasing government revenue requires no explanation as many of the challenges that we face today is due to the lack of government revenue. The government revenue has declined significantly to 8.3 per cent of GDP in 2021, which is one of the lowest in the world. In order to correct this position while correcting the tax cuts introduced in late 2019, the Government presented revenue measures in three occasions i.e. on 30th May, 2022, the Interim Budget presented on 30th August, 2022 and the Inland Revenue Bill presented in October, 2022. The revenue proposals mainly included changes to the Income Tax and Value Added Tax (VAT) while addressing tax policy gaps and rationalizing tax concessions.

Committed implementation of these tax reforms will help increase revenue in 2023 and beyond; enabling to move away from costly monetary financing (money printing) to cover government expenditure in the future. Also, the Government is committed to improve efficiency in public spending and fight corruption through the implementation of the tax policy measures.

Crude estimates suggest that revenue forgone due to the VAT exemptions granted to various sectors, including electricity, transport and fuel, is estimated to be more than 1 per cent of GDP. Hence, it is proposed to remove certain exemptions after reviewing. Amendments to the VAT Act to remove certain exemptions will be made effective from 01 April 2023.

It is noticed that some State-owned Enterprises (SOEs) are still paying the PAYE / APIT tax liability of employees. This issue has also been questioned at the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) and by the Auditor-General as well. Hence, I propose to stop such payments effective from 01 January 2023, since such tax should not be an expenditure to the entity (SOEs), although personal emoluments are paid under collective agreements.

Tax on Beedi sticks

a. In order to regularize the Beedi industry and deter people from Beedi consumption, I propose to impose a tax of Rs. 2 per Beedi stick. In addition, other fees payable for obtaining of certificates and licences will be increased.

Phasing out of Para Tariffs

a. In order to promote the manufacturing industry, to remove the existing barriers on international trade, to provide the necessary incentives and facilities for local industries and projects including agriculture, the CESS levy will be eliminated on phased basis in three years commencing January 01, 2023. For the Ports and Airports Development Levy, I suggest to phase out completely in five years. Accordingly, I am revising the current rates of the Customs Import Duty from 0%, 10% and 15% to 0%, 15% and 20% to accommodate

123 124

[

2022 4

the proposed phasing out of para-tariffs / levies effective from January 01, 2023. Relevant work in this connection is being done to introduce a Trade Adjustment Programme as well.

b. However, the proposed tax policy will be implemented in such a way that it does not interfere with the CESS levy on agriculture-based value-added industries.

Non-Tax Revenue

Increase in non-tax revenue is also important in the fiscal consolidation process. Hence, I propose to increase fees and charges by 20 per cent with effect from 2023. However, fees and charges that have already been increased in the years of 2020, 2021 and 2022 will not be revised with this Proposal.

In the same vein, it is proposed to increase fees levied by the Department of Immigration and Emigration on passport, visa and other charges.

Further, I propose to appoint a Committee to examine and make recommendations on the royalty, rent, and other non-tax revenue charged and collected by the government organizations to the General Treasury.

I propose to daily transfer all revenue and receipts collected by Ministries and Departments directly to the General Treasury with effect from January, 2023 to reduce the substantial cost of finance due to delay in remitting revenue collection to the Consolidated Fund. In this regard, General Treasury will take necessary actions to issue the instructions in due course.

Tax Administration

Recent announcements of tax policy measures should go hand in hand with tax administration measures to have a broader tax base, better compliance and stricter enforcement. Accordingly, tax administration measures will be enhanced through improvements in technology, regulations, process improvements and investing in Human Resources related to the Department of Inland Revenue, Sri Lanka Customs, and the Department of Excise.

Although the requirement of having everyone over 18 opening a tax file is the first step, many of those who open files will be below the tax-free thresholds. Therefore, it is important to introduce measures to identify high income earners specifically and get them into the tax net. In this regard, I make the Proposals in Annexure VI to improve tax administration.

Expenditure Management

Commitment to Manage Expenditure Effectively

The importance of proper expenditure management to strengthen the fiscal consolidation process needs no elaboration. It should be in line with the efforts to increase the revenue as well.

The Interim Budget introduced several proposals, including the introduction of new Public Financial Management (PFM) Act, incorporating binding fiscal rules and appointment of an Inspector General to keep the expenditures in check, which will be implemented in the near future. In addition, a number of circular instructions have already been issued to ensure strict control of government expenditure.

Establishment of a National Operations Centre (NOC)

It is high time to establish a National Operations Centre (NOC) under the Department of Project Management and Monitoring of the Ministry of Finance for tracking implementation issues of all development interventions of the country and resolve emerging issues on priority basis.

In support of the efficient and effective functionality of the NOC, it is also proposed to establish a comprehensive Web-based National Development Information System within the NOC as the supportive tool for obtaining updated data and information for decision-making.

Allowing Armed Forces Personnel to Retire Early

I propose to allow armed forces personnel, other than special categories, to retire after 18 years of service. Measures will be taken to provide them with necessary training, enabling them to engage in productive economic activities.

Difficult Situation Faced by Public Servants

I am well aware that public servants and pensioners are in a difficult situation to manage their expenditure from the monthly pay due to increase in transport cost, electricity and water tariffs and high food inflation.

Further, I expect that government revenue will be increased in about a year due to the economic recovery as a result of the measures taken by the Government. At the same time, it will be possible to implement the proposed reforms to bring the public sector to an optimum level. Hence, I believe that a considerable relief can be given to the public servants and pensioners in the latter part of year 2023.

State-owned Enterprise Reforms

Restructuring of SOEs

The urgency of restructuring the most fiscally significant State-owned Enterprises (SOEs) was reiterated several times during the last 6 months. As committed in the Interim Budget, a Unit has now been established at the Ministry of Finance with the specific task of restructuring SOEs.

Initially, measures will be taken to restructure Sri Lankan Airlines, Sri Lanka Telecom, Colombo Hilton, Waters Edge and Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC) along with its subsidiaries, the proceeds of which

125 126

will be used to strengthen foreign exchange reserves of the country and to strengthen the Rupee.

Strategic interventions will be made to SOEs with the anticipation of achieving economies of scale and other benefits. Therefore, I propose to line up businesses of a similar nature by way of backward, forward or horizontal integration.

The Gem and Jewellery Research and Training Institute will be merged with the National Gem and Jewellery Authority in order to provide services with better quality and efficiency to the gem-related craftsmen to increase export revenue. The Government will also explore the possibility of setting up of a Gem Emporium (Gem Zone) for the benefit of the industry participants.

Debt Management

Taking Selected SOE Debt to Government Balance Sheet

As a part of strengthening the balance sheets of selected SOEs, loans from China Exim Bank to the Government which had earlier reclassified as debts of the CEB, SLPA and AASL will be recognized as Central Government debt by end of December 2022. Guaranteed foreign exchange debt of the CPC will also be recognized as Central Government debt by end of December 2022.

Financial Sector

New Financial Asset Management Companies Act

I propose to introduce a new Financial Asset Management Companies Act to enable banks and finance companies to separate and transfer their non-performing bad assets to an asset management company. This will smoothen the resolution process of financial institutions by creating a swift removal of bad debts from an affected institution.

Establishment of the Microfinance and Credit Regulatory Authority (MCRA)

I propose to establish a Microfinance and Credit Regulatory Authority (MCRA) to ensure the protection of customers of microfinance and money lending businesses, while necessitating the reporting requirement of the regulated institutions to the Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka (CRIB).

Blue and Green Financing Space

Hon. Speaker, the country has over time created many assets that are environmentally friendly and has the potential to be monetized to access the growing blue and green financing space. Sri Lanka is a signatory to a number of key international agreements and has also agreed to be a part of the 30-by-30 initiative. In this regard, I propose to initiate work on the Marine Spatial Plan and identify and declare the Exclusive Economic Zones which will also pave the way to attract sustainable

investments, including blue, green and sustainable financing, while the country progresses on its programme with the IMF.

Social Protection

Welfare Benefits Policy

Hon. Speaker, I draw your attention to the 19th paragraph of the Interim Budget Speech presented by me to amend the Appropriation Act, No. 30 of 2021. According to the Welfare Benefits Act, No. 24 of 2002, the preparation of the social registry has already been started by Welfare Benefits Board (WBB). Accordingly, the beneficiary applications have been processed and the data systems are also being processed. We have already published on 20th October 2022 the legal regulations to identify beneficiaries based on verifiable eligibility criteria.

As the next stage of the process, it is planned to go to the homes of the applicants who have already registered to validate their eligibility to receive benefits and get a declaration related to it according to the Law. Accordingly, the process of selecting beneficiaries using new eligibility criteria will start in January, 2023 and the eligibility list will be published. In line with the Welfare Benefits Act, No. 24 of 2002, all welfare benefits payment schemes will be prepared based on that social registry system.

The WBB will coordinate payments of all welfare benefits. Electronic payments of benefits under this social registry and all welfare benefit payment schemes framed thereunder are facilitated to the bank accounts of eligible beneficiaries. Payments under the new welfare benefit payment schemes are expected to start by April, 2023. Until then, the existing welfare benefits schemes will be maintained.

Continuing the Provision of Increased Allowances Paid to Beneficiaries of Samurdhi, Elderly, Differently-abled and Kidney Patients Allowances

Hon. Speaker, a significant number of beneficiaries are wait-listed in anticipation of the current Elderly, Differently-abled and Kidney patients allowances. As they truly deserve relief, the General Treasury was instructed to allocate provisions through the Budget, making the allowances available for them as well. Accordingly, the provisions required for providing benefits throughout the year 2023 for essential people among those who are wait-listed for a prolonged period of time in anticipation of the Elderly, Differently-abled and Kidney patients allowances have been allocated in the Budget already.

The Government has paid close attention to curtail the difficulties faced by the community who are vulnerable due to the current economic crisis. Action has been taken to increase the allowances paid to more than 30 lakhs of persons i.e. beneficiaries of Samurdhi, Elderly, Differently-abled and Kidney patients allowances and

127 128

[

2022 4

more than 726,000 economically affected families, from the revised Budget for 2022. The Government is focused on extending the respective relief herein to another four months.

In respect of the aforesaid, an additional allocation of Rs. 43 billion will be provided in addition to the provisions allocated from the Budget Estimates at present.

Strengthening Elderly / Differently-abled / Widows as Household Entrepreneurs

Elderly/disabled/low-income/widows are a segment that should receive more attention economically. It is possible to strengthen this community economically by utilizing their skills and labour, and thereby obtain their contribution towards the development of the national economy. In that respect, I propose that a programme be arranged for this purpose by the Ministry of Womens Affairs and the Ministry of Industry in collabouration with each other. I propose to allocate Rs. 250 million for the year 2023 in this respect. Further, action will be taken to obtain the participation of the private sector under public-private partnership for promotion and advertising of the products made by them in the market.

Improving Child Nutrition

Amidst the current economic crisis, an increase in acute malnutrition among children under 5 years of age is observed. Hence, I propose a sum of Rs. 500 million be provided to further strengthen the existing nutrition supplemental programmes in order to reduce health problems arising as a consequence thereof.

Agriculture

Expansion of Coconut Cultivation

As there are new opportunities to generate foreign exchange by promoting the export of coconut and coconut-related products, facilities should be provided for encouraging more and more value-added exports of coconut. It is a fact that in recent times, coconut lands are used for other purposes upon fragmentation. Therefore, necessary steps should be taken to protect the present coconut lands as well as to encourage the replanting of coconut.

Current legal provisions allow fragmentation of less than 4 hectares of coconut lands, resulting in fragmentation of many fertile coconut lands which has severely impacted on annual coconut production. Therefore, I propose to amend the existing legal provisions and limit the fragmentation of coconut lands with less than one acre in extent.

Establishing 10 Agro-entrepreneurship Villages

It is expected to transform the farmers involved in the agriculture industry into agro-entrepreneurs and thereby generate employment opportunities. For this purpose, I

propose to establish 10 Agro-Entrepreneurship Villages in order to encourage export-oriented products with the use of modern technology. I propose to allocate Rs. 250 million for this purpose.

Producing Thriloka Wijayapathra

The possibilities of producing Thriloka Wijayapathra purely for the purrpose of exports will be examined for which an expert committee will also be set up.

Reducing Post-Harvest Crop Losses and Improve Storage

Even if we work hard to increase agricultural production, over 30 per cent of our production is lost due to various issues, such as improper storage and transportation issues. Therefore, I propose to allocate Rs.150 million from the Budget of the next year to develop the required knowledge, technology and various infrastructure facilities to reduce post-harvest losses. I also propose to set up an expert committee to obtain proposals, to prevent crop damages by animals.

Irrigation

Enhancing Flood Protection Systems

In order to enhance the flood protection systems, an additional sum of Rs. 500 million will be allocated for the implementation of irrigation systems based on Ma Oya, Aththanagalu Oya and Bentara Ganga.

Dairy Sector

Increasing Liquid Milk Production

In order to improve the local milk production, I propose to develop the Kundasale Artificial Insemination Centre and adopt new technologies. For this purpose, I propose to provide Rs. 100 million in 2023. I encourage the private sector to enhance their capacities to help in this endeavour.

Environment

International University for Climate Change

The effects of global climate change are real and complex. Sri Lanka should also contribute to the programme for common survival of the humanity by helping to mitigate the effects of climate change. Accordingly, I am planning to establish an International University for Climate Change for the purpose of furthering knowledge, sharing experience, education, training, building capacities, development of programmes in the areas of climate change mitigation. As initial expenses for this purpose, I set apart Rs. 100 million.

Green Hydrogen Technology for Development

Since the world's use of fossil fuels as a form of energy is costly and environmentally damaging, more attention has been paid to the use of renewable energy.

129 130

Meanwhile, many countries are conducting various studies to use green hydrogen as energy. Another advantage of this technology is the possibility of using it to produce fertilizer. Considering the weather and climate conditions of Sri Lanka, there is an enabling environment for the production of green hydrogen (using water with solar power or wind power). Therefore, it is better to carry out research and development activities for the production of green hydrogen on a commercial basis, through a scheme of public-private partnership. Hence, I suggest commencing a joint venture project at a suitable location in the Puttalam -Mannar coastal region.

Community Participation to Increase Forest Coverage

The importance of increasing forest coverage has been recognized in the context of the global warming trends. Accordingly, work related to the plan to restore 50,000 acres of degraded forest areas by 2027 should be expedited. In addition to that, appropriate programmes should be implemented in public places, and water catchment areas to increase the cover even outside the forests. I propose to allocate Rs. 50 million for this purpose.

Research and Laboratory Facilities

New Laboratory for Excise Department

In the absence of a mechanism to examine the quality of alcohol products and to set up standards, it has become difficult to identify alcohol products being made available in the market that are unsuitable for human consumption and take legal action in this regard. Accordingly, I propose to establish a laboratory under the Excise Department to carry out tests relating to alcohol products. Hence, I propose to allocate Rs.100 million for setting up the laboratory.

Transportation

Establishing a Road Maintenance Fund

The maintenance of the countrys road system is costly whereas the amount of provisions that can be allocated from the Budget annually for this purpose is limited. Accordingly, I propose to establish a Road Maintenance Fund by charging an annual fee not less than Rs. 100 per vehicle when obtaining revenue licences. The Fund is expected to provide for all types of road maintenance annually. To set up the Fund, I propose to allocate Rs. 100 million in 2023 Budget. I request the Ministry of Highways to establish a mechanism for this purpose.

Rehabilitation and Construction

I propose to allocate Rs. 2,000 million in the year 2023 to rehabilitate the roads damaged by floods in order to minimize the sufferings undergone by the people. Action will also be taken to repair the Garagoda Bridge across the Kelani River and complete the remaining work

of the Raja Mawatha in Badulla. Action will be taken to complete the remaining work of District Secretariat of Galle.

Solar Energy / Electric Cars

Facilities for Production of Solar Energy / Electric Cars

In order to promote production of electricity using renewable energy and to encourage local production of related solar panels, I propose to remove Port and Airport Development Levy and Social Security Levy on solar panels used to produce solar energy under the combined classification code 8541.10 and inverters under the combined classification code 8504.40, which are currently under taxation, with effect from 01.01.2023.

Also, necessary incentives will be provided to promote the use of electric cars locally as well as assembling them. Accordingly, Social Security Contribution Levy will be waived only for organizations that assemble motor vehicles and add at least 25 per cent local value and produce the required parts locally.

Here, the Ministry of Industry should coordinate with all registered electric vehicle component manufacturers and approved local electric vehicle assemblers to ensure local value addition and use of locally produced electric vehicle components for the development of the local electric vehicle component manufacturing industry. I propose to establish a communication technology system for this purpose under the Ministry of Industry.

The proposed information system should ensure automatically the value of locally sourced car components and the percentage of local value addition of the cars being assembled by every electric car assembly company for tariff concessions. This computerized information exchange system shall be developed and maintained by the Ministry of Industries.

Solar Panels for Religious Places

Action will be taken to provide solar panels to religious places with the assistance from foreign sources and the Government.

Promoting Youth Engagement

Retaining the Youth in Agriculture Industry

Retaining the youth community in the agriculture industry is extremely important in ensuring the country's food security. For that, agriculture should also be modernized to suit the present-day. Hence, I propose to select 240 youth who are currently unemployed representing each district of the Island to empower them as Agricultural Entrepreneurs. For this purpose, Rs. 120 million will be allocated.

Loan Scheme to Encourage Young Women Entrepreneurs

Recognizing the importance of encouraging young women entrepreneurs, who are engaged in informal household businesses, which are not covered by the Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Line of Credit Project, implemented under the financial assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), a loan scheme will be introduced.

Under this scheme, a young woman entrepreneur can obtain a loan up to a maximum of Rs. 250,000.00. The Scheme targets empowering at least 1,000 young women entrepreneurs at its initial stage. This Scheme is expected to be implemented through the Regional Development Bank (RDB) covering all the districts and for that, as a start-up fund, Rs. 250 million will be allocated for 2023.

Training of Youth for Foreign Employment

I propose to allocate Rs. 50 million in 2023 to the National Youth Services Council to train youth for foreign employment opportunities.

Health and Sanitation Facilities

Safety Seal (Sticker) for Drinking Water Bottles

It has become necessary to introduce a safeguard mechanism for drinking water bottles to ensure the quality of the drinking water bottles by considering the high demand for them. Accordingly, the Ministry of Health should take necessary action to introduce procedures to apply a safety seal (sticker) to drinking water bottles at the production point. Further, the Ministry should take follow-up action in this regard.

Sanitary Facilities for Prisoners

The sanctioned capacity of the prisons currently under the Prisons Department is 13,241. However, the current total number of detainees (including suspects) is 25,162. Accordingly, the existing sanitary facilities are grossly inadequate, and it is necessary to improve the existing facilities up to the required level. Therefore, I propose to allocate Rs 100 million for the purpose. The Prisons Department should consider this as a priority task.

Upgrading Hospitals

I propose to upgrade Badulla, Kurunegala and Polonnaruwa Hospitals as Teaching Hospitals.

Paying Wards System in Government Hospitals

I also propose to re-implement the paying wards system in government hospitals. As the first phase, this system will be established in national and base hospitals.

Monitoring Budget Implementation

Appointment of Task Force to Monitor Budget Implementation

It is observed that there are many shortcomings with regard to the implementation of Budget Proposals. However, it is required to ensure benefits to the public by implementing such proposals within the appropriate time frame. Therefore, I propose to set up a Presidential Task Force to carry out monitoring functions to expedite implementation of all Budget Proposals.

A summary of the Budget is presented in Annexure I. The relevant amendments to the Appropriation Bill to increase the borrowing limit due to the adjustments for book/cash value of government securities for the financial year 2023 are presented in Annexure II.

I request all of you to join and support the journey of bringing about a positive change in the country through these Budget Proposals . We are taking these suggestions as background. Let us prepare a new economic base. Let us come to a common consensus and create a national economic policy framework. Let us implement that policy framework for the next 25 years.

Every 5 years we can review our progress. Through such a review, we get the opportunity to further develop the policies that can make our journey towards our goal successful.

I have now provided this Parliament with the necessary background to contribute to this journey. On one side, the Parliamentary Sectoral Oversight Committees are there. On the other side, the National Assembly represents the Parliament. In addition, we have proposed several committees on public finance and financial services. As I recently drew the attention of the Speaker, the Parliament has not fully formed these Committees yet.

The Sectoral Oversight Committees can play a big role when the Budget Proposals that I have presented are implemented through government officials. The finance committees can effectively intervene in the exercise of reducing public expenditure.

Therefore, I request this Parliament to implement all those committees as soon as possible. Then we can create the space to initiate a new journey with a new guise.

Let us make the best use of that space and join together to create a better future for our true national resource, our youth.

Accordingly, I request all of you to actively and proactively contribute to the effort of re-raising the country through a new economic foundation.

Thank you!
