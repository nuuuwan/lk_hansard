.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Speaker, - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Sumanthiran? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, in the spirit of the Constitutional provision that the President is answerable to Parliament, may I ask the President for just two clarifications on the Statement that was made.

Firstly, Mr. President, the IMF issued a statement at the time the Staff-level Agreement was being reached, highlighting a factor, which they called corruption susceptibilities, as a challenge. - [Interruption.] Yes, the President is being disturbed by others while I am asking this question. What is the Governments plan to address corruption within Government in order to overcome that? That is the first clarification I seek.

Secondly, Mr. President, while you were Prime Minister, I sought a clarification with regard to that Staff-level Agreement and in this House, you gave an undertaking that the House will be kept informed at every stage of those negotiations. So far, we have not been informed of what that Staff-level Agreement contains. Will you direct that it be placed before the House?

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) As far as the IMF clauses in regard to corruption are concerned, the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms is to bring in a new corruption law, which will include the UN provisions that have been referred to in the Staff-level Agreement. You all also have the opportunity of discussing it in Parliament or before

Parliament. There is no problem, we will make it available.

The Staff-level Agreement is subject to ratification by the IMF Board and unlike on earlier instances, we still have to go and meet the main creditors. So, we do not know whether there will be any other condition imposed. As a result, we cannot release the Staff-level Agreement this time until the Board clarifies it. But, I am arranging in the next two or three weeks for the the Cabinet to have a session and together with that, for the Leaders of the Opposition Parties to get a briefing on it. I am trying to speak to Lazard to see whether it is possible for them to give the briefing because it would be even better than our officials giving you that briefing.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) As far as the Constitutional amendment is concerned, as you suggested, we are willing to discuss. But, have a formal, regularized structure rather than ad hoc discussions, appoint a Select Committee and then, we will go ahead with it so that it is regularized and formal.

Hon. Prime Minister, the second point is, I do not think there is any necessity to discuss it further, if you all are withdrawing the Twenty Second Amendment to the Constitution for the moment. Until there is a proper, comprehensive discussion among all the stakeholders, we are willing to go ahead with the Debate right now, if it so pleases. I do not think we need to waste time of Parliament.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) As we have agreed on principle that we should discuss it, just now, the Hon. Speaker summoned a Party Leaders' Meeting at 11.00 oclock. So, we will take up the issue there and discuss. Until then, let us start the Debate on the Statement of the Hon. President, which has been requested for and the Opposition agreed to. ( ) (The Hon.

2) The Kandy Municipal Council had

carved through the river reservation on the southern bank of the River Mahaweli at the place named Polkotuwa on the King Rajasinghe II Avenue in Dodamwala and constructed a flight of stairs consisting of a handrail using concrete.

As per the recommendation of the Waratennan-Hakkinda Environmental Protection Area Monitoring Committee, the Kandy Municipal Council, which had constructed the above-mentioned

1131 1132

flight of stairs illegally, was informed in writing on 06.01.2021 to take action to demolish and remove it. In addition, a reminder dated 20.04.2022 has also been sent.

3) M.H.L. Wickramasinghe residing at

No. 61, King Rajasinghe II Avenue had constructed a house illegally on a land belonging to the Kandy Municipal Council within the reservation of the River Mahaweli.

The above-mentioned construction was discussed at the Technical Committee meeting held on 07.01.2022 and the Committee recommended that legal action be taken against the said illegal construction. The Additional Secretary (Lands), who attended the Committee, stated that local authorities had in their possession both State lands and donated lands and such donated lands could not be treated as State lands. Therefore, he suggested that, before resorting to legal action, it was suitable to get the verification specifically from the Commissioner of Lands whether the land on which this construction had been carried out was a government land. The Committee recommended that legal action be taken as he suggested.

According to the recommendation of the Committee, this matter has been referred to the Commissioner of Lands by letters dated 03.02.2022 and 07.03.2022 to verify whether the land concerned is a State land. As such, legal action is to be initiated regarding the illegal construction concerned as soon as the Central Environmental Authority receives information to the effect that the land concerned is a State land.

4) Jagath Kolitha Kahandawala residing at

No. 311/17 Elephant Walk Lane, River Place Garden, Hal-Oluwa, Waratenna has used flagstones and applied a layer of concrete illegally in the river reservation.

5) K.U.A.K. Fernando had constructed a

hotel by the name "Why Not Garden" at No. 107, King Rajasinghe II Avenue, Kandy illegally.

The Waratenna - Hakkinda Environmental Protection Area

Monitoring Committee has recommended that the Central Environmental Authority should decide on taking legal action against that. Legal action has been initiated regarding the demolishing and removal of the illegal construction that has been carried out at the above-mentioned place (Case number 36491 - Kandy Magistrates Court 02). As such, the Court gave an interim injunction in order to stop the illegal construction that was being carried out at the place concerned and at the hearing held on 28.04.2022, that interim injunction was further extended. The case concerned is to be examined in due course.

6) C.D. Suresh Aberathna had carried out

illegal improvements at a place maintained on a land belonging to the Kandy Municipal Council at No. 57, King Rajasinghe II Avenue, Gatambe, Kandy, where restaurant facilities are supplied.

The matter regarding the above-mentioned construction was referred to the Committee held on 07.01.2022 and subjected to discussion. The Committee recommended that legal action be taken against the illegal construction. The Additional Secretary (Lands), who attended the Committee, stated that Local Authorities had in their possession both State lands and donated lands and that such donated lands could not be treated as State lands. Therefore, he suggested that it was suitable to get it verified specifically from the Commissioner of Lands whether the land on which this construction had been carried out is a government land before resorting to legal action. The Committee recommended that legal action be taken accordingly.

According to the recommendation of the Committee, this matter has been referred to the Commissioner of Lands by letters dated 03.02.2022 and 07.03.2022 to verify whether the land concerned is a State land. As such, legal action is to be initiated regarding the illegal construction concerned as soon as the Central Environmental Authority receives information to the effect that the land concerned is a State land.

( ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed) Of course, we have to come up with an answer for this issue. Also, I would like to mention in this House that for all those constructions, generally they get permission from various other institutions. It is only thereafter that they come to the Central Environmental Authority. So, how do we resolve this? Basically, permission is given for those by the local authority, the Urban Development Authority or by various other institutions. Afther they get permission from such institutions, they commence construction and do it in a way that affects the environment and without sticking to the plan for which they received permission.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran, now you can raise your matter of Privilege.

:

PRIVILEGE: THREAT TO LIFE

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Speaker, I am raising a Question of Privilege. On the 06th of August, 2021, I raised a Question of Privilege relating to the Hon. R. Sampanthan, Member of Parliament for Trincomalee, which was referred to the Committee on Ethics and Privileges. The said Committee requested me to be present at its Meeting on 04th October, 2022 at 3.00 p.m. and accordingly, I presented myself there. The owner of the Facebook page titled BATTI TV had been summoned and gave evidence after the charge against him was read out. In his evidence, he

1189 1190

2022 06

stated that he is a member of the political party Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal and his party Leader, the Hon. Sivanesathurai Santhirakanthan, is the person who sent him the offending video footage of the Hon. Sampanthan being helped to walk down the aisle in Parliament on 19th July, 2021, which he published on his Facebook page with his voice over, stating that the Hon. Sampanthan is of no use to anybody and that he is selfishly occupying a seat in Parliament. That video had been recorded from within the Chamber and according to the said evidence, it had been done by the Hon. Sivanesathurai Santhirakanthan.

The very next day, that is 05th October, 2022, yesterday, the Hon. Shanakiyan Rasamanickam and I left Parliament around 12.45 p.m. and went together for a pre-arranged meeting down Horton Place in two separate vehicles. While we were travelling, the security personnel attached to us observed a motorbike following us. Later, they saw the same motorbike parked near the place where we were and took a photograph of same. It is a motorbike with an Eastern Province registration number - EP BEY2600. The security personnel promptly reported the matter to the Cinnamon Garden Police. The OIC, Chief Inspector Aloka Bandara, had later told them that the person was an intelligence officer who had been detailed to follow us. Sir, I am tabling* the photograph of the said motorbike.

I raise this Question of Privilege relating to both the Hon. Shanakiyan Rasamanickam and myself and in that, our coming and going from Parliament is covered by Parliamentary Privileges. In addition, this seems to have happened after the proceedings in the Committee on Ethics and Privileges, where a former leader of an armed group, a paramilitary group, was identified as the culprit in the matter of the Hon. Sampanthans Privileges being violated. In this connection, I must say that he was also an accused in a murder case, the murder of an Hon. Member of Parliament. Also in June this year, President Ranil Wickremesinghe, sitting in the Opposition benches, identified this person as the person who killed 600 policemen. Even if what the OIC, Cinnamon Garden Police said is true, why are intelligence officers being detailed to follow Opposition Members of Parliament and also, why are intelligence officers of the State given vehicles registered in the Eastern Province? I am requesting the Hon. Speaker to take immediate action in this regard, as we consider this a threat to our lives in addition to it being a violation of our Privileges.

Thank you.

[2.08 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, thank you for the time given to participate in this Adjournment Debate today.

Sir, as I begin to speak, I must note that this is an anticlimax. The country has been waiting for serious Constitutional amendment. There was a countrywide cry to change the system and a part of that was to do away with the Executive Presidency. Then, we were told, Yes, we will abolish the Executive Presidency, but first, we will do away with the Twentieth Amendment. There was also a call to remove the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution and so, from about the month of April, the country has been waiting. Then, with a lot of fanfare, the Government said, We have introduced the Twenty Second Amendment to the Constitution. This is the promise we gave to the people. With this, we will substantially reduce the executive powers of the President and make the country and governance more democratic. Today, while the whole country waited with bated breath for this wonderful piece of legislation that you had promised the country to be brought to Parliament, debated and passed, the Government again has gone on reverse gear. Gear Reverse - GR - is now the catchphrase. We had a "GR" earlier, who also did this. Then, the new President, when he declared High Security Zones under the Official Secrets Act and it was pointed out that it was wholly ultra vires, that there was no power to declare High Security Zones under the Official Secrets Act, he

1221 1222

[ .

2022 06

reversed and earned for himself the name "GR" - Gear Reverse. We saw that again today: you step forward, say that you are delivering on your promise and then, you turn your back. That is the performance of this Government.

The President was here in the morning and he made a Special Statement with regard to the economic crisis that the country is facing. I must place on record our appreciation to the President for doing this as often as possible. That is a welcome change from previous dispensations. From the time he took over as Prime Minister actually, he has laid out his plan, has addressed the nation and Parliament and even after becoming the President, he has done that and for that, I think it is only fair that we place our appreciation.

But, this economic crisis itself is something that we need to understand before we decide how it is to be dealt with. As the President spoke, I clarified two issues with him. One was with regard to corruption susceptibilities that the IMF has highlighted. When the IMF highlights corruption susceptibility as a key challenge, a key factor for the country to come out of this crisis, it goes without saying that that was a factor that contributed in no small measure for the economic crisis to happen, that corruption within the Government was definitely an important factor that caused the economic crisis. The unfortunate thing is that the whole country knew about it and it had even become a matter of light-hearted conversation. Various Ministers were referred to as Mr. Ten Percent et cetera, but by the time we started calling them Mr. Ten Percent, they were actually taking 100 per cent. You cannot do that for too long. Obviously, the economy collapsed. At the beginning of this year, we raised these issues and said, Go to the IMF; start an IMF programme. The Government said, No, no, there is no such crisis. We can meet all our obligations. By the middle of April, the Government declared the country as bankrupt. So, today, officially, we are bankrupt. We must take steps to get out of that because the people are suffering and are due to suffer more. The increase in prices has not stabilized; prices keep increasing and that will keep happening. So, while we address ourselves as to how we can come out of this crisis, it is equally important that we also address the reasons for this crisis and address those immediately. Otherwise, it will be a vicious cycle we will never be able to get out of. That is the reason why I highlighted the corruption susceptibility and there does not seem to be anything being done. Unfortunately, I must place on record that the answer given by the President himself is unsatisfactory; to say, "We are bringing in some law" and to tell the country that that will deal with the rampant corruption is not satisfactory.

You brought in something called the Twenty Second Amendment and we pointed out that it, in no way, reduces any of the powers of the President. You tried to dupe the country, to mislead the country into believing that you are bringing in some democratic reform and when you realized that that was going to be exposed, that the Opposition was not going to play ball with you - the Opposition indicated to you yesterday that there is no substantial change - and that even after the passage of the Twenty Second Amendment, the President is going to continue to have the full complement of the Twentieth

Amendment powers, you have retreated; you have gone on reverse gear .

And, it is a fact that there is no change whatever in the powers of the President even when the Twenty Second Amendment is brought in. So, you cannot mislead the people, you cannot practise this fraud on the people and that is why the Opposition said, No, we will not go along with this. We will tell the people what this piece of Amendment you are bringing in, what it will do and what it will not do.

Whilst all of this is going on, I must raise some other concerns. There are other things that are happening, particularly in the North and the East. Yesterday, in the Mullaitivu District, the police did what they have been doing here against the university students. Fishermen have been demonstrating peacefully for several days against illegal fishing methods. The Minister of Fisheries went there promising to stop all illegal methods, and I was told that after doing that, some of his supporters took him to a side and told him something else. Then, he came back and said, I will make all these illegal fishing methods legal very soon. Those illegal fishing methods are illegal the world over; those are international standards. But, what he had told them was, I will make those legal. So, let them continue. And, yesterday, there was a clash and what does the police do? They do what they are used to: they attacked the peaceful protesters. There was tear gas used; there was a severe attack on those protesters. That is the kind of repression the Government is employing against people who are justifiably bringing their concerns to the fore, asking questions. They have a right to ask those questions.

In that area, you are trying to change the divisions and I am tabling* a document marked Confidential - for official purposes only.

But, I have a copy with me and I am placing it responsibly before the House. It was prepared by the Ministry of Irrigation and is dated 26th September, 2022 and signed by the Hon. Roshan Ranasinghe, Minister of Irrigation, in which you are tampering with the divisions, stating how the villagers in the south of Mullaitivu District are going to be dealt with and how you are changing the administration. In such a way, you are meddling with the ethnic composition, seeking to change the ethnic composition. You have been trying to do this for several decades. You actually changed substantially the population of the East. Now, you are concentrating on the north of the Eastern Province, the north of the Trincomalee District and the south-east of the Northern Province and the south of the Mullaitivu District, trying to bifurcate the natural linguistic contiguity, by which the North and the East are connected.

It is one region where there is a natural contiguity. By these efforts, by gerrymandering or changing administrative boundaries, you are trying to break that

1223 1224

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

contiguity. Now, this has very serious repercussions and I am asking the Government to immediately halt these efforts, using the Forest Ordinance and other special laws related to the Mahaweli, archaeology, which is very important, and wildlife. Those are special laws for special purposes, that is true. But, you are using those laws, not for the purposes for which those laws have been enacted as special laws, but for wrongful purposes: to suppress an ancient community and merely because we are smaller in number, to deprive us of the areas of our historic habitation. That area is the joined the North and East and if you do not stop those efforts, it will be a further disaster for this country.

Thank you.
