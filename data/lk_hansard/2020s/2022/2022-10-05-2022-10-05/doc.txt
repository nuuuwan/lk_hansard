. . Question proposed. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . [ ] () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Sir, I seek one clarification since you are in the Chair. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, what is that? () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Just now, we got a news alert that the final draft of the Resolution on Sri Lanka is being handed over in Geneva.

Yesterday, Hejaaz Hizbullahs case was taken up at the Puttalam High Court. For the third day, Sir, the prosecution was not available. He was charged under the Prevention of Terrorism Act and was given bail a couple of days before the UN Human Rights Commission sat last. It is on very flimsy evidence of the star witness that they are prosecuting him. The defence is asking where the Attorney-General is. How can they do this? If there is no case, drop it and let this poor man go. If there is a case, prosecute him. You cannot just continue like this.

1009 1010

2022 05

Without any reason, the Attorney-Generals State Counsel was not present. When the Judge questioned about it, the State Counsel who was present there on that day said that the State Counsel who was supposed to prosecute was not available. When they asked for the file, the State Counsel said that the file was not with her. When they asked the CID as to where the file was, the file was not there. Sir, we are going to get into a further mess. The former President is here; all the important people are here; the Hon. State Minister of Defence is also here. Hon. State Minister, it is your Minister who has fixed a DO on Hejaaz Hizbullah. Please deal with it, Sir.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you. [.. 11.45] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Premitha Bandara Tennakoon - State Minister of Defence) , 1977 8 3(1) .

. , . , . , '' , . , , , . ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .. . 12 . [2.57 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, firstly, I would like to say that the Amendments to the Standing Orders, in principle, are welcome. I belong to a party which believes that Parliament should be strengthened. So, strengthening the Committee system is primarily the most important function of this Parliament, not just having debates because the vast majority of the constructive work ought to be through the functioning of those Committees. In strengthening the Committee system, appointing new ones and also appointing Opposition Members to chair the Committees, I think, is the right way forward. So, in that sense, in principle, we welcome it.

However, Sir, whilst saying that the move to strengthen Parliament and the Committee system of Parliament is a welcome one, I would also like to say that the failure of this country is not just because of a weak Parliament, but also because of the Executive Presidency and the overall system of governance. We have had a unitary Constitution for the last 75 years, which has been an abject failure. But, scraping the barrel as we are right now, to not to acknowledge that it is the overarching system which caused this failure and in fact, keep debating the need to change that, I think, is ultimately not going to produce all that much forward movement. In that respect, I do not want to take time in arguing my case with regard to the need to reject the unitary Constitution and move towards a federal one. I think we will have that debate on another day.

Then, with regard to the Standing Orders and the Amendments, I would also like to suggest to the Hon. Speaker and the Hon. Leader of the House that Standing Orders be amended in a much more realistic and practical way. For example, Sir, the important special-purposes Committees -

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Order, please! . () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Susil Premajayantha) , " " . , . . Question put, and agreed to. , . , , . Whereupon THE HON. HESHA WITHANAGE left the Chair, and THE HON. IMRAN MAHAROOF took the Chair. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, I was about to say that with regard to the important special-purpose Committees like the Parliamentary Business Committee, COPE, COPA and the Committee of Selection, a specific number of Members has been introduced into the Standing Orders. Let us take the Parliamentary Business Committee of this Parliament, which is unofficially known as the "Party Leaders Meeting" because it is ideally the Committee which consists of the Party Leaders who decide on the Business of Parliament. Though I happened to be a Party Leader, I was unable to get into that Committee for almost a year despite my lobbying the Leader of the House, the Leader of the Opposition and the Speaker.

I was flatly rejected for almost a year and eventually, I got into that Committee because the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa needed to be included in, when he was brought into Parliament. But, that did not happen when I went and asked the Speaker. The number of Members allocated for this Committee is actually not practical. Today, you have several minor parties that are represented in Parliament, which have got mandates of their own. They are not in alliance with someone else. Our party is not in alliance with anybody else; we won two Members on our own volition. So, when we have earned our place, for us to not to have a place in the Committee on Parliamentary Business is actually a grave injustice because we would not know what is happening in Parliament. Therefore, likewise, at least with regard to the very important special-purpose Committees - Parliament is actually there to monitor the finances and to legislate - I think the number of Members must be much more flexible. Parliament should be prepared to change those numbers to incorporate Members who are actually Leaders of parties which have won mandates of their own so that those respective mandates are also represented in those Committees.

The other matter I wish to mention, Sir, is with regard to the allocation of time especially for smaller parties like the Tamil National Peoples Front, the party to which the Hon. Selvarajah Kajendren and I belong. I am a Party Leader and today, I am speaking towards the end of the days Proceedings. Surely, as Party Leaders, we should be given precedence and also there must be a minimum time allocated for a party that it is going to have only one speaker on a particular topic. I have been lobbying this point for many months because a grave injustice is done to us when there is a lot of interest in a particular debate - of course, today, there are not many speakers because not many speakers are interested in Standing Orders - and when speakers of a party such as ours is asked to speak in the afternoon. On such occasions, by the time we get the chance to speak - if we are given a minimum time of say, 10 or 12 minutes at least, that time would not changed at all - we have hardly any time to speak because the time gets reduced in due course, whereas if a Party Leader is given precedence, we would at least get to speak in the morning, in which case, more often than not, we would get at least that minimum time we require to make a point in a debate. So, I would like to make these suggestions to the Hon. Leader of the House and the Chair and through the Chair, to the Hon. Speaker to be considered because those can only strengthen the debates and certainly strengthen the plurality with regard to the debates in this House.

Finally, Sir, I wish to touch on a point which the Hon. Leader of the House and also the Hon. Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms made with regard to the sovereignty of Parliament, that Parliament is constitutionally a very important place and that it is so important that its functions should not be, in anyway, hindered. The point that both of them were trying to make was with regard to the way in which, during the protest that took place in the past or the so-called aragalaya, certain speeches and certain calls were made to surround Parliament or to reject the present Parliament and to establish a counter Parliament and various notions such as that. The tone of those comments by the Hon. Leader of the House and the Minister was to suggest that those calls were illegal because Parliament is so honourable and that it should be above criticism. I do not quite agree with that, Sir.

Yes, there was a mandate given to you all about two-and-a-half years ago, but even the Government accepts that that mandate has been rejected by the people.

It is because the Government itself accepted that the mandate has been rejected by the people that we had the Prime Minister resigning first and then thereafter, the President. So, when that mandate has been rejected and when the former President and Prime Minister resigned, accordingly, you must accept that this House also does not, in fact, represent the will of the people. And one of the other demands that people have been making is that this Parliament must be dissolved. So, that element of the peoples wish is still being rejected and we are only tampering with appointment of certain Committees and bringing in certain Amendments to the Standing Orders to facilitate those Committees to function, trying to make out that the Presidency, which is something that the

people have been calling for to be rejected and repealed, is being weakened and by strengthening these Committees within Parliament, there is a democratization process that is being undertaken. As far as I am concerned, it is a faade. So, the Hon. Leader of the House and particularly, the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms must realize that the call that Parliament is above everything else, I think, is a very dangerous one. I think todays Parliament reflects the very weak footing of that argument and we must not endeavour to try and pursue that line of thinking henceforth.

Finally, Sir, I wish to state this with regard to a matter that the Hon. Charles Nirmalanathan mentioned. That is about Kurundur Malai, which is an ancient Tamil worship site that has literally been taken over by the Department of Archaeology. The Hon. Vidura Wickramanayaka, who was, under the previous leadership, the Minister concerned and who is also the Minister now, visited the site, where he laid the foundation stone for that archaeological site to be made into a Buddhist temple. If it is an archaeological site, it is an archaeological site; it is a site that can be protected. But, that does not mean you can destroy that site and build a Buddhist temple. Who makes those rulings? The court was approached by us and we had a Stay Order or an injunction by the court to make sure that no disturbance is made to that site. We repeatedly told the Hon. Minister that we have reliable sources to say that buildings are taking place there, that a Buddhist temple is being built on that site without any verification of the findings of the Department of Archaeology, which is a racist department. Looking at the way it functions, I will go as far as to say that it is an absolutely racist department. Despite the Hon. Minister telling us that no such building would take place, the Hon. Members of this House representing the North and the East went to the site with the military and the police trying to prevent them and in fact, exposed the grave way in which the Buddhist monk concerned and the military, all together, had been violating that court Order. So, we would like to repeat that despite the assurances given to the Members of this House by the Ministries, these racist actions have been taking place, and it is under those circumstances, Sir, that the Members from the North and the East are asked to have some sort of faith in this Government. Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 10 . [.. 3.10] ( ) (The Hon. Hesha Withanage) , .
