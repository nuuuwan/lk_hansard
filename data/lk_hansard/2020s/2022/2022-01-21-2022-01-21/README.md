; it is in the Standing Orders. A Leader of a political party can even raise Questions under Standing Order No. 27(2). So, a recognized political party Leader has to be recognized in that way. Therefore, I agree with the former Prime Minister. Even though he is the only Member of his party, he is a Leader of a recognized political party and the Jathika Jana Balawegaya in the Opposition is also a recognized political party. We also have other recognized political parties and they all come under our Whip because we are the Government.

Presiding Member, being the youngest Member of Parliament and also the State Minister of Estate Housing and Community Infrastructure, I would like to welcome the Hon. Speaker of the National Assembly of South Korea and we hope he enjoys his time here. It is also heartening to know how our relations with the Korean counterparts have been.

Now, I would like to continue my speech in my mother tongue, Tamil, regarding the Policy Statement of His Excellency the President.

Lastly, I would just like to say that in this period of economic hardship in our country, we all must come together to move forward. And, it would be wrong of me if I do not recognize the efforts made by the Indian Government in terms of helping us economically. For example, just in January, 2022, they helped us with the deferrel of ACU settlements close to US Dollars 515 million, which is not a small task. Apart from that, there was also an extension of US Dollars 400 million under the SAARC currency swap agreement. Other than that, there was a US Dollars 500 million credit line for fuel purchase and there are more such schemes. They have helped us out from transportation to housing and through many other programmes. But, when this is the case, I feel that they are not getting the credit they deserve. The reason that they are helping us economically is because of their belief in our Government and its leadership. So, that being said, I kindly plead all the Members of the Opposition as well to please come together and help us come out of this difficult time. Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 10 .

In upgrading provincial schools in Jaffna as National Schools, you take over very the big schools in Jaffna.

[3.03 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, the opportunity to present the Policy Statement after proroguing Parliament should have been used by the President to address the anxieties and doubts that are in the minds of the people, helping them to get rid of those or at least, to allay their fears. But, what finally happened was that he tried to paint a rosy picture. It was an abysmal failure. His Statement did not offer any explanation as to whether the country would be coming out of the miserable position it is in.

With all these misery and hardship, today, the questions that are being asked in every household are, whether there is going to be power cuts in the coming days, whether there will be extended gas shortages, which we are currently facing, whether there will be a medicine shortage and whether there will be a scarcity of food. Then, there is also the question of the economy of this country grinding to a halt. With all the problems and these shortages the country is already experiencing, what is in store in the near term is nothing but catastrophic. Based on the direction we are moving in, we would soon be a bankrupt nation, there is no doubt, and every economic activity will come to a grinding halt and the general public will be in the streets, Hon. Presiding Member. I foresee a big demand for wheelbarrows, not for anything else, but to move the depreciated Sri Lankan Rupees around. That is what is going to happen in the future, if we do not take the advice from the right economists who are talking about the plight in which we are today. Now, based on the actions of the Government and the economic decision-makers, it is blatantly evident that the decision-makers, instead of looking for a messiah to pull the country out of the abyss, are passionately pursuing the devil to further entrench the country in the abyss and cause immense misery and hardship to the people of this country.

Hon. Presiding Member, every decision of this Government since it got elected to power has been reactive and agenda-based, where decisions were taken in isolation without a holistic assessment with proper scientific advice. The ramifications of such decisions, as a whole, on the economy would be terrible and that is what I am going to lay out here. Here are some of the ramifications of the reactive, agenda-based decisions. Firstly, the power shortage is linked to the fuel shortage, which is once again linked to shortage of foreign exchange. Secondly, the shortage of medicines is again linked to the foreign exchange crisis. Then, the food shortage is linked to the ban on fertilizer, against which so many who knew the subject was advising the Government, but the Government was turning a deaf ear, which was further exacerbated by the dearth of foreign exchange once again. Then, we see the inflation reaching double digits, which is linked to the tax cuts the Government gave to their preferred businessmen. Money

printing and the artificially fixed exchange rate also caused inflation. Then, the gas shortage is again linked to the foreign exchange crisis and to the misguided regulatory actions. So, there is a long list of ramifications of such decisions. The reversal of many Government decisions brought before this House endorses my contention that decision-making at Government level has been very haphazard, to say the least.

Hon. Presiding Member, the COVID pandemic has become the boogeyman for the Government, for every ill faced by this nation. The pandemic, of course, did create a situation like it did for all our neighbours in the SAARC Region; Sri Lanka was not the only country affected by the pandemic. His Excellency the Presidents own words were, We did better than most nations. But, all our SAARC neighbours who did worse than us on the pandemic front have weathered the pandemic storm, come out shining well and their reserves have also increased, whereas our reserves are plunging to the bottom. This is what is happening. The secret of our SAARC neighbours' success was, all of them had cohesive, structured plans guided by proper leadership to weather the pandemic storm while Sri Lanka was running behind the devil with no plan and no direction. Due to the time constraint, Madam, I could focus only on a limited number of issues relating to the economy of the country.

Now, we are in dire straits purely because of the inaction and misguided actions of decision-makers. Hon. Presiding Member, the learned Governor of the Central Bank has, to date, failed to digest the basic economic principle the market is smarter" than everybody else. What this means in pure laymans terms is, one cannot fight and/or control the marketplace. If you do, the market forces will hit you back hard where it hurts you most with venom.

Hon. Presiding Member, two important tools that align market forces are the exchange rate and the domestic interest rate. The results of this misguided action in the context of the foreign exchange market are, the drop in remittances, which was US Dollars 700 million per month in May, last year, to US Dollars 300 million per month today and the exporters' holding on to foreign exchange and the rupees borrowed against them, creating a shortage of foreign exchange in the banking system. That again, we must understand, is because of the misguided policies of the Central Bank. They failed to keep the rupee interest rate around 4 to 5 per cent whilst the banking system was paying 5 per cent for a US Dollar. Also, with the Central Bank paying an additional 2 per cent, it resulted in exporters retaining their foreign exchange and borrowing rupees to fund their operations, which resulted in the short supply of foreign exchange. This demand for foreign exchange pushed the US Dollar official rate differential to almost 10 per cent in May and June, 2021. Currently, it is about 30 per cent. The rapid increase of this differential contributed to the significant dip in remittances as well and that is the issue. The Central Bank Governors "carrot and stick" approach, as he went on record, only further exacerbated the situation, endorsing the principle that markets cannot be outsmarted, which should be understood.

377 378

2022 21

Hon. Presiding Member, the solution is to increase the rupee interest rate significantly higher. This will force exporters to convert their dollar holdings used as collateral to borrow rupees and then provide the exporters the market-decided exchange rate to convert, which will enable market forces to align interest rate and exchange rate at sustainable levels. This is what you ought to do.

What Sri Lanka is going through now, many other countries have gone through at some point of time and have successfully come out of many such crises. It is high time that the Government stops running after the devil and turn to the IMF for support since it is the lender of last resort. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) The IMF is not a monster, as showcased in this House by many Government Members. It does not work in the interest of any government, political party or NGO like they have been talking in this House. The IMF will focus on what is best for the people of Sri Lanka and will ensure that they benefit out of their support in a sustainable manner.

Therefore, Hon. Presiding Member, I hope even at this late juncture, sanity will prevail on the Government side and expeditiously, they will engage with the IMF and negotiate a package that would bring Sri Lanka out of this terrible, abysmal problem we are faced with today.

Thank you. [.. 3.12] ... ( ... ) (The Hon.H.M.M. Harees) .

379 380

[3.17 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) I thank the Chair for giving me this opportunity to take part in the Debate on the Policy Statement of the President.

Much was expected by way of reconciliatory statements from the President vis--vis the Tamils. The only advice we got from him was, Forget your people. Come and join me to do development work. Two thousand and twenty two years ago, a person who died on the cross said certain prophetic words. Man does not live by bread alone, He said. The President wants us to leave our kith and kin, those who voted for us, those who are awaiting their freedom from Sinhala hegemony in the North and the East, those who have lost their lands to Government departments and the armed forces and join him to take bread to our people. He thinks the 3,000 years of culture and civilization of the Tamils of the North and the East of Sri Lanka could be purchased by bread alone. He thinks if the Tamils are forced to live within an occupied territory, if they are deprived of even the existing feeble political rights, if they are sufficiently terrorized and if they are stifled and starved, they would sell their birthright to a pot of porridge! Maybe, the lack of political experience is showing on His Excellency the President!

Madam, his Policy Statement has nothing to show that he regrets the past; it has nothing to show that he welcomes a reconciliatory future. He enumerates what he has done so far, which has not saved this country from facing bankruptcy. He has not even a word of thanks for those who have come forward to help the country at this critical hour. Maybe, he felt a word of thanks to anyone other than those of Huaren descent might irk the latter. While the President and his ilk have been terrorizing [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

the minorities in this country, he himself seems to be terrorized by the thoughts of Huaren wrath!

Let me state here that now, the world and so many educated and concerned Sinhalese among Sri Lankans, too, acknowledge the fact that today, Sri Lanka faces this unprecedented state of affairs being on the brink of bankruptcy due to the unresolved ethnic problem. Nearly a fifth of the countrys wealth is utilized even today for so-called security and to pamper the military. The thirty-year war was due to the reluctance on the part of our majoritarian leaders to resolve the ethnic problem, but the President refuses to accept that this country faces an ethnic problem, and identifies that the Tamils face only an economic problem. He is like the proverbial cat which closes its eyes and believes that the world is in darkness. His inability or refusal to identify the existing ethnic contradictions signals the fact that peace and prosperity would be far-fetched dreams in this country for many

years to come. Even a college student would know that this country suffers today due to the unresolved ethnic contradictions. But, the President believes that by giving some economic sops, the Tamil-speaking people of the North and the East would be satisfied.

Madam, if there is an existing political problem, the most prudent, positive and scientific way would be to identify the problem, study it closely, find out why it cropped up and find an appropriate solution to it. Our beloved President refuses to identity an existing gigantic ethnic problem staring on his face and seeks a solution to a non-existing ethnic, economic problem. In this country, both the majority community as well as the minority communities suffer due to the wrong economic policies pursued by successive governments up to now. The Tamil-speaking people, who are the majority in the North and the East, suffer as much as the Sinhalese and others or more, economically. But, they are steadfastly eager for the resolution of their political problem, which the President refuses to acknowledge. This does not augur well for the future of this country.

There is no doubt that from the time of Independence, the Tamil-speaking people of this country have been suffering. Land grabbing in the North and the East from even before Independence, disenfranchisement of a segment of Tamils who contributed to the prosperity of this country, foisting of the Sinhala language in areas which had a very miniscule presence of Sinhalese in 1956, militarization of the North when the Tamil-speaking people agitated against the discriminatory laws, standardization in higher education to prevent Tamils from entering higher echelons of education, staging of successive pogroms which killed and maimed many a Tamil including infants brutally killed and women raped, which sent their kith and kin abroad seeking better pastures, have all been transgressions committed by successive Sinhala majority Governments in terms of the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights - ICCPR - and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights - ICESC. The genocide in Mullivaikkal was a continuation of this process.

Still, such offences are being perpetrated in the North and the East. Land grabbing by government departments with the help of the military without conforming to proper land acquisition procedures in terms of the law, expropriation of resources of the North and the East through agents and hirelings, displacement of Tamils from their areas of traditional occupation, settlement of people from outside the North and East in those areas, depriving our fishermen from earning their livelihood in their traditional areas, holding over of 65,000 acres of State land in the Northern Province to house a massive military are all contrary to the provisions of those two Covenants. Many such activities still continue. Not wanting to recognize all these activities, calling upon us, the Representatives of the Tamils, to join him in furthering economic activities only goes to prove that these high-handed activities are certainly going to continue in the North and the East, maybe, with renewed vigour and vitality.

381 382

I call upon the International Community, including India, to take note of this state of affairs. The President calling upon the elected Representatives of the Tamils to sink their ideological differences to join him in economic activities raises many suspicions.

Our people have suffered greater economic difficulties in the past during and after the war. Yet, none of us relegated our political aspirations to a second place and promoted economic regeneration as our primary concern. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member)Hon. Member, please wind up. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Just give me one more minute, Madam.

Even during the past 12 years, our people have elected a majority of Representatives who stood for their political rights. But, not recognizing the aspirations of our people, the President has asked us to jettison our political claims and join him in economic activities. In other words, he wants us to act contrary to the aspirations of our people.

If the President and his Government are going to be serious in ushering in a period of peace and reconciliation, first and foremost they should immediately halt all actions and activities that are being systematically undertaken by the Archaeological Department, the Forest Department, the Department of Wildlife Conservation and some other departments with the sole objective of destroying the ethnic and cultural character and the demographic composition of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces, thereby prevaricate and rewrite history, abrogate the much-abused Prevention of Terrorism Act and free all Tamil-speaking political prisoners presently behind bars under the provisions of the draconian PTA.

There are the inescapable prerequisites for any meaningful reconciliation programme which could precede any constitutional process to draw up a new federal Constitution for our Democratic Socialist Republic.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member)Next, the Hon. (Mrs.) Diana Gamage. You have five minutes. [3.35 p.m.] ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Diana Gamage) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, for the time given to speak at this Debate.

First, I would like to start by saying a few words regarding what the Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran just mentioned. I think he is instigating a conflict which is not there anymore in this country. Yesterday, there was a delegate from the UK who met the President. In the past, no President had approached or even tried to have a dialogue with the Tamil diaspora. We need to solve this problem, but, Hon. Wigneswaran, I cannot see you helping us, trying to instigate problems with the Tamil people again and again. I think there should be an end to this. I think the Hon. President has taken steps to solve that and I know that definitely, he is going to solve this problem with the diaspora because he has initiated discussions with them at the moment. Anyway, that is that.

Then, moving on to this Debate on the Presidents Policy Statement made in Parliament, I must say that I cannot understand or comprehend the way the Members of the Opposition speak; they speak as if they have been born gain. Of course, they have sort of been born again, but I cannot understand the way they have been walking around the country, talking to each and every household and shop about the problems in the country. For Gods sake, we all know about the problems in the country and that we are in a crisis! The whole globe is going through this crisis, not only Sri Lanka; we cannot be exempted from it.
