Sir, I wish to thank you for giving me the opportunity to participate in this important Debate on the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill, 2023.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe - State Minister of Finance) , . ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , .

( ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed) Sir, Budget, 2023 titled Sri Lanka, Towards a New Beginning was presented by the Hon. President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his capacity as the Minister of Finance under extremely difficult circumstances.

This Budget introduces the concept of "a social market economy" or "an open economic system of social protection". This economy will be led by the private sector while the Government focuses on regulating economic activities, investing in infrastructure, correcting market failures, maintaining law and order, taking care of the poor and the vulnerable groups and ensuring equitable benefits for all sections of the society. Budget, 2023 is also bringing across a whole lot of new policy initiatives which are aimed at modernizing the economy, getting into a new growth path and doing some of the much-needed reforms that had been discussed for a long time, but which we actually did not see happening for many years. We see a lot of direction towards adopting new technologies, new practices and new ways of executing policies which have been brought forth in this Budget. As mentioned by the Hon. President in his Budget Speech, it is a common social agreement for economic management; it is a pact between the people, the Government and all segments of the society, including the business community, for collective action to take the economy into a new dimension. Furthermore, we are creating a new economy for the young people, for their tomorrow.

Before diving deep into the Budget Proposals, we need to take into consideration the context in which this Budget was presented. As we all know, the country has an unsustainable level of debt, our net foreign reserves

1025 1026

[ ]

2022 21

are negative, inflation is at an unprecedented high level of beyond 70 to 80 per cent and the economy is projected to contract this year, maybe, by 8 to 9 per cent and also in the next year, by 4 to 5 per cent. We also have interest rates at almost 30 per cent and tax income is at one of the lowest levels, around 8 per cent of GDP. So, basically, we are expecting a contraction in the economy in the next two years.

The Government is also in the middle of a debt restructuring exercise with creditors and with the help of the IMF, to bring back the debt to a sustainable level. So, primarily, the Government will have to provide some kind of assurance to the creditors and to the international community that we are taking necessary steps to get the economy back on track and bring back macroeconomic stabilization in the country. In all, Budget, 2023 has been formulated in this broader context. So, key priority, in terms of Budget, 2023,is on macroeconomic stabilization. That is the short-term objective. In the next year, basically, all efforts of the Government have to be on macroeconomic stabilization. What it means is that the Government has got to raise adequate revenue and rationalize expenditure in order to bring back debt to a sustainable level.

Sir, looking more at the policy actions that have been spelt out in the Budget, we see that there are many progressive initiatives put forward. In order to create an export-oriented competitive economy, we are looking at establishing a consolidated agency with the BOI, EDB, SLECIC and NEDA amalgamated. That is an important policy measure taken after looking at the roles played by those institutions in developing exports and promoting investments. So, those institutions' reaching out has become very important and the expenditure allocated will improve outreach marketing and reaching out to investors, which the BOI and the EDB critically need to do.

Another important Proposal for economic development and developing exports is the creation of new Economic Zones in the Western Province, the North-Western Province and in Hambantota and Trincomalee regions. When foreign investors come to Sri Lanka, especially those who focus on manufacturing industries, we need to have the zones ready and waiting to accommodate them within a very short span of time. Therefore, the Economic Zones need to be pre-prepared with utilities made available, the infrastructure in place, for connectivity, roadways developed et cetera. So, the availability of Economic Zones in such a state that they could immediately be made use of by investors is quite critical.

Then, having Free Trade Agreements - FTAs - with India, China, Thailand and Singapore has been encouraged, mentioning trading arrangements with Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership - RCEP. FTAs and market access we can offer to foreign investors would be quite critical when it comes to the important checklist they look at when they select a destination.

The need for new labour policies to be in tune with a modern and competitive economy has been rightfully recognized in this Budget. The Governments intention to release land to grow exportable agricultural crops has been made quite clear in the Budget, 2023. We know that the State is a huge landowner and therefore, releasing or making available some of those State-owned lands to the private sector for engaging in productive economic activities is quite important. The process of releasing those State-owned land would be quite important. The speed at which it could be done, enabling the signing up of -

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) If the Hon. Minister will make way, I would like to raise one issue. Hon. Minister, you spoke about forest land in making your speech. If you are willing to respond to this, please do. In your own District, in the District of Batticaloa, in Vakaneri area which belongs to the Oddamavadi DS Division, there is a large of amount of forest land being cleared and used as a sand dumping yard. Your Colleague behind you is also responsible for some of that. It is being used as a sand dumping yard. Hon. Minister, you are the Minister in charge of environment. Could you take necessary action on that?

( ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed) Sir, wherever illegal activities take place, action is already being taken. The supervising committee is in the process of taking necessary legal action.

Now, let me continue with my speech, Sir. The process of releasing those State-owned lands would be quite important. The signing up of agreements, giving those State land on lease basis and making them available for investors need to be speeded up.

Then, the Logistics Infrastructure Development Programme proposed will be a far-reaching policy initiative, given Sri Lankas location and the existing strength as a hub,

I will be failing in my duty as Minister of Environment if I did not speak about the Budget Proposals aiming at creating an environmentally-friendly green and blue economy. That is an encouraging development brought about on the back of COP27 with a lot of countries adopting those practices. Sri Lanka, too, can access the multitudes of green financing options available globally. That is something we, as a country,

1027 1028

have not explored adequately. The Central Bank has published its Green Finance Taxonomy, which will enable Green Financing Frameworks to be established. I congratulate the Hon. President for declaring, as a policy measure, that Sri Lanka should be exploring more sources of green and blue financing and monetizing some of the existing assets in this space to enable Sri Lanka to access more sources of finance.

In addition, concessions have been granted on solar energy panels, inverters, electric cars and so on. There was also mention of green hydrogen technology as well as of an International Climate Change University, which is an initiative of the Hon. President and which he spoke about at COP27.

Then, moving onto the quite a few Proposals on the development of a digital economy, I must say that they are very progressive. We only need to look at our immediate neighbour, India, to see how much of digitization has been adopted there. It can be used for government payment systems, social security systems, in many other areas of payments and in other citizens services. The introduction of the QR code for fuel distribution is the best example. Here too, we see that Sri Lanka is quite far behind with a lot of transactions of the Government still taking place on manual basis. Now, the policies, laws and reforms necessary for digitization are being put in place. Accordingly, government payments will be made online from March, 2024; the electronic scheme for food security as well as the payment of social security are all going to be done through digitized methods. These developments will make sure that people receive what they have to receive directly, speedily and without delays and wastage in the process of providing these different services and social security to the population.

Sir, let me also briefly analyse a few taxation policies in the Budget and justify how this Budget would contribute towards macroeconomic stabilization, which I mentioned at the beginning of my speech. Take the Proposals on tax reform and tax administration. Once again, we have to look at those Proposals on tax reform and tax administration in the current context of the economy. The Budget brings relief to the people on the taxation front and in that, there are no new taxes introduced, except for a few increases and concessions to the existing taxes. On the other hand, there are ambitious targets set in terms of collection of taxes and tax administration.

There are measures to improve tax administration with clear KPIs being introduced to revenue collecting agencies. Broadening of the tax base, bringing changes to the Tax Appeals Commission Act, introducing commercial hub operations, which now include bunkering services as a part of commercial hub operations, et cetera are futuristic tax reforms. Efficient collection of more revenue with a simple tax system is the idea behind the tax proposals. The best example is the recently introduced Social Security Contribution Levy. There is wide

criticism by the Opposition that the SSCL is a tax on the turnover, it has an inflationary effect and therefore, the Government should consider an increase in tax on value addition rather than introducing a tax on the turnover, which has a cascading effect. I must say that that interpretation is not entirely correct. Although the SSCL is a turnover-based tax having a cascading effect, it is a simple tax. If you go for Value Added Tax, again you have the input mechanism, refund issues et cetera.

On the other hand, a number of tax proposals introduced in the Budget, 2023 will help create investor confidence, positive market sentiments et cetera. For example, there were fears of additional taxes such as Wealth Tax, an increase in VAT, additional taxes on revenue et cetera, which came to rest with the announcement of the 2023 Budget Proposals ending uncertainty and speculation, which is a positive sign. Investors were on the sidelines for the past couple of weeks in anticipation of the Capital Gain Tax on the stock market. But, the absence of such a tax on the equity market will be viewed positively by the investors.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , .

( ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed) Sir, just give me a few minutes more.

In terms of investor sentiments, there was nothing related to securities. There was only a mention of reducing para-tariffs in the long-term, which is a good thing.

With regard to the taxation Proposals introduced, as Minister of Environment, I must congratulate the Hon. President. That is, for introducing a number of tax Proposals in line with creating an environmentally-friendly green and blue economy. Those tax Proposals are centred around encouraging the use of electric vehicles, and a few concessions have been granted accordingly. In addition, both the PAL and SSCL have been exempted on importation of solar panels and inverters.

During this Budget Debate, many references were made with regards to the revival of the tourism industry. For the last 36 months, the Government helped the tourism industry by providing moratoriums on the capital and loans, which really helped to sustain tourism businesses. During the last five to six months, the Government also assisted the tourism industry in the scarcity of fuel by introducing the fuel pass. So, in those situations, the Government has provided a lot of enablers. Criticisms are levelled by the Opposition with regard to the number of tourists arriving in the country. While I agree that the numbers are low, I must also emphasize

1029 1030

[ ]

2022 21

that the numbers are low not only in Sri Lanka, but even in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and so on.

Post-COVID revival has not been that quick. The key thing that Sri Lanka will have to do immediately is to correct its image. At the moment, many people overseas think that Sri Lankan people are still suffering, that we still have queues, we are like savages burning each others houses, people do not have food, they are starving et cetera. That is the image out there and unfortunately, the media, whenever they talk of Sri Lanka, keep playing the old footage. People overseas do not really listen, but instead, they watch those images and think that the situation in Sri Lanka is still bad.

We desperately need to correct that image and tell the world that Sri Lanka is fine now. That positive message needs to go out to the world for tourists to come in to this country. It is everyones responsibility and that is where the Opposition also can play a major role. I urge the Opposition to not to instigate people to agitate on roads and demonstrate mass protests on unjustifiable and politically motivated causes, which send out a wrong message to the international community. This is the time the Opposition also should act with restraint. Give the Hon. President time and space to drive the reforms and revive the economy.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , .

( ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed) Sir, just give me one more minute.

Another positive development in the Budget, 2023 in terms of the tourism industry is that it talks about new areas such as adventure tourism, sports tourism, marine tourism, ecotourism et cetera, which would help the people in the local areas. Most of the locals are very skilled and know their terrain very well. So, they can take tourists on hiking and attract them to engage in diving, water sports et cetera. In that sense, people in the rural areas will get economically benefited. With a little bit of guidance and training, such locals can be attracted to entertain tourists and make a living out of it.

In conclusion, I wish to congratulate the Hon. President Ranil Wickremesinghe for presenting an exemplary and a visionary Budget for 2023 with strong and far-reaching economic policy reforms with a follow-through plan of action.

It is the duty and responsibility of all of us, as Legislators, to stand with the people and support the people-friendly vision and mission of the Hon. President to take our nation in the path of progress. Therefore, I appeal to my fellow Parliamentarians to join this national cause and be proud contributors to its inevitable success.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Jayantha Weerasinghe, PC) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, first, I must thank you for giving me this opportunity to express my thoughts on this Budget. I will revert to Sinhala in a few minutes, but let me say this in English.

Everybody knows that we are in the worst part of an economic crisis that has occurred in our country. The solution to that is very well embodied in the current Budget. If you look at this Budget carefully, you can see that it is a development-oriented Budget and if it is properly put into practice, we can bring this country out of the present financial impasse.

If you look at the salient features of this Budget, you can see that the main theme is economic revival or Sri Lanka, Towards a New Beginning. It is very correct. The Hon. President proposed several measures to increase government revenue with the objective of moving away from costly monetary financing in the form of money printing to cover Government expenditure; what is proposed is a clear departure from that principle. That is what we should remember. This will also be supported by improved efficiency in public financing and measures for public sector reform.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam. You have 20 minutes.

[2.05 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, especially for not reducing my time, which is a very rare occurrence in this House.

Sir, when I chose to speak today, I actually did not realize that today marks the beginning of a week in the Tamil calendar, in which we commemorate the fallen heroes of the LTTE. That is a very controversial issue as far as this House is concerned. But, first, I pay my respects to them and then commence my speech.

It has been 14 years since the war came to an end, Sir, and if you ask the people of the North and the East, particularly the Tamils, whether they are in a better place than 14 years ago - I say this with respect and much responsibility - the answer would be "no". At the immediate aftermath of the war coming to an end, the Tamil people were actually confused because they supported an armed struggle, a struggle that caused a lot of destruction in their own economy, because of the hallowed idea of freedom and creating a separate State, there can be no doubt about that. But, when that struggle came to an end, their idea of freedom also came into question because the LTTE was portrayed as a very

strong military organization and it was spoken the world over that if such an organization and a struggle could, in fact, be brought to an end, whether the ideals for which that struggle stood for is achievable and whether the Tamil people must rethink.

There was a moment when the Tamil people were doing a soul-searching and asking themselves, "Were we not being practical in supporting a separate state and an armed struggle?" It is in that context, Sir, that every Member of this House and even those who are outside must look back and do some soul-searching and ask, "Fourteen years after the end of the war, if those very same people who were prepared to soul-search are saying today that they are in a worse place, is there not something radically wrong?" You can quite easily put off someone like us or quite easily put off the way the Tamil people are being treated in the North and the East as racism - we will just say like that - but if you ask that, not just from Tamils, but from other members of this Island, they will also tell you the same thing today, that they are far worse off. So, Sir, 14 years after the end of the war, when common sense ought to dictate that this country should have developed and moved forward by leaps and bounds, if we are today scraping the barrel to an extent that even at the height of the war this country never had to, then surely there is something radically wrong! This system is stinking! And if we do not realize it, at least, today and think anew, then, Sir, we are not going to get out of this mess.

Sri Lankas economic crisis did not commence two years ago with the former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa getting elected. Nor did it commence an arbitrary 10, 15 years ago. It actually commenced the moment majoritarian politics took root, where you chose to make enemies from within, to look at Sri Lanka as a country belonging only to the majority Sinhala-Buddhists and everybody else being hangers-on, you chose to privilege the entire State accordingly and created enemies. And when you create enemies of that nature, obviously your economy will have to be modelled in a way to contain those enemies. That is common sense. Even though at the time the British departed, Sri Lanka was being spoken of as a model newly independent country by countries such as Singapore, which were aspiring to follow Sri Lanka, today, it is a basket case. There is no war to hide that fact as this has nothing to do with the Tamil armed struggle; this has nothing to do with it. What it is, is that you chose enemies so that you can find scapegoats, you can ferment racism and use that as a scapegoat and rook the country, rook it for yourself and for your cronies.

Today, the Tamil people of the North and the East, who were discriminated on year after year and which led them to the frustration where they had to ultimately choose to even give up their lives to try and find freedom as a better option, are suffering the second time around. First and foremost, it was pure racism that targeted them; now, it is because of your complete inability to govern and complete selfishness with which you are prepared to rook the country so that you can line your own pockets, the Tamils are suffering again. Is this not completely unacceptable? What will a person from the North and the

1073 1074

2022 21

East, who was willing to sacrifice his life, say today? Would his choice actually not be doubled and be more relevant to say that actually a separate State is the only way out? Is this the projection that you want after you brought the war to an end?

President Ranil Wickremesinghe and President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, in my view, Sir, are different from the average Sinhala-Buddhist nationalist politicians. They have a capacity to move beyond that; they have the qualifications to move beyond that as well, but they did not. President Kumaratunga was probably the first President who openly spoke about federalism and got an unprecedented mandate of over 60 per cent, which is still not matched. So, the ordinary Sinhalese people are not opposed to it. President Kumaratunga got elected on federalism and her choosing not to do it is a different matter. Likewise, President Ranil Wickremesinghe knows more than anyone else in the House that a federal solution is the only solution which will make this country prosper, prosper because you can cut down on defence and because every cent that you allocate for defence in a scenario where there is no war is literally burning money which you cannot afford. But, he is not prepared to do it nor is he prepared to speak the truth and that is the problem we have with him.

When he became Prime Minister in 2001, Sir, I was a young Member of Parliament; I had just got elected. Of course, he did not speak about federalism, but he did say many things including signing a Ceasefire Agreement with the LTTE, which, at that time, we supported. We went out of our way to protect him. When President Kumaratunga was being extremely hostile, we went out of our way to protect him. So, as a young Member of Parliament who got elected to this House for the first time when he was Prime Minister and who had been following his politics and his policies closely, I had not doubts, Sir, as I say that he is probably the most experienced person to be in power to handle the present economic crisis, that he is also probably the most experienced person who would tell you that there is nothing wrong with federalism. Well, he should not hesitate to say that to the Sinhalese people. Federalism is not separation, but quite on the contrary, federalism in this country would, in fact, ultimately result in unifying the county, a country that has been divided from the time the British left, not because of the British, but because of the decisions taken in this own House.

So, at a time when Sri Lanka has hit rock-bottom, is it not the time, at least, now for a President who has nothing to lose - I mean, he has already lost; he has become President by losing and therefore, he has nothing to lose more - at least in the last days of his political career to be a statesman and tell the truth, the truth that will ultimately be a legacy and the foundation for a new beginning of this country? But, he is not doing that, Sir. And, it is for that reason, when he made an impromptu or rather an unspecified speech soon after he got back from COP27, the Conference on Climate Change, inviting the Tamil Parties, that our party took up the position that there is nothing to speak with the President; he knows what the solution is.

He, who belongs to the Sinhala community, knows more than anyone else in this House what exactly he has to do to find a solution and as a basis for that beginning, at least, he must be honest to the Sinhalese people and say, Look, if we want to solve the ethnic problem, then we have to go down the federal path and it is only by solving the ethnic problem that we can afford to refinance the country in a way that will do away with this ridiculous expenditure on defence and other related matters and it is only through that that we can actually invest in the future of the generations to come and in our health, both of which are suffering". So, our partys position, Sir, has been and continues to be that these Debates regarding the annual Budget and the economy become meaningless unless you are fundamentally prepared to change the Sri Lankan State. If you do not have that vision, you are going to continue to waste money, waste it because of your ignorance or even worse, because you have vested interests.

As I said, for the first 75 years of this country, you have been finding scapegoats to line your own pockets. Whether you are going to carry on that path for a further 75 years, you can decide. But then, you cannot expect us to be a party to that. Sir, we have suffered enough! Surely, you cannot expect the new generation of Tamils, who have seen their brothers and sisters abroad doing tremendously well and whose income is more than this countrys income, to just simply sit and say, "look, we will take a little bit more for another 75 years or so". No! If you do not, at least, now rethink not only for your own people but also for us, we are not going to just simply sit and watch. We will make it a very expensive, wrong choice for you. We will, Sir; we have no other choice. That means, you will have to spend much more on defence. Is that what you want?

Today, not a single Member in this House is talking about a separate State, but you are spending more on defence; you are increasing the allocation. I believe this time, the defence allocation is 14 per cent more than the last time. It is your insecurities that will result in you pulling this country down further and further. Why? Because of racism and at best, because of ignorance. So, we will not be a party to it. Maybe, Members of this House will come and tell you something else, but the people on the ground are not going to just go on this way. Today, it is only the Tamils, but, God forbid, with the way you are treating the Muslims and the upcountry Tamils, they will also decide the same thing and God forbid, the poor people of this country, the ordinary Sinhalese people whom you have rooked and who are ultimately paying today, will also rethink. Then, you will have a totally different scenario to deal with, something very similar to what you had in the 80s. So, it is in that context, Sir, that we approach this Debate on the Budget.

Sir, I would choose to speak more detailedly on Votes of the Ministries at the Committee Stage Discussion, but as far as the policies are concerned, I will repeat what I have been repeating in the two previous Budgets. The North-East is a war-affected zone; almost 15 years after

1075 1076

the war, it still remains a war-affected zone. The President had visited the Northern Province over the last two days - he was in Vavuniya and Mannar - and he knows that; he, more than anybody else, knows that. That means, you cannot pretend as if the war-affected North-East can be treated on an equal footing with the rest of the country. So, we have been saying that if those people of the North-East are to, in some way, rebuild their lives, at the very least economically and not to fall even further down the precipice, then the North-East has to be declared a war-affected zone and there must be some protectionist measures applied so that the economy of the people can first be protected and then, be allowed to grow to a point where it can compete on an equal footing with the rest of the country. We have been repeatedly asking that this be done even before we became Members of this House two years ago and when the war came to an end. If ever President Wickremesinghe wishes to go back and see our critiques with regard to the annual Budgets, he would see that we have been repeatedly saying that it is a must. And Today, more than ever before, it is a must because the economy in the country is suffering, the ordinary people across the country are suffering and the average person in the North-East is suffering ten times over. Ten times over, at least. If there is no diaspora, Sir, those people would have died of starvation during COVID and especially now, with the economic crisis. So, you cannot allow this to persist. And, it is on that basis that I wish to reiterate yet again that if this country is to genuinely get out of this economic crisis, firstly, the ethnic conflict has to be resolved.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is up. Please wind up your speech.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I am finishing, Sir.

Also, if the problems of all others, be it the Muslims, the upcountry Tamils or the workers, are not resolved in one go and a holistic approach is not taken, this country will bleed. We are already a failed State and we will be a totally bleeding failed State, Sir. So, as a more immediate effect, the President must, as I said towards the end, consider, in principle, protecting the economy of the North-East and declaring it a war-affected zone.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 14 .
