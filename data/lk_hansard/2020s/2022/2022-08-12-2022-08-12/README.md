I thank you, Hon. Speaker, for the time given. I want to reiterate the fact that we still have an opportunity. It is the obligation and the responsibility of all political leaders to find a way out.

. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 6 . [1.10 p.m.] ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Diana Gamage) Hon. Presiding Member, I will try to conclude within that time. Anyway, thank you for the opportunity provided.

Sir, we are participating in the Debate on the Policy Statement made by the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe. I would like to mention that there are some very important points in his Policy Statement that we should take very much into consideration. We know that the country, at the moment, is in a critical situation economically as well as politically. I do not know whether we will ever be able to get into some sort of agreement with all the Opposition parties to form an all-party Government. The IMF requests that we first have a stable country and a stable Government, if we are to go ahead with anything further.

Anyway, talking about it, as citizens of this country, it is our duty and responsibility to contribute to get ourselves out of this crisis situation because we are a broken nation today. We all need to get together and build up this broken nation again. What I would like to say is, this issue has not been brought about within the last two years, but it is something which has been going on for quite a while, for decades, and there have been a few reasons for it: malpractices, inefficiency, corruption, wrong decisions, not taking the right decisions at the right time and incompetence. Corruption has been there for the last so many decades in this country since we got Independence in 1948. So, I would like to say that that is something we have to work on with transparency, which,

353 354

2022 12

I think, President Ranil Wickremesinghe is planning to do. I wish him all the best and good luck in trying to do that because that is one very important requirement that the IMF wants us to fulfill. Also, Sir, I think we need to increase the tax rate up to 15 per cent, which rate any country in the world obviously requires to carry on. So, those are some of the issues we have.

Then, I also would like to talk about another burden on this country: the SriLankan Airlines, our national carrier, which has incurred billions of losses. It is a huge burden on the Government. Therefore, it is time to seriously consider going into some sort of privatization of our national carrier, which has, unfortunately, incurred losses because of the malpractices and inefficiency in carrying out its duties.

All the speakers from both sides are not getting the time that has originally been allocated. So, is it not better for you to speak to the Leader of the House and get a half an hour extension at the end so that every speaker will get their stipulated time? Otherwise, it will come down to eight, seven, five, four and at the end, even to two minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Some of the speakers are not going to speak. So, I think we can reallocate time. Thank you for your contribution. Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera, please commence your speech. You have eight minutes. [.. 1.28] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon.

. . . ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . , . ? ( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) . ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . , .. ! 13 ; you have 13 minutes. [2.46 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, I was told that I have 14 minutes.

Anyway, I thank you, Sir, for allocating me some time to speak on the Policy Statement made by the President. I would like to go straight into the substantive concerns that we have with regard to that Statement. As you know, Sir, the President, in that Statement, refers to the North-East in one instance, merely one paragraph towards the end of his speech. He says this. I quote: It is also essential to provide a political solution to the issues faced by the Tamil community for a long time. They are suffering with many social and economic issues due to the hardships of war. There are many land issues that need to be resolved. We have to think anew about the development tasks in the North. We expect to get the support of the Sri Lankan Tamils living abroad by closely working with them on the programme of rebuilding Sri Lanka. We look forward to their visits and investments in their motherland.

That is the only specific reference the President has made to the Tamils of the North-East.

Why I want to start my comments with that specific reference is this. Not too long ago, in the year 2001, when there was a General Election and the UNF at that time got a majority in Parliament, the Hon. Wickremesinghe was appointed Prime Minister. President Kumaratunga was remaining as President and with the UNF having a majority in Parliament, he was appointed Prime Minister. He went on to sign a Ceasefire Agreement with the LTTE and the so-called peace process commenced. In the course

of those negotiations, what was known as the Oslo Communiqu came out. Sir, you yourself will remember it very correctly. At that time, I think it was your previous incarnation, where you were working at the Berghof Foundation when I first met you. When those negotiations commenced and the Oslo Communiqu came out, there was a huge gap, Sir, between what was stated in that Communiqu and what was actually happening on the ground. That was the concern of not just the LTTE, but also of the TNA, to which I used to belong at that time. Whilst you had a Government which said it was prepared to explore federalism, which is what the Hon. Wickremesinghe signed up to, on the ground, he was doing the complete opposite. There was absolutely no movement; if you were, in fact, prepared to consider federalism and you were serious about it, on the ground, there was absolutely no movement towards normalization. There was a very convenient narrative about a hostile President being thrown at us at every turn, but when it came to realities on the ground, there was absolutely nothing to suggest that there was a genuine change in the hearts of the Government and the State to transform Sri Lanka into a federal State. If there was, and if we, in fact, felt that there was that genuine change, things would have been very different. But, of course, as always, the narrative was very different. The convenient scapegoat became the LTTE and by extension, the Tamils; it was the Tamils who were never sincere to federalism. That was the narrative sold not just to the Sinhalese people, but to the whole world, that it is the Tamils who were not sincere, they were only interested in a separate State and nothing else and therefore, a military option was the only option. That was what we were told. At that time, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe could have got away with it by saying there was a hostile President, a hostile Parliament and therefore, he could not do much.

But today, those tables have turned. Today, President Ranil Wickremesinghe holds this entire House and may I say, the entire country at his fingertips by becoming the President, the all-important President. A vast majority of this House - certainly not our party and there may be a couple of others, but everyone else here - is prepared to work with him; he has the backing of the entire House. It is a House which has, since 2020, destroyed the country. So, it depends on the Hon. Wickremesinghe, the President, to bail them out. People do not want this House; people want this House dissolved. They want an election; they want a fresh mandate. So, it is this House which totally depends on President Wickremesinghe. If the Hon. Wickremesinghe was genuine about the Oslo Communique' that he signed up to then, he could make the case today. He could make the case to this House and through this House, to the whole country and say, Look, the Tamils have been wronged. Their rights must be granted". Federalism does not mean cessation; federalism does not mean separation. On the contrary, federalism is probably the best way not only in securing democracy, in securing good governance, but certainly also in holding people to account, holding this House to account because you would have so many administrations right through the country which would create genuine leaders at those levels, who could be a good example, good competition

387 388

so that even Members of this House have to live up to certain expectations and standards. So, you all could make the case right now if you were genuine about the policies that you signed up to in 2002 and 2003. But, unfortunately, the Hon. Wickremesinghe does not say a word of it and on the contrary, he calls himself a Sri Lankan and wants a Sri Lankan identity, where he says something somewhat worrying. His notion of a Sri Lankan identity, Sir, is one of not having different identities. He calls the different identities "divisions". He wants us to forget our differences. He feels that differences are weakening Sri Lanka. So, surely, Sir, what the then Prime Minister Wickremesinghe signed up to in 2001, 2002 and what he is now saying as the all-powerful President are two opposites; they both cannot be true. So, which one is the genuine Wickremesinghe? And here, Sir, I tell the Members of this House that there is a massive credibility issue the Tamils will keep raising.

At the end of the day, Sir, the Hon. Wickremesinghe must reflect on how he came to be the President of this country. He must reflect on the struggle which, at times, turned violent, yes. He calls it terrorism. He did not call it terrorism when he was seated in the Opposition benches. On the contrary, he repeatedly said that the peoples struggle must be protected. Once before also, Sir, in a speech I made, I said when a protest is done in the most non-violent and democratic way, when the whole country makes the point that change is required and when that change does not happen, at some point, frustration will creep in and naturally, that peoples protest conducted democratically will change and will change into violence. Why? Because the very nature of the protest was to call back a mandate they had given and the whole world knows that the people have, in fact, called back that mandate. If they had not called back that mandate and if this House did not believe that they had not called back that mandate, former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa need not have resigned. So, the people have called back the mandate. They are asking that you have an election so that they could have a fresh mandate and confidence in this House, but you choose not to do it. Instead, you all manipulated the situation where, today, you have the Hon. Wickremesinghe rising up to the Presidency, and then for him to call the method by which he rose to Presidency as terrorism and violence, Sir, is just not on. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I am winding up, Sir. But, I was told that I have 14 minutes.

The only reason why he could say that is because he is still totally indebted to the Members opposite; he depends entirely on the SLPP. He depends entirely on the undemocratic verdict this Parliament gives today and

therefore, he has to satisfy them. The only way he can satisfy them is by making sure that the peoples voices are reduced to naught; that is what he is doing. And it is for that reason, Sir, till such time the President withdraws the state of Emergency and releases everybody taken into custody that we believe the all-party Government he talks of is nothing but to sustain his own power.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 6 . [.. 3.00] ( ) (The Hon. Sanjeeva Edirimanna) , .

Hon. Presiding Member, at the very outset, before coming to my comments on the Presidents Throne Speech to Parliament, I would like to remind the House of

some matters which I have brought to his notice when he met us as party leaders at separate meetings he had been conducting for the last few days regarding the all-party Government and the all types of suggestions he had made.

I would like to refer the attention of this House to the sufferings of the people, particularly to that of both the fishermen in the coastal areas of the country as well as the farmers when it comes to the harvest of the Yala season. I was in the Eastern Province a few days ago. Now, the harvest is on in those areas and for the harvesting machines to operate, we need diesel. As a matter of fact, for the Ampara District, almost 400,000 litres of diesel are necessary whereas only 100,000 litres have been issued. This has resulted in the entire harvest getting destroyed unless diesel is made available almost immediately. So, I would like to bring to the attention of the Hon. Minister the urgent need to supply diesel for the purpose of harvesting. On top of that, elephants are already roaming the area, destroying the crops. The country is also talking about a food shortage in the future. So, it is absolutely necessary for us to attend to this particular issue and I would urge the Hon. Minister in charge of energy and petroleum to kindly look at it and make sure that the balance 300,000 litres of diesel necessary for harvesting are supplied without any further delay.

With that highlighted, I would also like to bring to the notice of the same Minister the requirement of kerosene for the purposes of the fishermen in those areas. Today, kerosene is sold at almost Rs. 80 per litre, whereas it is now sold in the black market for almost Rs. 1,200 per litre. For a fisherman to go out in his boat for fishing, per day, he requires about 40 litres. As a result, they are now compelled to buy kerosene from the black market at very exorbitant prices and therefore, it is absolutely necessary that a sufficient amount of kerosene is made available to the fishermen in those coastal areas of the country. I had been visiting some of those areas recently, particularly Oluvil and Kalmunai, where that issue had been brought to my notice. I have brought it to the attention of the Hon. President as well when we met him a few days ago and I would like that to be given urgent attention and also the issues of the fishermen and the farmers be attended to without any further delay.

Sir, having said that, I must congratulate the President on his election through this House to be the President of this country. Though we did not support him, we did see several laudable aspects in his speech, regarding which the entire country is quite satisfied with. But, however, before coming to certain criticisms regarding the conduct of the Government under his leadership, I would like to refer to this part of his Policy Statement. I quote:

Ever since I entered into politics, I wanted to create a society with a Sri Lankan identity without these divisions. To create a nation where we can live in harmony as children of one mother. I suffered political defeats due to regular engagement in this exercise. It was criticized by extremists because of my continued stand against racism and bigotry; some political parties slandered me as a racist.

However, I did not deviate from my principle. I will not deviate from that policy.

That is a matter regarding which I also would vouch, that the President, when it comes to racism and bigotry, had never been on their side. Therefore, I am sure that those who supported him must be finding him to be a very strange bedfellow because he is surrounded by people who have been subscribing to this type of racism and bigotry. The appointed Presidential Task Forces headed by Buddhist priests were supposed to be exercised in the same bigotry. In fact, I referred to the matter of Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thero and his Chairmanship of the "One Country - One Law" Presidential Task Force. Similarly, there was another Task Force appointed to look at the dangers posed to the archaeological sites in the Eastern Province, as if only the Eastern Province has archaeological sites which are in danger of being encroached. That particular Task Force did not have a single member from any minority community; it was packed with majority community people. And such was the actions of the former President. None of us want that type of suffering to befall upon one of our Heads of State, but he had turned a blind eye to many of our very earnest pleadings regarding those matters. Similarly, even the issue of COVID-19 was used to demonize the Muslims. What happened to them, I do not want to recount, but we have spoken ad nauseam in this House about the sufferings that we had to undergo as a result of bigotry and the racist policies of that regime, which has now been somewhat replaced at least nominally or to which a symbolic change has happened. So, I hope the Hon. President will be allowed the freedom to implement the policies and programmes he has so laudably laid out in his Throne Speech.

Having congratulated him on that, let me also move on to another important matter. I would like to talk about a serious issue in the Nawalapitiya area: the floods that have affected many thousands of people with almost 700 families being displaced and almost 100 odd families losing their houses. They have to be found alternate housing facilities. In fact, I had a meeting with the Divisional Secretary of Nawalapitiya. The Hon. Velu Kumar accompanied me to see some of those areas. Labuwalkotuwa in Nawalapitiya is totally destroyed; almost 100 houses have totally gone under water. This has happened every year repeatedly for the last five years. Every year, during the monsoon season, those areas have been inundated. Sir, there is Al-Azhar Muslim Vidyalaya at Selam Bridge. Water has risen virtually up to the roof level of two buildings of that school and children were unable to use those buildings for several months after the floods. This has happened repeatedly for five years. Therefore, it is an absolute necessity that we provide some alternate school buildings as well as housing facilities for them. In fact, when I met the President, I appealed him to make a visit to those areas and see the inundation the floods have caused. Sivasamy Thottam, Owita, Mahakumbura and Jayasundaragama are all areas which have been seriously affected by the floods and hundreds of people have been displaced and their houses have also been destroyed. Though some normalcy has returned, it is important now for the Divisional Secretary to identify some State land to provide the necessary habitation for them and to find alternate accommodation. So, I have brought that matter to the attention of the Hon. President.

Finally, I would like to just refer to a very irresponsible allegation that has been made against the President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, Mr. Saliya Pieris. He is the President of all the lawyers. There are several lawyers in this Chamber too. Today, I saw several Members of the Government, including the Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana, a Member whom I respect - I was surprised to hear him do that - making allegations against Mr. Saliya Pieris. In fact, the Hon. (Dr.) Pathirana did not refer to him by name, but his reference was quite obvious, saying that he had gone down to the South to defend some drug convict. As a lawyer, when you represent a client, there is a presumption of innocence of the suspect. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, Your time is over. Thank you for your contribution. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, all these people have unnecessarily got disturbed by the courageous stand the Bar Association of Sri Lanka has taken when the protests came up. There is a right for people to protest. Looking at the manner in which oppression was taking place, people had their legal right to get up and do what they did, and the Bar Association of Sri Lanka acted very responsibly and that should go down in history of the Bar Association. Therefore, after listening to the criticisms - I heard the Hon. Rohitha Abeygunawardhana also doing the same thing - levelled against the President of the Bar Association, I would like to correct that position. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you, Hon. Member.
