, . , , . , . , , , ; that is the last word. If you want to question the Hon. Speakers Order, you have to do it by way of a No-Confidence Moton, not by keeping on questioning it. We all agree that orders in Parliament are given by the Hon. Speaker. Those cannot be questioned. You all told us that when we were in the Opposition. Now, you all are in the Opposition and have forgotten what you all stated in the House. Whether we accept it or not, the Speakers order stands as the last order. , , . , . , . . .

[2.27 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, of my 20 minutes - I do not think I will take all of it - if there would be any time remaining, I would be grateful if you would give it to the Hon. Dharmalingam Sithadthan.

Sir, we are debating today the Ministerial Statement made by the Hon. Minister of Finance after his discussions with the IMF. In that Statement, he went on to list a number of mistakes made. In fact, he admitted to a number of mistakes that his Government had made, which also contributed to the current state of the countys economy. Of course, he naturally tried to make out that the sole responsibility of this was not on this Government, but also on the consecutive Governments that had been in office and the various wrong, populist decisions each of those Governments had pursued ultimately brought us to this situation. But, one matter that no one can deny, Sir, - in fact, he himself admitted - is the fact that there were tax reductions, tax cuts which were decided upon as soon as the Presidential Election was over, and in fact, that decision precipitated the present circumstances. I do not think anybody in this House can deny that as a reason for the current state of affairs, whilst most certainly, this country has been plagued with debt to a point that it is strangling. But, for the economy to be scraping the barrel in the way that it does, it has to be from the tax cuts and basically, the shrinking of the taxpayers percentage. That was, without any exaggeration, the reason why Sri Lanka was downgraded, literally resulting in shutting Sri Lanka from the international markets to raise loans, and we are here today.

These decisions, Sir, were taken despite the Members of the Opposition - in fact, all the Members of the Opposition, of whichever party that sits in the Opposition - warning that those were decisions which would eventually lead to severe financial consequences that the country and the people as a whole would be asked to put up with and that, given the COVID-19 situation, it would be crippling. But, no one listened. I remember, after the

907 908

(8th start)

Presidential Election when those decisions were taken - at that time a Parliamentary Election was called for, but could not be held; it was being postponed due to the COVID-19 situation - the Members of the then Opposition - we were not in Parliament then - including Members from the North and the East warned the Government repeatedly, saying that these decisions would have dire consequences, but obviously the Government and the President in particular, considering the margins of his victory, being intoxicated by his popular swing chose not to listen to anybody. The business community and leading economists wrote letters to him. I can responsibly say that those letters written to him were not even replied. So, that is the

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

fashion with which the President himself conducted affairs and his Government in Parliament chose to blindly support everything he did.

So, when that situation is the reality, when, today, the ordinary people who are facing the brunt of this crisis have realized what a mistake they have made, where the country has been bankrupted primarily by the decisions precipitated by the President and this Government, when people are saying that those can no longer serve in the Government, that they must go and when the Government chooses not to listen, when the President chooses not to listen, then, obviously, they have no choice but to express their displeasure in some other democratic way and that is what they are doing: they are on the streets. In a democracy, when you have given a mandate, let us say, for five years and when you find that your mandate has been completely violated, usurped, that you have been defrauded, then the only way you can try and rectify that situation is by calling back your mandate. When you do not have a legal provision to call back your mandate, then the only other way is to get on to the streets and make sure that those you have given that mandate to, in fact, leave and that is what the people are doing today.

When that is happening, we are, here in Parliament, carrying on a drama. What is that drama? The reality, Sir, is that this House is redundant; this House no longer represents the will of the people and in order to try and pretend that there is some sort of credibility, you have a drama that is being enacted. What is that drama? That is, some Members belonging to the Government, who created the two-thirds majority until about three or four weeks ago and who were the strongest allies of the President and this Government, blindly supporting, violently supporting - if their words can be put into physical practise, then that is violence; that is the nature with which they backed the President and the Government - them, all of a sudden decided that they wanted to sit in the Opposition. One month ago, Sir, on this very Floor, soon after the so-called Members announced that they were going to be independent, when I spoke, I told the Members of this House that it is a drama, that it is not going to be the case.

The Hon. Jagath Pushpakumara, who spoke just before me, is a Member seated in the Opposition today. But, everything he said was to ensure that this Government continues. What did he say? What is the logic he put forward? The first thing he said was that there is no point in bringing a No-Confidence Motion against the President, that the only way by which you can force the President to quit is by bringing in an Impeachment Motion and for that, you need a two-thirds majority and that is not practical. This is a Member sitting in the Opposition and he was saying, "It is not practical and therefore, do not waste time. You have not brought in an Impeachment Motion. A No-Confidence Motion against the President does not have a legal value. So, that is a lie, it is a hoax, it is just to try and fool the people".

Then what is the next step? If you can bring in a No-Confidence Motion that can succeed and that will have legal consequence, it is a No-Confidence Motion against the Government.

What was he saying for that? Oh, you bring in a No-Confidence Motion against the Government, but we cannot accept it now. The SJB has to tell us what their second plan is, what they are going to do after that. So, until the SJB tells us what they are going to do, until they tell us all the details, we are not going to support it. That is very convenient! Then, why did you cross over to the Opposition? What are you saying? If you read between the lines, it is that this present situation must continue, that it must continue without the people having their say.

Sir, one month ago, I said that this impasse can only be solved by an election. Until you have an election and until people feel confident in the Members of this House, they are not going to leave the streets. Today, the Opposition, the combined Opposition, has a challenge and what is that challenge? The challenge is that we must, on the one hand, try to somehow help with the economy with the very same people who bankrupted this country! And, two-thirds of them being Members of this House, any Member or any party that wants to, in some way, try and rectify this situation has to be in cahoots with almost half of that two-thirds. You are not going to have a majority in this House without, at least, half of the Members who are culpable for bankrupting this country being part of your own Government supporting you. So, how on earth can you govern? You cannot, Sir, without having an election and that is the priority. For as long as you postpone an election, the political crisis that currently prevails will become far worse. Riots will pursue because this House will be seen as not standing to the will of the people and something that would totally be discredited.

When riots take place, what is going to happen? We have a President even today who takes great pleasure in appointing army personnel as Secretaries to Ministries. What is going to happen when riots take place? When the people who have decided to talk go further because their voices are not being listened to, what are you going to do? You are going to unleash the military. That is what is going to happen. That is what this President and this Government is gearing for, Sir, because there cannot be

909 910

[ .. ]

2022 6

any other reason. So, if every single Member seated opposite wants to maintain their political credibility, the only way they can do it under the present circumstances is to support the dissolution of Parliament. Give us the support for that two-thirds majority so that we can go and tell the President to hold a Parliamentary Election. And, I say that you need a Parliamentary Election because even if the President resigns for whatever reasons tomorrow, this House will be asked to elect a new President. How can this House be asked to elect a new President when this House itself is totally redundant? So, that is my partys considered view, Sir, and we will certainly give our fullest support to that. We challenge the Members opposite, we challenge Members like the Hon. Jagath Pushpakumara who just spoke, if you are credible, let us bring in a Motion to dissolve Parliament and raise that two-thirds majority and if you can do that, you can also impeach. But, if you do not do that, all those who do not support that will be held culpable and also accountable.

Sir, the Leader of the Opposition, this morning, has tweeted that there has to be a system change and I presume what he meant by that is a radical change in the entirety of the system because this system has failed. Well, the Tamil political parties seated in the Opposition have always been saying, not just in this Parliament but in every single Parliament for the last 70 odd years, that this system you have is not going to work because it is a system that is rejected by a part of the citizenry of this country.

The Tamils have rejected this system; increasingly, you will find the Muslims also rejecting it. As long as the Government of the day, in the name of security, in the name of Sinhala Buddhism or in the name of whatever fancies you have, targets you as enemies, this system cannot protect.

For various reasons, this system has failed and if that system is to change, what is that change? The Hon. Sajith Premadasa, the Leader of the Opposition, a couple of weeks ago, to the great disappointment of our party and as well as mine, said that he is going to implement the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. What is the implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution? How are you going to implement it? The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution has been in force for the last 34 years. Are you going to do something that you have not done in those last 34 years? You cannot implement the so-called Thirteenth Amendment because it is within the Unitary State structure. So, for as long as you remain within the Unitary State structure, you cannot devolve power. Everyone knows that. The Supreme Court has ruled, not once, but over 30 times, upholding that principle. So, you cannot implement the Thirteenth Amendment and be sincere to devolution. You have to change the system and what is that change? You have to move away from the unitary Constitution.

Now, I am raising this issue, Sir, in this Debate with regard to the negotiations with the IMF and the political-financial crisis for a reason. For the first time - I have said this a number of times in this House - I see an opportunity for the reason that the Sinhalese people today do not trust their own leaders. I do not say it as a boasting

phenomenon or something I feel happy about, but it is an important situation: they feel their own leaders have destroyed their country. Today, there is no war. In the last 13 years, when this country could have gone from strength to strength, it has not. You have, in fact, gone from pitfall to pitfall and today, you are bankrupt. So, for the first time, when they are questioning their leaders and they are angry with their leaders for the decisions they have taken, why I say there is a golden opportunity is this. We are asking the ordinary Sinhalese people if their own leaders have brought them to this level, have lied to them and destroyed this country in the way they have in front of their own eyes, just imagine what they have been telling them about the Tamils, just imagine what they have been telling about what the Tamils stand for. When we say, We are for a federal State, these Sinhalese leaders, without batting an eyelid, continue to lie even today and say that federalism is separation. So, ask those questions because those are the lies that have destroyed you.

Today, this country is spending almost 19 per cent on defence; 13 per cent of your annual Budget directly goes for the military and that is supposed to increase by 2 per cent every year. That is the nature of the military you have created. This is after the war, military expenses at its highest, even more than during the war. What you spend for healthcare and education is less than 10 per cent! How can you justify that? Is this sustainable? But, despite the fact that this countrys economy has been destroyed and you really have to go begging to people whom you considered your enemies like India, even today, not a word is being spoken about the ridiculous way in which the military and defence expenditure are being maintained.

Why is that? These are the questions that the ordinary Sinhalese people must ask themselves. If they can be lied to in front of their own eyes in the way they have been, just imagine the lies that these leaders have told about the Tamils, about what the Tamils are asking for. And, if they do not ask those questions, if they do not make the right decisions at that election we say must happen, then nothing can save this country, Sir, and as far as I am concerned, that will be the last chance. When my father was assassinated by the Chandrika Kumaratunga Government, Sir, the members of my family who had settled abroad asked me and my family, my mother and my sister, to declare asylum and come abroad. But, despite the fact that my father was assassinated, despite all the evidence to say that this system is not going to be changed, something in me said that it is the leaders who are at fault, that the Sinhalese people have not been told the truth and that one day, if they could actually have an opportunity to know the truth, they might take the right decision. That moment I thought of then has come. And at this opportunity, this moment, if the Sinhalese people do not open their eyes, do not accept the fact that Sri Lanka is not just for Sinhala Buddhists, but it is also for the Tamils, the Muslims, the up-country Tamils and the Burghers, do not change the system accordingly to recognize that there is the Sinhala-speaking nation and the Tamil-speaking nation in this country and do not change that system to one of a federal nature, then this country would fail.

911 912

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) It will fail because you will have to continue your defence expenditure; it will fail because a newer diaspora, a newer Tamil society, a more modern society will find modern ways of trying to undermine the State because they consider the State as the entity which is against them, against their right. We can say that all this while it was the leaders, but today, when the Sinhalese people themselves have realized that they have been hoodwinked, they have been lied to, they have been defrauded by their own leaders, there is no way they can now turn round and say that the Tamils have not been wronged. If they are, in fact, going to turn round and say that the Tamils have not been wronged, then there is a racist agenda. Sir, as an individual who was born and bred in Colombo, in the South, and as an individual who has Sinhalese Buddhists as some of my closest friends, with whom I have a lot of closeness, I sincerely hope that that last -

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is up. Thank you.

[2.50 p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya - State Minister of Foreign Affairs) Hon. Presiding Member, we are discussing the Ministerial Statement made by the Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry regarding the current economic situation and also pertaining to his visit to the IMF.

Sir, at the outset, let me congratulate my Friend, the Hon. Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam, on his speech. I think he made very valid points. I certainly agree with him that we really need to look at how the country is being governed and if a new Constitution is in order, we can look at having one, but I also do believe that we need to work within the framework of the existing Constitution, if we are to look at constitutional changes. The core of his speech was on federalism and I do believe that devolution of power is a necessity. I had been a Member of the Provincial Council in which you also served and I think we need to devolve power in steps or in stages. We also need to understand that there is mistrust between communities, particularly between the Tamils and the Sinhalese. To devolution of power, I do agree, but we need to do it in stages and I think that is something we should seriously look at.

Then, I want to speak in general about the current situation in the country, Sir. I am not one to give advice, but I do think that there is a responsibility on Members of Parliament and the Speaker regarding how we conduct ourselves. We saw in the morning that we do not pay any attention to the Standing Orders and Parliamentary traditions and that we only want to make sure that our voices are heard without any courtesy to other Members who want to express their views. So, I certainly believe that the country, at this juncture, needs some discipline and that discipline should first come from Parliament itself.

Sir, pertaining to the current situation, the Foreign Ministry, under the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, has embarked on and been working with the Ministry of Finance to see how best we could get the country out of this situation. We have approached friendly countries bilaterally, seeking help in bridging finance and assistance to provide medicine and other necessities, of which a shortage prevails. We have also reached out to multilateral organizations and friendly countries. There is the process of SDRs - Special Drawing Rights. We understand that if some countries have excess SDRs, certain other countries might be able to utilize those SDRs. Yesterday, I had a meeting with the Hon. Janaka Wakkumbura to see how best we can initiate action, if there is a food shortage, to get some food from the SAARC Food Bank. So, it is not that these actions have not been taken. As the Hon. Minister of Finance stated, I think at this critical juncture, everybody should work together. I do not think we can come out of this situation if all the parties do not work together.

What we debated most of yesterday and today has been pertaining to the election of the Deputy Speaker. People were saying that there were deals within politics. I think politics, in general, is full of deals and will never be based on morality. Our position pertaining to selecting the Deputy Speaker was - we had already informed of that position to the SLFP - that if the SLFP nominates a candidate, we would not oppose him. We are perfectly aware that the SLFP wants to conduct themselves being in the Opposition and it is completely all right with us.

Pertaining to whether the Prime Minister enjoys the confidence of this House, I think a No-Confidence Motion has been put forward. So, we should take the No-Confidence Motion for debate sooner rather than later. But, let us see what the outcome of the No-Confidence Motion would be. One outcome would be the Government could retain its majority. What then? Would the ground situation change if the Government retains its majority? I do not think so. The other situation is that the Government could have a majority, but, nonetheless, would not have the 113. Then, what happens? The other situation is that the Leader of the Opposition could be invited to form a Government. So, I think it is fair that the SLFP is making that request. If they succeed with the No-Confidence Motion, what will be the next step? We need to have a legitimate Government controlling the country's state of affairs. Otherwise, this country will move into anarchy.

913 914

2022 6

I also think that there is a Parliamentary responsibility at this juncture. The Hon. Speaker can discuss with the Party Leaders and maybe, have some Parliamentary Committee to see how we could bring dollars into this country or how we could send people overseas for jobs. So, we can take all these measures.

Then, I was planning to talk on debt restructuring because that will take away a lot of pain for us. If you look at countries such as Ecuador or the Caribbean countries, there has been debt restructuring. If you have a fair assessment of most of the debt restructuring, the results have sometimes been positive and at other times, we cannot say the intended results have been achieved. So, this is a process in which we all need to work together. Even if the SJB and the Government get together and the JVP does not join them to form a government, then I do not think we would get out of this situation because although the JVP has only three Members in this House, we know that they have a sizeable control in trade unions. If we form a national government without the JVP, what would that result in? So, I think, at this juncture, if everyone could join in to have some form of government - even the TNA and the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam could join the Government and bring in the legislation which they speak of - then we do not need to have another election now, but have one after a stipulated period of time. But, at this juncture, going for an election might not be the most practical solution. The election costs something to the tune of Rs. 10 billion. Do we have the resources to hold an election is also a question. So, I think we need not wait. We can bring in these legislative changes which the people are talking about. If anybody else commands the majority of this House, the Hon. Prime Minister has said that he would be more than glad to resign and hand over the position. If he resigns, what next? So, all I am saying to the Members of the the Opposition and the Government is that we need to face this situation with a plan.

Thank you, Sir, for the time given. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . .
