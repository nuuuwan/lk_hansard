() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Nalaka Godahewa) Hon. Minister, we have been talking about these educational reforms for a very long period of time. But, for the last so many years or so many decades, we have not seen any significant change in the education system. So, could you kindly tell me what is the time frame for all these reforms you are talking about?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Susil Premajayantha) Hon. Member, we have to introduce some changes. In the field of education, you cannot make changes overnight; it will take at least five to 10 years. Not only Sri Lanka, but also countries like Finland, Singapore and even India have introduced educational reforms for 2022. So, we are targeting that and once it is done, we will be on par with those developed countries.

[1.28 p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed - Minister of Environment) Hon. Presiding Member, I am glad to speak on the Petroleum Products (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Bill. Of course, the Act is not something new; it has been there and with this Bill, we are only making a few Amendments to it, inviting other parties also to participate in the supply of petroleum.

1573 1574

[

2022 18

As we all know, Sri Lanka, on the one hand, is further liberalizing its petroleum market as a part of the Government policy to bring in greater competitiveness into the industry and on the other, in response to the financial constraints arising out of the economic crisis the country is facing at present. Sri Lanka's petroleum market consumes approximately five to six million metric tons of refined petroleum products, which translates to a significant quantum of foreign exchange, as at today. The volume and the turnover have been growing in line with the growth rate of the vehicle population and industrial expansion.

Due to the current economic crisis and severe foreign exchange issues, the CPC has not been maintaining an uninterrupted supply of petroleum products. As a result, the CPC has not been able to import crude oil and other petroleum products on time due to delays in opening LCs and also due to the insistence of some suppliers to make payments for fuel cargoes upfront . We all know what we had to go through due to that situation: there were long queues near filling stations and unfortunately, a number of people died waiting in those queues. The introduction of the QR code has sorted out the long queues for the time being. Although the present Government is not responsible for the fuel crisis, it has resolved the issue for the time being in a satisfactory manner and the credit should go to President Ranil Wickremesinghe and particularly, to the Hon. Minister of Power and Energy for taking action to minimize the issue. Yes, it has sorted out the issue temporarily and satisfactorily, but, of course, we all agree that it would not resolve the issue completely. The QR code system has also created some constraints, we all must admit, with 20 litres of petrol and diesel issued for light vehicles and only five litres issued for three-wheelers. Yesterday, the Hon. Minister requested the Cabinet to increase the quota for three-wheelers and that has been permitted. So, I am sure that will also be resolved in time to come.

The Government is quite mindful of the fact that fuel restrictions also restrict economic activity, the production processes and livelihoods of the general public, which has an enormous cost on the economy. The Government is gearing towards addressing that effectively and in a sustainable manner. So, there is no doubt that we need an immediate and short-term solution. In that context, the Amendments that we are bringing in today are progressive and will help manage the current situation more efficiently and effectively.

The Petroleum Products (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Bill provides for the importation, supply and distribution of fuel by parties other than the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation - CPC - and the Lanka Indian Oil Company - LIOC.

The LIOC came into being pursuant to the Petroleum Products (Special Provisions) Act, No. 33 of 2002 and along with the formation of a company called Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Limited. That is why I said that provision has already been there. At that time, what happened was, the CPC and two other parties were each to be allocated with one-third of the shares of the CPSTL.

The LIOC was selected as one of those two parties to be a shareholder of the CPSTL, but the third party could not be selected due to various reasons. Therefore, the CPSTL is a company of which one-third and two-thirds of the shares are owned by the LIOC and the CPC respectively. However, there is provision even now for one-third of the shares of the CPSTL to be granted to another party. As per the provisions of the Petroleum Products (Special Provisions) Act, No. 33 of 2002, the LIOC was granted licence to import, sell and distribute petroleum products in the country. However, 92 per cent of the country's demand is met by the CPC while the LIOC contributes approximately 8 per cent of the demand.

In managing the downstream petroleum issues of Sri Lanka, recently we observed that we have to pay higher premiums because of the financial crisis. When we called for tenders, there were no participants. That is not because the Minister or the Government was at fault, but because of the financial crisis, no company was ready to bid. Sometimes, not even a single company offered a bid. So, due to the financial crisis, the companies who participated in tenders offered higher premiums. Obviously, the Minister and the CPC had to decide whether to pay a higher premium or to shut down the whole country completely and let it go dark. So, that is why a higher premium was paid, which, sometimes, went up to the extent of US Dollars 34 per barrel. So, this did not happen because the Government changed or suddenly. This was the fault of all the consecutive Governments because they kept on borrowing and unfortunately, we went into this financial crisis and we all have to pay for that.

In addition to that, we also had to give in to the suppliers' demand. What was the suppliers' demand? When we called for tenders to buy Gasoil 500 ppm, the suppliers demanded that we pay at the Singapore Platts price of 10 ppm. So, what are we to do? As I said, we had to decide whether to close the whole country or to buy it at that rate? That is where the decision was taken to buy Gasoil 500 ppm at the Singapore Platts price of 10 ppm. So, due to that, there were losses and ultimately, those had to be paid by the consumers. But, that decision was taken not only to avoid shutting down the whole country and the economy, but even to avoid death. So, I would really appreciate the Hon. Minister for taking that bold decision at that time and keeping the whole country at least at this level. The economy is running right now and the people are appreciating it though the Opposition does not. Of course, generally, the Opposition never appreciates the right thing.

There were instances where vessels carrying fuel were anchored outside the Harbour and we had to pay a higher demurrage such as US Dollars 40,000 to 50,000 per day. What else can the Minister do? He cannot give money from his own pocket and that is not a small amount of money. So, those are the challenges the Minister had to face when he took over the Ministry and he faced them.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, please wind up now.

1575 1576

( ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed) Sir, just give me a few minutes. I need to suggest how we can overcome this situation.

So, that is what happened, why the losses were higher and why the prices have gone up.

Firstly, it was due to the depreciation of the currency and secondly, due to the financial crisis and ultimately, the increased prices paid to the suppliers had to be borne by the consumers.

So, due to these circumstances, in order to maintain a continuous supply of petroleum products in the country without a quota system, some Amendments have been brought to the Petroleum Products (Special Provisions) Act by the Hon. Minister, which are now before Parliament for approval, enabling him to select one or more companies established in petroleum producing countries on the recommendations of a committee appointed by the Cabinet of Ministers and chaired by the Secretary to the Line Ministry.

Sir, in order to further improve and strengthen the newly proposed arrangements, I would like to propose several measures to be considered by the Minister of Power and Energy. At present, the LIOC pays throughput charges in Sri Lankan Rupees. So, I would suggest an amendment to be brought in for them and also for the new parties who would join to pay that in dollars. That would definitely bring in some foreign exchange into the country.

In addition to that, we could look into the possibility of the CPC starting bunkering because bunkering would earn foreign exchange and is a profitable business as well. So, let us do that. I would recommend to the Hon. Minister to look into that aspect as well.

Sir, I would also say this. We all must accept that our Refinery was established in 1968 and almost 54 years after its establishment, we are still talking about it. We all should feel ashamed that we could not establish another refinery for the last 54 years. We could not refurbish the Refinery; we could not refurbish the pipeline and we could not refurbish the tank farm. So, what are we talking about? We should have done all that during the last 54 years. So, I am suggesting right now that you look into the option of establishing even smaller refineries, at least in the coastal areas. If 30 to 40 refineries come up, they can cater to the respective areas and the fuel prices would also come down. Therefore, Hon. Minister, please look into those suggestions because those would resolve some of the issues we are facing. Also, we could go for joint ventures in doing that.

Before I wind up, I must also emphasize that we urgently need to re-establish confidence of the international fuel suppliers in Sri Lanka and honour our commitments towards them.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Please wind up, Hon. Minister. ( ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed) Just give me one more minute, Sir.

Sir, we need to keep our promises and be more business-oriented in dealing with the suppliers. We need to better understand how the global petroleum industry is working. Due to shortage of funds, we have failed in our timely commitments towards them and we need quick fixes to boost the supplier confidence. The only sustainable way of doing it is to ensure that we secure a credit line for purchase of oil on a long-term basis. As discussed during my visits to Saudi Arabia and the UAE as a special envoy of the Hon. President, both countries were willing to consider a serious proposal from Sri Lanka. Therefore, I would like to request the Minister of Power and Energy to re-trade this process along with the Minister of Foreign Affairs so that we will secure a more sustainable short to medium-term energy solution.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . [.. 1.41 ( ) (The Hon. Vijitha Herath) . . . . . . . . . .

I would like to say this in the English language. I do not really understand why Clause 7 has even been included in this Bill. I cannot even imagine why you would do it when we know that in our country, corruption is a huge issue. Even if we are not corrupt, allegations of corruption are thrown at most of us. Sir, Clause 7 states, I quote:

"Any power exercised or any act done, by the Energy Supply Committee prior to the date of commencement of this Act in pursuance of any power conferred on it by the principal enactment shall be deemed, for all purposes, to have been validly exercised and done."
