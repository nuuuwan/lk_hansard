( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Prime Minister, apart from the legal objections regarding a National Delimitation Committee being appointed once again, yesterday, a Gazette Notification has come out giving only ten days to submit proposals on delimitation of wards. We are, of course, opposed to this whole delimitation process itself. However, today, I am meeting the Chairman of that National Delimitation Committee, Mr. Mahinda Deshapriya, at the Department of Survey in the afternoon. The only thing is, these ten days are hardly sufficient. We have 240 odd Local Authorities all over the country. We, as political parties, will have to summon all the people concerned, have discussions with them and then try to revise the delimitation of wards. There are multi-member wards, single-member wards and three-member wards. Also, you have to look at the ethnic composition of those wards. I do not know, . . . . . . . . pass . . I think ten days are hardly sufficient. You have to review all this. - [Interruption] No, the Gazette Notification says only ten days. How on earth could any party submit their proposals within ten days? So, look at all that. I do not know whether you are really sincere about this. This may not be a sincere exercise, that is a different matter. But, whether you are sincere or not, please look at these things. Anyway, I will raise this matter with the Chairman of the Committee. He might bring the matter to you to see whether you can extend the time.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) . . . . . . .

.

. [ ] . [ ] . . . . He is a very Senior Member. I had served in the Select Committee on electoral reforms; he also had served in that. I must say that the entire Provincial Council Elections system was throttled by them when they were in power. As a result, we have had no Provincial Council Elections so far. We do not know how to resolve this. So, there has to be agreement even on how to resolve that. - [Interruption.] You say that, but you never signed; you ran away!

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) No, no! ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I am sorry to say, you ran away. - [Interruption.] I have the Report here. I will show, you never signed this Report. - [Interruption] That is how you behaved, I am sorry to say.

Sir, I would like to just quote a few lines from an article which appeared in the "Frontline" magazine after our discussion on that decisive day. On that decisive day, the Prime Minister was the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe; he was acting for the President. This is what, the false news, the "Frontline" carried: "Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe announces his resignation". . In that article, the name of the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva, Member of Parliament and former Minister, also appears. In that, he was reported to have said, "Correction to my earlier tweet on consensus to ask PM and President to resign." . "Frontline" article . on the following day, the forces were able to defeat those terrorists who came. . ? . . . . . . . . . .

Chairman, for the time given to say a few words on the Votes of the long list of 25 institutions including the President, the Judges of the Superior Courts, independent Commissions and so on.

Before I get to the subject matter, I wish to clarify what we did at the Vote last evening. I did explain it right at the end of my speech, but nevertheless, the time was insufficient. Therefore, I would like to say that right through the Debate on the Second Reading, all Members of the Tamil National Alliance, every one of us, criticized the Budget for various reasons; I do not need to repeat that. Ordinarily, we would have had to, therefore, vote against the Budget at its Second Reading. However, we took a decision not to cast our vote against the Budget at its Second Reading for one reason and that is because the Hon. President has, on numerous occasions in the last ten days, repeatedly said that he wants to resolve the Tamil national question and has invited Tamil parties to have discussions with him. We have publicly expressed our scepticism about that invitation. Nevertheless, when there is a hand stretched out by the President himself, we thought we must reciprocate in some way and therefore, would not vote against the Budget as a signal of our bona fides in this matter.

[At this stage, the Hon. President Ranil Wickremesinghe entered the Chamber.]

Now that the Hon. President is also here, I might say that in Sinhala.

. . . . " " . .

As I walked into the Chamber today, there was a discussion between the Chief Opposition Whip and the Hon. Prime Minister, and I want to make certain observations with regard to that. As has been observed in Article 4 (c) of our Constitution, the judicial power of the people shall be exercised by Parliament through courts, tribunals and other institutions. Even in that, a reservation is made with regard to the powers and Privileges of Parliament and its Members, which Parliament would directly exercise and has not been delegated to the Judiciary. So, the Judiciary is independent, the Constitution stipulates that also in the Chapter on the Judiciary. Nevertheless, the sovereign judicial power is vested in Parliament and it is Parliament that exercises it through courts. There is, sometimes, a confusion with regard to references being made to judicial decisions and I might cite the previous Standing Orders.

The previous Standing Order No. 78 read thus, I quote:

The conduct of the President, or acting President, Members of Parliament, Judges or other persons engaged in the administration of justice shall not be raised except upon a substantive motion;.

This Standing Order was amended in the new Standing Orders which came into effect on the 15th of April, 2018. There, the words The conduct" have been changed into The personal conduct. So, presently, as the Standing Order reads, it is only the personal conduct of the President or acting President, Members of Parliament or Judges that should not be discussed except upon a substantive motion. That is an important change; what was said to be The conduct has now been restricted to The personal conduct and that was done advisedly. I remember being in the Committee on Standing Orders at that time which made that Amendment and the Hon. Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms was also a Member of that. So, we made this recommendation and Parliament adopted the new Standing Orders which changed it. The reason why I am mentioning this is that when judicial power of the people is vested in Parliament but that power is exercised by another body, surely Parliament must be in a place to discuss that, not the personal conduct of the judges - no, that, you cannot except upon a substantive motion - but the judicial conduct and judgments. In any case, judgments can be criticized even outside Parliament, as the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella pointed out. Lord Atkin said, Justice is not a cloistered virtue; it must suffer the scrutiny of ordinary men". So, that can be done even outside, but within Parliament, Parliament has a very sacred and special duty to discuss even the conduct of judges, not only judgments.

So, having clarified that, may I raise another issue with regard to the Office on Missing Persons. I mentioned this yesterday, too, but now that allocations are being discussed at the Committee Stage today, it is an important issue. When the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera presented the Bill on the Office on Missing Persons, the President - he was the Prime Minister then - will recall, only three people spoke: the Minister who presented the Bill, the Hon. Bimal Rathnayake from the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna and myself. The then Members of the Opposition disturbed the Proceedings, approached the Hon. Foreign Minister and tried to disrupt the passage of that Bill. However, it was passed. What was contained in this Bill which has now become an Act? It is a mechanism to investigate those who have been disappeared, the enforced disappearances. That is why enforced disappearances also had to be made an offence in this country. So, that is an Office which is vested, by law, with the power to make investigations to find out what happened to them; primarily, that is the duty.

In 2017, an allocation of Rs. 500 million was made for this Office to be given away as interim payments. Some people think that that is compensation. No. For compensation, there is another office, the Office for Reparations. That Bill was also passed in the last Parliament. These are interim payments for the dependents of the person who has been disappeared, for

41 42

their livelihood. It was announced that Rs. 6,000 a month would be paid, but what we find is that out of that Rs. 500 million, only Rs. 11 million was paid. Then, in the 2021 Budget, another Rs. 300 million was allocated and when that was allocated, it was said that that was in addition to the allocation already made. I know that when an allocation is made for a year, that ends with that year. So, what was envisaged was that the entire Rs. 500 million would be spent in that one year, but only Rs. 11 million was spent. But, when Rs. 300 million was set apart, it was said that that was in addition to the Rs. 500 million; Rs. 800 million was allocated. But, nothing was paid out of that Rs. 300 million also; only Rs. 11 million was paid. That is, recognizing that their relative, their breadwinner has been disappeared. But, that does not absolve this Office of its core duty of conducting investigations to find what happened to them. The relatives of the disappeared want to know what happened to them. The State has an obligation to make these payments, but that is by the way. The primary obligation is to investigate to see what happened to them. Five years on, not a single investigation has been done by this Office and the Chairman has the gall to say that no one has disappeared! I mentioned this yesterday, too. He says no one has disappeared. So, there are two different tasks. One is, the interim payments - even that has not been done properly - but the core function of this Office is yet to start.

I am mentioning this today in this way because the Hon. President was seen greeting the South African President Cyril Ramaphosa at the Airport here, cutting a cake for his birthday and announcing that South Africa is willing to help in the reconciliation process. All that is very good. But, reconciliation begins with the ascertainment of the truth. There is no reconciliation by sweeping the truth under the carpet. That must be made known. It is only by the first act of ascertainment of the truth that there can be true reconciliation. You set up an Office five years ago, but you have not had even one investigation done. Then, when you say, We are serious about reconciliation, are we to be blamed for saying that those words sound hollow? Are we to be blamed for that? Your actions must be louder than your words. But, all we have is words, words and words, nothing on the ground.

And, as I speak, more lands are being acquired. On the 23rd of September, a letter was sent by the Ministry of Lands to acquire the balance lands that are around Palaly, 1,614 acres. The Government has repeatedly said that they are releasing these lands.

) ( - , ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe - President, Minister of Defence and Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies) Where are the lands?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Around the Palaly Airport, Hon. President. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) I will look into that.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) On the 23rd of September, a letter was sent to continue with the acquisition process that was commenced in 2013. In 2013, when the acquisition process started, the extent to be acquired was 6,438 acres. There are 2,176 petitioners challenging that before the Court of Appeal and I appear for them; I must disclose my interest according to the etiquette. So, I appear for those 2,176 petitioners and most of their lands have been released. It is true that most of their lands have been released, but it is on one acquisition order. The part that has not been released is about 2,000 acres and out of that, they have given instructions to go ahead and acquire 1,614 acres. So, on the one hand, we hear words about reconciliation, resettlement and release of lands, but on the other, we see the opposite happening. I am thankful that the President just responded saying that he will look in to that.

Similarly, we have brought to your attention how the Forest Department, the Department of Wildlife Conservation and more than anything else, the Department of Archaeology have been using those special laws given to them to move our people out of their lands, lands they have occupied for generations. Suddenly, overnight, stones are placed around their boundaries and they are told, "You cannot enter those places anymore". This is happening as I speak. So, where is that reconciliation?

We welcome the Presidents initiative when he says, "We will resolve everything". The President made this speech in Vavuniya too and said that all the people must agree on what the solution should be, and we are agreeable. Nothing will be sustainable if one section or the other of our people oppose it. We understand that. We want all the people of this country to be content, be satisfied and feel secure that this is their country. So, we welcome you initiative, Hon. President. You know that this particular matter has received a lot of attention over the years, even during the last Parliament under your Chairmanship in the Steering Committee. The Hon. Prime Minister was also a Member, and we went through that whole process. There is a large amount of consensus and there are only a few things that need to be sorted out. That can be done and resolved even in a days sitting. We do not even require three months. That is crucial because if we are looking to the South African example, that is what happened there. They have told us in previous times when we visited there, "Secure your future before you look at your past". In South Africa, a political change happened before they could look at accountability issues. So, that fundamental change must happen. And, in my

43 44

2022 03

humble opinion, that must precede other measures. Sure enough, you need to do a lot of confidence-building exercises because there is a serious lack of trust and suspicion because of the long history and what has happened. So, that issue is there.

Therefore, confidence-building measures are important, but what is crucial is to settle the core issue, the root issue and then look at other justice and accountability issues because then, people will have a very different outlook on how to resolve those.

Hon. President, on this occasion when we discuss also your Votes, we recognize that, perhaps, you are the only person in this House, although you are not a Member of this House today, who has the longest experience even in this matter. You were part of the Government team which negotiated with the TULF from the middle to the end of 1986, which later ended with the Indo-Lanka Accord and the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which we did not accept as a meaningful scheme of devolution. Nevertheless, the President has been involved in this from that time onwards and knows everything that is to know about the resolution of this issue. We also have, as I speak, former President Rajapaksa here, who appointed the All Party Representative Committee - APRC - headed by the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana. They came up with a Report. Although we were not invited to it and we did not participate in that Committee, that is a good Report. Many Members in the front row of the Government side today were Members in the Cabinet in August, 2000 when President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga actually brought in a Constitution Bill to Parliament. The United National Party at that time, led by the President, opposed it only because of a transitional provision with regard to Executive Presidency, not because of the devolution arrangements in that. So, all of these consensus, we have, but we have yet to take it over the line. That is what has been entrusted to the President now.

As we seek to come out of this economic crisis, the political crisis intertwined with the economic crisis. If the country is to have a due image, if the country is to infuse new confidence in the world stage, then there has to be a firm political resolution to this political crisis that has plagued this country ever since Independence. I have heard the President say more than once, At the75th Anniversary of the Independence, we all must be children of one mother. That is a good ideal to work towards, but there is a very short time before that. And, I want to repeat what we have said in public: we are willing to work with you constructively to achieve that objective you have enunciated; we are willing to do that to achieve the reasonable and legitimate aspirations of our people and indeed, of all the people who live in this country.

You will be aware that in the last Parliament when we went through the process of constitutional reform through the Constitutional Assembly, our leader, the Hon. R. Sampanthan, repeatedly told this House that he wants the new Constitution accepted at a Referendum. He said, I do not want to do anything behind the back of the majority people of this country; everyone must feel

secure". So, that is our desire as well, that the majority people of this country must also accept it. More than 40 countries in the world today have a federal form of government. Those are the strongest countries in the world. More than 40 per cent of the population of the world are in federal countries.

You have others who are quasi-federal and who sometimes call themselves unitary, like the Great Britain, where the extent of devolution is far more than even in a federal form of government. We do not ask for something that is not found anywhere in the world. We are asking for something that is reasonable, that is practised all around the globe, which will ensure that all our people will live with dignity and self-respect in this country, and we want the majority people in this country to understand and accept that. After all, you are a preponderant majority, no one can shift that.

It was the Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, in 1926, who introduced the idea of federalism to this country, not the Tamil leaders. The first political party that adopted a resolution on federalism was the Communist Party in 1934 through the Vaidialingam-Keuneman proposals. It was the Kandyan chiefs who asked for a federal form of government, twice before the Donoughmore and the Soulbury Constitutions. So, it cannot be bad for the Sinhala people because it was the Sinhala leaders who asked for it.

It is true that, over time, wrong messages have been communicated to the country and there are suspicions. Those must be allayed and we must resolve this in a just way so that we all can then stand up, as the President envisages, on the 04th of February, 2023 as children of one mother.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) The Hon. President Ranil Wickremesinghe. [11.46 a.m.] ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe - President, Minister of Defence and Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies) Hon. Chairman, first, I would like to tell the Hon. Sumanthiran that when we were in Vavuniya the day before yesterday, we did discuss and sorted out the problems regarding the Department of Wildlife Conservation and the Forest Department. It is a problem confined not only to the North, but prevelant in most parts of the country. So, we will be taking that up.

45 46

Having said that, I think about the ethnic problem in this country or whatever you call it, from 1984 till now, we have spoken about it and there is nothing new to talk about it, but just to decide what is relevant and what needs to be done. I think we can do it by next year, by the 75th Anniversary of Independence, which is my aim. If you cannot do it by then, you may not have that Sri Lanka by 2048.

One thing we have to do is, build up confidence among the Tamil community. We also have to build up confidence among the Sinhala community, who has reasonable concerns as to where it will lead. Finally, we are also looking at the Muslim community and we have discussed at the Security Council to release all those young people against whom there is no evidence.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees will now take the Chair.

Whereupon THE HON. SPEAKER left the Chair, and DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. ANGAJAN RAMANATHAN] took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Deputy Chairman, I was commenting on the benefit of the Hon. Presidents comments, that they have resulted in achieving some type of consensus in the House.

Talking about former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga' proposals - the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, too, was in her Government as a Minister - we must also comment that those proposals were designed taking the country as a Union of Regions. We are not worried about the terminology here; the constitutional terminology is not the issue. It is a question of sharing power both at the Centre and at the regions. If we are to come to a collective understanding and put an end to this whole issue, this is a golden opportunity for us to achieve that consensus. So, let us not be misled by unnecessary controversy relating to different constitutional concepts, but the intention of devolving power is what is important.

Having said that, now, let me now deal with the Vote of the President taken up at the Committee Stage Discussion.

Ayesha Jinasena, Deputy Solicitor General, was opposed to leading evidence of Zahrans wife. Zahrans wifes evidence is very important. Now, the Attorney-Generals Department has filed an indictment against her in the Kalmunai High Court. It is very interesting to see. She is divulging a lot of information. Her evidence is very important for us to look at the hidden facts behind this whole issue. Who created this monster Zahran? Who was behind this? Then, there was Sarah's alias Pulasthini's case. She has gone missing. Hadiya, the wife of Zahran, in her evidence before the Presidential Commission says, Sarah - Pulasthini - never left our company. She was always there with us wherever we travelled. From hiding

place to hiding place, she was there". Then, Ayesha Jinasena poses the question, "Did you observe anything strange in Sarahs - Pulasthinis - room?" Then, Hadiya says, "No. Wherever she went, they came and fixed closed-circuit TV cameras". The bedroom of Sarah - Pulasthini - and Hasthun, her husband, was covered by closed-circuit TV cameras. Who was watching their actions?

Sarah was a plant; she was a person who was giving information from within. Somebody from outside, some mastermind, was watching what was happening throughout. There is a colleague of ours who appears for Hadiya. I told him that there is some interesting information I have unearthed, having read the evidence of Hadiya, wife of Zahran. Zahran married a 14-year-old girl; she was a youngster and she still is a youngster, I am sure. There were some intelligence operatives. When this famous video appeared on the Internet, the first person who alerted me was Prof. Maithree Wickremesinghe, the Hon. Presidents wife, the First Lady. So, she alerted me - in fact, she was petrified when I mentioned that in the Presidential Commission - and then only I came to know and looked at the video. The whole issue is the connection with some intelligence operatives, as to why they were in touch. There were two chaps called Army Mohideen" and Police Faiz. In the evidence of Hadiya, there is reference to how this "Police Faiz" came to be in touch with Zahran. He goes and comments on the Internet and criticizes Zahran. Suddenly, he comes and lands in Sri Lanka, befriends Zahran and becomes his disciple. There again, was there a connection?

Then, what about the incident in Vavunativu? In Vavunativu, when the jacket was discovered inside a culvert, suddenly the accusation was of LTTE involvement. When they were going to arrest the suspects, then another intelligence officer goes and says, No, these are our informants. Do not arrest them and blocks the arrest. So, what had been happening is something that we have to look into. We went into the incidents in detail at the Parliamentary Select Committee that was appointed. In fact, some of the young Members on that side started criticizing our involvement in cross-examining those witnesses. The Hon. Sumanthiran was there; I was there and the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senarathne and several of us were there. We carefully examined. We knew there were a lot of miscommunications among the different intelligence services in the country. There was also some intrigue within them.

Then, see what has happened to Shani Abeysekara. Today, in the middle pages of the Daily Mirror, there is a big article about the Public Service Commission and the refusal to repay, at least, his wages. What is the Public Service Commission doing? These are issues we have to look at.

Finally, let me come to the issue of the new Cabinet Paper that has been presented. The "Daily Mirror" reports Initial Cabinet nod for proposed new anti-corruption legislation". It is strange. The newspaper states that initial Cabinet nod has been granted and that the Cabinet endorsed it as a policy decision. We do not want this to be just a policy decision.

57 58

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) It is coming in as a law. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Yes, it must come in as a law. But, the way it is reported -

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) That is not correct. It will come as a Bill and then, you can consider it.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Presidents Counsel Sarath Jayamanne, who was behind the drafting of this Bill, came and explained to us the basis of the draft. There are some very important changes. In fact, I told him specifically that a separate precis of Crime Act has to be enacted, if you are to make it meaningful. That is what has been taken up even in Geneva. I am told that Justice Yasantha Kodagoda and Presidents Counsel Sarath Jayamanne both have co-authored a concept paper regarding this. They are officers with sufficient experience in the Attorney-Generals Department. The Attorney-Generals Department itself has been at the receiving end of a lot of criticism regarding their suggestion in that concept paper about non-conviction-based confiscation. Those are the issues that we confronted when we looked at these issues during the last regime.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) So, let us look at a better way to resolve these things.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) We agreed with the IMF on the criteria. I will give you the statement on that. We agreed on the UN standards. I will give it to you tomorrow.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Thank you very much.

Since I do not have much time, I will wind up.

We have had umpteen Commissions. But, please look at whatever Commission report and the possibility of appointing another Commission to look at what has transpired in these things and finally, to resolve these issues, once and for all.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) The Commission has not worked; it has been there since 1995. It is not worth the money spent and the number of cases put in. So, we have to adopt a new structure; we have to look at either the Singaporean structure, the Hong Kong structure or the Serious Fraud Office in the UK. The Minister will take it up. I think you have to study those and come up with an appropriate agency.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) That is all I wish to say, Sir.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) The next speaker is the Hon. Rohitha Abegunawardhana.You have 25 minutes.

, ! In the US Congress, there are 800 in the research staff, but in this Parliament, there are just 12 Research Officers. Who else are there? There are 216 in the Catering and House Keeping staff, 17 Receptionists, and 45 Cooks, whereas there is a research staff of 800 in the US Congress. We discuss a lot of things, but do we reach consensus, do we make any decisions and do we implement them? No, absolutely not. I think, everyone in this House is responsible for that. Therefore, whatever we discuss, , .

I want to ask a question from the Members of the Opposition who voted against the Second Reading of the Budget. Suppose, you are given a chance to present a Budget in this House at this critical juncture - speak from

your heart - could you come up with a better Budget than this? Then, why are you opposing this? It is important for all of us to realize that this is the time that we all have to get together and rescue the country, first. , , .

Profiles in Courage written by John F. Kennedy, the 35th and the youngest President of America, states, I quote:

149 150

To be courageous, these stories make clear, requires no exceptional qualifications, no magic formula, no special combination of time, place and circumstance. It is an opportunity that sooner or later is presented to us all. Politics merely furnishes one arena which imposes special tests of courage. In whatever arena of life one may meet the challenge of courage, whatever may be the sacrifices he faces if he follow his conscience - the loss of his friends, his fortune, his contentment, even the esteem of his fellow men - each man must decide for himself the course he will follow. The stories of past courage can define that ingredient - they can teach, they can offer hope, they provide inspiration. But they cannot supply courage itself. For this each man must look into his own soul.

In the near history of Sri Lanka, I think President Ranil Wickremesinghe, even after facing the most violent incident of his life, where his own house was burned down by the mobs, made that courageous decision. Without having strength for his party in Parliament, without having people's support and maybe, without having a mandate, he made that courageous decision at that time to safeguard the democracy of this country. Our children and grandchildren will, one day, write down his name in gold letters in history.

Sir, I, too, have a dream like Martin Luther King did. In 1963, he had a dream and that dream, he said, was to see white children and the children of the slaves living together. I also have a dream, that the people of my motherland, Sri Lanka, the Tamils, the Sinhalese and the Muslims, would rebuild this nation so that we could be called a true democracy. Sir, I would like to table* this paper I (too) Have a Dream - Dr. Suren Raghavan which I have written.

Thank you very much.
