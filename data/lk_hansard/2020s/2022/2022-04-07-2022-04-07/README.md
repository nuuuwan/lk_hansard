PRIVILEGE: QUESTIONING OF PROCEEDINGS OF

PARLIAMENT

0 ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Sir, I have a matter of Privilege to raise and another clarification to make, both of which I gave notice to you yesterday.

The Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act of Sri Lanka gives to this House the powers and Privileges also enjoyed by the House of Commons in addition to what is provided in the Act itself. Those rights include the rights in the Bill of Rights of 1688, which assures freedom of speech in this House and also states that the Proceedings of this House cannot be questioned outside. There is a special Presidential Commission of Inquiry appointed to investigate into the "Pissu Poosa" Report and the Commissioners now want to question some of us, including me, on matters that had been discussed in the House, which form Proceedings of the House. The Proceedings of the House including those on matters that had been voted on and money had been voted on cannot be questioned and none of those had been challenged in courts. So, I thought I should raise it as a matter of Privilege here, that by doing so, they would be violating my Privileges and the Privileges of the House, and I will inform the Commissioners as such.

Sir, as you know, the "Pissu Poosa" Report has, in turn, been challenged by the Human Rights Commission. So, the Government must first decide whether they are going to accept the Report or not.

Then, we have been charged as respondents. I have certainly gone to court and challenged this Report because I was made a respondent in it when I was called in as a witness in the case of Dr. Nihal Jayathilaka, who got locked up. I gave evidence. I think he had a case which he could put forward. Other than that, I had no other issues.

I think this Commission of Inquiry, after all, is responsible to Parliament; it is not a judicial body. So, we can question them. Once the new Justice Minister - I do not know whether you or another would be appointed - is appointed, I would like very much, at that time, to ask the State Counsel why they did this. We are told, Hon. Minister, that your account was much larger than what is in the Treasury now, in which case you could supplement it.

I must say that we, there are also other Members, will be raising these issues later. As I told you, I do not want to discuss this in detail today as today and tomorrow are important for the current debate. When the crisis is over, you give us time. Then, there will be other Hon. Members who will take it up.

Next, I want to make a clarification regarding a news report in the Colombo Telegraph of 06th April, 2022, which states How Ranil Squashed 2015 Currency Smuggling Allegation Against Gotas Son. It states that there was some American team which came here and advised me that there was sufficient intelligence to charge him and that the then Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake and I were told about this. I must tell you that the Hon. Sagala Ratnayake became Minister only in the last two or three weeks when the Hon. Tilak Marapana had to resign. Certainly, either before or when he became Minister or after, I did not meet any American team at all; I did not have a function for them. They did not show me anything regarding this gentleman Daminda Manoj Rajapaksa. I have seen nothing about it and I was not the relevant party to take up the issue with. If there was anything, they had to take it up either with the Anti-Corruption Secretariat or the Presidential Task Force on Recovery of State Assets, which was headed by Mr. Weliamuna in the Presidents Office. So, as far as I am concerned, this is a fabrication and I must also say that I am not aware of any allegation against this individual.

The website Colombo Telegraph had been banned before 2015. I knew Uvindu, who was publishing that website. We lifted the ban. I thought he was a good journalist and had a lot of potential. I am sorry - I am speaking not in anger but more in sadness - that he has sacrificed his integrity for short-term gain or fame. I hope he will not do this in the future.

Thank you. 0 ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Kiriella? 0 ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . . ? . .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, I rise to a point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Rauff Hakeem, what is the point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, I would like to remind you that the Hon. Anura Dissanayake made a proposal in the morning that because of the situation, the Party Leaders be given precedence today for them to make their points known before you call upon the others. So, I kindly ask you to consider that.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) But by the Opposition, we have been given a time schedule.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Anyway, since you called upon the Hon. Shritharan to speak, let him speak. Thereafter, allow the Party Leaders to take precedence in the list and then call the others.

Sir, we are in a very bad, serious situation. So, let me tell you this. Let us at least have a caretaker Government with eminent persons from outside. Appoint them for at least six months until the elections and then somehow go on a sustainable path towards reconciliation of our debts. We have to somehow restructure our debts.

0 ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) We have to suggest a mechanism. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes, we have to suggest a mechanism. That is what we are saying. Of course, in keeping with what the Leader of the Opposition said, we are going to present a Bill within a weeks time to this House. We would like the Government to discuss it with us and let us see what could be done.

The President is unable to exercise his powers - he has already lost his mandate; all his credibility is gone and his acceptability is nil in the country. Everybody wants him to go home. He must realize this. You cannot hang on to a position when everybody outside is calling for your resignation. Not only in this country, but all Sri Lankans in every other country, in every capital city in the world are carrying out massive demonstrations. This is not going to cease unless we take a proper decision. Of course, we are not forcing anybodys hands; it is up to them to make the decision.

For One country, One Law, you appointed a Task Force. What is that for? That is in order to somehow try and create this mythical image as if the minorities are not abiding by the law and therefore, you must have this concept. And, all people gulped this false bravado. Then, you have appointed the Romesh de Silva Committee and a Presidential Commission to go into the Report on Political Victimization of the Pissu Poosa Commission. . ! . .

Now, we are moving towards a disorderly default. We will be forced to default by May, June and then what will happen? We will be in a much worse situation. Therefore, for initial consent solicitation to suspend the debt payment, we will have to appoint some legal firm. Have you all taken steps to do that without a Finance Minister, without any proper team to go for negotiations?

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up. 0 ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, give him two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Therefore, there is a very serious situation.

Now, our worker remittances have come down by almost 60 per cent. That is, by about US Dollars 7 billion. So, what are we going to do? There is a 30 per cent inflation in the country. Today, the "DailyMirror says that our inflation is almost 29 per cent. So, this is the situation. You went on printing money and created this inflation. You went on paying back all the International Sovereign Bonds when we said, The final tranche, do not pay. That is what the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva told you this morning.

This week, in the US District Court of Columbia, there were charges of wire fraud in the purchase of a new Embassy building in Washington DC in 2013. The Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative of the World Bank says that these people in power all over the world steal between US Dollars 1 trillion and US Dollars 1.6 trillion. We are a signatory to the UN Convention Against Corruption, where there is a Chapter on Asset Recovery. In 2018, we appointed a Presidential Task Force on Recovery of State Assets. We have a draft of that. Could you please bring it to Parliament and get it approved? We are making a request. Why am I saying that? What did Jaliya Wickramasuriya, former Ambassador of Sri Lanka to the United States - he was Ambassador from 2008 to 2014 - do? He has admitted that he attempted to take more than US Dollars 300,000 in the purchase of that new Embassy building. Who is Jaliya Wickramasuriya? I would like to have an answer, if there is anybody who knows.

, . . test . test . test .

Esala Weerakoon was Deputy Ambassador when Jaliya Wickramasuriya was Ambassador. The Secretary to the Treasury at that time was Dr. P. B. Jayasundara. The Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was Mr. Karunatilaka Amunugama; Mr. Amunugama took a back seat. So, the Accountant of the Embassy told Esala Weerakoon that there was a problem. What was the problem? He said, Mr. Weerakoon, you are signing documents. You know that there is a fraud. You had better be careful. Mr. Weerakoon, being a gentleman, talked to Dr. P. B. Jayasundara. What did Dr. P. B. Jayasundara do? He informed Mahinda Rajapaksa. What did Mahinda Rajapaksa do? He transferred Jaliya out and brought Prasad Kariyawasam to Washington, which was a good move. Then, what did he do? He nominated Jaliya Wickramasuriya as Ambassador to Canada! ? The Canadian Government did not give the agrment.

The IMF will not negotiate with us until they have confidence in us and they see political stability in this country. We are wasting time. The countrys problem is going to get much worse. I am hoping against hope that this problem will not lead to a food shortage after the Sinhala and Tamil New Year.

Thank you again for providing me time. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. Jeevan Thondaman. You have seven minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Jeevan Thondaman) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I would like to state the obvious here, that people are on the streets. They are on the streets because there is a fuel and electricity shortage and a possible food crisis at hand.

Being a young Member of Parliament, I would like to remind all the Parliamentarians why we are here right now. We are here right now to debate the current situation. We are not here to play a blame game; we are not here to point a finger at and say whose fault it is or who is responsible. I am very sure that people are well aware of all those who are at fault and all those who are accountable for this situation. And, right now, it is time for us to look at solutions.

I would also like to say that there was something very amusing actually. About two days ago, I witnessed the Hon. Leader of the Opposition making a brilliant speech. It was thought-provoking and very powerful, but, unfortunately, by the actions of the Opposition Members yesterday, it was overshadowed. You see people holding placards outside the Parliament and all over the country simply because they do not have a voice in Parliament and if you look at it in that sense, it is ironic and

disappointing that the people who do have a voice in Parliament are also holding placards. So, that is a very senseless thing to do, in my opinion. It is also disappointing because right now, we are talking about masked men and an individual donning a helmet getting into the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayakas vehicle. But, in my opinion, neither the masked men nor that man with a helmet are going to pay the US Dollar 1 billion that is due in July. I do not think we are speaking about the things that need to be spoken about. I do not think we are speaking about going to the IMF; I do not think we are speaking about debt repayment; I do not think we are speaking about debt restructuring; we are not talking about how we can curb inflation and we are not talking about how we could give a recovery plan to the entrepreneurs and the small business owners who have suffered a heavy loss due to COVID and this fuel and electricity crisis. We are not focusing on any of them. So, what are we doing as Parliamentarians? It is absolutely dismal.

Apart from that, it is very saddening that Sri Lankas reputation in the global stage has reduced. Recently, I witnessed a prominent Indian journalist mentioning that the fiscal policies of Sri Lanka are illogical, that taking a loan to repay a loan is like putting a bandage on a bullet wound. You know, that is not a permanent solution. We are just delaying the inevitable, that inevitable being peoples lives and the economy at stake. We have so many things at stake and we are not focusing on the things at hand. Even now, we are still playing a blame game, we are still pointing fingers at others and it is exactly why people are out on the streets. People are out on the streets. Yes, we understand; we can read too; we can see that they are holding up boards which say Go home, Gota!. But, everybody should understand one thing. You must understand the sentiments of the people. When they say Go home, Gota!, they do not mean just the President or the Rajapaksas, but they mean all the Members of Parliament sitting here right now because all of us have failed in our duty. We have failed to address the public sentiments.

I am sorry that I have to say this. A sign of a good democracy is a good Opposition and people can judge as to where we are right now.

Actually, how we should go forward in this is quite simple The only thing that we need to do is, both the ruling party and the Opposition must find a common ground and compromise. I am not trying to justify the actions of the ruling party here, but the ruling party has come forward and said, Let us come to a common ground. But, if the Opposition is going to play with peoples feelings and harp on we cannot find a common ground. This is a one-way solution, that is not how it should work. People are suffering and we need to step up. If you want all the people to calm down and go home, you just have to show them that there is a road to recovery; we need to show them how we are going to find solutions for the crises we are in.

People have, right now, accepted that they are going to suffer before things get better. That is what people have realized and people have accepted it.

257 258

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Thondaman, you have two more minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Jeevan Thondaman) Thank you, Sir.

So, people have realized and accepted it. But now, it is our duty to show them the road to recovery. We have a meeting with the IMF on the 11th of April, 2022 and I am unaware as to who is going to go there. But, there has to be a solution.

Also, I would like to say something in Tamil, to address another important issue that had happened, if you could give me an additional minute, Sir.
