ACTION AGAINST THE BILL RELATING TO SRI LANKA PASSED IN PROVINCIAL PARLIAMENT OF ONTARIO, CANADA: STATEMENT BY STATE

MINISTER OF REGIONAL CO-OPERATION

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya - State Minister of Regional Co-operation) Hon. Deputy Speaker, on behalf of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, I wish to make this Statement in response to the Parliamentary Question raised under Standing Order 27 (2) by the Hon. (Ven.) Athuraliye Rathana Thero on 11th March, 2022.

1. Yes, we are aware of Bill 104. Mr. Vijay Thanigasalam, Member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, Provincial Parliament and of Sri Lankan origin, submitted a Private Members Public Bill titled Tamil Genocide Education Week Act on 30th April, 2019 and it came into effect on 6th May, 2021. Due to the strength of the vote of Canadians of Tamil origin, MP Thanigasalam was able to introduce Bill 104 at the Provincial Parliament.

The purpose of this Bill is to have a seven-day period in each year ending on May 18, not in March, to be proclaimed as Tamil Genocide Education Week, during which period all

1063 1064

Ontarians are encouraged to educate themselves about and maintain their awareness of the so-called Tamil genocide and other genocides that have occurred in the world history.

2. Yes, recognizing the strain this Bill can cause on the inter-community relations among the members of the Sri Lankan community in Canada, we have sought intervention of the Canadian Government through the Canadian High Commission in Colombo as well as through our Missions in Canada.

3. The members of the Sri Lankan expatriate community in Canada have initiated legal action against the enactment of Bill 104. This includes filing of Constitutional Questions by a Sri Lankan Canadian at the Ontario Superior Court on the legality of the Provincial Parliament passing this Bill. In addition, the Sri Lankan Canadian Action Coalition - SLCAC - in Toronto has hired a law firm to challenge this Bill at the Ontario Superior Court.

4. The Bill was originally submitted in April, 2019 and came into effect only in May, 2021. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had made concerted efforts to prevent this Bill from being taken up for two years. This two-year delay was due to the extensive action taken by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in coordination with the Sri Lankan High Commission in Ottawa, the Consulate General in Toronto, which is covering the Ontario Province, and the members of the Sri Lankan origin community in Canada.

After the First Reading on 30th April, 2019, the Second Reading of the Bill took place on 16th May, 2019, where it was debated and referred to the Standing Committee on Regulations and Private Bills. The Bill was pending before this Committee for nearly two years. It is notable that the two-year delay at the Committee level was possible partly due to understanding of the MP who was the Chair of the Committee. However, when MP Logan Kanapathi of Sri Lankan origin took over the Chairmanship of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Private Bills on 30th March, 2021, the Bill was abruptly reported to the Legislative Assembly for the Third Reading on o6th May, 2021 and was carried. This process had taken place without hearings at the Committee Stage. It is evident that the Bill was rushed through the House by MPP Thanigasalam and Kanapathi and their supporters to prevent any dissent or delay.

The Sri Lankan High Commission in Ottawa and the Consulate General in Toronto have made representations at various fronts/ levels against the

Bill, as per the instructions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This was supported by the Foreign Ministry in the form of both verbal and written opposition to the Bill.

The then Foreign Minister had written to the Foreign Minister of Canada and met the Canadian High Commissioner in Colombo and sought intervention to prevent the enactment of the Bill. The Sri Lanka community in Canada has also made written submissions and met with several MPP opposing the Bill.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its Missions in Ottawa and Toronto continue to engage with the relevant authorities in the Canadian Government on this matter. The Canadian Foreign Ministry has confirmed that the Government of Canada has not made a finding that there was "genocide" in Sri Lanka. Most recently, on 07th February, 2022, the Sri Lankan High Commission in Canada issued a Media Statement refuting the allegation of Tamil genocide in Sri Lanka.
