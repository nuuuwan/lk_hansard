, , right from 2017 onwards, all international banks advised the then Government not to borrow in the way they planned. They were advised from 2017 and 2018 onwards that if they borrowed like that, in time to come, the economy of Sri Lanka would be under unacceptable, tremendous pressure; they were advised by all the international banks that there will be tremendous pressure on the economy. The reason why they were told not to borrow like that was because there would be a bundling impact in 2021 and 2022.

So, all financial experts made them certain suggestions. The first suggestion was, for the then Government to extend the maturities of ISBs to ensure that there would be no bundling impact in 2021 and 2022, but the then Government neglected that advice. Then, the second advice was, if they really wanted to borrow money, to borrow at lengthy maturity periods so that there would be a less impact on the economy. But, all those advices which were given at that time were neglected by the Yahapalana Government.

[4.04 p.m.] ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Diana Gamage) Hon. Presiding Member, thank you for the time permitted.

I wish to bring to the attention of this House an issue which has arisen within the last 24 hours. We, as a sovereign and an independent nation that suffered a 30-year war, know the pain and the repercussions that it brings to a nation, the suffering of innocent women and children and about the lives of the youth that were taken away. We are still in the process of rebuilding this nation.

1477 1478

[

2022 24

We, Sri Lankans, are dear friends of Russia and Ukraine, have so many bilateral agreements and do trading with those two countries. Therefore, any pain or hurt that is being endured by those countries is a concern to us. Hence, I implore President Putin himself to seek a better way to communicate.

Sir, so many of our societies have come such a long way from the days of war, but nowhere near enough not to remember what it truly cost us on all sides. The suffering continues to ripple through time like when dropping a stone in a pool of water. We are all a family on this earth and our neighbours are the ones who are, in many cases, closer to us than the rest, sharing many aspects of our cultures and traditions. I urge President Putin to remember this and reconsider the methods he chooses to send out a message to the world which is now so interdependent and connected, in which citizens from so many lands travel to other nations, sharing their identities, learning from their environments and coming together to build the future we all strive for, an effort to which we can put our greater strength to overcome the difficulties that we all inevitably face in going forward. Therefore, I tell President Putin, with the great power you hold, you take the chance here and now to find an alternative to war, thereby supporting the potential we have to build an even more established, united global community in future.

It is peace that we all in this world need and peace it should be. As a nation, we too have gone through the pain and the difficulties of war and still, we are facing the issues that came up through that war. Therefore, being dear friends of those two countries, with whom we do so much of trading and share our friendship, I urge President Putin, on behalf of all Sri Lankans in this country, to rethink of another alternative than going into war, which destroys peace.

Thank you.

A research on the child disciplinary method in schools of Sri Lanka has been conducted by the National Child Protection Authority. A research book related to the said study has been published and pilot projects have been conducted targeting teachers.

Also, in addition, the following programmes are being implemented by the Department of Probation and Child Care Services:

Raising awareness of parents at the village level on good parenting since the year 2021.

Implementation of child empowerment programmes on the theme of how to become a praiseworthy child since the year 2021.

Skills development programmes implemented through childrens clubs/childrens council programme maintained with the objective of bestowing a child with moral values and knowledge to the society, training and empowering children through leadership programmes and spiritual development programmes to develop the discipline they need in order to build a non-violent society.

Attention is paid to the physical and emotional problems of children at the village level through the Rural Child Development Committee executed by this Department, and these committees are thereby acting as social security networks for the protection of children.

This strengthens the coordination intervention required to prevent child abuse. (b) (i) Initial activities to appoint an Expert Committee have been commenced to seek views and recommendations on new legal reforms related to physical punishment, and the approval of the Board of Directors of the National Child Protection Authority has been received for that matter. Accordingly, the related works are to be commenced soon. (ii) Accepting complaints lodged through 1929 Child Line, letters, faxes and other methods and subjecting such complaints to be investigated by the Special Police Investigation Unit of the National Child Protection Authority, local police stations, Investigation Division and Legal Division. Also, taking legal action where necessary and providing required psychosocial support to those children through the psychosocial section.

Regulating the police investigations and lawsuits on physical and mental abuses against children.

Child Rights Promotion Officers recruited by the Department of Probation and Child Care Services have been attached to each District Secretariat and Divisional Secretariat.

Various awareness programmes are conducted by these officers at village level, and opportunities have been made available to report to these officers on child abuses.

pportunities have been made available to lodge complaints to the Head Office also, and the investigation of those complaints is done by the district and regional officers.

(iii) The legal authority to deal with physical punishments and other forms of child abuses is vested in the Police and the court. No legal provision to act through an administrative mechanism external to

criminal justice has yet been introduced for such punishments to be taken as grievances without being reported to the Police or the court. However, informing the public and giving preventive education to avoid physical punishments and violence on children are effective. Also, the National Child Protection Authority and public institutions including the Ministry of Education and all schools, the Ministry of Health and all government hospitals as well as the Ministry of Mass Media can take action in this regard. The National Child Protection Authority is already conducting islandwide awareness campaigns to prevent violence against children.

(c) Not applicable.
