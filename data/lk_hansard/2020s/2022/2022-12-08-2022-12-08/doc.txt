I just want to let him know that the Hon. President is working with the Ministry of Investment Promotion to start a new Export Processing Zone in Mankulam, to upgrade the Palaly Airport and the Trincomalee Port and to have an Export Processing Zone or a Free Trade Zone in the Trincomalee Harbour. I am sure that will have a big impact on the North.

( ) (The Hon. Mano Ganesan) What about bungee jumping? ( ) (The Hon. Dilum Amunugama) Yes, that will also be there. I will explain.

So, we have earned Rs. 218 million only by exhibiting and through events. Then, for initiating bungee jumping, they have paid us US Dollars 20,000 and they will bring in 10,000 jumpers each year. Each jump will cost US Dollars 500. We are hoping to start it very soon. A Japanese company has already signed a contract with us.

( ) (The Hon. Dilum Amunugama) . That is the charge of the Japanese company.

( ) (The Hon. Mano Ganesan) That is fine.

Then this morning, we saw the Hon. Leader of the Opposition raising a Question by Private Notice regarding the poverty conditions in this country today. He said that poverty, as per the World Bank's Report, has increased to 26 per cent. I would like to qualify his statement. Though the national poverty rate is 26 per cent, in the plantation sector, it is over 50 per cent. . 51 . . . . . - - 26 51 .

We also saw that the Hon. Ali Sabry, Minister of Foreign Affairs, had gone to the United Nations General Assembly - UNGA- and stated that this current crisis in the country has opened new opportunities for reform. That is correct; we also agree. . . .

Hon. Deputy Chairman, that letter states, I quote:

It is evident from the aforementioned provisions in the Sri Lanka Electricity Act, which is the industry Act for the electricity industry, general policy guidelines of pricing could be issued by the Hon. Minister and that such policy may be framed in the form of a tariff structure formula or by any other method. In terms of Section 30(2)(c) of the Act, as aforesaid, the PUCSL would be statutorily obliged to give effect to such policy. It is observed that neither the Sri Lanka Electricity Act nor the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka Act, No. 35 of 2002 contain any provision that empower the PUCSL to vary or act in variance of such policy guidelines.

I will leave it for the Members of Parliament to decide what has to be done. I do not think this type of behaviour can go on. If you are a chairman of a public corporation, you must know how you should behave. You are not a monkey who dances to the tune of the organ. . . . . . ?

I think we all have to get together and think how this financial sector is to be lifted. We can blame each other; I can say I am not responsible. But, the fact is that we cannot have the banks collapsing. So, we will come back to you, to the Committee on Public Finance and the Committee on Banking and Financial Services. That is why I wanted that oversight committee on banking appointed. It is a very serious problem and will go on for some time and I want the House to be aware of it. . -

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) . . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Yes, Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva?

511 512

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Hon. President, you are raising a very important point. I would like you to take a look at the domestic debt exchange of Ghana, which is coming into force this week. It is a voluntary exchange, Hon. President. They are actually addressing the elephant in the room. Here, we are talking about all kinds of issues, but we are not really addressing the domestic debt issue. If we take the banking sector, we are not addressing how we are going to ring fence the banking sector; we are still trying to unwind the problem. That is a huge issue, Hon. President, but nobody is talking about it.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Okay. Let us address it once we get onto this. Secondly, I reckon that you agree that we must have a new law to regulate the casinos. I think the Singapore's law is something to look into and maybe, the Committee on Public Finance can send us a report on regulation of casinos.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) I appreciate that, Hon. President. Originally, it was sent without a regulator.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) I know. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) But, there is one thing, we got them to agree to the deadline of 30th September, 2023 to set up the regulator.

So, we hope they will keep to it. We are also aware of the need for casinos to come up, but the regulator must come up by the 30th of September, 2023.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Singapore has not only looked at the aspect of regulation, but also at the health aspect, which is one good thing in it. Then, what do we do with the Sri Lankans? Are they to enter those places or not? They have their fundamental rights. You cannot ask the foreigners to come and not them. So, there are also many social issues which we will have to go into and give us a full comprehensive report on casinos. And, how many casinos can we bear? We cannot have a casino at every petrol station. So, we have to decide on how many casinos we want to have.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) There are so many online casinos.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) I know. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) But, none of them are paying any taxes. Even as of today, there are a number of online casinos. So, we also told the Ministry of Finance that they will have to urgently bring an amendment to the existing law so that they could somehow register those online casinos because, probably, billions of rupees are lost since we do not collect a single cent of tax from them.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) I agree with you. That is why I said I want Parliament to go into it and come up with a comprehensive report, which you all can do quickly and then, we can sort that out.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) . We have very difficult choices to make. No one here likes to make those choices. If we do not make them, the economy breaks down and the foreigners who are going to help us - our bilateral creditors - might not help us. So, we are in a really difficult situation. Who is the politician who would like to raise the electricity tariff by 50 per cent? That is why you gave the job to me and no one else wanted it. So, I had to take up the task. - [Interruption.} . .

( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) I will ask the House to agree on that. ( ) (Hon. Members) We will have a Select Committee. We agree.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) So, you all come up with a Select Committee. I have nothing against it.

( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) Okay, we will go for a Select Committee.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) You all decide on that. I do not think there is anything to hide. Our system had a lot of structural defects, which got triggered off by reducing taxes. I think my predecessor, the former President, has accepted that. But, let us go into it and see what has happened and what the structural defects are, because we must remedy them also.

Whereupon THE HON. IMRAN MAHAROOF left the Chair, and THE HON. WEERASUMANA WEERASINGHE took the Chair.

[4.45 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, for the opportunity to say a few words on the last day of the Committee Stage Discussion of the Budget, 2023.

As we have right through this Budget Debate, particularly at the Committee Stage, explained, the Budget Proposals that have been made to the House do not take into consideration the serious economic crisis the country faces. These Proposals are no different to the Budget Proposals that had been made in the previous years and it looks as though their business, as usual, is not taking into consideration the very serious financial crisis into which this country has fallen.

We have highlighted many of these matters. Often, speakers on the Government side have asked the question, All right, what is your alternate proposal? What do you propose then? You are only criticizing. Yesterday, some of us addressed the press and made certain alternate proposals, and I want to just mention some of those here. I call them no-brainers, you do not have to even think about them. By these proposals, examples, we show that you can increase revenue severalfold without affecting the ordinary people of this country. One is with regard to the Withholding Tax. The Withholding Tax has been reintroduced and it is at 5 per cent. By having it at 5 per cent, the Government can raise Rs. 90 billion. If you fix it at 15 per cent, you can, at source, recover Rs. 270 billion, an increase of Rs. 180 billion. That is why I call it a no-brainer. These are taxes which, anyway, are liable. It is just that if you do not tax them at source, there is every chance that those taxes are never paid.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have two more minutes. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Okay, Sir.

Then, I will give only that one example. So, anyway, that tax has to be paid and therefore, you can tax it at source and raise your Rs. 270 billion, Rs. 180 billion than the current amount. That will make a huge difference,

591 592

particularly with regard to the insufficient allocations that have been made to health, schools and maternity benefits, which require only Rs. 6 billion, if the Government were to take over that. So, that will make a huge contribution to the economy. At least, it will go up by another 10 per cent.

Sir, due to lack of time, I will only say that we will not participate in Vote on the Third Reading, as we did at the Vote on the Second Reading, for the same reason that, whatever our criticisms be on the Budget Proposals, the President has made overtures to settle the national question which has plagued this country since Independence. So, as a gesture of goodwill, we will not oppose the Government today. But, I must record the fact that that hope of anything substantial happening in that front received a body blow when the Hon. Speaker convened a meeting of some Members of Parliament this afternoon to, by consensus, nominate a person to the Constitutional Council.

Of the seven Members of this House who constitute to the Counstitutional Council, we know who the Speaker is, who the Prime Minister is, who the Leader of the Opposition is, who the Presidents nominee is and who the Governments nominee is; all five persons belong to one section of the society in this country. Fortunately, the main Opposition Partys nominee is the Hon. Kabir Hashim, who is the sixth Member. We nominated a person from the main Tamil Opposition Party, the third largest party in this Parliament, and that nomination was resisted by those who were elected to this Parliament on the SLPP ticket and who claim they are independent Members and are seated with us in the Opposition benches. Going back to the majoritarian mindset was perfectly displayed this afternoon and that behaviour has dented very seriously any hopes of ethnic reconciliation in this country.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) ... . 6 .

I did not say anything about any other factor that was mentioned by the Hon. Member who spoke just before me. I only said that in the composition of the Constitutional Council, out of the seven Members of Parliament, we know who five Members are, that the sixth Member is the Hon. Kabir Hashim and naturally, the last and the seventh Member must be our nominee. If it goes on the basis of who are the majority and who are the minority in numbers, then that is yet again a display of majoritarianism; .
