BUREAU OF REHABILITATION BILL: DETERMINATION OF

THE SUPREME COURT

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I wish to announce to Parliament that I have received the Determination of the Supreme Court in respect of the Bill titled Bureau of Rehabilitation, which was challenged in the Supreme Court in terms of Article 121(1) of the Constitution.

On an overall consideration of the provisions of the Bill, the Supreme Court has made the following Determination:

A. The Bill, as a whole, is inconsistent with Article

12(1) of the Constitution and as such, may be enacted only by the special majority required by Article 84(2) of the Constitution. However, this inconsistency shall cease if:

(i) All references to ex-combatants, violent extremist groups and any other group of persons are deleted from the Bill; and

(ii) The Bill is limited to the rehabilitation of drug dependent persons and such other persons as may be identified by law.

B. Clauses 3, 4(a), 4(b), 6(b), 23, 24, 25(2), 27, 28(1),

34, 35 and 37 [the definition of "rehabilitation"] of the Bill are inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution and as such, may be enacted only by the special majority required by Article 84(2) of the Constitution.

However, the said inconsistencies shall cease if the said Clauses are amended as follows:

Clause 3 - "The objective of the Bureau shall be to rehabilitate drug dependant persons or any other person as may be identified by law as a person who requires rehabilitation and which may include treatment and adoption of various therapies in order to ensure effective reintegration and reconciliation, through developing socio-economic standards."

Clause 4(a) - "Provide treatment and rehabilitation to drug dependent persons who in terms of the Drug Dependent Persons (Treatment and Rehabilitation) Act, No. 54 of 2007 request treatment and rehabilitation or are required by such law to be provided with treatment and rehabilitation."

Clause 4(b) - "provide rehabilitation to any person who in terms of a relevant law, requests rehabilitation or is required by such law to be provided with rehabilitation;"

Clause 4 - by the insertion of the following new paragraph (e) - "advice the Minister with regard to programmes for rehabilitation, treatment and aftercare having regard to the basic norms of Human Rights."

Clause 6(b) - "the following five members (hereinafter referred to as "appointed members") be appointed by the Minister:-

(i) two persons who shall possess academic and professional qualifications and have experience in the field of rehabilitation;

(ii) two persons who shall possess academic and professional qualifications and have experience in the field of social integration; and

(iii) one person who shall possess academic and professional qualifications and have experience in the field of law and order.

Clause 23 - by the deletion of the words "ex-combatants, members of violent extremist groups, violent extremist person and any other person or group of persons" and this Clause being suitably amended to reflect the position that only the rehabilitation of drug dependant persons and such persons who are identified by law and whose rehabilitation is provided for by law will take place at a centre managed by the Bureau.

1855 1856

Clause 23 - by the insertion of new sub-clauses numbered as Clauses 23(2) to 23(7) as proposed by the Attorney-General and referred to at pages 36 and 37 of the Determination, subject to the following:

(i) Clause 23(3)(a) - by the insertion of the words "and may examine the records and log books maintained at the Centre" at the end of this paragraph.

(ii) Clause 23(5) - by the addition of the words "including an order that such person be immediately admitted to a Government Hospital for medical treatment and that the Officer-in-Charge of such Centre immediately inform the Court that made the order for the rehabilitation of such person of the findings of the Government Medical Officer" at the end of this Clause.

Clause 24 - by the insertion of the words "as may be prescribed" after the words "or any unauthorised article."

Clause 25(2) - by the insertion of Clause 25(2) as proposed by the Attorney-General and referred to at page 40 of the Determination and subject to the following:

(i) the addition of the words "or an Attorney-at

-Law representing such person" at the end of Clause 25(2)(a), and in the proviso to Clause 25(2) after the words in parentheses;

(ii) the deletion of the words "within a Centre

Clause 28 - by the insertion of the following new paragraph proposed by the Attorney-General - "It shall be the duty of the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation, or a person duly authorised by him to immediately inform the Magistrate within the Judicial Division in which such Centre is located of any exercise of powers under Section 28(1) and (2)."

Clause 34 - by the insertion of the following proviso at the end of Clause 34(1) -

Provided that the Council shall not have the power to make rules in respect of any matter in which regulations are required to be made in terms of this Act.

Clause 35 - should be amended in the manner referred to at pages 29 and 30 of the Determination.

Clause 37 - rehabilitation means the procedures and programmes for rehabilitation, treatment, aftercare and support that shall be prescribed by regulations made under this Act.

C. Clause 17 of the Bill is inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution and as such, may be enacted only by the special majority required by Article 84(2) of the Constitution.

D. Clause 25(1) of the Bill is inconsistent with Article 14(A) of the Constitution and as such, may be enacted only by the special majority required by Article 84(2) of the Constitution. However, the said inconsistency shall cease if Clause 25(1) is amended by the addition of the words or the provisions of the Right to Information Act at the end of the said Clause.

E. Clause 26 and 28(2) of the Bill are inconsistent with Article 11 of the Constitution and as such, may be enacted only by the special majority required by Article 84(2) of the Constitution and upon being approved by the people at a Referendum as stipulated by Article 83 of the Constitution.

The said inconsistencies shall cease if:

(i) the words without reasonable cause in Clause 26 are deleted; and

(ii) the words all such means including in Clause 28(2) are deleted.

F. Clause 29 of the Bill is inconsistent with Article 76 read together with Articles 3 and 4 of the Constitution and as such, may be enacted only by the special majority required by Article 84(2) of the Constitution and upon being approved by the people at a Referendum as stipulated by Article 83 of the Constitution.

The said inconsistency shall cease if Clause 29 is amended by the deletion of the words or any rule.

Of course, it is not acceptable if they charge unnecessarily, privately or illegally.

If it is only the royalty that has been charged by them, yes, it has to charged in order for the Government to earn revenue.

[12.38p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on this very important Constitutional amendment that has been presented to this House. I say, important, not because I say that there are any important contents in this Bill; it is important because this Bill is being touted as an important reform to the Constitution of this country, while it is not. It is my intention today to inform the country as to what this amendment actually seeks to do.

Now, there are many Members in this House who voted for the Seventeenth Amendment to the

Constitution. The same Members voted for the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Those very Members voted for the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution and they voted for the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution and today they are all ready to vote for the Twenty Second Amendment to the Constitution, which will become the Twenty First Amendment. They are like a pendulum - they swing from one end to the other. I have my respect for the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera seated there. Right or wrong, he stands on one end. He does not swing like a pendulum.

I say this because when the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution was passed in this House, nobody cast a vote against it. Only one Member of Parliament abstained from voting. When the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution was passed in this House, only one Member -the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera- voted against it. Everybody else voted for it. That shows what the Seventeenth Amendment and what the Nineteenth Amendment sought to do, and how even Members in the Opposition benches were conscious of the expectation in the country and they went along with it, particularly the Nineteenth Amendment.

When the Nineteenth Amendment was presented to this House, I think the Government had only 48 Members; the Opposition had over 150 Members - yet it was passed. That was soon after an election. But, those very Members - out of that 150, I think about 60 odd Members - later voted for the Twentieth Amendment, including the Hon. Minister of Justice, who presented this Bill. The Hon. Minister of Justice pleaded with the other Members to give them an opportunity to correct a wrong that they have committed by passing the Twentieth Amendment.

I ask in all sincerity, from the turn of this millennium - seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, twentieth, twenty first and every time - you say that you have made a mistake and you want to change it. What type of Parliament is this, that swings like this from one end to the other? Every time you say, I made a mistake, let me correct it. It is no wonder that the country says, to be done with these 225! No wonder that everyone in the country today says, throw these 225 out; you are misleading us; you are taking us for jokers. The people of the country are not jokers. They know what they are asking for.

Why is this Twenty Second Amendment to the Constitution coming today in the very same Parliament that adopted the Twentieth Amendment? It is coming because people in the country want to democratize this country; want to change the Constitution of this country. They want a system change - not tinkering with the Constitution. Some tinkering happened from the Seventeenth Amendment onwards. But this Bill that is before this House today does not even tinker with the Constitution. After it is passed - if it is passed - it will still retain all the powers of the Executive Presidency that the President enjoys under the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution. I have challenged people for debates. I had one on Monday night. No one is able to show that it

1957 1958

[ ]

2022 20

actually reduces Presidential powers. So this is a fraud on the country; this is an absolute fraud. People are asking for a change; a total change. They do not want the Executive Presidency.

How have the people of this country been taken for a ride? Presidential Election Manifestos of 1994 said, Abolish Executive Presidency within six months. From 1994, that six months have still not come. Now, not to be outdone, every other candidate at every other Presidential Election comes before people and say, I will abolish the Executive Presidency. Vote for me. Eventually in 2015, President Maithreepala Sirisena who is here also said that. When he became the candidate, the first promise that he made to the country was, I will abolish Executive Presidency. Then in the manifesto, small adjustments were made and he said, "We will first do what is not required to be done with a Referendum and then we will bring in a new Constitution." It is only President Gotabaya Rajapaksa who did not promise to abolish Executive Presidency, but even he said he would bring a new Constitution within one year. That was a promise. On the 3rd of January, 2020 when he addressed this House, when he made his Throne Speech, he said, I will bring a new Constitution within this year and he pointed to four factors.

One of those was the Executive; he said, to deal with the Executive - [Interruption]. Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan, your telephone conversation can be heard on the microphone here. If you do not want to listen to what is happening in the House, please go out and speak. The former President said, "There are four things that are necessary for changing the Constitution." No.1 is the Executive; 2. Electoral system; 3. Provincial Councils and No.4 - as he termed it - Independence of the Judiciary. So, the first matter that he identified was the Executive. Everyone has promised this country that the Executive Presidency will be revisited. Not only then, before he relinquished the Office, in his last address to the nation, he said, We will do away with the Twentieth Amendment as a first step and then, we will deal with the Executive Presidency. A day later, the Prime Minister who just took over office - the incumbent President - in his address to the nation very specifically said, We will abolish the Executive Presidency. That was only a few months ago. But, what are we left with?

The history shows, as I said, from 1994 abolition of the Executive Presidency has been promised and the solution to the Tamil national question has also been promised consistently. In 2011, President Mahinda Rajapaksa famously told India three times that he would fully implement the provisions of the Thirteenth Amendment and go beyond that and make devolution of power meaningful. He said that three times in Joint Statements; but not done yet. None of these promises are ever kept. None of these promises are ever kept. That is why the citizenry of this country is asking for a fundamental change. They are exhausted. They know that this does not happen. When we talk about this in meetings, we are told, Incrementally, we will do it. But, I can show you that nothing is done even incrementally. You keep going further down and I will show how that is done.

Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution established a Constitutional Council.

Why? Because, there should not be political interference. When you say, "appointment of Independent Commissions", the key word is, "independence." Therefore, the Constitutional Council itself had to be independent. In order for the Constitutional Council to be independent, it required seven out of the ten Members should not be Members of any political party. That is why they came from outside. They should not be Members of any political party. That is how you assure independence.

The Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution did away with that. I spoke in this House. I made the longest speech on the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution in this House, on the 8th of September, 2010- hardly a few months after I entered this august Assembly for the first time. That is because the UNP had withdrawn from the Chamber and it was left to us and the JVP to make speeches on the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution. In the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution, the Constitutional Council was done away with.

Then, the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution came, because you had promised to abolish the Executive Presidency - I am talking about the former President Maithreepala Sirisena . In your then manifesto, you said, We will first do what is possible, without a Referendum. There itself, there was a step down. No step up; but a step down. Then, the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution Bill was prepared. That went to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court struck down a few matters- another step down for the second time. When we came to this House, 150 Members were in the Opposition and they opposed to several matters. In order to get it through, they went a further a step down. That is when the composition of the Constitutional Council became politicized; 7:3 became 3:7. There were only three independent members and the other seven were the Members of Parliament. By definition, they were politicians and members of political parties. There was no independence thereafter. There it went. Even now, what the Hon. Minister of Justice is saying is, Re-establishing the Constitutional Council." It is that - it is that Constitutional Council which is not independent. So, how will it make appointments to the Independent Commissions? That is a step down.

Then, what happened? The Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution was passed. Now, you say that you want to correct it, because people who protested demanded a change. They want the Executive Presidency abolished and they also said, Do away with the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution first.

So, if you do away with the Twentieth Amendment, you have to go back at least to the Nineteenth Amendment. I have always said that the Nineteenth Amendment is not the perfect legislation even at the time it was passed, because of this several compromises that had been made. But, we did it because immediately thereafter there was a Constitutional Assembly created by

1959 1960

the whole Parliament and we went into the creation of a new Constitution. A draft of the new Constitution was presented to this House on the 16th of January, 2019 by the incumbent President as the then Prime Minister, for which there was consensus among all the parties. There were a few adjustments perhaps necessary with regard to electoral system, but everything else was agreed. Even power sharing arrangements were totally agreed. But that draft never saw the light of day. That was dumped and then the Twentieth Amendment strengthened the Executive Presidency.

Now you are telling this to the people, because people want to change this; they want to abolish the Executive Presidency. You are lying to the people saying, This is a first step towards that", when in fact, none of the powers of the Executive President are taken away by this Bill. It is false. You are lying to the people of this country. " ; ; . . . .

The Constitutional Council appointments show that the Government will have a control over the Constitutional Council.

The Supreme Court also has swung like a pendulum, unfortunately. In the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution Bill, they permitted various changes and said, This does not require a Referendum. But, now, for those identical changes, the same Supreme Court says, You require a Referendum. Now, people have to be told this as well. It is not only the Parliament that swings like a pendulum, but also the Supreme Court. Change that Supreme Court also. Ask them also to go home. If they cannot read and understand their own Determination on the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution Bill. With the very same words, within a few years, they say now, This requires a Referendum.

How can that be? They are supposed to be learned. So, how can that be? Of course, today, there was a good Determination of the Supreme Court on the Bureau of Rehabilitation Bill. As it was presented, we said, Withdraw it. It goes against the fundamental principles that a person must be presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law- not to be just rounded up him, taken and put into rehabilitation. I do not know why the Hon. Minister even presented this Bill in the House. I have asked the question publicly whether the Cabinet should be rehabilitated for even presenting this Bill. This is the second time that I have come across where the Supreme Court has said that the whole of the Bill is inconsistent with the Constitution. First time, it was the Broadcasting Authority Bill brought in some years ago. -[Interruption.]This may have been done when you were not the Minister. But when you are the Minister and when you present it, surely you should read the contents of the Bill. Why do you present a horrendous piece of legislation like this? At least on this occasion, the Supreme Court has shut it down. But, on the Twenty Second Amendment to the Constitution Bill, they have been swinging this way and that way. - [Interruption.]

( ) (An Hon. Member) The Supreme Court is moving like a pendulum. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Supreme Court is also moving like a pendulum. How will people have confidence in the Supreme Court, when it changes its mind on constitutional interpretation, which is sole and exclusive preserve of theirs? They jealously guard it also; and then they swing one end to another. Now, because of this, I say with respect, people have asked for a change and what you are trying to do is to pull wool over the eyes of the people. You are pretending to the country that you are making some reform when, in fact, you are not making any reform.

You are not making any reform and this is dangerous. I must say there are no harmful provisions in this Bill, but the harm is that you are showing the country something that is not there; and that is potentially harmful because the confidence that people have in this institution, has been eroded and totally destroyed by now. When they find that the Parliament has also misled them - make them think that there is some major reform when, in fact, there is no reform - they will only take to the streets. They will have no confidence in their representatives who have fooled them once again.

The same thing happened with devolution. When the Thirteenth Amendment was enacted, we said, It is not enough. We did not accept it. But even what was enacted was never implemented in full. It kept coming down, step down and step down. Then, whatever that had been given to the Provinces was taken back - transport authority and various things. The pinnacle of that was the Divineguma Bill - fifteen powers given to the Provinces were swiped away and taken to the Centre - a step down. Whilst telling everybody else we will go for Thirteen Plus, but it is minus, minus and minus. It is identical. This is your approach. You are telling the people that you are going forward, you are democratizing, but, in fact, you are strengthening a dictator. , . . , , . .

This is a very dangerous thing that you are doing to the country and I must warn the Hon. Members of this House that let us stop pretending; let us stop fooling the people or attempting to fool the people. People are never fooled. If you want to do a reform, do it, take it to the people at a referendum. Why are you fighting shy of a referendum? After all people have asked for this. When people have asked for this, take it to the people, get their

1961 1962

consent. That is how you make reforms in the country. You must make a fundamental change. Bring a new constitution. Do not pretend; do not lie to the people and try to make them fools.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . 58 .

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 50 .

[2.50 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Presiding Member, today, we are debating the Twenty Second Amendment to the Constitution Bill. I must say, at the outset, that the Twenty Second Amendment to the Constitution comes nowhere near the Nineteenth Amendment, which was done away with by the former Government by bringing in the Twentieth Amendment to Parliament.

The Twenty Second Amendment to the Constitution can be improved if the Government goes ahead with the amendment, allowing the President to make appointments on the Constitutional Council's recommendations with the agreement of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. With that, there would be an improvement. We also see some other positive features such as the inclusion of the National Procurement Commission and the Audit Service Commission among other Commissions. Higher public officials would be appointed more neutrally because of the involvement of the Constitutional Council. One recent experience we had was the appointment of the Governor of the Central Bank, which was a political appointment unheard-of. He resigned from his State Ministership and was appointed the Governor of the Central Bank. Where in the world that happens, I do not know. But, that is what happened in Sri Lanka. Now, even the appointment of the Governor of the Central Bank is going to be brought under the Constitutional Council. Under the Nineteenth Amendment, in making appointments to Ministries, the President acted on the advice of the Prime Minister, but now, it has been reduced to "consults the Prime Minister". So, this Amendment does not come anywhere near the Nineteenth Amendment. However, I admit that if Amendments are properly moved, there would be some positive aspects in it.

We, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, as a party, brought to Parliament a Twenty First Amendment to the Constitution. The fundamental basis of that Amendment is the abolition of some of the powers of the Executive President. We have looked back at the 44 years of the Presidential System in this country. While there are positives and negatives of it, overall, we have come to the conclusion that the Executive Presidency has actually been a liability because it has not been sufficiently accountable to the Legislature and there has been abuse of power. So, the Twenty First Amendment that we presented to Parliament abolishes those draconian powers of the Executive President. Somebody said, Then, it has to be put for a Referendum. So, what is the problem? A Referendum means, apart from Parliament, the people also decide. But, the Government has decided to ignore that. Therefore, they have brought in this Twenty Second Amendment to the Constitution.

Sir, we are proposing that Clause 44(3) be amended by deleting the last paragraph of it, which states, "Provided however, preceding provisions of this paragraph shall not preclude the President from assigning any subject or function to himself on the advice of the Prime Minister and accordingly, any reference in the Constitution or any written law to the Minister to whom such subject or function is assigned, shall be read and construed as a reference to the President". Why do we say that it should be deleted? What we are saying is - the President has the power, as determined by court, to hold the Ministry of Defence - that we do not have to specifically mention that the President is not precluded from assigning any subject he wants. I think it goes without saying what the President's powers are. I do not think the deletion of this provision, in any way, alters the powers of the President. We have had an argument about this. That argument needs to be looked at in the context of the law and political theory. Look at the Westminster system. There, we have a Prime Minister. The Prime Minister can hold any office. But, it would be unheard-of to think that the British Prime Minister would hold the Defence Ministry, the Finance Ministry or some other Ministry. No, the Head of the Cabinet is the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer has a right to appoint Ministers, change Ministers and change and reassign their subjects. The Chief Executive Officer of the Sri Lankan Cabinet is the President of the country. Therefore, the President of the country does not have to assign to himself any subjects. He should assign those to the others. It is like being the monitor in a class. The monitor gives different people different responsibilities and makes sure that those responsibilities are carried out and also evaluates whether they are being properly carried out or not. Therefore, we are suggesting that that provision be deleted. It does not alter the powers of the President; silence does not alter the powers of the President.

[3.49 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to address this august Assembly on a very important Amendment envisaged to the present Constitution.

It was expected that this Bill would restore the essence of the more progressive Nineteenth Amendment. But, unfortunately, centralization of power around a single individual still exists. The checks and balances that were expected in a meaningful manner have not been included. The independence of the Public Service, transfer of power to Parliament, checks and balances which could curtail the immense powers of the President and transfer of powers between President and Prime Minister are missing. The fundamentals of public finance and accountability, too, are missing.

Some of the offending areas are the President holding portfolios, appointing Ministers without the advice of the Prime Minister, the Presidents power to determine the number of Ministers and Ministries and his assignment of subjects and functions to such Ministries, the President's power to appoint all Secretaries to Ministries at his own discretion, his discretion to dissolve Parliament early and the ability to control or influence seven of the ten members of the Constitutional Council, thereby, undermining the independence of the institutions to which appointments are made through the Council.

Thus, these proposals seem to satisfy the political ambitions of a few politicians and political parties rather than genuinely trying to address the crisis in governance, which has plagued Sri Lanka so far. But, whatever the shortcomings and discrepancies are, this Bill is a step in the right direction. To vote against it would be to perpetuate the present system. In arguing for perfection, we should not turn out to be the enemy of the good.

No doubt, the advantages and disadvantages were envisaged at the time the Presidential System was introduced in 1978. The advantages trotted out at the time were, one, quick decision-making due to the centralization of power around a single individual; two, the Presidential discretion in appointments - thus, the appointees were directly responsible to the President - three, the whole country elected the President and therefore, the entire country was the electorate; four, the fixed tenure of office, which ensured stability to the country; five, the President was above party politics and therefore, was insulated from party politics and six, the Ministers were individually responsible to the President. That made President J.R. Jayewardene to obtain undated letters of resignation from each Minister and Member of Parliament of his party.

On the other hand, the disadvantages identified were as follows: one, it is prone to dictatorship or abuse of the office, being dangerous to the democratic process; two, the separation of powers can cause delays in the execution of government programmes, if Executive-Legislative relations were not properly managed. Therefore, a friction among government organs was contemplated. Three, lack of flexibility in the tenure of office of the President. A Parliamentary system could act according to the circumstances and be flexible and it is not so under the Presidential system. Four, it is very expensive to operate. The Parliamentary system was considered to be more cost-effective, but the Presidents power to spend directly created opportunity for lack of fiscal discipline and even all forms of corruption. Five, due to the absence of party discipline, unlike in a Parliamentary system, the relationship between the Executive and the Legislature was prone to disagreements and was less easy to manage. With the Government Party now being of one hue and the President of a different colour, this possibility is even more plausible today. Six, the Presidential lobbying can encourage corruption. Suppose certain groups within the Governing Party could be cajoled to join the party of the President, there could be misuse of power by the President.

We have seen the contradictions that emanated due to lack of understanding between the President and the Legislature during the time of Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike as well during the "Y ahapalana" Government. Therefore, concentration of power in a single individual can have innumerable implications. But, it was thought that a strong Executive could bring benefits to the minorities. The President, if he wanted to, could, with his unfettered powers, bring relief to the problems of the minorities. But, how far that would be possible would depend upon the personality of the President. So far, the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe has not catered to the voice of the chauvinists and the champions of the ethnocracy openly.

The transitional provisions in the Bill allows the present incumbent to continue until the full term of office of the present Ninth Parliament. Therefore, as a person somewhat acceptable to the non-Sinhala Buddhists also, he has an opportunity to take up matters of importance for the future of this country. As I understand them, they are, one, repayment of national debt through proper fiscal management. The way we diplomatically manage the international community is intrinsically interwoven with that problem. Two, take cognizance of the recent UN Resolution that was adopted with only seven countries standing by Sri Lanka and commit the country to conform to the expectations of the world body. The country's supporters among the international community have steadily decreased every year and the next time, I expect even China to abstain from voting for Sri Lanka. Our bravado statements have only exposed us as to who we are. Three, knowing the nature of the Tamil ethnic problem and the long history of the Sri Lankan Tamils extending beyond 3,000 years in the Island, it would be better for the country if the President could solve our problem once and for all by granting total devolution of powers to the North and the East of Sri Lanka in order that all communities could travel forward hand in hand within a United Sri Lanka. I would submit that the transitional provisions of the Bill have given the opportunity for the incumbent President and the Members of the Ninth Parliament to work out solutions for our long-standing problems fully and effectively.

It is my studied opinion that a confederation would be the ideal system of government for this country. But, before the present Constitution is changed, the services of India would be paramount due to their responsibility in getting the Thirteenth Amendment into our Constitution.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is up.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Please give me just one more minute, Sir.

Any attempt of arbitrary replacement of the present Constitution with a new Constitution could deprive the Tamils of even the limited powers granted by the

Thirteenth Amendment under the unitary Constitution. Therefore, in the formulation of a new Constitution for Sri Lanka, the services of India would be a sine qua non as far as the future of the Sri Lankan Tamils is concerned.

Sir, I intend supporting this Bill with all its inadequacies and infirmities.

FOOD INSECURITY AMONG PEOPLE OF ESTATES [.. (.49]

( ) (The Hon. Mano Ganesan) , , .

Sir, I move,

Current economic crisis is affecting the plantation worker residents in our country disproportionately more than others. The impact of the economic crisis on this segment had been predicted and interventions sought. But the situation continues to be precarious as per the findings in the reports of following four international organizations:

(1) Special Report of UN Food and Agricultural Organization

and World Food Programme Crop and Food Security Assessment Mission to Sri Lanka.

(2) Sri Lanka Food Security Monitoring Report of United

Nations World Food Programme (WFP).

(3) Economic Survey Report of Sri Lanka Red Cross and

International Committee of the Red Cross.

(4) Report of UN Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms

of Slavery, Mr. Tomoya Obokata, submitted at the United Nations Human Rights Council.

Estate sector households record the highest level of food insecurity in the country at 51 per cent while urban sector at 43 per cent and rural sector at 34 per cent.

Existing government social safety mechanisms do not adequately cover the plantation sector leaving them at the mercy of private companies. This has not worked in the past and will not work now.

Circular #DSD/HO/14/SS/05/01/04/2022 dated 17/10/2022 of Samurdhi Development Department calls for applications from the anticipated beneficiaries for the periods September, October, November with Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance. This circular in Sinhala has not reached the most vulnerable plantation sector.

I propose this House pays special attention to the most vulnerable segment of the Sri Lankan community and the Government seeks the support of our international development partners, i.e. UN organizations and the Governments of India, Britain, USA, EU, Japan, Canada and Australia to implement a social safety affirmative action programme in respect of the alarming food insecurity situation in the plantation sector.

[5.20 p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya - State Minister of Foreign Affairs) Hon. Presiding Member, at the outset, I want to thank the Hon. Mano Ganesan for bringing this Adjournment Motion. But, may I also say, Sir, that the Hon. Member took somewhat of a racial tone in speaking on that and I am surprised by his attitude too.

Anyway, I completely agree with him and understand that the people in the estate sector are suffering. But, it is not only the people in the estate sector who are suffering; the people with a low income are also suffering. So, at this juncture, to take a racial tone -

( ) (The Hon. Mano Ganesan) I did not say that only they are suffering. All are suffering, but it is the people in the plantation sector, the marginalized people, who are suffering most. That has been identified by international organizations.

( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) But, you did try to insinuate, Hon. Member, that the Government is deliberately neglecting the estate sector and I want to refuse that allegation. That is all I am saying.

( ) (The Hon. Mano Ganesan) That is not an allegation; the UN is saying that. The reports are also there.

( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Okay, that might be. But, you know very well that before this crisis took place, the estate sector workers were also given Samurdhi. Now, whether there has been a decrease in the number of beneficiaries is something which you have to spell out. - [Interruption.] Okay. The second point is, I am not sure why you want the Minister of Foreign Affairs to answer this Adjournment Motion because food security does not come under that Ministry. But, I just want to make a suggestion. When I was the State Minister of Social Security in charge of Samurdhi, we wanted to introduce a Multidimensional Poverty Index and I certainly think that if we introduce such a scheme, a Multidimensional Poverty Index, the allegations of racism and all those things could be

dropped. But, at this juncture, this is not what we want to hear. We all need to work together in order to solve this problem. However, I will reply on behalf of whatever Ministry concerned.

The estate housing division under the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing has already submitted a concept paper for the approval of the Department of National Planning for creating food security among estate people. The proposal will also be submitted to the World Food Programme.

According to the information received from the Department of Samurdhi Development, the Samurdhi subsidy and other subsidies were given for the months of May, June and July using the funds provided by the World Bank. Treasury funds were used to provide Samurdhi benefits and other regular allowances for the month of August. Arrangements have been made to provide Samurdhi subsidies and other subsidies for the period from September to November using the financial allocations of the Asian Development Bank.

The Circular titled "Food Security and Livelihood Provisions Emergency Assistance Project" bearing No. DSD/HO/14/SS/05/01/04/2022 dated 17.10.2022 has been published in the Tamil language in the official website of the Department of Samurdhi Development. The said Circular has been sent out to all District Samurdhi Directors through WhatsApp so as to inform all the beneficiaries.

( ) (The Hon. Mano Ganesan) I know that. I am not refusing it. But, some estates did not get it because those estates are isolated.

( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Let me finish my speech. I have the right to reply. That is why I said, Hon. Member, that Samurdhi does not come under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I am only answering it. - [Interruption.] Okay. I think the best thing to do is this. I will take this up with my Minister and the President and you also can make your inputs. Then, we can work out some scheme. But, I do not think we really need to apply a racial undertone to this.

The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Slavery, Mr. Tomoya Obokata, visited Sri Lanka from 26th September to 03rd December, 2021. It is recalled that as part of the Governments continuing engagement with the UN system, Sri Lanka has extended a standing invitation to all thematic special procedure mandate holders. Sri Lanka has received 11 special procedure mandate holders during the past seven years since 2015.

In the Report of the Special Rapporteur, he has referred to the living conditions of the workers, especially about housing. Further, in the report, while stating that

2051 2052

the Government of Sri Lanka had taken a number of steps to upgrade the living conditions of the employees such as the construction of single-standing houses, it was acknowledged that the Government of Sri Lanka is cognizant of and is endeavouring to resolve the remaining challenges of the employees. With regard to support and assistance for Sri Lanka from the UN, the Ministry is in constant engagement with the United Nations Resident Coordinators - UNRC's - Office in Colombo as well as with related agencies. In early June, 2022, in response to a request from the Government of Sri Lanka, the United Nations launched a Humanitarian Needs and Priorities Plan" - HNPP - in Sri Lanka, calling for US Dollars 47 million to provide assistance to 1,700,000 people for four months from June to September, 2022. The UNRCs Office is coordinating assistance from the donor community in line with this UN initiative. Among the objectives of the HNPP, there is provision for food assistance, targeted nutrition services and the provision of immediate agricultural support, which allows the resumption of basic productive activities for the maintenance of livelihoods and food and nutrition security.

In addition, in August this year, the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework was signed. That Framework which was finalized in partnership with the Government of Sri Lanka represents a commitment of support at a time of severe economic challenges and will guide the work of the UN system in Sri Lanka until 2027. The Framework is flexible and adaptive; that allows regular adjustments and joint-work plans, through which UN contributions are operationalized in line with evolving national priorities. This is, as far as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is concerned. But, rest assured that I will also speak to the Minister in charge of Samurdhi.

( ) (The Hon. Mano Ganesan) I need a response from the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs to it.

( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Okay. But, it does not come under the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Anyway, I will also speak to the Minister in charge of Samurdhi. Then, he will have a one-on-one discussion with you and see what could be done in order to uplift the conditions of the estate people. But, I would also like to tell you that this is not the time - at this juncture, the country is going through tremendous hardships - to bring up racial issues and all those things to the forefront. Let us all work together and try to uplift the lives of the people of this country.

Thank you. . :. 5.30 .
