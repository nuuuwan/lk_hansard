Hon. Presiding Member, the late Hon. M.S. Sellasamy started his career as a District Chairman of the Ceylon Workers Congress before being elected its General Secretary in 1963. He was also the President of the Estate Staff Congress, the Ceylon Teachers Congress and the Lanka Agriculturists Association. Also, he was elected to the Colombo District Development Council and was an executive member there from 1981 to 1988.

In 1988, the Hon. Sellasamy was elected to the Western Provincial Council and was appointed as the Minister of Health and Economic Infrastructure. Later, he was elected to Parliament in 1989 and first, became the State Minister of Transport and then, the State Minister of Industries in March, 1990.

I believe he had a very colourful life. According to our culture, traditions and history, Sir, we do not believe that those who departed from this world, really departed; we believe that they are somewhere around here. So, Sir, I salute the Hon. Sellasamy for leading and guiding us.

Sir, I would also like to take this opportunity to speak a few words about the other Hon. Members of Parliament, whose Votes of Condolence we are taking up today.

1994 . , , . , , , , . [12.08 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. Premnath C. Dolawatte) Hon. Presiding Member, we know that when it comes to womens representation in politics, especially, when it comes to the Legislature, it is very rare to find women

politicians. So, today, I am going to first speak about the ex-TNA MP, the late Hon. (Ms.) K. Thangeswary, who was from the Batticaloa District. She contested from the Batticaloa District and was elected as a Member of Parliament of the Tamil National Alliance. She was in Parliament for one term: from 2004 to 2010. However, due to an internal dispute - we are all aware that in politics, there are disputes inside parties as well as among parties - she left the TNA and joined the UPFA. She again contested the Parliamentary Election in 2010 from the UPFA, but lost.

The Hon. Thangeswary Kathiraman devoted her whole life to politics and social work. That is why she remained a Miss in her private life. Although she lost her seat, she did not stop doing social work for the people in the Batticaloa District. She was from a very poor family. Especially from the North and the East, still, we cannot see much of womens representation in this Parliament. It is very rare. We do speak about womens representation, but we rarely find women representatives coming from the grass-roots level. We have seen womens representation in Parliament. We had produced the first female Prime Minister of the world from our country, but she was also from a politically connected family. After her husband was assassinated, she became the first female Prime Minister of the world. But, it was a very rare case when it comes to the Hon. Thangeswary. She came from the grassroots, from a poor family, and got elected from the Batticaloa District to Parliament. Not only that, she was a very educated bachelor. She got her degree from the University of Kelaniya and had contributed to the Tamil literature by writing several books. She was also honoured by several literary associations, both locally as well as internationally, for her researches.

In conclusion, I must say that she was a woman politician who came from the Batticaloa District, from a faraway, rural district and dedicated her life towards the betterment of people of that district, and I pay my condolences to her family.

Sir, I am now going to speak about the late Hon. Muthu Sangaralingam Sellasamy. He contested from Colombo Central, from which I also contested the last time. When I was elected to Parliament, I was the SLPP organizer for Colombo Central, which, as you know, is a major political seat for the UNP. The Hon. Sellasamy was not only a politician, but also a trade union activist. He was elected District Chairman of the Ceylon Workers Congress for his hard work. He won the confidence of his associates and was elected General Secretary of the CWC in 1963. The Hon. Sellasamy was also the president of three other institutions, namely, the Estate Staff Congress, the Ceylon Teachers Congress and the Lanka Agriculturists Association. From 1981 to 1988, he was an executive member of the District Development Council, Colombo.

In June, 1988, he contested the Provincial Councils Elections from the Western Province and came third in the list. He was appointed Minister of Health and Economic Infrastructure of the Western Provincial Council, but later resigned to contest the Parliamentary Elections in 1989. He got elected and was appointed State Minister of Transport. Before he became an MP, the Hon. Sellasamy was a member of the Senate of the University of Colombo and NADSA. He represented the plantation workers at various seminars and conferences here and abroad.

Sir, I pay my condolences to the Hon. M.S. Sellasamys family, due to whose support he could devote his life towards the betterment of the society.

, , . .

, . , . He was a leading lawyer, a trade union activist and a senior member of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party. We all knew him as Batty Weerakoon, but his name had been registered as Richard Weerakoon. He had his early education at St. Thomas College, Matale and then came to Trinity College, Kandy, from which he entered the University of Ceylon. He read English for his Honours Degree at that University and graduated in 1957. Four years later, he graduated as an Advocate from the Sri Lanka Law College, Colombo.

I must also mention about his contribution towards the literature of this country. He was the author of several books written in English. Those include "Law of Parliamentary Elections on Corrupt Practices, Illegal Practices, Agency, Burden Proof, Other Offences" published in 1970, "The Sinhala Jathaka Stories: An Evaluation" published in 1974, "The Evolution of Labour Law in Sri Lanka: Tea Plantation to Free Trade Zone" published in 1986, "Sri Lankas Mythology" and "The Elephant Kraal & Other Stories from Sri Lanka". He had written all these books under the name R. Weerakoon, Richard Weerakoon. He had written only one book under the name Batty Weerakoon. That is, "Sri Lanka's New Capitalism and the Erosion of Democracy: Political Writings of Dr. Colvin R. de Silva in the Period 1977-1988" published in 1988. That is the book I mentioned earlier. I still remember, once I entered the Law College, I went to the Lanka Sama Samaja Party office, took that book and read it.

Finally, I pay my gratitude to the late Hon. Batty Weerakoon, who had worked for the betterment of the society, and also pay my condolences to his family.

Thank you very much. [.. 12.18] ( ) (The Hon. Buddhika Pathirana) , . , , . . 2019 . , , , .

. [2.26 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Presiding Member, I count it a great privilege to be able to say a few words on the Votes of Condolence taken up today.

I would particularly say a few words about the Hon. Batty Weerakoon, who was not merely a stalwart amongst the leftists of this country, but was also considered by all of us as a statesman who did not ever compromise his beliefs and his policies. I had the good fortune to actually know him in person when he was the Minister of Justice for certain measures that were taken with regard to reform of the prison system. I had met him on a couple of occasions, but I knew of him. In our profession, as I started out as a young attorney-at-law, I had often watched him perform in courts. After he relinquished his ministerial portfolio also, I remember an occasion in the Supreme Court when he made a presentation and the then Chief Justice Sarth N. Silva told him when he finished, Oh! You have not lost any of your old fire. He spoke with passion and argued his case even then. I saw him in the District Court in Colombo, appearing for Mrs. Manorani Saravanamuttu at a time when a very few lawyers were willing or had the courage to represent her with regard to the killing of her son Richard De Zoyza. I think that case was eventually withdrawn or could not proceed with when the two police officers against whom that case was filed died in the same bomb blast along with President Premadasa. But, he fought those matters; he appeared in the Magistrate's Court in Moratuwa for her. Those were times when even lawyers feared to appear for their clients and Batty Weerakoon was nonetheless unafraid; he was his usual self, fighting for justice, fighting for what he thought and knew to be right.

He was a Marxist from his very early days and joined the LSSP. In fact, he was the General Secretary of the LSSP for a long number of years. During the 1977 UNP regime, when the economy was liberalized, he took several measures to turn the tide, as it were: filed a case against the Greater Colombo Economic Commission Bill and succeeded in changing several of the Clauses, particularly those that would have adversely affected the rights of the workers in the Free Trade Zones.

And in the All Party Conference, he participated with the Hon. (Dr.) Colvin R. de Silva as a representatives of the LSSP, which led to the establishment of the provincial councils, and he was a person who was strongly in favour of devolution of power.

His campaign against the Eppawala phosphate mining is also something that this country cannot forget. Even when he became the Minister of Science and Technology, he continued that fight. He, in fact, even as Minister, went and stood in a protest outside and fought against what the National Science Foundation had termed "highly disadvantageous to the country with highly adverse environmental impacts". So, whether he was in the Opposition or in Government, even holding a ministerial portfolio, the late Hon. Batty Weerakoon stood for his policies and those came first to him, not his position; that did not matter to him. So, in the true sense of the word, he was a committed Marxist, a Sama Samajist and he was that, to his dying day.

As I said, I have had the privilege of meeting him on a couple of occasions. I have known his daughter Ms. Chamantha Weerakoon-Unamboowe and his son-in-law. I would want to place on record our deepest condolences on behalf of the Tamil National Alliance to the members of his family and wish that this Vote of Condolence made in this House today would, at least, be some solace to them, as they have grieved over his demise.

May I also say a few words with regard to the Hon. (Ms.) K. Thangeswary, whose Vote of Condolence is also taken up today. She was a Member of Parliament from the Batticaloa District, an erudite woman Member of Parliament, someone who knew her culture and her language as a scholar. During her tenure, she served her community well. Though, at the time she passed away, she had not been elected, the people of Batticaloa remember her fondly to this day. Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , .

Order, please! Before that, will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan to the Chair? (, ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara - State Minister of Batik, Handloom and Local Apparel Products) Sir, I propose that the Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan do now take the Chair. ( ) (The Hon. Dilip Wedaarachchi)

, , , . . Trinity College , . . , , . , , . , , ! . . [3.05 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Yadamini Gunawardena) Hon. Presiding Member, on behalf of the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna, I wish to add a few thoughts especially with regard to the late Hon. Batty Weerakoon. As it was said earlier in the House, he was a student activist, a trade unionist, a political activist, an eminent lawyer and a Member of Parliament. He became the General Secretary of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party and went on to even serve a term as Minister of Science and Technology of Sri Lanka.

Above all, he was a courageous and a fearless human being. Why I say so, Sir, is because, as an eminent lawyer, he was always accessible to the common man as well as to the trade unions and workers across Sri Lanka. The Ceylon Federation of Labour was led by him during one of the most crucial periods in our history and he was fortunate enough to have a very close guidance and relationship with eminent politicians of the era - in the 1960s and 1970s - especially, those like the late Hon. (Dr.) N.M. Perera and the late Hon. (Dr.) Colvin R. de Silva.

He contested the 1977 Parliamentary Elections from the Kollonnawa Electorate, where he pioneered solar technology and which was part of Avissawella, the electorate represented both by my grandfather and grandmother. So, I take it a very personal reason to convey and share the thoughts of our family at this moment with the family of the late Hon. Batty Weerakoon, former Minister.

At the same time, I must say that he was surrounded by eminent personalities, not only in the political circles or in the legal fraternity, but also other learned members from different professions. I remember once meeting Dr. Charith Fonseka, who was one of the pioneers in ophthalmology, and Dr. Perera, who was probably the leading professional in dermatology. Then, another member in his family was Dr. P. Ramanujam, who was a leading personality in the Administrative Service and later, serving in the Public Service Commission and so on and so forth. So, he was surrounded by eminent people from different, respected fields in this country and he was very well served through those connections he had built, through that network of a close-knit family which supported his courageous and fearless endeavours in the arena of politics. As a student 25 years ago, I remember joining my father, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, and my uncle, Gitanjana Gunawardena, in the protest against Eppawala phosphate mining, the historical judgment on which became part of the law of this country, and the key personality behind obtaining that judgment or the petitioner who appeared in public interest was none other than the late Hon. Batty Weerakoon. Of course, the judgment was delivered by the late Justice Amarasinghe.
