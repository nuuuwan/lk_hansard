( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) The Hon. Prime Minister is walking out of the House. Sir, I want to raise an urgent matter regarding an incident happening in Batticaloa right now. Sir, as you are aware, the commemoration of the people who were killed in Mullivaikkal is taking place throughout the country and their commemoration is taking place right now in "GotaGoGama" in the Galle Face as well.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Sir, in Batticaloa, around 600 people, relatives and loved ones of those who were killed in Mullivaikkal, have gathered right now for the commemoration and you all have said that peaceful commemoration is allowed as long as there is no evidence of any proscribed organization. Sir, right now, in Batticaloa, there are around 600 people who are trying to commemorate their loved ones who were killed in the last stages of the war and the Headquarters Inspector of Batticaloa has come there to disrupt the proceedings. He has asked them to remove the banners that are there and those banners have nothing related to any proscribed organization. The Hon. Prime Minister guaranteed that there will be room for peaceful commemoration. So, I would like the Hon. Prime Minister - unfortunately, he just walked out - to intervene in this matter and allow this peaceful commemoration to happen because it could lead to an unnecessary situation otherwise.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) , . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. S.M. Marikkar) , . . 2015 . , . . , . . , .

So, I encourage the international community to visit our country. Our country is safe to visit. Ignore the travel warnings and trust us. We are the Opposition in the country. We are inviting the international community to visit our motherland, help us out and also enjoy yourselves. Come to the beaches of the East; come to the beaches of the South, the North and those around the country. You can do your enjoyment activities on our beaches. You can do your surfing, you can swim and enjoy the sun. So, I appeal once again to the international community and encourage them to visit our motherland and enjoy its peace and tranquility.

I made my speech not in malice; I made it based on facts.

I would like to once again invite the Hon. Prime Minister to take us up on our proposal to provide the three economic experts in Parliament with the positions that I mentioned. Also, there is absolutely no issue in working with the Government on programmes that are beneficial to the people and to the country.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, I just want to clarify some of the matters raised.

The World Bank money cannot be used for fuel. At the moment, the money they have given us is for cash transfer. There is some more to come. So, we want to ask them whether it is possible, at this stage, to use some of the money urgently to buy petrol. Whether it will succeed or not, I do not know. There is a World Bank team in Colombo at the moment. I also will be meeting them today. So, we will pursue it. If you are lucky, we will have it. Otherwise, we would not have that money. That is all about it.

Next, I am bringing up proposals on changes to be made in the Committees and even at district level. As to who are going to be the Chairpersons, the Opposition and the Government have to decide.

The Opposition, not only the SJB, but also the TNA, the JVP, the All Ceylon Tamil Congress, has to get those positions. As the Government will have to sit down and sort out how to do it. Certainly, to have the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva work with me is a great pleasure. He has worked with me earlier. So, I have no problem at all. How we divide those positions is the question.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) , , "" . Hon. Prime Minister, I have to tell you that we primarily focus on equipment. I have to tell you what we can do; . , . . coordinate .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) We can give you all that. When the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva comes, I will -

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) , equipment .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I know what you all are doing. The most urgent are the medicines needed for diabetese and heart patients. We will give you all the information. Provide us whatever you can because the rural hospitals have not got these medicines. The hospitals in Colombo have them.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. Speaker, in reply to the Hon. Prime Minister's request for medicines, I want to explain that, at this juncture, we are in a position only to provide lifesaving hospital equipment. So, we will do that. He mentioned one particular medicine, which he requested us to try to provide. I do not think we have the funds to provide it for the whole country while being in the Opposition. But, as much as possible, we will try to provide all the important lifesaving medicines.

Also, I want to tell you, Hon. Prime Minister, -

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Raise money from the private sector. We will bless it. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Yes, we will.

Then, Hon. Prime Minister, our party does not spend 24/7 and 365 days on marginalizing you.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Then, how many hours? ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) We actually want to incorporate you since you are an individual in Parliament possessing just one Seat. We respect you. You have been a former Prime Minister several times over and you were my political leader when I was in the United National Party. One thing my father had taught us is to respect leaders. Unlike many who have a distaste for you, we respect political leaders. I do not want to marginalize you. Since you are just a singular person, I will incorporate you. Do not worry.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, I am very happy that I have come here. These are all SLFPers who left the UNP; they broke away

from our party. I will incorporate them first in the UNP. Then, Hon. Premadasa will get them back. But, you are a sitting Member.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Right. Thank you. Shall we stop this now? ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Sir, I want to warn the Hon. Prime Minister. When he mention that most of those who are on the other side of the political aisle are people who came from the UNP to that side, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena was staring at him. So, you had better be careful. I do not think that he was in the UNP. Were you, Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena?

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) He was not there. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) He was staring at you. That is why I said that.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Two of the founding members of the Sirikotha were S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike and D.A. Rajapaksa.

[3.32 p.m]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, today, I am taking part in this Adjournment Debate whilst the Tamil people of the North-East and the world over commemorate what we call the Mullivaikkal Tamil Genocide Day. It is a day that is the blackest in the Tamil political calendar and a day that brings a lot of memories which make the Tamil people, no matter where they are, politicized. That is because when the war came to an end on the 18th of May, 2009, there was a moment where the Sri Lankan State could have tried to convince the Tamil people that it was

215 216

[ . ]

2022 18

willing to change, that supporting an armed struggle was something that was unnecessary and that Sri Lanka could, in fact, change so that it could become inclusive where the Tamil people could call Sri Lanka their home as much as the Sinhalese and, maybe, the others living on this Island do, but that did not happen. So, that did not happen and 13 years down, if you ask an old lady who owned 20 acres in Keppapulavu in Mullaitivu District, which is currently under military occupation and which has now been relegated to a quarter of an acre, her reply would be that she wished she did not come out of Mullivaikkal alive. So, that is the failure, Sir, which Sri Lanka has become, that is what the political culture of Sri Lanka is and the people to blame are the custodians of this State: that is, you, all of you who inhabit this House and who have held political office.

For the Tamil people, 13 years after the end of the war, to feel that they miss the LTTE more than ever, I think, is an indictment that you will continue to face until you seriously think of changing. I am saying all of this today when we are debating the terrible loss that several Members belonging to several parties of this House faced and when a lot of Members are reeling at the violence that took place against the establishment. I say this - Sir, I said about Tamil genocide and the fact that 13 years down the road, we have not learnt a single lesson - because when people become disenfranchised, when people feel that the State is not there for them, when people feel that the enemy is the State and that they have nowhere to turn to, then they will turn against the State and you can call that organized or unorganized and you can delude yourselves in blaming various people, but the fact of the matter is, no one outside this House has any sympathy for the damage and the loss that has been suffered by the Members of this House or by other members of the political parties represented in this House. That is the reality that we are facing today.

So, it is up to the custodians of this State, who are primarily the Sinhala Buddhist people who hold high office, to rethink at least now, go to their own electorates, whether it be to the Sinhalese or even to the Tamils, and say, "We are going to take a step back and are going to, in fact, change, to change in a way that the ordinary people are enfranchised". I say this, Sir, as a party. Let me just give you a good example of our own party. Our party is considered as a hardline party, a Tamil-nationalist party that is inflexible, that does not compromise. When we left the TNA in 2010, we were routed at the elections, but we kept telling our people that the Sinhalese leaders would never deliver. When the TNA tried to tell the Tamil people that there could be a change even with the Rajapaksas in power then and certainly after that in 2015 when the Maithreepala Sirisena-Ranil Wickremasinghe Government came into power, what we said was that there would be no change at all. You will have individuals like the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella who, even today, without any qualms, will stand up and say that he is for federalism. But, those are individuals. The system is the same and there is no change. It is because of that that the TNA, which kept telling our people, No, there will be change, is today diminishing and our party, which tells

the truth, is growing. It is the same logic that you face with your own electorate.

Today is not an era where we rely on print media to get news, where you control the media and where you can try and brainwash. Those days are gone. Today is an era when people outside, other than Members of this House, are actually far more literate, far more with it, are capable of saying what is happening in every corner of the world and are capable of comparing us with others who lead various countries. And, we are failing every time. What you did to the Tamil people, you are doing to your own people; you are disenfranchising your own people and it is because you are disenfranchising your own people that the violence took place. You thought you can teach those who are non-violently protesting a lesson or two and you got it and you will keep getting it. If you do not understand that this Government headed by this President must go - that is the primary political unrest that exists today in this country - you will get it, not once, but hundred times over.

The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe has taken over the mantle of Prime Ministership. He is being accused, including by our party, of safeguarding this failed President and this failed Government. He could have waited - no one denies his expertise; no one denies his experience and no one denies that he can contribute quite considerably to change the economy of this country - but instead, he chose to rush in.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . . rose.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes, Hon. Lakshman Kiriella? ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, the Hon. Chaminda Wijesiri is not speaking today. So, kindly give his time to the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Thank you, Hon. Kiriella.

The Hon. Prime Minister has taken over the mantle at a time when President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was about to go, when that office was limping, when it was gasping for

217 218

breath. That is the time when that person who belongs to a party which did not win a single Member from an electorate, but only managed to get a National List seat in this House and that too, so many months after - that National List seat was given to his party - took the position of Prime Minister when Members of his older party, which now form the primary Opposition, could have formed a Government.

The Hon. Prime Minister could have played a very substantive role if he had waited for that change to take place, but he did not. Instead, today, he shares the biggest blame for sustaining the Rajapaksas and most importantly, the Presidency and that is what the people outside are watching. So, if the Hon. Prime Minister wants to save his own skin, then he must make sure that that political change takes place. No matter how intelligent he may be, no matter how experienced he may be, if he does not have the backing of the people, he cannot possibly survive nor can his changes ever come to fruition. And it is here, Sir, that I say to the Hon. Prime Minister that for his political ambitions or for his partys political ambitions, if he wants to continue to remain somewhat credible, then, he must make sure that he backs the right party, the right changes, the right political decisions, not only the decisions he makes with regards to the economy. His track record has been a disaster. So, if that does not change, that disaster will be not just for himself, but will be a nail in the coffin of the democracy of this country and will also be the legacy that he leaves behind.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I am winding up, Sir.

Whilst I have personal respect for him, let me say this, Sir. Sri Lanka is at the crossroads. You have lost the Tamil people. You have lost the Muslim people. The Muslim people who backed you when you waged war against the Tamils, today, are disenfranchised because you have chosen to go against them. Today, you are losing your own people and your own people will turn violent. They will turn violent, if it is not by themselves, then, it will be by someone who is prepared to give leadership to it and do not say that that is undemocratic. What we are doing here is what is undemocratic.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . .
