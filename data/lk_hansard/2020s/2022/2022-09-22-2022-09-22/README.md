PETROLEUM PRODUCTS (SPECIAL PROVISIONS) (AMENDMENT) BILL: DETERMINATION OF THE SUPREME

COURT

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I wish to announce to Parliament that I have received the Determination of the Supreme Court in respect of the Bill entitled Petroleum Products (Special Provisions) (Amendment), which was challenged in the Supreme Court in terms of Article 121(1) of the Constitution.

On an overall consideration of the provisions of the Bill, the Supreme Court has made the following Determination:

A. Clause 3(2) of the Bill is inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution and may only be passed by the special majority required under the provisions of paragraph (2) of Article 84. The inconsistency will cease if the composition of the Committee is changed to include the following:

1. Secretary to the Ministry in charge of the subject of economic policy development.

2. Secretary to the Ministry in charge of the subject of investment promotion.

B. Clause 7 of the Bill is inconsistent with Articles 3 and 4(c) of the Constitution and may be passed only by the special majority required under the provisions of paragraph (2) of Article 84 and approved by the people at a Referendum by virtue of the provisions of Article 83.

C. The Bill, as a whole, is inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution. This inconsistency will cease if the following Clause is added to the Bill: The Committee appointed by the Cabinet of Ministers shall be deemed to be a Scheduled Institution within the meaning of the Bribery Act, and the provisions of that Act shall be construed accordingly.

I order that the Determination of the Supreme Court be printed in the Official Report of todays Proceedings of the House.

POISONS, OPIUM AND DANGEROUS DRUGS (AMENDMENT)

BILL: PETITION TO THE SUPREME COURT

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) 222(2) , , ( ) .

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Hon. Speaker, the IMF - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Regarding the IMF agreement, about which you raised yesterday, the Hon. President informed me that even the

Cabinet has not been briefed about those discussions. Though they say it has been agreed upon with the officials, it has to be approved by the Board of the IMF. Before that, the Hon. President has to have some discussions with the other creditor countries and then, their report also has to be added to that. Until such time, it will not be decided by anybody. Before that, there will be a Cabinet briefing. Even the Cabinet has not been informed yet. The Cabinet will be briefed very soon once he receives all the details. For a briefing, even the Speaker and the Opposition will be invited and any other interested parties can also participate. That is what he told me in the morning, to inform you that this has not been finalized or approved by the Board.

Some more things have to be added and some more things have to be revised. So, wait till the Cabinet briefing is done because the Cabinet has not yet been informed by anybody. Therefore, please bear with that.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Hon. Speaker, my argument is this. There was an agreement.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, true. That will be adhered to. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Nothing has been signed. But, when they met, there was an agreement of the minds. I cannot explain it to you in any other way. There was an agreement on what should be done.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) What he told me was, it is not an agreement. It is an - ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) My point is, once the Cabinet approves - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) The Cabinet has not approved yet. That is what he said. Before that, it has to be briefed to the Cabinet. That is what he told me.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) If the Cabinet approves, it will be too late for Parliament to discuss. That is what I am saying.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) It has not been approved by the Cabinet. That is what he said.

335 336

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Then, an assurance must be given that before Cabinet approval, it will be submitted to Parliament.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) That is what he gave you. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) All right. If you say so, it is okay.

[12.41 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to speak a few words at todays Debate.

The Hon. Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation was here a moment ago. I want to raise one matter with him with regard to the Palaly Airport. That is an international airport. It was opened and there were flights from Madras. Then, due to COVID, all flights were suspended. It has not resumed operations yet and even when it resumes, the cost of the airfare is prohibitive. The reason for that is, the airport taxes are so high that people will not be able to afford it. The Hon. Minister is now coming back into the House. I have spoken to the Hon. Minister about this matter. The taxes at the Mattala Airport have been waived and we have been asking that the taxes at the Palaly Airport also be waived because unlike the Mattala Airport, the Palaly Airport, when you resume operations, will have a steady traffic and that will be good for our economy. Therefore, I am requesting the Hon. Minister again to please waive the airport tax for Palaly Airport so that there will be a steady stream of traffic.

Sir, as we deal with these issues today, in the North and the East, there are other issues that people are facing, particularly with regard to the lands. Yesterday, in Kurunthur Malai, there was a demonstration with regard to new constructions that were being undertaken by the Department of Archaeology. Two of our members were arrested saying that they had disrupted the officials from functioning. The Department of Archaeology is entrusted with the responsibility of preserving archaeological monuments. We know that there are archaeological monuments. Those must be preserved, but they do not have the authority to build anew. There are court orders restraining them from building new structures and yet, when people demonstrate against an illegal activity by the Department of Archaeology, they are being arrested. So, I want to raise that issue here.

Sir Paul Pieris, renowned historian, has written that long before the advent of Prince Vijaya to this Island, there existed five Iswarams and one of those is Thirukoneswaram. Tirugnana Sambandar had sung about this Temple in the Seventh Century BC. So, it is ancient. This was destroyed by the Portuguese in 1624, but it was rebuilt in 1959. This is now designated as an archaeological site, but using the fact that it is an archaeological site - it is indeed an archaeological site - there are efforts to bring in people from other districts, particularly from the Ratnapura District. There was one politician who took people from the Ratnapura District, settled them - traders in that area - around the archaeological site and now, there are 58 shops that have been set up and efforts are being made to grant lands from that archaeological site to those 58 shop owners, who are actually aliens in that area. They have been brought and settled there to change the demography. This must immediately be stopped.

So, these are the issues that our people are facing today, particularly the issue of land being grabbed by the Department of Archaeology, the Mahaweli Authority, the Department of Forest and the Department of Wildlife Conservation. Also, various other special laws are used to take away the lands on which Tamil people have lived for centuries. Now, that is something which must immediately be stopped.

Your Government is now facing a challenge at the UN Human Rights Council. The Hon. Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms is here and that is good because I want to refer to some matters that concern him as well. In September, 2015, the Sri Lankan Government co-sponsored a Resolution called HRC 30/1. Co-sponsoring means, you agree and sign on to that Resolution, which then means that it is your Resolution also. In that Resolution - Hon. Minister, you were the Minister of Justice even at that time - there was a clause to which Sri Lanka agreed: Operative Paragraph 6 of the Resolution, in which it was agreed that Commonwealth and other foreign judges, defence lawyers, authorized prosecutors and investigators would participate in a process. So, it states "Commonwealth and other foreign judges". Originally, that draft, as you know, Hon. Minister, stated foreign judges. It was at the request of the Sri Lankan Government that the word Commonwealth was also added to say Commonwealth and other foreign judges. That is Sri Lankas own Resolution. But, now, your Minister of Foreign Affairs goes to Geneva - you were seated behind him - and says that participations like this, external mechanisms, are unconstitutional. How can that be unconstitutional, Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, when, in December, 2012, you yourself, as an MP, brought in a Private Members Bill called "Removal of Judges of the Superior Courts (Special Provisions) Act"? In that, you yourself had suggested that that inquiry be conducted, against the Superior Court Judges, by judges who have held office in the highest court of any Commonwealth country other than Sri Lanka. So, even according to you, according to your own belief, consistently between 2012 and 2015,

foreign judges participating in processes or inquiries in Sri Lanka was not unconstitutional. You would not have presented a Bill that was unconstitutional, surely! You are a constitutional lawyer. So, it was your own Private Members Bill. Then, as the official position of the Government of Sri Lanka, while you were the Minister of Justice and the incumbent President was the Prime Minister, he wanted the word Commonwealth added in that Resolution and so it was added and it was resolved.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I will conclude, Sir.

You cannot resile from whatever you had agreed to. I can understand it when the Government changed and Gotabaya Rajapaksa became President, where statements were made saying, We are withdrawing from the Resolution. But, can you withdraw from that Resolution? How can you withdraw from the Resolution that you yourself agreed to? So, the Resolution now before the Council will be put to vote because you are opposing it, you are opposing the very words that you had agreed to previously, and that is not good for the country.

Thank you. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) ( ) .

, ( () - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe - Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms) . Sir, I will not take more than two minutes.

The Hon. Sumanthiran mentioned my name, about the Resolution adopted in Geneva in 2015 and one of the Private Members Bills I had submitted with regard to the removal of judges. I am thankful to the Hon. Member for raising it. I presented that Bill taking into consideration the Latimer House concept, according to which the independence of the Judiciary is very vital for the sustenance of democracy and the rule of law, and we all are concerned about the independence of the Judiciary. Therefore, at that time, I made an attempt and I think my learned Friend would appreciate the effort I made on that issue.

Similarly, we concede that there was a Resolution which was co-sponsored by Sri Lanka. But, in the meantime, the Hon. Member knows, there were a lot of turbulences in the political landscape of our country; there was change of regimes and from time to time, some different decisions had been taken. But, I think my good Friend, the Hon. Sumanthiran, believes me, that as you have some interest to resolve this issue, similarly, I too have an interest to resolve it. You are genuinely saying that; I am also genuinely saying that. At the moment, we have taken a lot of meaningful steps to resolve the issue. We concede that there is a lot more to do. In the next few weeks time, I hope to have a cordial discussion with the Hon. Members from the North and the East on this issue, decide the way forward and reconcile for a peaceful nation. I think my good Friend will help us.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . 20 .

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . .

[2.00 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, there have to be checks and balances in any government. That is why the last Parliament, under the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya, changed the Standing Orders and ensured that certain checks and balances are there. , we ensured that there are checks and balances.

But, what happened when 6.8 million people voted and elected this Government, giving them a two-thirds majority? I have the privilege and honour of being in the Committee on Standing Orders chaired by the Hon. Speaker. What was the first Motion introduced in Parliament? That was to suspend certain sections of the Standing Orders of Parliament. They suspended the Sectoral Oversight Committee system; Standing Orders Sectoral Oversight Committee . I went for the First Meeting of that Committee, Sir. Seated next to me is the Hon. Sujith Sanjaya Perera, who is also a Member of the Committee on Standing Orders. We represented the Opposition and went for that Meeting. At that Meeting, the Government Members said, We are definitely not going to allow the Sectoral Oversight Committee system to operate. We want to revert to the old system. . , I submitted a report to the Committee on Standing Orders on the good aspects of having a Sectoral Oversight Committee system versus those of having the Ministerial Consultative Committee system. We recommended to have both systems going. The Minister chairs the relevant Ministerial Consultative Committee and can solve certain problems. But, to make Parliament more democratic and the system more open, we recommended to have the Sectoral Oversight Committees in Parliament. In the last Parliament, I was acting as a Chairman of a certain Sectoral Oversight Committee. We even went on study tours overseas and studied the Sectoral Oversight Committee systems in other countries: in the United States, Canada, England and in Europe.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Order please! .

( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Bandula Gunawardana) , " " .

, . . Question put, and agreed to.

447 448

, .

, , .

Whereupon THE HON. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. SHANAKIYAN RAJAPUTHIRAN RASAMANICKAM took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) Hon. Presiding Member, we studied how the Sectoral Oversight Committee system works in other countries, the pluses and the minuses of it and how we can change and improve it. However, Sir, when this Government came in, immediately they suspended the Sectoral Oversight Committee system.

Now, things have changed. The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe has become the President of the country and the Head of this Government. There is a saying, Sir, that there are no permanent friends or enemies in politics. So, after the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe became the President of this country, once again, the Sectoral Oversight Committee system is going to be brought back. Remember, the same group belonging to that same political party who hold the two-thirds majority in this House is still in control. That same group who suspended the Standing Orders of Parliament and the Sectoral Oversight Committee system completely have, today, agreed to change the Standing Orders of Parliament and bring back that Committee system.

That is leadership. It is the same number of MPs with the same two-thirds majority, but today, because the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, as the President of the country, wants to bring back the Sectoral Oversight Committees and have checks and balances in Parliament, we are having this Debate to pass the new Standing Orders in Parliament. It is a good thing; it is not a bad thing. For the last one and a half to two years, as a Member of the Committee on Standing Orders, I have been fighting to have this Sectoral Oversight Committee system in Parliament. Anyway, people can change; sometimes, things change; power comes and goes. Remember, there is a Government or a party that has a two-thirds majority in Parliament, which can govern and rule. Tomorrow, there can be an election and the people of this country could decide who would govern thereafter. But if we, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya or the SJB - it can be an alliance - comes to power, we will ensure that this system is actually enshrined even in the Constitution. Sir, for the last one and a half years, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, on behalf of the SJB and the Opposition, has always been asking the Speaker or whoever who was chairing Parliament to please bring back - it has been an appeal - the Sectoral Oversight Committees.

Sir, there was agreement between the Opposition, the Government and the Speaker to have the Chairmanship of

the Committee on Public Finance given to the Opposition. That has happened. With this change in the Standing Orders, it would be enshrined that the Opposition would have the Chairmanship of the Committee on Public Finance. However, what happened to the agreement that we had on the Chairmanships of the COPE and COPA? There was agreement reached that the Chairmanships of all three financial Committees of Parliament will be given to the Opposition. Sadly, here, the Chairmanships of the COPE and COPA are not given to the Opposition; it is not reflected in these changes to the Standing Orders moved today.

I wish to read from the Draft that was given to the Committee on Standing Orders, which states, .nominated by the Committee of Selection, provided that the Chair shall be a Member of the Opposition. That is, in relation to the Committee on Public Accounts. Sir, I wish to table this with your consent.

Also, the same wordings are there with regard to the Committee on Public Enterprises: .the Committee of Selection, provided that the Chair shall be a Member of the Opposition. So, these Amendments moved are in clear violation of that agreement. I do not know what happened. At the Committee on Standing Orders, there was agreement, but it went before the Committee on Parliamentary Business and now, that Committee, I believe, had changed it.

Sir, youth representation is a good thing. There is proviso in the Standing Orders that a certain number of youth could be invited to the Sectoral Oversight Committees. My recommendation to Parliament is that Youth Parliamentarians or young provincial councillors between the ages of 18 and 35 be invited to be a part of this system.

Sir, with your consent, I table* my Report to the Committee on Sanding Orders on the Sectoral Oversight Committee system.

If the Government, without suspending the Standing Orders, kept the Sectoral Oversight Committees, I think Gotabaya Rajapaksa would have still been in power, Mahinda Rajapaksa would have been in power, Basil Rajapaksa and the rest of the Rajapaksa family would have been in power. There would not have been the "aragalaya". There would have been checks and balances; there would have been a system where Parliamentarians can air their views openly.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up.

( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) Sir, may I have two more minutes from the time of the Opposition, please?

So, if we had that system, there would have been debates in Parliament over important issues. Take for example, the fertilizer crisis in this country. - . . , , . . ? GMOA , to get rid of chemical fertilizer from this country.

Then, during the last Parliament, there was also the issue of the PTA and the CTB - the Prevention of Terrorism Act versus the Counter Terrorism Bill. Again, there was an agreement and it was debated in the Sectoral Oversight Committee and reports were issued.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) Let me make one more point, Hon. Presiding Member. I must state that these new Standing Orders are coming in as a result of the "aragalaya". If not for the "aragalaya", the Standing Orders would not have been amended.

The last point I wish to make is with regard to the media. I also table* the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghes proposal, which clearly states that we must open up Parliament, have a system of accountability and those who are answerable to the people have to be held accountable.

Now, with 20 Sectoral Oversight Committees coming into play, who will be appointed as Chairmen and who are the Members who will be representing them? Therefore, we need to have a broader consensus in that regard in Parliament so that we could have a successful Sectoral Oversight Committee system.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. D.B. Herath. You have 13 minutes.

Sir, there have been a lot of expeditions conducted. Mike Wilson, Sir Arthur C. Clarke and Peter Throckmorton had conducted certain undersea expeditions and they had found a lot of artefacts and antiquities. There are Buddhist relics as well as Hindu relics.

Archaeology is a science. It is based on certain principles and it is an art because you need skills too to engage in that. Since it is a science which is based on principles and evidence - we have to acknowledge that - whether we like it or not and even if it does not suit our thinking pattern, nevertheless, if there is something proven according to scientific facts, we have to adhere to that, unless or otherwise the Act related to archaeology is revised; that is, the Antiquities (Amendment) Act passed by this Parliament is revised. So, until such time, we have to adhere to the present Act.

Sir, now, I would like to answer the pertinent questions raised by the Hon. Members of the Opposition. They have been questioning the validity of the Department of Archaeology, to my understanding. Sir, though we may have different political leanings and different political orientations, that does not mean that we should not uphold the law of this country. An Act is a law; we have to abide by that. I am sorry to say these things. Do not distort facts; you are distorting facts. I also can do that very well, but I will not go to that extent. The problem faced by the Kovil Committee has to be resolved. Very soon, I would like to make a personal visit to Thirukoneswaram Kovil and let us sit down and discuss this. I am willing to sit down with that Committee. You cannot shake hands with a clenched fist. We are extending our hands.

( ) (The Hon. Sivagnanam Shritharan) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Vidura Wickramanayaka) You cannot raise a point of Order at this juncture.- [Interruption] No, you cannot raise points of Order.
