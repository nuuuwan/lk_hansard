Harin Fernando, if you are listening from your office, I would like to say that tourism and lands is a vast subject, about which there is a lot to be said. Hon. Fernando, I have brought your attention to a large amount of corruption that is taking place in the Ministry of Lands. Just like how I would like the Hon. Naseer Ahamed to take action on the corrupt practices of the Ministry of Environment, I would also expect you to take action on such activities in the Ministry of Lands because it is also one of the most corrupt Ministries.

Also, on tourism, in terms of policy, Hon. Fernando, I would like to say this. The type of tourists we should look to attract are much different from those who visit countries like Thailand because, to Sri Lanka, we do not want large volumes or millions of tourists to come and to destroy the beauty of this country. We need to go one step above; we need to attract tourists who spend money. 10. . 10 3,800 . 1,400, juice , . ; . attract . Budget Speech tourism income US Dollars 5 billion .

Sir, as the country is facing a massive issue right now with regard to repayment of our debts, the debt restructuring process should be our prime objective. We are debating about a Budget where some of the allocations made are very minimal. We will talk to you in the future about how the Government can increase its revenue, but, right now, for the country, the priority is to get the IMF bailout package of US Dollars 2.9 billion or the IMF Staff-level Agreement approved. That should be the country's priority.

Whilst we do that, Hon. Minister in charge of environment, there is also a system through which the Government of Sri Lanka can apply for Green Bonds. Green Bonds are directly related to the environmental impact on our country. If we reduce the countrys air pollution, sometimes, we can get a lower percentage of interest on those Green Bonds. So, there are a lot of things we can do under the Ministry of Environment. Therefore, Hon. Minister, you had better take action against the GSMB because, otherwise, we will not have access to Green Bonds.

, . . inflation . , inflation . .

Sir, we are discussing today the Votes related to the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Wildlife and Forest Resources Conservation. Their overall allocations have reduced from Rs. 6.8 billion to Rs. 5.8 billion in 2023. The Hon. State Minister of Finance is here. I think the IMF also helps the country if there is sufficient money allocated to the Ministry of Environment. They do not expect the Government to cut down on expenditure related to the environment. I think there is an unwritten law on that. When the IMF wants the Government to cut down on its expenditure, they do not necessarily expect the Government to cut down on expenditure related to environment because, indirectly, the entire world has a responsibility towards environment protection. So, I

1719 1720

would like to urge the Minister in charge of environment and the State Minister of Finance, who is also here, to please look at how we can increase the allocation to the Ministry of Environment because that would not necessarily have be deducted from our National Budget.

Then, Sir, I have a massive concern. Very recently, I spoke in Parliament about China not willing to restructure the debt they have given to this country. Sir, it is a serious concern - I was exercising the sovereignty of the people of this country in this House or Assembly - that the Chinese Embassy's Twitter handle is commenting on matters that I speak related to the country's sovereignty.

In this House, in this Chamber, when I speak, I speak on behalf of the people of Sri Lanka. I do not speak on behalf of any embassy or any other country per se. But, the Chinese Embassy repeatedly tagging me on Twitter is a serious concern about this countrys sovereignty. What does the Chinese Embassy have to do with matters that are discussed in this Chamber? I have the Privilege to speak in this House. What is the Chinese Embassys business to take up my comments and speak about them on Twitter? If the Chinese Embassy wants a Twitter war on its web page, I am ready for a Twitter war, but I just do not have time.

The other day, I only made that point because I want this country to prosper and the IMF negotiations to go through, which is a primary concern right now. All I said was, Help with the debt restructuring process. But, in turn, what has the Chinese Embassy done? They are continuously tagging me on Twitter. So, if that is the war path they want to take with me, I would like to raise a few more things right here, which I did not say the other day.

Chinas economy is worth US Dollars 20 trillion. That is, US Dollars 20,000 billion, if I am not mistaken. So, out of the US Dollars 20 trillion or US Dollars 20,000 billion, all that Sri Lanka owes China in total is US Dollars 3 billion to the China Development Bank and US Dollars 4.3 billion to the China Exim Bank. So, altogether, the amount the country owes China is US Dollars 7.4 billion, out of that US Dollars 20,000 billion. I know that China may have concerns about their Belt and Road Initiative, under which they may also have lent other countries and those countries, too, may be asking them to restructure their debts. That is not our problem. I am talking on behalf of the 22 million people of this country.

When China lent money to this country, they knew our economy was collapsing. But, they still went ahead and gave money just to get Sri Lanka caught in Chinas debt trap. So, they did this knowingly. They had information, they are not stupid and they have an economy worth US Dollars 20 trillion. Do you think they are stupid to come and lend money to a country whose economy is crashing? They knew that. So, right now, why can they not help the people of Sri Lanka and write these debts off? Right now, what we are asking them is, at least, to restructure or to reschedule those loans. ,

As Sri Lankans, we might be divided on ethnicity, religion and over other differences, but when it comes to Sri Lanka, we all will unite together as 22 million Sri Lankans, and that is what we did recently. GotaGoHome was something that all Sri Lankans got united to do. But, if the Chinese Government or the Chinese Embassy continuously do not work for the benefit of Sri Lankan people and they do not look after the interests of the people by restructuring these debts, I would like to warn the Chinese that there will be a China Go Home protest soon and I will lead it! , Chinese Embassy , 22 , ; . , 22 , GotaGoHome , China Go Home .

While I respect the views of the Hon. Member of Parliament since he has all the right to express his views, I do not think we should take up the position as such to say that we will lead or somebody will lead a China Go Homeprotest. We have to work with all the countries.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva, that is not a point of Order.

You cannot allow one Member to comment on a speech of another Member in the Opposition. That is Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silvas opinion. That has no relevance. He should not comment on the propriety of a speech made by another Member. - [Interruption.] Hon.

The SJB, the JVP, the SLPP or the SLFP might not want to get on the wrong side of China because you all probably want to come back into power and stay in power.

Hon. Chairman, I would like to say a few words in English also since the Hon. Minister of Tourism and Lands is in the Chamber.

Sir, I had been given some proposals by the Nothern Province Tourism Association. The tourism sector has been heavily affected due to the COVID situation in Sri Lanka. People who have invested in tourism suffered a lot due to the drop of tourists both in domestic and foreign tourism. We are happy to note that tourists are now visiting Sri Lanka.

The Northern Province has the potential to develop itself as a tourist destination. There are beaches, archaeological sites, flora and fauna, vegetation and many other tourist attractions. The experience that a tourist gets in visiting the Northern Province is different to the experience he gets in other provinces.

Sir, the following are some of the proposals I would like to highlight from among the proposals made by the Northern Province Tourism Association.

To develop tourism, we need to have trained people. In Jaffna, there is a Hotel School, but it is not a purpose-built school. It is in a rented building and is conducting only a few courses. The people in the Northern Province also like to be trained and get employment in the hotel sector. Therefore, our kind request is to provide a purpose-built Hotel School in the Northern Province like the Hotel Schools in Colombo or Kandy.

Although there is lot of talk about the Jaffna Airport at Palaly, there is a delay to commence operations. India is our prime tourist-generating country. The commencement of operations at the Jaffna Airport will boost tourism in Sri Lanka. That will benefit tourism in the entire country. In the past, there was also a ferry service between Rameswaram and Talaimannar. To boost tourism in Sri Lanka with tourists from India, our kind request is to speak to the relevant authorities and to recommence that ferry service.

Sri Lanka is keen to develop wildlife tourism. There are places to see wild elephants and wild leopards. But,

the only place where you can see wild horses in Sri Lanka is the Delft Island in Jaffna. So, we kindly request you to make a proper plan and develop that place as a place to watch wild horses.

In Sri Lanka, there are tourist resorts in many areas, for example, in Bentota, Pasikudah and Yala. There is a resort to be set up in Kalpitiya as well. We also request, for the development of tourism in the Northern Province, to set up a tourist resort like those in other parts of the country.

The Indian Government has built a tower at Rameswaram to view the Ram-Setu Bridge. It is attracting a large number of tourists; it is definitely a tourist attraction. The other end of the Ram-Setu Bridge is Talaimannar. So, what we need is a tower at Talaimannar to view not only the Ram-Setu Bridge, but also the Southern tip of India. That will boost domestic tourism.

Then, there is a plan by the Government to develop the islands around Sri Lanka. What the Northern Province needs is to develop the Kurikadduwan ferry port. Once you upgrade it to international standards, then there will be people from the private sector to operate ferry services to nearby islands. I think we should benchmark this development similar to the ferry ports in Australia.

Finally, Sir, I would like to table* a few documents with regard to the sectors I discussed: payment of compensation for expansion of the Palaly Airport; statistics of private land occupied by the Army in the Jaffna District and documents with areas pertaining to forest conservation and wildlife conservation in the Jaffna District, the problems in the district and the solutions.

Thank you.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Harin Fernando - Minister of Tourism and Lands) Hon. Member, with your kind assistance, I would like to continue this conversation and would also like you to champion this cause. I think you hit the nail on the head; it is absolutely correct, we need to get tourism in the Northern Province up and running. We are trying to set up a committee. I would like you to join it with the Chairman of the SLTDA. I will officialy send you a request to join that and then, we should be able to sit and discuss.

Also I just want to make a small mention. The first aircraft from Alliance Air will fly to Palaly Airport on the 12th of December, 2022, just to inform you.

[5.34 p.m.]

) ( - ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed - Minister of Environment) Hon. Presiding Member, before I answer all the questions raised by the Hon. Members, let me place on record the Vision of the Ministry of Environment, its Programme for the coming year, 2023, and also the institutions which come under our Ministry - the GSMB and the Central Environmental Authority. It is a privilege to present to this House the environmental strategic vision and approach of the Government, the progress made in the recent past and the future directions and programmes in the environmental sector at the Committee Stage Discussion of the Budget, 2023.

The strategic approach of this Ministry is to harness the countrys natural capital to usher in sustainable economic prosperity to the people. At the outset, I wish to inform the House that the mandate of the Ministry of Environment is to transform the Government policy and other sectoral policies related to environment into action and to provide leadership for the priority tasks of policy-making, their implementation and enforcement, making public investments relating to the environmental sector and the implementation of projects under the National Development Programme with the paramount objective of creating a Sustainable Environment for all living beings within the territorial boundaries of Sri Lanka.

The key feature of the Governments approach in dealing with the environment is transforming the natural

1851 1852

capital that Sri Lanka is richly blessed with in such a way that it will usher in economic prosperity to the people in a sustainable manner while preserving and safeguarding the environment, the biodiversity and the whole of our ecosystem.

It is in that context that the Hon. President, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, has indicated in the Budget Speech, 2023 an Environment-friendly Green and Blue Economy as one of the three main economic approaches adopted by Sri Lanka to overcome the current economic challenges and move forward. Taking this broad vision forward, as the Minister in charge of environment, I wish to state that Sri Lanka can be transformed to be an ecological superpower with a carefully carved out strategic approach, which my Ministry is now trying to provide leadership for.

Then, let us consider Sri Lanka's potential as an ecological superpower. Sri Lankas potential transformation into an ecological superpower could be achieved by synergizing Sri Lankas unrivalled geostrategic location and untapped ecological assets. This is in line with the Hon. President Ranil Wickremesinghes call to action to the G7 leaders prior to the upcoming G7 Summit in Hiroshima, Japan in May, 2023 for accelerated transformation and transition of the world not only to net zero, but also to a nature-positive economy. I urge my fellow Parliamentarians and President Ranil Wickremesinghe to unite, galvanize and mobilize the entire nation with a transformative and unsinkable whole-of-government and whole-of-society top-to-bottom consensus and fellowship in order to make Sri Lanka an ecological superpower. This is an attainable goal in the context of the emergence of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero - GFANZ - which is the worlds largest coalition of financial institutions committed to transitioning the global economy to net zero greenhouse gas emissions, with combined assets under management in excess of US Dollars 130 trillion.

A carefully developed programme intervention focusing on sustainable harnessing of Sri Lanka's ecological assets will be an ideal candidate for green and conservation finance with innovative features like swaps of debts for investments. It will potentially not only resolve Sri Lanka's debt crisis in the fastest possible time, but also generate a high-level net foreign currency income annually.

Then, Sri Lanka's developments in the policy background. In terms of tangible achievements and progress made in the area of development of environment policies and regulations, I must inform the House that 19 years after the introduction of the "National Environmental Policy and Strategy" in the year 2003, the updated NEPS was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on 20th June this year and it will be published soon. Also, as the Cabinet has shown the urgent need to prepare an appropriate policy framework and action plan for the implementation of the National Environmental Policy, the Ministry of Environment has prepared the "National

Environmental Action Plan" in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

I am also glad to state that the "National Guidelines for the Restoration of Mangrove Ecosystems of Sri Lanka" and the "National Strategic Action Plan for Conservation and Sustainable Utilization of Mangrove Ecosystems in Sri Lanka" were also launched during this year. In addition, the "National Policy on Environmentally Sensitive Areas in Sri Lanka", which I presented to the Cabinet, has also been approved now.

Talking about the Global Climate Change Lobby and the opportunities for Sri Lanka, I would like to say that even though we remain a country with a lowest level of greenhouse gas emissions, unfortunately, we are also majorly affected by climate change due to our strategic location. Under any circumstances, we cannot underestimate the negative impact of climate change at all as its impact on our economy is not negligible. Therefore, we have to work to protect our people and food crops form the negative effects of climate change.

The 27th Conference of Parties - COP27- of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - UNFCCC - was held in Egypt last month.

The Hon. President led the high-level country delegation to the summit and delivered a valuable speech at the Meeting of the World Leaders. The overall outcome of the summit is discouraging as the Hon. President had commented recently and there is a lot of doubt about the seriousness on the part of some of the developed and industrial countries on climate action. However, one positive outcome of the summit was the decision to establish a global fund for loss and damage caused by climate-induced disasters.

In this context, I would like to share with you some of the alarming facts and figures which concern all of us in Sri Lanka. According to the Global Climate Risk Index Report 2021, Sri Lanka ranked 30th among the countries most affected by extreme weather events in 2019. The World Bank says that 87 per cent of Sri Lanka's population lives in moderate or severe hotspots. Then, the ADB reveals that by 2050, the potential impacts of climate change would lead to approximately 1.2 per cent loss of annual GDP and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery 2016 Report reveals that US Dollar 380 million worth losses are being incurred each year from climate-induced hydro-meteorological disasters.

If we take the more specific references to climate-induced disasters in Sri Lanka, the damages and losses caused by floods in May, 2016 cost the country approximately US Dollar 660 million, whereas the damages and losses caused by floods in May, 2017 were estimated to be US Dollar 478 million with 212 deaths and 78 persons missing. I hope you all understand the impact of climate change and the disasters it could bring about in Sri Lanka. So, that was the damage caused by just two floods

1853 1854

[

2022 02

It is in that context that we should harness the promising opportunities for Sri Lanka in the context of these global developments. As a climate-vulnerable country, we must prepare well in advance to tap the proposed loss and damage compensation fund. Since there is no proper mechanism in place to estimate the value of lives and properties lost to Sri Lanka due to climate-induced disasters, we are unable to put forward proper claims and therefore, cannot make definite statements about such claims. So, we need to get the relevant laws and mechanisms in place as a matter of urgency.

Another progressive suggestion made at the COP27 was to double the amount of funds allocated for adaptation. That is another area of opportunity coming in our way. In response to this, my Ministry has already started working on submission of proposals and programmes to scale up some of the projects and programmes and also to replicate similar projects in new geographical areas. We are looking at scaling up and replicating projects in areas such as air resources management including e-mobility and e-transportation projects, bio-diversity including mangroves preservation and restoration and of course, climate change mitigation and adaptation. These projects will attract grant funding in the range of a few hundred million dollars.

The Ministry of Environment acts as the enforcement institution of the Green Climate Fund and I would like to give you a summary of the works we have performed. Currently, two national-level projects and three regional-level projects have been approved by the Fund.

Then, about preservation of natural resources. Although the natural resources of Sri Lanka have contributed to the sustainable existence of the people for many millennia, they have been depleting rapidly for several decades. The causes for this unfortunate situation include deforestation, soil erosion, deposition of silt in reservoirs, destruction of natural wetlands and biodiversity et cetera. Due to the clearing of forests for other land uses, the productivity of the total area of the Island has decreased or is at risk of decreasing.

To prevent land degradation, the Ministry has prepared the National Action Plan for Prevention of Land Degradation 2015-2024.

Sri Lankas biodiversity has been highlighted globally and has also been declared as one of the 36 world biodiversity hotspots.

I must emphasize that considering all these factors, protecting the environment is everyones job, not only that of the Ministry of Environment. All the government institutions are required to cooperate with the Ministry to preserve, safeguard and sustainably develop the environment we all live in.

As far as commercial value addition and industrial usage of minerals are concerned, the GSMB, which is the

only institution that has mapped all the mineral resources in Sri Lanka, and the GSMB Technical Services (Pvt.) Limited are two institutions belonging to our Ministry. By now, we have completed the classification of mineral resources of Sri Lanka. One is the mineral resources which can bring in foreign exchange and the other is the mineral resources which the local industries need. However, there is no proper assessment to calculate the volume and value of the identified mineral pits in the country. So, the value of those minerals is not reflected in the Gross Domestic Product of the country.

The Central Environmental Authority is also an important institution under our Ministry. As the main national institution which implements the National Environmental Act, No. 47 of 1980, it is there for the protection of the environment, regulation and coordination of related activites and as an advisory institution related to the environment. The implementation of school environment pioneer programme, the environmental educational awareness programme, follow-up activities relating to water condition, monitoring of the quality of the air as well as 24-hour reception of environmental complaints are also carried out by the Central Environmental Authority. Further, efforts are being made to reduce the impact of single-use plastics on the environment from the year 2021.

Sir, there are more services being carried out by our Ministry. Sri Lanka Climate Fund (Pvt.) Limited is another institution that operates under our Ministry, which has been established to assist Sri Lankans to move towards a low-carbon and climate-resilient Blue and Green Development. Through this institution, many sustainable environmental advisory projects are implemented such as Greenhouse Gas Verification, the Sri Lanka Carbon Credit Scheme, the Clean Development Mechanism and Energy Audit.

On behalf of the Ministry of Environment, an amount of Rs. 2,223 million has been allocated by the Budget, 2023. Out of that, Rs. 1,564 million as Recurrent Expenditure and Rs. 659 million as Capital Expenditure has been allocated. Out of the Capital Expenditure, Rs. 329 million has been received as foreign aid to Sri Lanka. As a climate-vulnerable country, Sri Lanka needs to make more budgetary provisions for climate change issues in line with the latest recommendations of the World Bank Group, which says that investing an average of 1.4 per cent of GDP annually could reduce emissions in developing countries by as much as 70 per cent by 2050 and boost resilience. For allocating an amount of Rs. 2,223 million on behalf of our Ministry under difficult circumstances when the country is undergoing an economic crisis, I would like to express my heartiest gratitude to the Hon. President as the Minister of Finance.

Before I conclude, let me answer the questions raised by the Hon. Members regarding the Director General of the GSMB. We have already issued a charge sheet to him and follow-up action is in progress.

1855 1856

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, your time is already up. Please conclude your speech.

( ) (The Hon. Naseer Ahamed) Sir, I have to answer some more questions raised by the Hon. Members. Okay, I will cut short my speech.

Likewise, with regard to the GSMB Chairman's issue relating to sand mining in Safi Nagar, complaints have been made to the CID and the National Audit Office is evaluating the whole thing. The report will be submitted. Once that is received, necessary action will be taken as per the advice of all those institutions.

Today, some Hon. Members gave us advice, some criticized us and some others expressed their opinions. All those will be taken into consideration. Maybe, in the coming future, I will be able to answer all of their questions.

I will ensure that the Ministry of Environment is driven in the right direction. I appeal to this House to give me a chance to clean up the entire institution. I know the institution is corrupt; there are so many corrupt activities going on. Give me a chance and I will clean up this institution and ensure that it will bring in revenue to the country.

Thank you.
