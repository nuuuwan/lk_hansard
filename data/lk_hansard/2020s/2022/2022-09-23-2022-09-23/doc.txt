VOTE OF CONDOLENCE: HER MAJESTY QUEEN

ELIZABETH II

[9.43 a.m.] ) ( - , , ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena - Prime Minister and Minister of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government) Hon. Speaker, I move,

That this Parliament resolves that Parliament of Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka pays its deepest sympathies to His Majesty King Charles III and the Royal Family and people of Great Britain on the demise of worlds immensely respected Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.

. . Question proposed. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) .

[9.44 a.m.]

) ( - , ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe - President, Minister of Defence and Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies) Hon. Speaker, amongst all the letters of congratulations I received on becoming President, the one that was sent by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II was special. It would have been, if not her last letter of congratulations, one of her last letters of congratulations.

Her Majesty has been very frail after the death of her husband His Royal Highness Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. But, no one expected a sudden passing away of the Queen like this. Two days before her death, we saw Her Majesty on television with her outgoing Prime Minister and the incoming Prime Minister and she looked a bit exhausted. Anyway, anyone who spends half a day with the outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the incoming Prime Minister Liz Truss would have been exhausted! So, that was nothing special. Then, we heard of her passing away.

Funeral ceremonies are all over now. But, we have to grapple with one issue: what did Queen Elizabeth II mean to us - to Sri Lanka, the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth and to the world? As Queen of Ceylon, her reign signified the transformation of our country from Ceylon to Sri Lanka. The great political upheavals started under her: the 1956 Election victory, the emergence of the ethnic issue, the coming up of the generation of free education, the State control of the economy, the two coup d'tats against Governments and the start of the armed uprising in the South.

Her Majesty is a staunch Christian and held to her beliefs as a defender of the Anglican faith, but as Queen of Ceylon, she also upheld the commitment to safeguard Buddhism under the Kandyan Convention of 1815. A little-known fact is that Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II presided over the 2500th Buddha Jayanthi Anniversary celebrations as the Head of Ceylon together with the Kings of Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and the President of Burma, by which name Myanmar was then known.

After her term came to an end and we became a Republic, there were also two issues that had been left behind, which are still unresolved. The conversion from the Dominion of Ceylon into the Unitary State of the Republic of Sri Lanka brought about the emergence of the ethnic issue, which, in turn, led to uprisings and still, the last part of it has to be resolved.

Then, the other issue that had been raised was, if you want a figurehead, why do we not have the Queen and why do you need a figurehead Pesident?

I remember that the late Mr. B.A. Siriwardena, Editor of the Aththa, wrote an editorial stating that we need

not become a Republic to become a socialist country. Then, there was also the issue raised by the then Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. J.R. Jayewardene, supported by his Chief Opposition Whip, the Hon. Ranasinghe Premadasa, as to why we need a figurehead President. They said that if we are to have a President, we should have an Executive Presidency on the model of France. Now, that also is still an unresolved question. Many had pledged to abolish it and won elections, but no one has done it yet.

In a sense, the Queen represented not only the transformation of Sri Lanka, but also the transformations in the rest of the world - the transfer of power from the West to Asia and Africa, the dismantling of the British Empire, the UK joining the European Union and then leaving it, now redefining its role as Britain globally.

Queen Elizabeth II was different. From Head of the British Colonies, she became the Head of the Commonwealth of Nations, a transformation which represents her greatest success in bringing together the West and the rest. The Commonwealth of Nations saw some of the most outstanding leaders of our time - Sir Winston Churchill, Dame Margaret Thatcher, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Sir Robert Menzies, Pierre Trudeau, Lester Pearson, Nelson Mandela, Jomo Kenyatta, Kenneth Kaunda, Julius Nyerere, Kwame Nkrumah, Lee Kuan Yew, and Tunku Abdul Rahman amongst others - get together with Her Majesty the Queen.

In this transformation, Queen Elizabeth II became to us a symbol of stability, a symbol of adaptability - no other Queen would have jumped out of a helicopter with James Bond - and a symbol of duty. As a global icon, she outranked the UK, a nation which has to charter its fortune now without its greatest soft power asset, Queen Elizabeth, who was one hundred times more powerful than the aircraft carrier named after her.

It is to pay our respect to this global icon that many of us participated in the funeral service at Westminster Abbey. It was a very moving funeral service. The most poignant moment began when all of us in the Abbey, Christian or non-Christian, joined in to sing her favourite hymn The Lord is my shepherd: Goodness and mercy all my life, shall surely follow me, and in Gods house forevermore, my dwelling place shall be.

Queen Elizabeth II is no more. Therefore, while supporting the Motion moved by the Hon. Prime Minister, I request the Hon.Speaker to convey our condolences to His Majesty King Charles III and members of the Royal Family.

Sir, I conclude this tribute to Queen Elizabeth II of Ceylon, the last of our royal line which began with King Vijaya, with this verse.

Anicca vata sankhara, uppadavaya-dhammino; uppajjitva nirujjhanti, tesam vupasamo sukho.

"Impermanent are formations, subject to rise and fall. Having arisen, they cease; their subsiding is bliss".

Thank you.

[9.52 a.m.] ) ( - , , ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena - Prime Minister and Minister of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government) Hon. Speaker, joining the Debate on the Vote of Condolence in memory of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, I would like to state that the passing away of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II has certainly saddened the people of Sri Lanka, Great Britain and the people across the world. While sharing our sincere grief, the people of Sri Lanka offer their sincere gratitude for the remarkable life dedicated to service of faith and duty.

We recognize this as a time of profound personal loss for the British Royal Family, who are mourning a beloved mother, grandmother and a great-grandmother.

The Queen visited our shores on three occasions. The first time was as Princess with Prince Philip on their honeymoon and on two other occasions later during the course of her seven-decade reign as the Queen. She was touched with sympathy and kindness for the people of Sri Lanka whenever our people were afflicted by tragedy and disaster.

Queen Elizabeth II was also the Head of the Commonwealth and today, the Parliament of Sri Lanka joins together with the extended Commonwealth Parliaments in sorrow and mourning over her loss.

As mentioned by the President of Sri Lanka, in presence, he paid his last respect to the Queen on Her final journey and on September 19th, Sri Lanka declared an official state of mourning in Her remembrance.

At this time, on behalf of Parliament and all Sri Lankans, we convey our deepest condolences to the new King, the Royal Family and the people of Britain.

Like his mother before him, the King has a deep and lasting connection with Sri Lanka, a love for our beautiful country and hopefully, a deep affection towards our people.

May Queen Elizabeth II rest in peace and achieve the supreme bliss of Nirvana!

Thank you.

[9.54 a.m.] ) ( - ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa -Leader of the Opposition) Hon. President, Hon. Speaker and Hon. Members of Parliament, we all are gathered here today to pay our tribute to Britains longest reigning monarch, the late Queen Elizabeth II. She was the United Kingdoms longest reigning monarch and one of the longest reigning monarchs in all of recorded history.

We pay tribute to Her Majesty, not just for the longevity of her reign, not simply for the stability that she brought to her subjects and her nation, not just for her graciousness and stature - of course, we remember her for all these reasons - but also because we recognize and acknowledge her unyielding passion for duty and her uncompromising dedication to the service of the United Kingdom and the monarchy. The tributes that have thus far been made in this Chamber and beyond, from the

537 538

White House of the United States to the Parliaments of the Commonwealth of Nations and the people across Great Britain, are undeniable testaments to the love the people had for their Queen, a reflection of the adoration and respect she inspired and thus, an ultimate reflection of Her Majestys own loyalty to Her nation and the Crown.

This Chamber also pays its respects to Her Late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on account of our status as a Commonwealth nation, as a nation state of the global community of nations and also as a special acknowledgement of our shared history with the United Kingdom and its people. Whatever our political differences were and the history of confrontation which resulted from the periods of colonization, we come together to acknowledge their grief; we understand that the people of Great Britain are mourning and we do respect that in all sincerity.

This Chamber, our institutions, our laws, some of our political customs and political structures have all evolved from our British colonial past and beyond. As a former colony, we cannot deny a colonial hangover. That is a reality and should never be ignored or forgotten. The oppression of peoples around the world at the hands of British imperialism is widely acknowledged.

Those debates around republicanism within the UK and around the Commonwealth will only grow with the passing away of Queen Elizabeth II. This, in itself, is a testament and a tribute to her reign and her very being. While those debates may continue and while I respect all those who have divergent opinions on the British Monarch and its history of imperialism, I also acknowledge that the freedoms we possess to debate and disagree are foundational to the story of human emancipation. However, as human beings, we all must respect the grief of the millions of people around the world, particularly those in the United Kingdom, given that Sri Lankas history itself is forever intertwined with the history of the United Kingdom. At this particular juncture, Sir, please permit me to reflect on the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. We are all aware that the United Kingdom is a parliamentary democracy with a constitutional monarchy. That means that despite all the pomp and pageantry surrounding the Royal Family, while the Queen was wearing the Crown, while King Charles III now wears the imperial Crown, political power is wielded by others usually far removed from the Royal Family. In many ways, that is what that has ensured the survival of the British monarchy - its distance to the power centre as well as its proximity to the nations heart.

Whatever else Queen Elizabeth II is remembered for, she will not be remembered for her political beliefs; she will never be defined by her political ideology. For someone who had existed as Head of State for over 70 years, we must acknowledge, it is an extraordinary achievement to be perceived as politically neutral throughout that period defined by social and economic upheaval, revolution, war and technological advancement. The real legacy of Queen Elizabeth II was that she always

found herself above the fray. Rarely would she react or respond without considerable measure; she remained as disciplined a public servant as there has ever been or perhap as there ever will be.

Do remember that the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom must update the Queen once a week with a private, face-to-face audience. Her Late Majesty had those weekly appointments with 14 different Prime Ministers over a 70-year period.

Though Queen Elizabeth II was, in many ways, a very young Queen at the time of her Coronation, she had already had many, many years of preparation for her duties. One of the enduring personality traits, confirmed by all those close to her, was her sense of obligation to duty and service. Further evidence of that lies in her preparation for her meetings with Prime Ministers, her questions to them and her natural curiosity about the world beyond her own inner circle.

We all are aware that Sir Winston Churchill was her first Prime Minister. Prime Minister Churchill was also a friend of her father, King George VI. There are stories of how Prime Minister Churchill was initially unsure about how a young Queen would manage the British Empire and the prevailing pressures on the Crown. I recall the footage of how Sir Winston Churchill joined the Royal Family including King George VI and the future Queen Elizabeth II on the Royal Balcony, waving to millions after the end of the World War II on 08th May, 1945. Queen Elizabeth II was said to have been extremely impressed, even beguiled by the relationship her father, the King, had with his subjects and the love and adoration they had for him.

That was in the years following the Blitz on London, where many buildings in the City were bombed, a perilous moment for the United Kingdom, and where a moment of existential dread was overcome with the dual powers of the Government of the United Kingdom and its Royal Family, in whose name the Army of the United Kingdom entered the battlefield. It was a solemn relationship.

On her 21st birthday, the future Queen made her own solemn vow to her people: I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service I want to remind this House that Queen Elizabeth II was on royal duties in Kenya when King George VI passed away. She was whisked away from her duties to a lifetime of service. There were no questions asked, she would henceforth sacrifice herself and her family for the betterment of the Crown. Queen Elizabeth waited for over a year for her own Coronation out of respect for her father, the late King George VI.

When we recall the late Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill and his relationship with the late Queen Elizabeth II, we should note that there was some divergence between the Queen and her Prime Minister during the post-war period about Britains place in the world. We must remember that Sir Winston Churchill fought many wars for the British Empire and was a strong

539 540

[ ]

2022 23

supporter of retaining Britains global supremacy in the face of a trend towards decolonization, proliferation of independence movements and the dissolution of the British Empire. He differed from the young Queen Elizabeth with regard to that; the Queen preferred a loose confederation of States which would come to be known as the Commonwealth. In fact, the very young Queen Elizabeth II went on a much-publicized world tour visiting many nations that would later become members of the Commonwealth, a world tour against the advice of her Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill. From such tours began her reign as Britains most important diplomat; Queen Elizabeth II would become United Kingdoms most experienced diplomat, an experience that no other person had ever had, not before and certainly not since.

When we talk about her relationships with Prime Ministers, we must remind ourselves that when Labour Leader Harold Wilson became Prime Minister in 1964, there was much trepidation that the famous lefty would disrupt the formalities between the Crown and the Government. That was a time of social and economic upheaval and unrest with Britain undergoing economic hardships. There was widespread dissatisfaction with the Conservative establishment of the time, which led to the rise of the Labour Party under Harold Wilson, who was himself an avid supporter of the unions and the labour movements of the day. The 1960s was also a period of counterculture and rebellion against tradition, all of which were a threat to the monarchy. It has been noted that the Queens experiences with the Prime Ministers had always revolved around the perspectives from the Conservative side of the political aisle. The Premiership of Mr. Wilson would, in fact, be the first time that Queen Elizabeth II would be given the perspective from a different side of the political aisle. It is said that she cherished her briefings with Harold Wilson, that her natural curiosity would lead to many questions regarding the labour struggle and the unions being put to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister Wilson, for his part, was always ready to treat the Queen as his equal, someone to learn from as well as to educate.

Great Britain faced many challenges with revolts against the Wilson Government from the unions, pressure from the coal and steel industries while trade with former colonies had broken down. It is said that her audiences with Harold Wilson would last longer and longer with each passing week and that she would often ask him to stay longer than was required. Harold Wilson was said to have explained to the Queen the issues facing the working class in a manner that previous Prime Ministers had seldom cared to. He shared the experiences of the unions with Her Late Majesty. Her Late Majesty even began inviting Prime Minister Wilson to stay for drinks after the audience had officially ended serving brandy and gin, breaking traditions of many decades in the process. There is even a story about Prime Minister Wilson being invited to the Balmoral Castle in Scotland for a traditional barbecue cooked by the Duke of Edinburgh and the washing up done by the Queen herself.

Queen Elizabeth II had a far less congenial relationship with the "Iron Lady", Prime Minister

Margaret Thatcher, a politician who was famous for tough talking with a confrontational style and was the complete opposite of the Queen, who was always required to steer clear of confrontation. I must bring to the attention of the House that during the Thatcher era, there was rising inequality due to economic issues, unemployment was high and social unrest was threatening to spill over. Thatcher would confront unrest with force, something which the Queen was said to have been most uncomfortable with. Another point to note is that under Prime Minister Thatcher, Britain took a hands-off approach on the issue of apartheid in South Africa, where her Government even effectively slowed down the imposition of sanctions on the apartheid Government of the time. Queen Elizabeth, against the advice of Prime Minister Thatcher, travelled to a Meeting of the Commonwealth Heads of Government, supporting the claims of anti-apartheid agitations in South Africa. Despite her differences with Prime Minister Thatcher, Queen Elizabeth was unhappy at the treatment meted out to Prime Minister Thatcher towards the end of her Premiership. That was the mark of a person who was able to understand the human element even in power games of the political arena.

I want to impress upon the House the notion of the Queen or now, in the case of the King as a sovereign of the people, the idea that one person can represent a definitive authority within a hierarchy. There is a certain romanticism to this idea. It is worth pursuing to understand the role of the monarch and how well and so diligently Queen Elizabeth II discharged the duties of her role over a 70-year period. The tradition of the Prime Minister meeting the monarch once a week is part of that notion of the sovereign. Just consider the Prime Minister, with all the lawful constitutional powers, diligently and without fail every week - week in, week out - paying a visit to the monarch, literally bowing before the sovereign and updating him or her on the happenings of the Government while also taking advice from the monarch on any matter which they see fit. This tradition of a Prime Minister bowing before the monarch is a manifestation of the ideal that the monarch represents something bigger than the Office of the Prime Minister, something beyond the powers of the Government. The sovereign is another representation of the will of the people and of the stakeholders of the wider State. As the Head of State, the monarch must be respected and that respect is what is cloaked in the romanticism of the sovereign. The respect that the monarchy has earned is perhaps what has solidified its foundations during the late Queens long and distinguished reign.

Since Sri Lanka does not have a monarch, it is the people of Sri Lanka who are sovereign. Thus, it is the people of Sri Lanka that our leaders - the President, the Prime Minister - must bow to. The culture of being secondary to the people of this country, to the electorate or the body politic is something that we must urgently develop in Sri Lanka. Our own political and economic upheaval and social unrest created by a political oligarchy which thought itself to be a virtual monarchy in Sri Lanka is reason enough for our political leaders to finally accept that there is something bigger than them, bigger than the

541 542

Government: the will of the people. The Sri Lankan Government and the institutions of the Government, the Parliament itself, have lost the trust of the people; this House is no longer representative of the people. So, we must give ourselves to something bigger than ourselves, if we are to truly transform Sri Lanka. The Government of Sri Lanka and its institutions must regain and recapture the respect of its own people and that of the international community, on whom we so depend. For this, we must take many lessons from Her Late Majesty the Queen, a monarch whose reign began long before the popularization of the television in every home across the world and long before the 24-hour news cycle and the climate of gossip columns came into being. Even through scandals and setbacks, the monarch, the late Queen, was always able to maintain the respect of her subjects.

Queen Elizabeth II was unique in this way: she is the first modern royal to negotiate the media culture of the late 20th and the early 21st Centuries and she had done so barely putting a foot wrong. Even in the face of her own Annus Horribilis of 1992, through the death of Princess Diana, the various personal issues of her children, through the Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic, Queen Elizabeth II departed with the same aura of respect she earned throughout her reign. The manner in which she conducted herself throughout is a testament to the ideal that the institution she represented was more important than the family itself, than herself and her own personal predilections; she represented the ultimate symbol of survival and sacrifice to the institution. Even as that institution had to evolve with time, she ensured that she would remain consistent to the values that have always defined it.

It is speculated that, since the Queen was never born to be a queen and did, in fact, spend 11 years of her life as a royal with no prospect of being the Queen, perhaps she was naturally never meant to be a conceited person, never looking beyond her station. She was able to develop the reverence of the Crown before she became the heir, thereby, as the heir, she understood the transient nature of the Throne.

Through it all, she had a partner with her, the Duke of Edinburgh, to whom she was married for over 70 years. Despite losing him, Queen Elizabeth II never once wavered from her steadfast sense of duty, the duty before self and her family.

There had been 61 monarchs of England spreading over 1,200 years. In this modern world, in this 21st Century, the question How has this monarchy lasted for so long? will always be asked. In my humblest opinion, it is because many monarchs managed to somehow earn and retain the respect of their people and some, even earned their love and adoration. Queen Elizabeth II earned both the respect of her subjects as well as the love and adoration of her people; she was devoted to them and they were to her.

Hon. Speaker, at this juncture, I would like to pay our tribute and respect to Her Majesty the Queen and to the

Royal Family, her extended family and the people of Britain, express our condolences and deepest sympathies on the demise of Her Late Majesty.

Her late Majesty was the symbol of stability, the Mother of her Nation, the Head of State and the Queen of their hearts.

May she rest in peace!

[10.21 a.m.]

) ( ( ) ) (The Hon. Jayantha Weerasinghe, PC) First, I wish to thank the Hon. Speaker for allotting time for me to extend my condolences on the demise of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.

Hon. Speaker, Hon. Members of Parliament, to describe Her Majestys reign as a glorious, exemplary and a splendiferous reign is hardly a superlative description. In that, Her Majesty has left a record of a reign, which would be a hard act to follow for all future successors. She ascended the Throne in 1952 on the demise of her late great father, King George VI.

Today, one has to ask, why is this universal outpouring of sorrow and admiration for her? What is the secret of that? It is because of an unspoken feeling that Her Majestys death signifies the end of an era and that the world would never see the like again. In her period of being the Queen, which spanned 70 meaningful long years, she had seen 15 Prime Ministers, a staggering record! She had weekly meetings with them, week after week. And with which Prime Minister did she start? The inimitable great Sir Winston Churchill. From 1952 onwards, not only did she interact with 15 Prime Ministers - the last being Liz Truss, who was sworn in by Her Majesty probably a few days before her death - starting from the legendary Sir Winston Churchill, but also had seen the periods of government of 14 US Presidents. No mean record at that! The only US President she missed was Lyndon Johnson. So, barring Lyndon Johnson, with 14 US Presidents, she interacted successfully, the longest reigning monarch in British history with a staggering reign of 70 long years - it would be better to say 70 glorious years - in the service of her country and the Commonwealth.

Her devotion to duty was legendary. She never uttered a word which she later had to regret or withdraw. Never. All her Prime Ministers had constantly intoned that from her, during those weekly meetings, they were able to garner a lot of important issues and ideas, and all the Prime Ministers, starting from Sir Winston Churchill, greatly appreciated the advice that she always proffered in a very independent, nevertheless in the most useful manner for Prime Ministers to observe in the future.

We all know that she was certainly not born in straight line to the Throne, but fortuitously came to the Throne because of the very well-known abdication crisis. Had it not been for that, we would never have seen this legendary Queen. That abdication crisis caused her fathers brother to leave the Throne in order, as he said, To marry the woman I love, Mrs. Simpson. Then, after the abdication of her uncle, her fathers older brother, her own father became the King and thus, it paved the way for this remarkable Queen and her remarkable reign.

From a very young age, virtually from childhood to adolescence, Her Late Majesty experienced the horrors of

545 546

the Second World War and in that period, she was trained by her late father in the greatest constitutional principles, which she followed for the rest of her life. When she came to the Throne, they had just got over what was known as the "Blitz", day in, day out, night after night bombings of London and the suburbs. In that period, she saw her own fathers house, the Buckingham Palace, being bombed and it was at that point that there were suggestions that the Royal Family should evacuate England and for the safety of the family and the children, they should go to an independent country and live there. When that suggestion was made, the reply given by Her Majestys late mother, Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, is worthwhile to remember. When they were asked whether they are going to leave England for the safety of the family and children, this is what the Late Majestys mother, Queen Elizabeth, said: The children will never leave without me. I will never leave without the King and the King, of course, will never leave. Those words, her subjects never forgot either during the war or thereafter. That was the type of training Queen Elizabeth II had: serve the country, serve the people, serve the Commonwealth.

Then, Sir, during the War, she served in the Auxiliary Territorial Service, which was known as ATS, and that was not merely a small appointment just to kid the people, certainly not. During the War, 335 ATS women were killed or lost their lives. It is in such a regiment that Her Late Majesty served as a young adolescent.

Thus, she became the first member of the Royal Family to be an active duty member of the British Armed Forces.

She celebrated her Silver Jubilee in 1977, the Golden Jubilee in 2002 and the Platinum Jubilee in 2022, the first to do so in the history of Britain and probably, the only one to do so in the future as well.

Her Majesty graced this country twice: first, in 1954 and then, in the 1980s. She was married for 73 years and was fortunate to have as her helpmate an equally dutiful husband and also such dutiful children. Her son Charles III, who now succeeds her, is no stranger to Sri Lanka. Today, the Commonwealth flourishes because of the guidance she gave for 70 years. Let us, at this point, while passing our condolences on the death of the Late Queen, also extend our good wishes to King Charles III and hope that he would be an equally remarkable and meaningful monarch.

There is one more thing I want to state here, how Her Late Majesty always went on with the times and changed her stance with the times to keep in touch with the changing times. A number of years ago, when there was a public clamour that the Queen should pay taxes, she realized that it was time even for a sovereign to pay taxes, readily acceded and agreed to pay taxes, much to the admiration of her countrymen.

Hon. Speaker, while we mourn the passing away of a great sovereign, let us also wish that her successor, King

Charles III, who is also no stranger to this country will have the good fortune to have a memorable reign to match that of his mother.

Thank you. [10.34 a.m.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. S.M.M. Muszhaaraff) Hon. Speaker, I am profoundly honoured to participate in this Vote of Condolence on the passing away of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. I was deeply saddened by the passing away of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.

Her sense of duty and service to the UK and the Commonwealth is a remarkable example for the world as a whole. I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the UK, the Realms of the Commonwealth and by countless people around the world. This is a painful period of mourning for nations around the world. Over her seven remarkable decades on the Throne, the Queen consistently proved herself to be as powerful a leader on the world stage as she was an effective guiding hand to the British Government behind the scenes.

As Head of the Commonwealth, her duty, dedication and service marked the life of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, a life that demands our greatest respect and thus, embodies the values we aim to stand for. Her legacy is enduring and her service to the people is inspiring. Her determination or tenacity is an inspiration for many people around the world. Her legacy will dominate large in the history and in the story of our world.

Sir, Her Majesty the Queen was not only a huge inspiration to many, but was also a mother, a wife and a grandmother like many other women. She paved the way for the masses with her charitable work, fashion, statements and her service in the army. She travelled the globe on State visits and leisure visits, thereby connecting the world; everyone, even indigenous people knew her name. Her love did not stop at individuals or people, but extended to animals as well such as her corgis, horses and swans. No one can or will ever replace the Queen. She had touched many hearts and joined the world as one.

In 1954, just five months after her Coronation, Queen Elizabeth II engaged in a royal visit to Sri Lanka. That was the first visit by a reigning monarch to Sri Lanka. The ten-day tour included a royal procession in Colombo, where she opened the First Session of the Second Parliament of Sri Lanka, then Ceylon, a train ride to Kandy and tours of Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Nuwara Eliya.

Her Majesty the Queen visited Sri Lanka again in 1981 to witness the construction of the Victoria Dam, Sri Lankas largest hydroelectric power project. Her Majesty also issued a public message on the 70th Anniversary of

547 548

[ ( ) ]

2022 23

Sri Lankas Independence stating, The relationship between our two countries has continued to grow over the years, and it is my hope that the connection between our people continues to flourish in the years to come.

Sir, back in 1947, on her 21st birthday, then Princess Elizabeth said, My whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service. For 75 years, Queen Elizabeth more than fulfilled that vow; she performed her duties with commitment, wisdom and a profound sense of service. She set a tremendous example for all of us.

Whilst I respectfully remember the life of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and feel sorrow at her departure, I send my warmest wishes to King Charles III on his accession to the Throne of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The dedication and commitment of the King to young people and the common good is well-known and has had a significant influence across the world. I wish His Majesty good health and strength throughout his reign.

Sir, I conclude my remarks with an excerpt from Her Majestys 2008 Christmas Broadcast: When life seems hard, the courageous do not lie down and accept defeat; instead, they are all the more determined to struggle for a better future.

Thank you.

[10.39 a.m.]

) ) ( () - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe - Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms) Hon. Speaker, I am thankful to you for giving us the opportunity to express our condolences to His Majesty King Charles III, the members of the Royal Family and the citizens of the United Kingdom on the passing away of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.

The Hon. President, on behalf of our nation, paid the last respects to Her Late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II at Westminster Abbey. In addition to that, all the political Party Leaders in this House expressed their condolences. After Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II was enthroned in February, 1952, one of her first overseas visits was to Sri Lanka. That was in April, 1954.

The reign of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II was legendary. I do not think there had been any queen or king who held that position for a period as long as 70 years in the history.

I am happy to mention, Sir, that I met Her Majesty in February, 2015 when I attended the Commonwealth Law

Ministers Meeting and there, she expressed memories of her visit to Sri Lanka in 1954. I was rather surprised that she had such a long memory when Her Majesty explained how she went to Sigiriya and the Dalada Maligawa in Kandy.

If one follows the life of Her Majesty, we can learn a lot. There is a nice TV series about her on Netflix named The Crown, which, I think, has about 40 to 50 episodes. One can comprehend what kind of challenges she had faced, especially during the period of the crisis over the Suez Canal, in which the British were involved and how prudently she, as the Head of the Commonwealth and the Head of the United Kingdom handled all those issues and resolved them smoothly.

I can remember the visit of Prince Charles, now His Majesty King Charles III, to Sri Lanka on our 50th Independence Day in 1998. He visited our Colombo National Museum and after the visit, he admired the way we have preserved our historical monuments.

Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, until her demise, remained as the Head of the Commonwealth, within which there are 14 countries with Dominion status which recognized the Queen as the Head of State of their countries. Her demise, of course, is a great loss to the United Kingdom as well as to the world. During Her Majesty's period, there had been 15 Prime Ministers serving the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom prospered during that entire period under her leadership.

Therefore, as a nation, we all convey our condolences on her death to His Majesty King Charles III, the members of the Royal Family and also to the citizens of the United Kingdom. By extension, it includes the Commonwealth countries which recognized the Queen as their Head of State.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) The next speaker is the Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake. [10.44 a.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) Hon. Speaker, on behalf of the Gamini Dissanayake family, I join the many Sri Lankans in mourning the passing away of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.

I recall Her Majestys visit to Sri Lanka in 1981. My late father was the Minister-in-Attendance. I was a small boy and did not have the good fortune of meeting Her Majesty. However, the opening of the Victoria Project under the Accelerated Mahaweli Development Programme was a historic event that is etched on the hearts and minds of the Sri Lankan people. I recall how thousands of people, waving many Sri Lankan and

549 550

British Flags, stood for hours just to catch a glimpse of Her Majesty as her motorcade passed by. The people of this country greatly appreciate her active support for the Accelerated Mahaweli Development Programme.

This House joins the millions of people across the world in paying tribute to a much loved and respected monarch. I would like to convey my deepest sympathies and condolences to the Royal Family.

May Her Majesty's gracious soul rest in peace!

Thank you. [10.46 a.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Niroshan Perera) Hon. Speaker, I wish to express my condolences to the Royal Family at the passing away of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. I was extremely sad to hear the sudden news of the Queens departure after hearing about concerns for her failing health earlier in the day.

Like many, I have known of the Queen all my life and I have admired her life-long sacred duty, reassuring presence, unfailing commitment and selfless service to the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth of Nations. I will always keep fond memories of royal celebrations as well as watching on television her marvelous arrival at the 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony in London and her brilliant and entertaining tea party with Paddington Bear for the Platinum Jubilee. I was especially looking forward to the celebration of the Queens 100th birthday and was hoping that that would be possible. However, I am sad that she could not reach that historic milestone in actual life.

Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II always had a special relationship with Sri Lanka. In 1954, just five months after her Coronation, Queen Elizabeth engaged in a royal visit to Sri Lanka. That was the first visit by a reigning monarch to Sri Lanka. She was accompanied by her husband Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh. The ten-day tour included a royal visit to Colombo, where she opened the First Session of the Second Parliament of Ceylon, a train ride to Kandy and tours of Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Nuwara Eliya. They visited again in 1981 to witness the construction of the Victoria Dam, Sri Lankas largest hydroelectric project built by a UK firm under the Presidency of J.R. Jayewardene.

I will continue to remember the Queen for her devotion to duty, love for her family and people, her beauty and the winning smile, her stylish attire, her graceful and dignified manner, her passion for her horses and corgis, her understanding, care and patience, hard work, leadership and her fantastic sense of humour. I will

personally miss Her Majesty the Queen immensely and continue to hold her in high esteem and will always think of her with deep affection. I believe that she had thoroughly done her duty and was ready to join her husband, His Royal Highness Prince Philip. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth has been an amazing example to us all throughout her whole life, faithfully honouring her pledge to devote herself to the service of her people.

I would like to pass on my deepest respect and condolences to King Charles III and the whole Royal Family at this sorrowful time. We give our grateful and heartfelt thanks for a faithful and devoted reign of 70 years of dutiful and loyal service as a record-breaking monarch and over 96 years well lived. Thank you very much, Your Majesty. We were very lucky to have your memory with us.

God bless Her Majesty the Queen! May her soul rest in peace!

Thank you. [.. 10.40]

Hon. Deputy Speaker, I also want to say a few words on the demise of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. I am, of course, a republican, but irrespective of the fact that I am a republican, I have to acknowledge the fact that Queen Elizabeth II was the Head of State of Sri Lanka since her Coronation in 1953 until we became a republic under the 1972 Republican Constitution.

I think whenever we talk of royals - with no disrespect to the royals in other countries - in true nature, we only refer to one royal family and that is the British Royal Family. We know why. That is because the Queen had been the Head of State of 32 sovereign countries during her entire reign and after she was coronated, she became the Head of State of six independent countries along with

579 580

[ ... ]

2022 23

Sri Lanka. Sir, I just googled some facts and found that the role she had played was absolutely amazing; during the 70 years of her reign, she played it with such grace and dignity. Over 170 Prime Ministers of Commonwealth countries served under her. So, if there is anything to learn from the life and the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, it is the manner in which she conducted her duties and when a lot of attention was brought upon the royal family, how she acted with dignity. It all can be admired.

So, at this juncture, we would like to express our sympathies to the British Royal family and the people of England and the Commonwealth.

Thank you.
