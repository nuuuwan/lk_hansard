At this particular juncture, Sir, please permit me to reflect on the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. We are all aware that the United Kingdom is a parliamentary democracy with a constitutional monarchy. That means that despite all the pomp and pageantry surrounding the Royal Family, while the Queen was wearing the Crown, while King Charles III now wears the imperial Crown, political power is wielded by others usually far removed from the Royal Family. In many ways, that is what that has ensured the survival of the British monarchy - its distance to the power centre as well as its proximity to the nations heart.",

That was a time of social and economic upheaval and unrest with Britain undergoing economic hardships. There was widespread dissatisfaction with the Conservative establishment of the time, which led to the rise of the Labour Party under Harold Wilson, who was himself an avid supporter of the unions and the labour movements of the day. The 1960s was also a period of counterculture and rebellion against tradition, all of which were a threat to the monarchy. It has been noted that the Queens experiences with the Prime Ministers had always revolved around the perspectives from the Conservative side of the political aisle. The Premiership of Mr. Wilson would, in fact, be the first time that Queen Elizabeth II would be given the perspective from a different side of the political aisle. It is said that she cherished her briefings with Harold Wilson, that her natural curiosity would lead to many questions regarding the labour struggle and the unions being put to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister Wilson, for his part, was always ready to treat the Queen as his equal, someone to learn from as well as to educate.",

Harold Wilson was said to have explained to the Queen the issues facing the working class in a manner that previous Prime Ministers had seldom cared to. He shared the experiences of the unions with Her Late Majesty. Her Late Majesty even began inviting Prime Minister Wilson to stay for drinks after the audience had officially ended serving brandy and gin, breaking traditions of many decades in the process.

Thatcher would confront unrest with force, something which the Queen was said to have been most uncomfortable with. Another point to note is that under Prime Minister Thatcher, Britain took a hands-off approach on the issue of apartheid in South Africa, where her Government even effectively slowed down the imposition of sanctions on the apartheid Government of the time. Queen Elizabeth, against the advice of Prime Minister Thatcher, travelled to a Meeting of the Commonwealth Heads of Government, supporting the claims of anti-apartheid agitations in South Africa. Despite her differences with Prime Minister Thatcher, Queen Elizabeth was unhappy at the treatment meted out to Prime Minister Thatcher towards the end of her Premiership.

    "text": "I want to impress upon the House the notion of the Queen or now, in the case of the King as a sovereign of the people, the idea that one person can represent a definitive authority within a hierarchy. There is a certain romanticism to this idea. It is worth pursuing to understand the role of the monarch and how well and so diligently Queen Elizabeth II discharged the duties of her role over a 70-year period. The tradition of the Prime Minister meeting the monarch once a week is part of that notion of the sovereign. Just consider the Prime Minister, with all the lawful constitutional powers, diligently and without fail every week - week in, week out - paying a visit to the monarch, literally bowing before the sovereign and updating him or her on the happenings of the Government while also taking advice from the monarch on any matter which they see fit. This tradition of a Prime Minister bowing before the monarch is a manifestation of the ideal that the monarch represents something bigger than the Office of the Prime Minister, something beyond the powers of the Government. The sovereign is another representation of the will of the people and of the stakeholders of the wider State. As the Head of State, the monarch must be respected and that respect is what is cloaked in the romanticism of the sovereign. The respect that the monarchy has earned is perhaps what has solidified its foundations during the late Queens long and distinguished reign.",

Our own political and economic upheaval and social unrest created by a political oligarchy which thought itself to be a virtual monarchy in Sri Lanka is reason enough for our political leaders to finally accept that there is something bigger than them, bigger than the",

The Sri Lankan Government and the institutions of the Government, the Parliament itself, have lost the trust of the people; this House is no longer representative of the people.

The Government of Sri Lanka and its institutions must regain and recapture the respect of its own people and that of the international community, on whom we so depend. For this, we must take many lessons from Her Late Majesty the Queen, a monarch whose reign began long before the popularization of the television in every home across the world and long before the 24-hour news cycle and the climate of gossip columns came into being. Even through scandals and setbacks, the monarch, the late Queen, was always able to maintain the respect of her subjects.",

Even in the face of her own Annus Horribilis of 1992, through the death of Princess Diana, the various personal issues of her children, through the Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic, Queen Elizabeth II departed with the same aura of respect she earned throughout her reign. The manner in which she conducted herself throughout is a testament to the ideal that the institution she represented was more important than the family itself, than herself and her own personal predilections; she represented the ultimate symbol of survival and sacrifice to the institution. Even as that institution had to evolve with time, she ensured that she would remain consistent to the values that have always defined it.",

From 1952 onwards, not only did she interact with 15 Prime Ministers - the last being Liz Truss, who was sworn in by Her Majesty probably a few days before her death - starting from the legendary Sir Winston Churchill, but also had seen the periods of government of 14 US Presidents. No mean record at that! The only US President she missed was Lyndon Johnson.

When she came to the Throne, they had just got over what was known as the \"Blitz\", day in, day out, night after night bombings of London and the suburbs. In that period, she saw her own fathers house, the Buckingham Palace, being bombed and it was at that point that there were suggestions that the Royal Family should evacuate England and for the safety of the family and the children, they should go to an independent country and live there. When that suggestion was made, the reply given by Her Majestys late mother, Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, is worthwhile to remember. When they were asked whether they are going to leave England for the safety of the family and children, this is what the Late Majestys mother, Queen Elizabeth, said: The children will never leave without me. I will never leave without the King and the King, of course, will never leave. Those words, her subjects never forgot either during the war or thereafter. That was the type of training Queen Elizabeth II had: serve the country, serve the people, serve the Commonwealth.",

So, if there is anything to learn from the life and the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, it is the manner in which she conducted her duties and when a lot of attention was brought upon the royal family, how she acted with dignity. It all can be admired.",
