... ( ... - ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC - Minister of Foreign Affairs) Hon. Presiding Member, I just want to respond to the Hon. Selvam Adaikkalanathan.

Hon. Member, we can see that everybody is suffering due to this economic crisis, but it seems that the people of the North and the East are disproportionately suffering from it. A lot of people have gone to Tamil Nadu during the last six months or so. Some, mostly the Tamil-speaking brothers and sisters -320 people- are in Vietnam now. Two of them had consumed alcoholic sanitizer. Another seven persons who were interned in Ukraine are also Tamil-speaking people. We are looking at whether some sort of a publicity mechanism could be adopted to inform them not to get caught in human trafficking, trying to go to other countries on refugee status or on fake passports. Those who migrated like that are suffering there. Eighty five of those who are in Vietnam have

agreed to come back; we will facilitate them to come back. This crisis has disproportionately affected your community in the North and the East. So, we need to inform them not to get caught in human trafficking, Hon. Member.

[12.39 p.m.]

.. ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Hon. Presiding Member, I would like to make some observations on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and on the plans of the Government for the near future.

I think the most important ingredient of the foreign policy, Sir, is credibility; what we say must be believed, must be taken seriously. The Government has told us that they are planning to solve the ethnic issue through completely a new Constitution. The Government has also said that they propose to do that before the National Day, the Independence Day or the 04th of February. There had been governments which had been in power in this country with five-sixths majorities, two-thirds majorities. All those governments had made an attempt to get to grips with that problem and to come up with a viable solution. But, so far, all those attempts have failed. Now, does anybody believe that before the 4th of February, the present Government is going to solve that problem? Is there a minimum of credibility in that statement? Is there anybody on the planet who takes that statement seriously?

We are also told that there will be a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Will that be on the model of the South African Commission? The South African Commission had an exhaustive investigation. They summoned the oppressors and the victims; the people who were responsible for horrible atrocities and the families of the persons who were killed and the persons maimed and mutilated as a result of it. They were all brought together. And then, people like Desmond Tutu played a key role. They inquired whether there was genuine contrition, genuine repentance. If there was repentance, there was amnesty. If there was no repentance, then the criminal law was set in motion and there were indictments. Are we going to do that? Is there any serious intention of bringing the armed forces, the police in touch with victims? Is there any earnest desire to do any of this? Who would believe any of those promises?

Then, there are some very serious immediate issues. The Government is saying that they propose to get

support from the International Monetary Fund very soon. The international Monetary Fund has on three occasions mentioned the importance of a mandate. They want to deal with a country which has a mandate. The most important manifestation of a mandate is elections. There must be elections because the IMF makes its resources available to the people of a country through a government. And if there is no nexus between the government and the people, then there is a serious problem with regard to support from the International Monetary Fund.

Then, there is the GSP Plus issue, on which Sri Lankas exports are dependent at this moment. That is the lifeline which is keeping us alive. But, the GSP Plus is neither a gift nor an entitlement. The continuing enjoyment of GSP Plus is dependent upon compliance with 27 international instruments, principally the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, democracy and human rights. If there are no elections and if elections are deliberately not held, then the very basis for enjoyment of GSP Plus is eroded. We are in a situation, today, where Provincial Councils Elections have not been held for three years. As I address you today, there is not one single elected member in any provincial council in any part of the country. It is very much our wish that that will not happen to local government institutions as well.

Hon. Presiding Member, it is a happy coincidence that you have, in perfectly good faith, presented a Private Members' Bill. Your Bill was published in the Gazette of the 14th of October, 2022 and was presented to Parliament on the 08th of November. Before that, the Hon. Imthiaz Bakeer Markar presented a similar Private Members' Bill. The objectives are the same: to increase the threshold of youth representation and womens representation. The Hon. Imthiaz Bakeer Markars Bill was presented to this Parliament four months before the Private Members Bill of the Hon. Premnath C. Dolawatte. The Hon. Imthiaz Bakeer Markars Bill was published in the Gazette on the 02nd of June and was presented to this august Assembly on the 06th of July. The principles in the Bills are sound. There is no question about the principles of the Bill and we entirely accept that the Hon. Premnath C. Dolawatte, Attorney-at-Law, in perfect good faith, presented this legislation. But, we will not allow that Bill to be made use of as a pretext for the postponement of Local Government Elections. There is a view - I hope it is not correct - that the Government is planning to take up this Private Members Bill and to have it enacted next week soon after the Budget is passed . It is not possible, it cannot be done in accordance with the laws of this country, and we will do everything in our power to resist this insidious attempt in this House, in the country at large and before the Supreme Court of the Republic.

Sir, the legal position is, as the process of holding this election has already started - it started on the 20th of September and is ongoing - it cannot be interrupted, subverted or suspended by any attempt on the part of the Government. The law requires that 340 local authorities in this country must be in place before the 20th of March, next year. It means that the last date on which these

891 892

elections can be held is the 27th of February, 2023. There is a period of ten days notice for nominations. The nomination process takes one week, then starts the election campaign, for which the minimum is five weeks and the maximum is seven weeks. The principles contained in the Hon. Premnath C. Dolawattes Bill are prospective; they are for the future. They are not retrospective. They cannot be hijacked in the way that an innocuous Provincial Councils Bill was hijacked for the purpose of postponing the elections, which have still not been held. We know that that was a Bill connected with womens representation at provincial councils. The Government introduced about 13 new pages at the Committee Stage and subverted the entire content and the objective of the Bill. We will not allow that to happen with regard to the conduct of Local Government Elections.

Then, Sir, I have read repeated statements by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that they are interested in reorienting the priorities of Sri Lankas Foreign Policy. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and our Missions abroad are going to focus on economic diplomacy, by which they mean investment and foreign trade. I wish the Ministry well, but I am rather skeptical about success for three reasons. One reason is, if there is rampant corruption in this country, there is not going to be any serious investment. I regret that the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs is not here. I would ask him to have a look at the headline in one of the mainstream newspapers today about this scale and the magnitude of corruption. I want to say that nothing I am saying is intended to detract from the integrity and the professional competence of my Friend, the Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, Presidents Counsel. But, unless you tackle corruption, no investor worth his salt is going to take a second look at Sri Lanka.

The International Monetary Fund has identified what they call "corruption vulnerabilities" as one of the major impediments to dealing with Sri Lanka. The IMF has said that they are prepared to support our agriculture sector, but they will do their own audit. They have no faith in Sri Lankan audit. There cannot be a greater insult to the financial procedures of our country.

Now, there is another talk of a new Bill on corruption. We do not need a new Bill. What is needed is political will to implement the existing laws governing corruption in this country. Does anybody in their senses believe that this Government constituted in this way as a result of the election that took place in this House and with the internal arrangements and agreements that were arrived at among the component elements of the Government is going to make an honest attempt to eradicate corruption from this country? If that is not so, do not expect serious investments.

Then, the second impediment is the flight of personnel. Sri Lankas abiding strength is the calibre of our human resources. About 700 doctors have left our country within the last few months. The ICT industry is on the verge of collapse. Professionals and academics are

leaving the country in droves. So, how can we have investments in this country, if there are no personnel of quality to handle those investments?

How can there be investment in infrastructure? That is my third point. The Government has made it necessary for entrepreneurs to go to the banks and borrow money at 30 to 35 per cent rates of interest. Can anybody do a business and get any profit at all paying a 30 to 35 per cent interest? Factories are going to collapse; production lines are going to dry up and very large numbers of jobs and livelihoods are going to be lost. Then, the export sector taxes are increased from 14 per cent to 30 per cent. Can they earn money to pay the taxes? The Government will not collect anything like what they expect to in terms of revenue. If they do not have the yield, how can they incur expenditure on infrastructure? Without qualified personnel, without proper infrastructure or with the collapse of infrastructure in the country and with corruption rampant - everyday, the proceedings of the COPE and the COPA are in the national newspapers - with all those three impediments, is there any prospect at all that serious investors will come into Sri Lanka?

I conclude, Sir, by saying that these are mere dreams; they are illusions. None of it is going to happen, unless there is a vibrant democratic system in our country. For a vibrant democratic system, hold elections.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is up.

.. ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Okay, Sir.

You cannot govern this country by fearing people. There are no Provincial Council Elections, no Local Government Elections, you cannot get on the street, no demonstrations or protests and the Army and Emergency powers will be used.

In that situation, can we possibly accomplish the objectives we have set ourselves? So, Sir, my exhortation to the Government is, you cannot govern a country without holding elections. Hold elections. The law requires that the time frames be observed with regard to the Local Government Elections. We will go to court as a combined Opposition to compel the Government to respect the suffrage, the franchise of the people. If that is not done, this Government is no longer legitimate, it does not derive its authority from the people of this country. Our Constitution states that the people are the repository of sovereignty. If there is cynical violation on that principle, we cannot stand tall before the world and we are not going to get any of the support that we expect from the international community.

Thank you, Sir.

[12.55 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Hon. Presiding Member, it is undisputed that the golden era of post-independent Sri Lankas Foreign Policy was between the decades of the 1950s and the 1970s, for which both the UNP and the SLFP-led Governments of that era should be credited. We witnessed, during that period, the repeated success of our leaders in the international arena and the countrys reputation as a member of the international community was well beyond its geographical and demographical size. Our leaders of that era such as Prime Minsters the Rt. Hon. D.S. Senanayake, the Hon. Dudley Senanayake and the Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike enjoyed a solid reputation as international figures and statesmen for their handling of Sri Lankas Foreign Policy.

We saw a gradual erosion of that since the 1980s due to the reasons within and beyond the control of the State. The departure from Sri Lankas traditional Foreign Policy in the 1980s contributed to the serious negative consequences. Notwithstanding the decades of battering of our international image by the LTTE, unleashing terror on our land and various activists carrying out sustained campaigns against Sri Lanka, there was once again a glimmer of heyday during the period of the late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar who managed to resurrect the image of Sri Lanka and put it back on the world map as an important member of the international community. Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, as one who well comprehended international relations, empowered the late Minister Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar to enact and implement a Foreign Policy in Sri Lankas national interest. As you know, Sir, it was the late Hon. Kadirgamar who led the Foreign Policy front well while it was the Hon. (Prof.) G. L. Peiris who managed to bring in three new Constitutional Drafts during that era. Those Drafts of 1995, 1997 and also of 2000 were drafted by the Hon. (Prof.) G. L. Peiris and the Draft of 2000 was set on fire by the Ranil Wickremesinghe and Company Limited inside Parliament.

Countries comparable to Sri Lanka in size and economic power have been able to achieve success in the foreign policy arena through consistent diplomatic efforts. The consistency of Cubas Foreign Policy has brought them great success in the international sphere with only two countries voting against their Resolution at the United Nations General Assembly in 2022. We have to possess either the political and economic might of countries like Singapore and Isreal or have the solid international network of a country like Cuba or preferably, both. Sadly, Sir, Sri Lanka, today, has neither.

In recent times, Sri Lanka has regrettably engaged in a reactive foreign policy, abandoning its time-tested, all-weather friends of the international arena for petty domestic advantages. Amateurs were bumbling around to fulfil political dues, sacrificing the national interest: for example, the Aeroflot fiasco and the former Foreign Secretary saying, India First" et cetera. Inconsistency in Foreign Policy does not augur well for the country and it leads to the erosion of trust of friends of Sri Lanka. This was evident by the large number of abstentions on the Resolution on Sri Lanka at the recent Session of the UNHRC. Most of these abstentions were by countries which were once steadfast friends of Sri Lanka. We need to ask what we have done to promote our relations with those countries over the past decades. We neglect our friends in the international arena and then seek them out at our time of need.

Sri Lanka has always had a good relationship with the UN system and served as a member in numerous executive bodies. Whilst certain eminent individuals have been elected to serve on various international committees, Sri Lanka, as a country, no longer holds membership of any important executive bodies of international or intergovernmental organizations or bodies. The last we served on the UNHRC was in 2008. I am pleased to hear that Sri Lanka has announced its candidacy for the UN Economic and Social Council for 2024 to 2026. I sincerely hope that adequate effort will be made to secure the seat by mobilizing the network of Sri Lankas diplomatic Missions overseas.

Politicization of Sri Lanka's Foreign Service at the expense of investing in a professional, well-trained Foreign Service has been the bane of our foreign policy debacles in recent times. It is the key to carrying out a consistent foreign policy crafted on the basis of national interest, regardless of party politics. While everybody agrees on the need for a professional Foreign Service, hardly any concerted effort is made for regular recruitments and to provide continuous and regular training to the Sri Lanka Foreign Service officers. Solid training at induction, mid-career and even at Head of Mission level is imperative. I am not disparaging the work done by the Bandaranaike Diplomatic Training Institute, but a robust, practical curriculum to suit Sri Lankas national requirements in the 21st Century is non-negotiable.

I regret to point out that English language needs more emphasis in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I know, Hon. Sabry, when you were Minister of Justice, you were more concerned about testing the knowledge of English of the law students rather than law, which I do not agree with. But, in your new Ministry, the English language is foremost and must be given priority.

Recruitments to the Sri Lanka Foreign Service were last done in 2018, which needs to be done on an annual basis. It is reported that 40 officers will be recruited to the next batch of the Foreign Service. Skipping recruitment for years and then recruiting large batches is not the same as regular recruitment. Officers of the Sri Lanka Foreign Service serving as Heads of Missions are asked to retire

895 896

upon reaching the age of 60 without even completing their customary tenure at a diplomatic mission. However, measures are now underway to appoint such retired persons formerly of the Sri Lanka Foreign Service to important stations. The appointment of your present Secretary is one such example and the new Ambassador to Japan is another. There are sufficient numbers of officers in active service who are senior enough to be appointed as Heads of Missions. I would like to know why this cannot be fulfilled by the existing cadre of the Sri Lanka Foreign Service. In terms of expenditure, the Government, now, has to spend on the existing cadre, pay pensions to the retired officers as well as pay them for the post-retirement assignments they are undertaking.

I wish to ask the Hon. Minister what assessment was taken in closing down Sri Lankas representations in Nigeria. Nigeria, Hon. Minister, is Africas fastest growing economy. Norway's per capita income is among the top five globally and it is a country which has held close ties with Sri Lanka for a long time. Frankfurt is becoming the economic capital of the European Union, Cyprus is one of the first EU countries to recruit Sri Lankan labour and Sydney is Australias largest commercial centre and home to a large and influential overseas Sri Lankan community. What significant achievements have been made with such savings by closing Missions? Are those Missions the prime candidates for closure? No. If it is imperative to close some Missions to make savings, close some others.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is up.

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Sir, please give me just one more minute.

Sri Lanka is a country which has long thrived on its international connectivity, the absence of which over the past two to three years has had disastrous effects on the economy. I urge the Minister to use this year, Sri Lankas 75th Anniversary of Independence, to utilize its network of Missions effectively. You should set targets providing performance-based budgets to Missions to increase inflows of Forex through trade, tourism, FDIs and skilled employment to help us out of this economic predicament.

Sir, today, in addition to the Votes of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we are also debating the Votes of the Ministry of Mass Media. Let me wind up by saying something about media. Today, Sir, media is also under threat from the Government.

[1.05 p.m.]

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Diana Gamage) Hon. Presiding Member, thank you for the time given to participate in the Committee Stage Discussion today on the Votes of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Transport and Highways and the Ministry of Mass Media.

Sir, I would like to start with just a few words regarding the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I think establishment of foreign relations is a significant and a vital requirement at this present moment, especially with the economic crisis we are facing. It is also important due to the significant reliance of Sri Lanka on foreign trade and international relations. I have suggested to set targets for our foreign-based diplomats before also; I brought a proposal on setting targets for diplomats in our foreign embassies on trade and especially on promoting tourism by bringing in tourists to Sri Lanka because those embassies represent Sri Lanka in foreign countries. Therefore, those diplomats, I think, should be given targets on promotion of trade and tourism in Sri Lanka. I think it is a vital, very important and a significant thing we should be doing. We should not only set targets for them, but also review their progress on all these things

897 898

[)

2022 28

from time to time to see whether those are actually happening as proposed because I know that a lot of our embassies in other countries are actually there just for the sake of operating an embassy and a very few are working towards promoting trade and bringing in investments to Sri Lanka.

Then, I would like to say a few words about the visa fee and would also like to suggest this, as the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs is here. Now, we have increased the visa fee. At the present moment, we are looking at bringing in more tourists to Sri Lanka. I actually suggested at the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Tourism and Lands as well that we should give tourists visa on arrival and it should be free. At the moment, we charge US Dollars 35 as the visa fee. There are tourists who are willing to come here and spend over US Dollars 1,000. Should we to look at the US Dollars 35 visa fee or at the US Dollars 1,000 they are willing to spend? So, with the tourism industry just starting to flourish again, to revive it, I propose - I hope it would be considered - that we give tourists free visa on arrival. That is about the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Also, I would like to say a few words about the Ministry of Transport and Highways. Transport in a country is actually one of the main areas which help it to develop. Today, Sri Lankas public transport, we know, is in a very sad situation. We can see traffic jams on streets, environmental pollution due to that and the damage it is doing to the environment. I think we should reconsider starting that LRT project again. Stopping that, I think, is a very big mistake we have made because at the beginning of it, we had spent so much of money. But, now, it has been stopped and that effort has gone to waste. We should try to revive that. If we had that LRT system, with the fuel crisis we are facing in the country today, it would have made a huge difference. So, I think we should start talks again with the parties concerned and try to revive that because it is absolutely important for the country right now when it comes to public transport.

I have already brought in an investor to Sri Lanka - I have spoken to the Hon. President about it - to start a US Dollars 5 billion project to create a public transport hub on a public-private partnership - PPP- to operate a transport system between the Fort Railway Station and the Maradana Railway Station. It is going to be built in a few years. So, a US Dollars 5 billion Foreign Direct Investment has been brought to Sri Lanka. Those are important things that we need to do with regard to transport.

If we take the railway stations, we know that they need to be developed because especially when there are tourists in the country, they would like to travel by train. So, I think those should be developed especially as tourist zones in Sri Lanka.

[1.25 p.m.] ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Hon. Presiding Member, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its network of Missions are Sri Lankas public face on the international stage. Sadly, like all other institutions, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Foreign Service are, today, broken institutions which exist only by name, draining Sri Lankas financial resources.

The Minister of Foreign Affairs keeps touring around the world giving interviews about other countries learning from Sri Lankas failures, as if he had no role to play in allowing the country to fall into the miserable state it is in. Earlier today, State Minister Tharaka Balasuriya said that the Votes of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have been cut from the US Dollars 56 million in 2018 to US Dollars 24 million in 2023. He lamented that it is nowhere near the amount of money needed to run the Ministry. To cut costs, like many of our Colleagues

903 904

mentioned, the Embassy in Norway, which was worthy of being kept open, was closed. The Consulate in Cyprus, which merits being kept open, was closed. But, there are many Consulates including the one in Los Angeles headed by Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksas brother-in-law, which could ideally be closed, that are kept open.

Have the Minister, the Sri Lankan Ambassadors and High Commissioners and all officials even started travelling on Economy Class to set an example to others? Senior US officials and Ambassadors travel on Economy Class even when there is no economic crisis in their country. If the people are forced to pay massive taxes and expenditures on education and health are cut, then it is more than fair for economizing at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The State Minister said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is like a boxer fighting with one hand tied behind his back since it has not enough staff. Or, is it because even Foreign Service officers have reduced themselves to levels of servility that have never been witnessed before? The concept of public service has been forgotten; mediocrity and blind loyalty are rewarded; professionalism is shunned and there is hardly any accountability from top to bottom. Officers do as they please and the culture of impunity has taken deep root in the Foreign Service and the Ministry. Junior and middle level officers have chosen the path of servility over professionalism as they know that this is the route to securing foreign postings.

It is appalling that the former Secretary to the Foreign Ministry, the Admiral, who was responsible for bringing disrepute to Sri Lanka on the international stage, contributing to the collapse of Sri Lankas economy and breaking down international partnerships, is now being sent as Sri Lankas Envoy to Indonesia.

The State Minister said that the Ministry is to recruit a fresh batch of Foreign Service officers. But, the recruitment process needs deep scrutiny and amendments first. I hope that is happening and also that the 40 positions he mentioned would be advertised for and given wide publicity. We must attract the best.

Then, I want to speak for a minute about the Consular Affairs Division. Does the Ministry even bother about serving the public at all? When was the last time the Minister even personally visited the Consular Affairs Division? Sir, the Consular Affairs Division, which was elevated to a state-of-the-art Division to serve the public, where the wait time to obtain services had been reduced to less than 10 minutes from an average of 5 hours, has been destroyed under the leadership of those who ran the Ministry from November, 2019. Tales of woe and corruption have been documented all over in the recent past, how it takes the entire day, sometimes days, to get an appointment and how those appointments are "sold" at the entrance? But, what happened? I find it impossible to understand why you are unable to use the Electronic Document Attestation System - e-DAS - and its well-trained staff to provide a decent service to the public. In February, 2017, we launched e-DAS. In 2017, more than

500,000 documents were electronically authenticated and the overall saved time for the public was approximately more than two million hours! That was a remarkable achievement in the history of e-Governance in Sri Lanka. The next year, we won four awards. Among them were the Public Sector Most Outstanding ICT Achievement Award, the Gold Award in the Government and Public Sector Category at the 19th National Best Quality ICT Awards and the Asia-Pacific ICT Alliance Award for Best e-Governance Performance in Sri Lanka. Please fix this, Hon. Minister. It is a disgrace. If you want, I will be happy to help.

Sir, the manner in which Sri Lanka handles human rights and naming and categorizing countries as friends and enemies based on voting at the UN Human Rights Council is absurd. For how long are the politicians and the officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its key Missions overseas going to fool the country with their infantile debating points, without pausing to reflect on things carefully and working together with local communities and international partners to set things right and restore credibility in our institutions?

Empty words and rhetoric about setting up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, like the State Minister mentioned this morning, for show will not earn us the respect of either the international community or of our own concerned and conflict-affected citizens when the rule of law and the institutions already established including the Office on Missing Persons have been undermined and made a mockery of.

I want to touch on the Report of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on the human rights situation in Sri Lanka for a minute. The Report reflected on the prior-reported concerns. But, this time, Sir, the Human Rights Council specially focused on the demand for accountability for economic crimes, as echoed in the recent peaceful protests. This being the first time that the phenomenon of "economic crimes" has been reported, the failure to take immediate action to address them would certainly lead to allegations of a new culture of impunity for economic crimes, too. This would negatively impact on the EU GSP Plus as well as assistance from the IMF, creditors and investors.

Since the Government asserts that any international accountability mechanism on Sri Lanka would be contrary to the provisions of the Constitution, it would be in the interest of Sri Lanka to begin to address economic crimes as alleged, using our own laws and domestic mechanisms which are independent and outcome-oriented. But, instead, what is happening on the ground, Sir? Those who committed these heinous economic crimes which tripled poverty in Sri Lanka and made almost 10 million people, according to the University of Peradeniya, unable to survive without assistance are being protected. It is inconceivable that the President has not even spoken about establishing a mechanism to investigate and act against those who committed these crimes. The investigation initiated by the COPE under the previous Chairmanship of the Hon. (Prof.) Charitha Herath was dismissed by the current Chairman. I assume

905 906

[) ()

2022 28

that the position of the Government on those alleged economic criminals was made clear by the President who said during his Budget Speech that those who claim they would go after corrupt politicians are liars and are not to be believed.

Finally, in the dire need to restructure the massive foreign currency debt, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has a crucial role to play. The State Minister spoke of the Ministrys involvement in picking Lazard and Clifford Chance to advise Sri Lanka. What have they done so far? What progress has been made with the private lenders? Todays Daily Mirror has two conflicting stories: one, where the Governor of the Central Bank Nandalal Weerasinghe says that Sri Lanka will be able to get IMF Board approval by January, 2023 and a second, where the CEO of the Standard Chartered Bank, Bingumal Thewarathanthri, says that it is possible, perhaps, by March "when there is a clarity on the haircuts that is going to be borne by foreign bondholders, bilateral creditors and domestic creditors". Whom does he refer to as domestic creditors? Are they local banks and individuals who invested in ISBs and SLDBs or those who invested in LKR G-Secs? So, there has to be clarity on this.

There are so many conflicting stories on how well debt restructure discussions are moving forward. The President said that Japan had agreed to lead the effort, setting up an ad hoc platform for bilateral creditors in the Paris Club, China and India. Japan then said it is not so, but they would help. Now, what has happened? Who is talking to China? Without Chinas agreement on some form of debt restructuring, getting the approval of the IMF Board would be almost impossible, unless they agree on a Suriname model. But, given the outcome of that experiment, I doubt very much that that is any longer an option. What I am saying is, I do not think the Suriname example is possible in Sri Lanka.

The President met the Chinese Ambassador last week. What was the outcome? Was the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the State Minister, the Foreign Secretary or anyone part of those diplomatic discussions? Then, what is happening in Delhi? Is the Sri Lankan High Commissioner speaking to the Indian side? Or is he running a separate operation completely outside of your Ministry, Hon. Minister?

Todays newspapers report that the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Ali Sabry, is going to Washington DC tomorrow and that he is supposed to meet Anthony Blinken to discuss debt restructuring with the IMF. Will you, Hon. Minister, tell the Secretary of State that walking away from the MCC was a mistake?

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have two more minutes. ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) I will wind up within a minute, Sir.

Will you seek assistance again from the United States? What assurance will you give that such treatment would not be meted out to them again? These meetings, Hon. Minister, have limited outcomes. What we need is, our Missions to integrate with the BOI, the EDB and other institutions to drive investment promotion on a methodical way. There are technically superior ways of achieving our investment objectives. Successful countries do those things.

Sir, I would like to quote a paragraph from my speech made on the 25th of November, 2020 on the Votes of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the Committee Stage Discussion of Budget, 2021.

I quote from the Performance Report of the Foreign Ministry, which is on our Table, Expanding the existing trading, investment and labour markets whilst looking for new opportunities with Asian and African countries to cultivate economic ties, to diversify export baskets. I wish him the very best in his endeavour.

I was speaking about the Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya.

I encourage him to restart the 18-week online Economic Diplomacy Programme I started with the Centre for International Development at the Kennedy School of Harvard University. That was a first for the University and a first for us. It was really successful with some 40 plus senior diplomats participating in the rigorous course to sharpen the skills needed for successful economic diplomacy. Sir, I would like to table* the Agreement we signed in March, 2017.

That was two years ago. Was anything done, Hon. State Minister? Did you or your Ministry even contact those people? I do not know, but what I do know is, according to my discussions with them, what we started is being utilized by other countries and they are beating us at the game; we are falling behind. So, it is a sad state of affairs all around.

In conclusion, to achieve meaningful and sustainable progress which would benefit all our people and to take Sri Lanka on a real growth path, Sri Lanka must embrace and embody good governance, democracy, rule of law, security sector reforms, human rights, public sector reforms, economic reforms and commit ourselves to reconciliation and equal citizenship. Unless there is a change on the ground, the network of Missions overseas can do little, except waste away Sri Lankas precious foreign exchange.

I was critical, but I want to wish the Hon. State Minister all the luck because they need everything they could gather. We are criticizing, but if there is anything we could do, we want to be helpful at the same time.

I wish the new Secretary and the entire staff all the very best in meeting its objectives in the coming year.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) ) . 10 .

[2.43 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, while discussing the Votes of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we all are tempted to speak about the Geneva Resolution and the debacle that took place a few months ago. I feel that we have to look at how to strategize ourselves to face such a Resolution as well as have a proper retrospection as to what went wrong in our efforts to counter that Resolution and have it defeated.

Before coming to that subject, may I briefly deal with a few other issues concerning the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We are embroiled in an issue concerning human trafficking through auspices of our foreign Missions abroad, particularly some of the Missions in the Middle East. This new situation has arisen because the diplomats of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have virtually outsourced the Consular Affairs Division to the officials of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment. According to the Vienna Convention, consular services are one of the primary duties of any Ministry of Foreign Affairs. So, that matter needs to be looked at very carefully.

I know that during the period when the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva was the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, there was a senior officer called Ganegama Arachchi, who spent almost three years in preparing the e-Consular Services platform. He was a very dedicated officer who worked on it. Actually, he came to that position when he was almost 56 years old and then he worked on it for almost three years. Finally, what happened to him was, he was posted to Stockholm when he was 59 years old and as soon as there was a small change in the Government, within one year, since he had completed six years, he was asked to come back. Such dedicated officers, who worked on some of the important projects, and their services have totally been disregarded and they are totally frustrated for what has happened to them. This is happening all the time.

Similarly, this happened to another officer, Ms. Mahishini Colonne, who is now at the BIMSTEC Secretariat as a Director. That lady was a good, well-trained officer. The other officers of the same batch are now getting the second ambassadorial post, but she had finally chosen to leave the Service because she knew that she is not going to be placed anywhere because there is this seeping discrimination within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. So, that must come to an end. Good officers must be respected for their ability. There are ideological conflicts when it comes to their political masters. These are people who had done a good service to us even in places like Geneva. That is why we have got into this mess, by ignoring good officers and trying to create your own cronies within the Ministry. Do not do this. Senior officers are getting highly frustrated because of this. Therefore, that should come to an end. We have a very good, senior officer now as the Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ms. Aruni Wijewardane. Her mother was a senior professor in our university system. I am sure some change would be brought about in the conduct of the affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the future. Of course, for that, the Hon. Ministers must give assistance to the people who run the Ministry.

Sir, having said that, let me now deal with our Foreign Policy trajectory. We must try and reorient our Foreign Policy, particularly considering the importance of Sri Lanka in the emerging Indian Ocean Indo-Pacific strategic landscape; we must have a new approach.

We must know how best to navigate, advance cooperation and face challenges together for shared prosperity with others. We must also look at integration with regional and global trade and economic cooperation arrangements, what entities to participate in, how best to avoid overlaps and how best to develop constituencies abroad which would support trade, investment and economic advancement. We have to create our own lobbyists, not those fake lobbyists who take taxpayers money on the pretext of trying to promote Sri Lanka among the Senators and Congressmen in the USA. We know one such case. Finally, he was found to be a fraudster. We paid our taxpayers money to make him a lobbyist, and this is what the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been doing in the past. So, we have to move away from this culture.

Then, promotion of multilateralism as a means to resolve common challenges is the way to go about, identifying areas for collaboration, consensus building and regaining leadership. Climate change falls under this particular category. So, the Hon. President has spoken about creating a university on climate change in this country. Those are good concepts, but before that, we must try and reorient our Foreign Policy to take advantage of the current climate in the international arena.

Then, sustained engagement with overseas Sri Lankan communities, securing their talent and expertise for national advancement while recognizing their potential and contribution in the economic, science and technology spheres. Now, to engage with our own Sri Lankans living

927 928

abroad, what are the programmes we have initiated? The President simply making an appeal to come and assist the country is not enough. Look at India. They have created Programmes for Non-Resident Indians and Overseas Citizens of India. So, we also must create some special programmes to attract assistance from our own Sri Lankans living abroad.

Then, another important area is advancing reconciliation and peacebuilding. Without that, the demand for criminal accountability will become even more pronounced. So, it is time for us to look at reconciliation in this country. We must welcome the Hon. Presidents resolve to try and somehow bring an end to the ethnic problem in the country by speaking to all the Tamil and other minority parties, to bring about a Constitutional solution to this problem. It is a very ambitious timeline that he has given. Before the 75th Anniversary of Independence, he says he will try and bring in Constitutional reforms to solve the national ethnic problem. That is a very tall order, but still, we wish him well, if he means well.

Since the Hon. Minister too is here, I would like to refer to the Operative Paragraph 10 of the Geneva Resolution. Coming to the issue of religious discrimination, Hon. Minister, I know how you yourself, while being in your previous incarnation as the Minister of Justice, were sought to be undermined by appointing a famous Buddhist priest who was known for hate speech as the Chairman of the Presidential Task Force on One country, One Law. The Minister himself felt undermined; he was so frustrated that he went and handed over his resignation as well. That was the way in which their own Ministers were treated. Again regarding this Operative Paragraph 10, I would like to refer to a speech made by the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government recently at the Convocation of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. It was a very good speech where he talks about the need to hold those people who took the decision to cremate COVID-19 corpses without any scientific reason, going against the World Health Organizations guidelines. It was a deliberate attempt to discriminate a minority community. They were engaging in racial profiling of Muslims during the COVID-19 pandemic. We must thank some of the epidemiologists who stood up with the Muslims on this issue. They very bravely challenged the Government, but I regret that important professional bodies like the College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists were silent about the issue during that time because there was a big public impression created as if that was the best scientific way to go about to combat the pandemic, whereas all that was done for a discriminative purpose. Therefore, there must be an inquiry since it is important and mandated by the Human Rights Councils Resolution; particularly Operative Paragraph 10 states that you must at least conduct an inquiry to punish those who had taken the decision to traumatize a community and unnecessarily create this problem in this country.

Having said that, I must also deal with some other issues. In that Resolution, we find an important category called economic crimes. For the first time during such a Resolution, a Minister went twice to Geneva, hoping upon hope that we will succeed in trying to improve on our performance from the last time. What happened ultimately was we got four votes less than the number we got the last time. It was a humiliating defeat for us! Of course, we must stop harping on issues like sovereignty, national security and non-interference in internal affairs of a country. Those are very good to talk about and actually, our Foreign Policy must be based on those principles.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) In addressing those economic crimes - they have been linked to human rights and for very good reasons, they are mentioned in that Resolution - we must be proactive and try to display to the international community that we mean business. And, how are we going to bring in the Stolen Asset Recovery law? I am told that Presidents Counsel Sarath Jayamanne and His Lordship Justice Yasantha Kodagoda have prepared a concept paper regarding that. A non-conviction-based asset recovery suggestion has been made through a new piece of legislation that is to be introduced, if at all the Government is willing to do so. So, it is important for us to try and be proactive and show the international community that we mean business, that we are prepared to try and comply with those requirements. Therefore, without resorting to megaphone diplomacy to escape from the strictures that have been placed on us, let us come clean about our conduct and the treatment we afford to our own citizens in this country in maintaining human rights and humanitarian law.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) ) . 6 .

We are totally against any sort of racism. For us, all are human beings. Whatever race or religion you all belong to, you are, first, human beings and thereafter, Sri Lankans. So, we stand for all your rights. Unfortunately what has happened, Hon. Member, is that this particular statue had been stationed there without getting permission at the beginning. Now, everybody comes there to worship it. Naturally, when people see such a statue, I can understand it, they offer prayers and all those things. That has irritated the landlord there. So, we are trying to resolve that. You and several Hon. Members of Parliament including the Hon. Mano Ganesan, this morning, the Hon. Sivagnanam Shritharan and the Hon. Member who is presiding, all have spoken to me about it. Everything possible to safeguard their rights, we will do. There are no two words about that. Please take that into consideration.

. . ( . ) (The Hon. Premnath C. Dolawatte, Attorney-at-Law) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

Sir, while I was presiding in the morning, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L Peiris mentioned my name, referring to a Private Members' Bill I had presented to the House. I must say that there is no ulterior motive or any hidden agenda in presenting that Bill. I presented that Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill to increase youth representation or their quota before the General Election. So, it has nothing to do with delaying the Local Government Elections or whatever. Actually, we seek Government's co-sponsorship to expedite the proceedings. Today, the Report on that has come from the Ministry. The Secretary has signed it, but it should also be signed by the Minister himself. So, again, I have to go to the Minister and get that Report signed. Sir, I must say to this House that we need to increase the youth quota. We all should get together and get that youth quota increased.

Thank you.

[5.17 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, I would like to commence my speech today by going back to a speech I made on the Vote of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs some time back on Friday, the 03rd of December, 2004. In the course of that speech, I said, The desire to draw limits on the Tamil peoples right to self-determination makes the Sri Lankan State align itself with any power that is willing to play along, even to the extent of blatantly seeking the interference of global superpowers that would compromise and put in jeopardy the strategic interests and security interests of India. This, I said in 2004, Sir, and the tragedy that has befallen this country is precisely what I warned of then.

Although I warned of it in 2004, it does not mean that Sri Lanka had not got hurt in a similar way by this stupid Policy earlier also, in the '80s, again because Sri Lanka rather, without solving the Tamil issue and instead trying to defeat it militarily, chose to find international partners to an extent that you put Indias security interests at jeopardy and made the matter so out of control for yourselves that you eventually had to face an armed struggle for over 30 years. That struggle was not brought to an end through a negotiated settlement, but, as far as we are concerned, through genocide. So, there has been no solution; the problem still persists. In fact, the Tamil people, who spoke of an ethnic problem from the '40s and then eventually had to take up arms in the '70s, are now supposed to forget about the ethnic problem. Actually, it should be the complete opposite. The violence that the Tamil people had to face at the time they took up arms was far less than that they faced during the 30 years of armed conflict and in particular, at the end of it. So, can you imagine the psyche of the Tamil people? Last week was Great Heroes Week. There were a lot of threats, a severe number of threats to people commemorating the dead. But, despite that, simply because the Government was forced to say that they will not prevent commemorations, people were willing to face whatever consequence that may come afterwards and thronged those areas. So, what I am trying to say is, that is the psyche of the aggrieved people. And, the problem has not been solved; quite the contrary, it has, probably, got worse.

Very tellingly, Sir - the Hon. Minister is here - the steps to find reconciliation comes under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I think that is a betrayal of the true intentions of this Government. I say betrayal because it makes it so obvious. You see, when a particular subject comes under a particular Ministry, that Ministrys efforts on that particular subject are going to be the greatest, I would assume. If reconciliation comes under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it means - I am pretty certain that that is the case - that reconciliation is just a matter which comes under foreign affairs only to somehow manage the pressures that might come from foreign countries, particularly from countries which have a significant presence of the Tamil diaspora, and nothing further. And there is nothing, Sir, that has happened any time recently, especially after the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe became President, which seems to suggest otherwise. Let us forget about the previous Governments - I think we all know how they performed on this matter - but there is nothing certainly with regard to President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

So, the problem has not been solved, but instead, we had the Hon. Minister, after his visit to Geneva and detailing other UN-related matters, coming to this House and saying that an important step with regard to reconciliation will be the formation of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Sir, I think both the President and the Minister of Foreign Affairs mentioned the South African example. When the birthday of the President of South Africa, who happened to be in transit, was apparently celebrated here, by the media, this matter was again brought to light. South Africa is a totally different scenario. In South Africa, the so-called reconciliation happened after the struggle was won by the oppressed, after apartheid was brought to an end and democracy prevailed. And even in South Africa, now, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is critiqued because it was a political decision to go down the path of truth and reconciliation, which was at the cost of accountability. It was a political decision. When apartheid came to an end, those leaders of the ANC chose that they would put away accountability because the political process has won. In Sri Lanka, we do not have that; in fact, it is the complete opposite. The people who consider themselves oppressed, continue that struggle. It is a victors peace where we have with regard to accountability, a complete denial not only by the Government but also by various other institutions like the OMP and the Office for Reparations, which have been put in place to show the world that there is a transitional justice process going on. I think some of the other Colleagues of mine also brought up an issue with regard to the OMP to the notice of the Hon. Minister, where the Head of the OMP had made some remarkably blunt statements, exposing the true intent of the Government, which is basically a complete denial; it is essentially a foreign relations exercise.

So, it is in that context, Sir, that we have to sort of look at the Presidents most recent announcement, calling the Tamil parities for negotiations with regard to finding a political settlement to the problem. That is probably the most important element if this perception, based on past realities, is to be different.

Now, the President more than anybody else, I have said this previously also in this House, knows that if true reconciliation is to happen he must be honest - the Hon. Minister also knows this - in going before the Sinhalese people and telling them, Look, 75 years of ethnic conflict has only ruined this country. We have made enemies within and if we do not resolve this problem, it is going to get worse. We are in a political crisis; we are in an economic crisis and we cannot be going on like this and whatever that we said in the past, we are telling you now the truth, that the only way the ethnic problem could be solved is by going beyond a Unitary State, accepting that a federal solution is the only way and that federalism is not separation. The Hon. Minister knows that more than anybody else. He is a lawyer. There are enough safeguards you could bring in constitutionally. Once the Tamil ethnic conflict is resolved, where Sri Lanka recognizes its plurinational nature, then the need for secession would be given up even by the Tamil people. You can have those constitutional guarantees as well.

So, if we are to take the President's invitation seriously, Sir, our partys view is that he must, in fact, come out and say what I just said. He must tell the Sinhalese people that we have to go beyond the Unitary State and otherwise, there is no solution to the ethnic problem. Also, he must tell the world that these negotiations would be on the basis of federalism and in the course of those negotiations, he would also ensure that whilst the Tamil national question is resolved to the satisfaction of the Tamil people, the Muslims and the up-country Tamils, the Sinhalese peoples biggest fear, probably of secession, through the resolution of the Tamil national question, would be addressed; Constitutional guarantees through the resolution of the Tamil national question would be obtained from the Tamils and others, whoever it maybe. But, without doing that, to go and sit at negotiations, in my view, is yet another exercise of time-buying.

That is why, Sir, I ask my Colleagues who represent the North-East, those of the TNA and the Hon. C.V. Vigneswaran, not to rush. This President needs legitimacy; he needs to show that everybody is engaging with him. For him, that is the most important thing. And, I am not against engaging with him for as long as certain barriers are gone beyond. We cannot be fooled again and again. For such an engagement, the President has to give those assurances not just to the Tamils, but most importantly to the Sinhalese because we do not want the Sinhalese people to get up tomorrow and say that they were lied to. No solution is going to be sustainable, if the Sinhalese people feel that they were lied to. I truly believe that if we are honest to the people, whether it be federal or whatever, and explain to them that reality, then they will come on board. But, without those assurances being given, I appeal to my Colleagues who represent the North-East not to rush. This is an opportunity where the President must prove his bona fides. If not, the consequences those Members of Parliament who represent the North-East would have to face from the people of the North-East would be very similar to how the people in the South reacted.

Thank you, Sir.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC) Hon. Presiding Member, I just want to respond to the Hon. Ponnabalam. Thank you for your speech and some of the valid concerns, Hon. Member.

We all agree that we need to find a way to reconcile and get Sri Lanka going forward as a united nation. But, reconciliation has not been part of the agenda of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry is supporting it, internationally dealing with it because that is a part of our job.

For the purpose of reconciliation, there is an already established high-powered Cabinet Subcommittee led by the Hon. President himself. The Hon. Prime Minister, the Hon. Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms, the Hon. Minister of Fisheries and myself are also there. So, we are engaging in that process; there is a mechanism. I know that the proof of the pudding is in the eating; it takes time. What I am passionate about and one of the reasons why I entered into politics is to do whatever I could to bring people together. You, me and everybody must feel that we all are Sri Lankans and we must stand united. In that, we should be able to promote the Sri Lankan identity, where everybody is dignified. We stand for that.

It is not that we are going to follow the South African model. We are just trying to look at the structure of it and to learn from that. I understand and agree that every country should have its unique model. As you know, South Korea had their own model when they were subjected to military rule and dictatorship. Peru had their own model; Bogota had something else and South Africa also had their own structure. So, we are studying all these contours and then we have to find a model suitable and unique to our country. Of course, we are looking at a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, through which we hope to find a peaceful solution. And, we have not ruled, once the truth is elicited, going beyond that. Therefore, all this is in its early stages. We are open on this and I agree that we cannot afford to have another eyewash. We need to sit down and discuss; we have to be genuine. It is also important for the South, the Sinhalese and the soldiers to sort it out internationally because everybody is clubbed together and accused of war crimes and all sorts of things. So, they also need a platform to redeem themselves. Some of them have done a yeoman service during the war, you would have seen, looking after the Tamils who were fleeing the war zone. So, we must also do justice to them.

I think President Wickremesinghe has honestly communicated this. He had visited the North and the East and established an office in Vavuniya. The Twenty-first Amendment to the Constitution is in effect. Whether it had been diluted or not is debatable. Also, we are serious about amending the PTA, which we have already done. Then, we are going to remove the PTA altogether and replace it with a new law. Some honest effort has been made with regard to that. Therefore, I request the Hon. Members of the Tamil National Alliance and other Tamil parties, including your party, Hon. Ponnambalam, to

engage, discuss and debate. There is no need to agree to everything, but let us make progress together so that we do not need to waste our resources and fight each other in the international arena. In the meantime, it is also important that we understand, just like understanding the Tamil psyche and their feelings - I understand that as well - the feelings of the people in the South and elsewhere. Last week, throughout the world we saw certain images and heard discussions to the effect that the LTTE is there, they are an extension of the LTTE and they were celebrating and saying that they have not given up the dream of secession and all those things. So, we have to come to a middle ground, a moderate ground and bring in peace, once and for all. Therefore, it is also important that their feeling, too, are understood.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , ) . / .

In a globalized scenario, you cannot ignore anyone. The Middle East is important for us; the South Asia is important for us and China is also important for us. The USA is our biggest market, the EU is our second biggest market and the UK is our third biggest market. Therefore, all of them are extremely important for us. In a globalized situation, we cannot live in isolation and we need to understand that.

At the same time, we have to reiterate that our Foreign Policy is, Sri Lanka first. There are no two words about it. Every decision we are going to take will be in the interest of Sri Lanka; we will always consider whether by taking a particular decision, Sri Lanka is going to be isolated or it is going to be strengthened. We will continue to do that. And, we will not, whether we like it or not, implement any solutions imposed on us by anybody. We are an independent country. Some people may not be interested in our sovereignty, but we are very concerned about the sovereignty of this nation and our independence. We will engage with everyone, talk to everyone and we are open for discussion, but we will do what is right for our country; we will not do what is right for other countries. Therefore, we want to make it very clear to others that our policy is, friendship to all and malice to none and we will continue to pursue that policy. We all must understand that, whether we like it or not, in a globalized situation or circumstances, things move fast. We may take decisions and some may work and some may not. As long as we take decisions bona fide, for the betterment of the country and not on a personal agenda, I do not think we should worry about them. So, that is our position.

Hon. Chairman, I must say that debt restructuring and the IMF process have almost come to a finality now. The only things that are being held back are the debt assurance letters from all the creditors, particularly from the Paris Club, which includes Japan and some western countries, as well as from India and China. Luckily for us, India, China and the Paris Club cooperated and had come to a physical meeting with the IMF in Washington about a month ago. Thereafter, they also convened at a virtual platform in Sri Lanka conducted by the IMF once again. I am very confident that both India and China, being our close friends, neighbours and long-standing allies, will not let us down and will grant those debt assurances as soon as possible. The moment we get those, either in December or January, we may probably be able to go to the IMF and get its Board approval. If their Board approval is given, it is not money that is going to solve our problem, but again the whole financial market will have confidence in Sri Lanka. The ADB has agreed to line up some funds; the World Bank has lined up some funds and the AIIB has shown interest in supporting Sri Lanka. When all those things happen, we would be able to turn around this very critical and difficult situation.

We must also understand that this is a challenge for all of us. It is easy for us to point fingers at each other, criticize each other, but the issue right now is finding a solution for this. Is there any other solution than this? If you show that, we will also support you. I have said that a long time ago. In April, when I took over the Ministry of Finance also I said, If you have a better solution, please come and implement it. We all will support you. But, it did not take place. No one came forward, no one took the challange and the Hon. President had been elected and now, rightly or wrongly, has follows a procedure. I think he deserves some breathing space to deliver. It has been just four months since he was elected. You can see the difference he has made during those four months. Of course, this is a very uneasy calm, we all understand that, and it could go either way. But what I am saying is, do not to think about your political agenda, think about the country and let us come out of this problem. Even if you

1003 1004

all, the Opposition, come to power, you need to have a country to run. One thing we have achieved is, we managed not to allow the country to face the situation Lebanon went through, Libya went through, Iraq went through and Venezuela went through. What was that situation? Demolition of the civil structure. They - Venezuela, Lebanon and Iraq - have all the money in the world. Last year, Iraqs entire earnings from petroleum exports alone was US Dollars 100 billion, but still, they cannot get the country going.
