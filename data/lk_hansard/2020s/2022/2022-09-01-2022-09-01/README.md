There is a subsidy that has been promised for kerosene, but no funds have been allocated for that; zero rupees have been allocated for that. This is in contrast to the Rs. 46,000 million that has been allocated for the social safety net - we welcome that - and also in contrast to the health allocation of Rs. 248 billion, a three per cent increase in the allocation for health. So, what was given in words, as promised in the Budget Proposals, you can also see it in rupees. I am just contrasting that with the promise to grant relief to kerosene users, for which, yet, no allocation is made. Now, this is significant because the whole approach of this Government is to silence the middle class and upper-middle class. So, you are making petrol available now; you are making super diesel available now, but diesel is in short supply and there is no kerosene. Your priority must be the other way round; you must address the needs of those who need it most, not that of the upper-middle class. But, you are doing that because you think if you silence the upper-middle class, then, you can get away with blue murder.

Blue murder is what is happening in the country all round. Everyday, we hear of shootings. We know of people being shot dead here, there and everywhere. The police are not investigating any of those crimes. The police, in their thousands, are deployed to stifle genuine peoples protests. When there are are 500 people

901 902

marching, there is a police force of about thousand policemen who go to stop that protest. Tear gas is used; water cannons are used and now, lo and be hold, the PTA is used! Detention Orders under the PTA have been signed by the President himself! He normally signs in English, but in these Detention Orders, he has signed in Sinhala, for some reason. Ordinarily, he signs in English - we are familiar with his signature - but these three Detention Orders, he has signed in Sinhala. Is there a change in personality? Is he appealing to some sections in the country by beginning to sign in Sinhala now and that, too, on Detention Orders?

Economic recovery and your manner of governance have a strong connection. You see, if a beggar comes to my doorstep and begs for food for his children, I will be compelled to give him some money. He might come regularly, get some money and go. But, the day I find out that he is using that money to get drunk, go home and beat up his wife and his children, naturally, I will stop giving him money after that. So, that is what the international community also does. You scream here saying, How can you stop giving us money? You cannot prescribe to us human rights standards" et cetera. No, they can. If they find that that money is being misused or you are oppressing other people in this country, surely, those countries will not lend you money.

I must say something else also. We are all glad that there has been a Staff-Level Agreement reached with the IMF. The Government announces that, well and good, but as soon as the Government announced it, this is what the IMF has stated issuing a statement on the 01st of September, 2022. I quote:

The agreement is subject to the approval by IMF management and the Executive Board in the period ahead, contingent on the implementation by the authorities of prior actions, and on receiving financing assurances from Sri Lankas official creditors.

So, this is contingent on something. It is not done yet. We hope it will be done. But, you have an obligation and you have to first perform that: the Budget needs to be consistent with the economic reform programme and the macroeconomic framework underlined by the IMF. So, that is the statement that has been issued.

Similarly, the Government was heard in the last couple of days saying that Japan was going to lead a conversation with a group of countries to assist Sri Lanka with regard to bridging finance. We all thought, okay, that is a good thing. But now, we have Japan saying, No, we never agreed to do that. The President, when he became Prime Minister, came on National Television and said, I will not hide anything from the people. I will tell you the truth. But now, that is blurring a little; that has started to blur. You are not telling the whole truth. You are now beginning to tell the people what they like to hear, what we also like to hear. But, that is not the whole truth. Your using the PTA against unarmed protestors will definitely impact on the economic recovery of this country and that will impact on the poor people of this country mostly, not on the upper-middle class whom you have silenced by giving petrol or whom you think you have silenced by giving super diesel. So, you need to rethink your

priorities. You cannot have it both ways; you cannot have a Government that is indulging in oppressing peoples legitimate protests, also seeking financial assistance.

The Interim Budget Deficit has increased by 43 per cent from the one that we approved in November last year. In November last year, we approved a Deficit of Rs. 1,600 billion. In the Interim Budget that has now been proposed by the Minister of Finance cum President, the Deficit is Rs. 2,300 billion and 85 per cent of that is to be supplied by revenue from the country itself and that is why you have increased the VAT rate. I heard speakers from the Government saying that we complained about reducing the VAT rate then. Yes, we complained about reducing it from 15 per cent to 7 per cent. That was one of the main causes for this economic crisis. But, the answer does not lie in increasing it back to 15 per cent after the country has fallen into this debt and after the people have been subjected to all the hardship and the economic deprivement they have been subjected to. That is not the answer. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up. .. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) Okay, Sir.

So, the Interim Budget only heaps more misery on people. There are some good aspects with regard to relief like 726,000 families awaiting Samurdhi also getting an allowance and all of that. But, all that is taken away by an increase of VAT by 3 per cent, which is an indirect tax all will have to bear. Therefore, increasing the Deficit and hoping to supply that Deficit through local revenue is not the answer. You have to comply with international human rights standards, if you are to really get relief from the international community.

(Mrs.) Diana Gamage) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, thank you for the time provided for me to speak during this Debate.

Firstly, I would like to mention that we all are here to speak about one big, common issue. That is, the state the country is in today - the bankrupt country which has defaulted. This is the Ninth Parliament and today, for us, as new Members of Parliament, to face this situation is very unfortunate. What we all have been doing during those nine Parliaments for the last few decades in this country is only mud-slinging, arguing, fighting and playing the blame game with each other and nothing has come out of it so far and also we have no solutions for these problems. That is the reason why we went into default and bankruptcy. Yesterday, we had a discussion with the Governor of the Central Bank. He explained to us how we are going to get out of this situation. The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran complained about the 15 per cent VAT increase. I would like to say that any country in the world needs a minimum of 15 per cent tax.

Sir, I would like to say this in Sinhala. . , , . . 22 . , . . .

. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran. You have eight minutes. [3.42 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Eight minutes? I was told that I have ten minutes.

Anyway, Hon. Presiding Member, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to participate in this Debate.

First of all, let me thank the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara for giving the good news that the American Ambassadress is contemplating of Sri Lanka giving the North and the East the right to self-determination. That is something we have been asking for, for the last 73 years. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Within the Unitary State. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Thank you very much, Hon. Member.

Sir, the Appropriation (Amendment) Bill has been presented to Parliament as an Amendment to the Appropriation Act, No. 30 of 2021. Under the new Amendment, for the year 2022, under which Government expenditure has been revised, a massive increase in Recurrent Expenditure for public administration is proposed as opposed to the allocation under the previous Budget for 2022. The Government should have reduced expenditure at the time of this severe economic crisis that we undergo presently rather than raising it further while the public suffers from high inflation rates. If benefits were to be given to the penurious needy, some other expenditure should have been cut down because inflation would not come down as the Central Bank was continuing to print money to meet expenses. A fortnight ago, it printed Rs. 30 billion, according to reports. Unless the Government cuts down expenditure including Capital Expenditure, we would not be able to reduce the inflation rates and stabilize the economy. Of course, reasons have been given for the increase in expenditure, but increase in expenditure would further increase the inflation rates.

In addition to public administration, a notable increase can be observed in the expenditures assigned for the President, defence, education and health. The defence allocation has been increased with a sum of Rs. 212,808 million allocated to the Ministry of Public Security. A sum of only Rs. 138,560 million has been allocated for agriculture in contrast. Such are the priorities.

It appears that we are not going to tarnish our reputation as the 14th largest army in the world. Why does our small country need such a large army? Generally, a country would focus on the process of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration - DDR - after a war. Those are essential to restore sustainable peace in a post-war scenario. We should have reduced our army personnel as soon as the war was over or at least a few years later. We have today 331,000 army personnel officially as opposed to Britains 90,000. That number is to be further reduced by Britain soon. The DDR is one of the significant aspects of the process of post-war peace-building. Disarmament, demobilization and reintegration - DDR - is a process that contributes to security and stability in a post-war recovery context by removing weapons from the hands of combatants, taking the combatants out of military structures and helping them to integrate socially and economically into society by finding civilian livelihoods for them. But, those who fought the war are still in our armed forces. Some of them are still working in the combat areas. It is high time that they are taken out of the North and the East and reintegrated into the civil society. In most of the cases the world over, this process has been implemented with the assistance of foreign governments and international or regional institutions. However, the circumstances under which the Government of Sri Lanka happened to take over the sole responsibility for implementing the DDR process have raised serious concerns both at the local and international levels. The findings of a recent study show that the DDR process was not fully implemented in a broad manner in the Sri Lankan context, but only served as a continuation of the militarily victory over the LTTE. In particular, not much attention was paid to disarming and demobilizing the armed groups and the so-called DDR process took place in Sri Lanka without international assistance and supervision. One would think that the Sri Lankan powers that be had a purpose in keeping out international assistance and supervision. I would surmise it is to keep the North and the East under the military boot. This, coupled together with the expenditure for the armed forces in the Appropriation (Amendment) Bill, shows that there has not been any changes in the psyche of the powers that be in Sri Lanka even after the "aragalaya". Thoughts of Sinhala hegemony still reigns heavily in their minds.

All the talk about an all-party Government becomes a mockery in the light of such continuous military spending. Therefore, the clarion call for unity is an empty shell. The Government, under the present President, wants to continue to spend large amounts of money to maintain our 14th largest army in the world. It has no intention of forging any form of reconciliation with the minorities. And with whom is the Government expecting

943 944

a war? Against India? Against China? Against America or even against the Maldive Islands? No. They expect an attack from us, the poor Tamils of the North and the East, because the Government believes that the Tamil people will not continue to endure against the Sri Lankan States continued oppression and genocide. That is why the Sri Lankan Government preferred to conduct the so-called DDR process without international assistance and supervision. They want the presence of the military permanently in the North and the East.

Sir, Sri Lankas economic crisis is due to many factors. One major factor was the war and the money that Sri Lanka borrowed to buy destructive weapons. Another is massive corruption among government and Defence Ministry officials. A further major reason for the crisis was the ethnic cleansing that forced most of the Tamils to quit small businesses, high tech-related jobs, the manufacturing trade, exportation and training, impeding Sri Lankas economic development, managerial efficiency and productivity. The State, by its short-sighted racial policies, sabotaged itself. Earlier, the racial discrimination against the Tamils forced many of them to leave Sri Lanka. They are the Tamils who are now offering to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for Sri Lanka, if the political problems of the Sri Lankan Tamils are solved. All of those erstwhile racist activities led Sri Lanka to this economic crisis. It did not happen overnight; it started with the ethnic riots of 1958.

Israeli Professor Oren Yiftachel has said that ethnocratic countries often experience ethnic tensions, which cause instability. Therefore, as long as Sri Lanka remains an ethnocratic country, there will continue to be instability. This will never lead to sustainable peace and economic prosperity, as expected by the Hon. President. The fact that you have increased defence spending to keep the army in the North and the East and to establish massive military infrastructures and settlements to continue oppressing the Tamil people shows the instability that will continue in the future. After 13 years since the end of the war, why is the military being allowed to occupy our peoples lands and buildings, our forests and shores? The existing problems that the Tamils face, which were brought to the notice of the President, are conveniently forgotten in his speech. We feel that, though the President had positively responded to our queries regarding the day-to-day problems the Tamils face, apart from the need to solve the political problems of the Tamils, he prefers to remain silent in Parliament regarding our problems lest he disturbs a hornets nest. Sir, I am reminded of Robert Walpole, who was Prime Minister of England in 1715 or thereabout and whose policy was let sleeping dogs lie. Maybe because our Tamil youths, in recent times, have not resorted to "aragalayas" in their areas, the President believes we are but sleeping canines best left to be unsaid and unreferred to. But, I am sure this time, Geneva would reiterate its stand quite positively.

Now, I would like to remind the contents of my request letter, to which the Hon. President responded

positively. He promised to release all Tamil political prisoners, but nothing has come out from that promise. It is said that there is a move to release some persons taken into custody on suspicion after 2019, just in time for the Geneva deliberations. None are going to be fooled by such gimmicks, if they are true. If the case of the Tamil political prisoners, some of them languishing in jails for over quarter of a century, is not going to be considered in a humanitarian manner considering the long period of incarceration and the type of diseases that have been contracted by some of them, I am wondering if any Tamil Parliamentarian could ethically and morally be called upon to join in an all-party Government. Many of these prisoners had been found guilty solely on their confessions made to police officers under the PTA. Such confessions to police officers cannot be accepted as evidence under our regular criminal law. That was why I had asked for the release of the Tamil political prisoners and for the scrapping of the draconian PTA from our statute books. Instead, it is now being used against the "aragalaya" leaders. These leaders would soon be called terrorists. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Wigneswaran, please wind up your speech. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Just give me half a minute, Sir.

Any attempt to bring in diverse political viewpoints together under one umbrella must be preceded by genuine acts of goodwill towards those holding such viewpoints. It is useless saying, Join us and I will give you a free hand to express your views. The moment a Tamil Parliamentarian joins the Government, he would lose his freedom of speech. The majority in the governing party will rule the roost. I hope the Tamils whose names have been included in a ministerial list recently would wait till the Geneva deliberations are over before taking office. I have no objections to attending a meeting of party leaders friendly towards this Government to put forward the viewpoints of the Tamils.

Finally, Sir, my request to the donor countries and the IMF is, "In this difficult situation for Sri Lanka, you should definitely help save the people of Sri Lanka from starvation, but please see that you do your assistance in such a way that your assistance is not used to suppress the rights of the Tamil people and would not be used for defence expenditure".

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . 6 . Order, please! , .
