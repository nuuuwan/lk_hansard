Yesterday, I read an article in "The Morning" newspaper. Sir, I am quoting from that article what the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Presidents Counsel M. U. M. Ali Sabry, said.

"Speaking in the Parliament yesterday (06), he also said that the Government is working to strengthen the truth and reconciliation mechanisms of the country,"

Then, he goes on to state, I quote:

"There are two groups that criticise this effort. One group is the Southern politicians, who dont want this country to be united. The other group is the Tamil diaspora." ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) .

Hon. Minister, the Tamil diaspora is also a part of this country or people who lived in this country and who were chased out of this country at one point due to the war; they did not leave the country by choice. Now, they are being called the diaspora because this country chased them away.

When the truth and reconciliation mechanism had been proposed in this country, as the peoples elected Representatives who are in touch with them, we rejected that proposal the day you presented it to us, saying that there is no justice mechanism in it. To that, you said the Attorney-Generals Department could do some work, but you already know that the Attorney Generals Department has way too much on its plate. So, we spoke about, at least, a hybrid mechanism for justice. Without justice, this mechanism will fail, which is why we are opposed to that, Hon. Minister.

Thank you.

... ( ) ( ... - ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC - Minister of Foreign Affairs) .

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC ) Hon. Member of Parliament, thank you for raising that. We have come up with a truth and reconciliation mechanism and have established an Interim Secretariat. That Secretariat had spoken with other parties and had 55 consultations. We had consultations with you also. We noted down those points, improved it and have now gazetted it.

I have nothing against the entire diaspora, do not get me wrong. But, there is a segment of the diaspora which, every day, talks about a separate State. In my speech yesterday, I said that if you want to advocate your federalism, whether I agree or not, that is your right and that I have no problem with it. The Supreme Court had said that you can do it, and I am also for devolution of power because I feel that the Tamils in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces feel that they are not a part of governance. They must feel that they are also a part of governance. Therefore, I am for it; I have been for it, not only today, but from day one because I have had good Tamil friends. My father also had good Tamil friends and they were murdered in 1983. I saw that and my father was depressed after seeing that. So, we want a solution to that.

Then, a similar thing was said about the Office on Missing Persons also. Do you know that out of the 6,500 people who have complained that they have lost their loved ones from 2000 to 2009, predominantly from the North and the East, 5,200 families have gone before the Office on Missing Persons because they want relief. We all can argue here, but we need to come to terms with it and find a solution. This may not be the finest solution, but let us start with that. So, that is the idea.

We are open to your constructive suggestions. I also know the limitations. You may not publicly endorse this; you cannot because of the complexities both in the North and the East. Even some of the Sinhalese politicians and you all also cannot do that because that is how we have polarized ourselves over a period of time. But, that does not mean that we should not come up with some sort of a meaningful solution. So, we are open to your suggestions and please write to us. And, the law is now in the public realms. I did not want the politicians to take up that role because then, it will be politicized. Therefore, we have an Interim Secretariat to do it. Please give your suggestions to that and we will finalize it.

Thank you.

. I will quote from the Wikipedia about Rice Production in Vietnam. See what a phenomenal development they have achieved in rice production!

"Rice production in the Mekong delta has seen phenomenal increase in recent years, though in some years drought conditions have impeded this growth. This increase is attributed to planting of modern early maturing rice varieties, better management, appropriate Legal Constructs by the Government. Forty two IRRI researched varieties of rice were released for adoption in the Mekong Delta and according to IRRI sources these varieties cover 60% of the irrigated rice-growing area in the delta. Area brought under Rice paddy, which was at 4.744 million ha in 1961 increased to 7.305 million ha in 2007. Correspondingly, Rice production in Vietnam which was 8.997 million tonnes in 1961 and 10.29 million tonnes in 1975, gradually increased over the next two decades to 35.567 million tonnes in 2007."

"Realising the folly of State Control, ...."

.

" .... the Government of Vietnam, in 1986, allowed the farmers "to grow and sell their rice". Sure enough there was an incentive to the farmers to grow rice in the delta and Vietnam became one of the leading exporters of Rice. Since then many Legal Constructs have been enacted in Vietnam as a part of Wetland Development, of which the most significant is the Land Law (1994) that gave rights to the farmers, which resulted in an accelerated growth of the Mekong Delta and increase in income to the people."

PRIVILEGE: MAKING OF THREATS AND

ATTEMPT TO ASSAULT

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I would like to raise a matter of Privilege and I hope you would give me adequate time to raise it. I have already briefed the Assistant Secretary-General about the matter and it is a serious issue.

Sir, a few minutes ago, the Hon. Rohitha Abeygunawardhana threatened to assault me. He threatened me in the Office of the Prime Minister of this country. In the Office of the Prime Minister of this country, this Member threatened me and was about to physically assault me. He was stopped by State Minister Ashoka Priyantha and also a witness to that incident was the Hon. Jagath Priyankara, Member of Parliament, who was also in that Office. So, as per the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act, my Privileges had been violated. I had been threatened; my life is under threat because the Hon. Abeygunawardhana said, Walk out and come and see me near the lift! So, he had threatened me. He said that he will assault me near the lift and the reason he gave was that because I walked into the Office of the Prime Minister of this country. He said, How dare you walk into our Prime Ministers Office!" Sir, I went to meet the Hon. Prime Minister, who is also the Minister in charge of Divisional Secretaries, about an issue pertaining to Batticaloa. Batticaloa is a part of this country. I am a Tamil. The Hon. Abeygunawardhana suggested that I should not walk in there. So, I told him, "He is the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka." As a Member of Parliament of this House, as a citizen of this country, I have all the right to go and meet the Prime Minister. Tell us to our face, You are not a part of this country. You are Tamil. This

country and this Prime Minister are only for the Sinhala people. Tell us that. Then, we will take action.
