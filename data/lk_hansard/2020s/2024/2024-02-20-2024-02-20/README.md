. . ( . ) (The Hon. Premnath C. Dolawatte, Attorney-at-Law) First of all, Hon. Deputy Speaker, before I participate in this Debate, I would like to clarify some matters regarding the Amendment I proposed to the Penal Code. I presented the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill as a Private Members Bill on the 04th of April, 2023. We took up the Second Reading of that Bill on the 13th of December, 2023. That Bill seeks to decriminalize the conduct of the LGBTQ community. I think we all are aware that Sections 365 and 365A of the Penal Code are the sections we propose to amend to decriminalize the conduct of the LGBTQ community. So, most of the members of that community are keen on knowing what is going on with regard to the Bill. Therefore, I would like to clarify the situation.

Last December, after the Second Reading of the Bill, it was referred to the Legislative Standing Committee chaired by the Hon. Deputy Speaker. After the prorogation of Parliament, a new Parliamentary Session started and the new Members for the Legislative Committee are due to be nominated. Afterwards, the Committee would nominate co-opted Members to consider that Bill. On the 13th of December, 2023, I requested the Secretary-General to take necessary steps regarding this Penal Code (Amendment) Bill. So, after the appointment of the Legislative Standing Committee, I think the co-opted Members from the Government and the Opposition would be named to consider the Bill. Thereafter, the Legislative Standing Committee would have a discussion and decide on the Bill and finally, it would be taken up in Parliament for its Third Reading. So, I believe that for the LGBTQ community and those who are interested in the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill to decriminalize the conduct of the LGBTQ community, this clarification is enough. At the same time, I would like to table* this letter requesting the Secretary-General of Parliament to expedite this whole process.

I heard and saw some of the interested parties accuse the Ministry of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms saying that they have not given the necessary report on time. I must tell you that, as normally done in regard to any Private Members Bill, if the relevant

509 510

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

Minister does not submit his report on the Bill within a six months' time, then I could move the Second Reading of the Bill. Sir, we have already passed that time period, the Bill is on the correct path and now, we have come to the latter part of the process. I believe, hopefully by March or April, without delaying the entire process, we could consider the Bill at the Legislative Standing Committee and report to Parliament. I would like to have the support of the Legal Draftsman, the Attorney-Generals Department and at the same time, the support of the Ministry of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms with their report, which is necessary for the legislative process of the Bill at the Legislative Standing Committee. So, that is where we are now and I believe that in the near future, we could pass the Bill and make it a law of this country.

Sir, I am going to wind up after asking this question very quickly in English and I would be grateful if somebody could provide some clarification on that. The Secured Transactions Act of 2009 as well as the new Secured Transactions Bill state that the secured collateral does not need to be owned by the debtor. This implies that the owner of the collateral should give the consent to the registering of the asset as security, but it is not explicitly stated. The Secured Transactions Act of 2009 states that the debtor has the right to continue to use the asset, but the new Bill states that the collateral is to be perfected. What the Secured Transactions Bill means by "perfection" is given in Clause 29(3), which states, I quote:

"...the collateral shall be actually delivered into the possession and custody of the secured party or his authorized representative, and continue to remain actually, ostensibly and bona fide in such possession, until such time as the secured party seeks to enforce its rights in respect...."

So, the question I am asking is, does it mean that the debtor cannot have access to the asset for productive purposes, given the new law that has been brought in and would it not be detrimental to the debtor, especially the SMEs, if the asset is pledged as collateral, but has to be handed over to the secured party? I am just asking for a clarification to get this cleared.

Thank you very much for the time provided. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. Selvarajah Kajendran. You have six minutes. [.. 2.49]

( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana) Hon. State Minister just mentioned about a school which is being established in the Batticaloa District. He and I attended the DCC meeting in Batticaloa last week. This particular school is called Sir Razik Fareed Vidyalaya. That has been started way back in 2020. So, we are not going to start a new school. Sir, it is proper to mention, while we are discussing about the Ministry of Finance, that Government side people are being given liquor permits. With those permits, there are bars opened closer to kovils and mosques. Because of that, they are trying to close this school, which is already in existence. That is why I wanted to make it very clear and with due respect to the Hon. State Minister, -

. ( . ) (The Hon. S. Viyalanderan) Hon. Presiding Member, give me my allotted time. Hon. Member, I can explain it to you after my speech. Thank you.
