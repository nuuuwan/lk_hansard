: SRI LANKA TELECOMMUNICATIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL:

DETERMINATION OF THE SUPREME COURT ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I wish to inform Parliament that I have received the Determination of the Supreme Court in respect of the Bill titled Sri Lanka Telecommunications (Amendment), which was challenged in the Supreme Court in terms of Article 121(1) of the Constitution.

In the said Determination, the Supreme Court has summarized the Constitutionality of the Bill as follows:

Clause 8 - Proposed Section 9A(2) of the Bill is inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution. However, the inconsistency shall cease if the word may be replaced with the word shall, as set out in the Determination of the Supreme Court.

Clause 9 of the Bill is inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution and can only be passed with the special majority required under paragraph (2) of Article 84. However, the inconsistency shall cease if the Clause is amended as set out in the Determination of the Supreme Court.

Clause 12 - Proposed Section 17(10) of the Bill is inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution and can only be passed with the special majority of Parliament required under Article 84(2). However, the said inconsistency shall cease if the Clause is amended as set out in the Determination of the Supreme Court.

Clause 13 - Proposed Section 17(A)(1) and 17(B) of the Bill are inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution and can only be passed with the special majority of Parliament required under Article 84(2). However, the said inconsistency shall cease, if the Clause is amended as set out in the Determination of the Supreme Court.

Clause 18(5) - Proposed Section 22(3A) and 22(3B) of the Bill is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 14(1)(a), 14(1)(g) and 12(1) of the Constitution and shall only be passed by the special majority of Parliament required under Article 84(2). The said inconsistency shall however cease if Clause 18(5) is amended as set out in the Determination of the Supreme Court.

Clause 18(7) - Proposed Section 22(7) of the Bill is inconsistent with Article 12(1) and Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution. However, the said inconsistency shall cease, if the Clause is amended as set out in the Determination of the Supreme Court.

Clause 20 - Proposed Section 22AD is irrational and inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution and shall only be passed by the special majority of Parliament required under Article 84(2).

Clause 33 - Proposed Section 59A is inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution and shall only be passed by the special majority of Parliament required under Article 84(2). However, the inconsistency shall cease if proposed Section 59A is deleted.

Clause 35 - Proposed Section 68(1A)(b) and 68(1A)(c) of the Bill are inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution and shall only be passed by the special majority required under Article 84(2). However, the said inconsistency shall cease if Clause 35 is amended by deleting proposed Sections 68(1A)(b) and 68(1A)(c), as set out in the Determination of the Supreme Court.

The other provisions in the Bill are not inconsistent with any provisions in the Constitution.

I order that the Determination of the Supreme Court be printed in the Official Report of todays Proceedings of the House.

MEETING OF COMMITTEE ON PARLIAMENTARY BUSINESS

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) 2024 13 8: : 1.00 02 8 [ 8 8[ [: : .

. ( - , ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe - President, Minister of Defence and Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies) Hon. Speaker, you had read out to the House the Determination of the Supreme Court on the Gender Equality Bill.

I just want to raise a point of Order that it violates the powers of this House given under Article 4 of the Constitution, and we should appoint a Select Committee on that.

I would like to, first and foremost, refer to the what the Determination on the Gender Equality Bill states. It states, "What is the 'National Policy on Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women' referred to in this Bill? At the least, it is hard to find out. It is not specific as there is no reference in the Bill, to any particular State policy...." There has been a National Policy on Womens Empowerment and Gender Equality since 2011. These are obligations of the Government under the Sustainable Development Goal 5 and a number of womens conventions and agreements we have signed. More than that, in the case of Kamalawathie and others vs. the Provincial Public Service Commission, North-Western Province and others SLR 1, national policy was deemed within the domain of the Cabinet of Ministers and Parliament; it is a political matter. Therefore, the Supreme Court cannot, in any way, go and make any ruling on this. Then, they are contravening and coming into our area.

Secondly, there is a large number of cases which had been dealing with the question of equality and equality of women. There is the case of Rathnayake Tharanga Lakmali vs. Niroshan Abeykoon and the Inspector General of Police, which recognized the dignity and well-being of people as a fundamental right. Then, there was

867 868

2024 13

the ten-Judge Bench in the case of Sarath Jayasinghe and others which said, "We are of the view that mere reliance on a text used in a Constitution is not sufficient to ascertain the values that are embodied in a Constitution or its Amendments".

Similarly, Justice Shirani Bandaranayakes Judgment on the case Karunathilaka and another vs. Jayalath de Silva and others states, The basic principle governing the concept of equality is to remove unfairness and arbitrariness. It profoundly forbids actions which deny equality and thereby become discriminatory. The Court has also ignored the special Determination on the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill made by the Chief Justice. Sir, in the Gender Equality Bill, we are talking of empowering women and ensuring equality for women. But, according to Sustainable Development Goal 5, even other minorities must get government services without discrimination. That, anyway, comes from the average duties which have been given to us under Fundamental Rights. So, all these powers have been disregarded; in a sense, the Court had set aside everything and given the Determination. Or, in other words, all the other judgments have disappeared, as if this Court had eaten them all up. So, in a way, they are practising judicial cannibalism and then, we are being asked to accept their judgment, which this House cannot do. How can you overrule the judgments given by a ten-Judge Bench and the Chief Justice? So, that is one area.

Then, they are saying that this would allow same-sex marriages and gender transition. No, this Bill has nothing to do with it; we cannot allow that.

The Court goes by this normal Section put in every law by the Legal Draftsman and the Attorney-General, not by us. That is, this law prevails over other laws, but this has also been interpreted. Finally, it is for the Court to decide. I think in the case Chamara Sampath - not our Hon. State Minister, but another person - vs. Neil Iddawala also, they referred to the points. This has been done on the doctrine of harmonious construction, and the laws of marriage in this country cannot be changed by one Section.

More than that, they say that, basically, the whole Pirivena Education Act could get knocked out by this. I do not know on what basis they had decided that. We have Article 9 of the Constitution which protects Buddhism. I know about the Pirivena Education Act because I was one of those who drafted it and the Minister who implemented it. That Act states, "8 ) 8 [ ) [ ) 8 8 [ 8 8 8 8 8 8 [ 8 [ [ ) 8 8 ." All that has been taken on by Article 9 and do you think a small provision could change that? I do not think the Supreme Court or the Bench which sat on the case is even aware what [ ) mean. I think, first, they should go to a

temple or a pirivena and learn what those are before telling this House all this. We are aware of that. We have a member of the Sangha also as an Hon. Member here. So, what we are asking is, can all the rights of the Buddhists be taken away by one small Section? Then, what is going to happen? All the protection given for Buddhism would be removed.

If we take the power of the Supreme Court, finally, all of us have to go back to the 1972 Constitution. All its inherent powers had to be justified by the Constituent Assembly and the 1972 Constitution, on which the present Constitution was built. Therefore, the Supreme Court cannot rule on a Bill; they can only advise us. It is basically a pre-legislative scrutiny that they do. What we did in the 1978 Constitution - I was one in this House who was involved in that - was that we transferred the powers of the Constitutional Court to the Supreme Court to ensure that the independence of the court is even further strengthened. That is all we had done. In 1972, when the first instance came up and T. S. Fernando decided that two weeks was not mandatory, the House overlooked it and ruled it out. I think former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara were also Members of the House then. The powers of the Supreme Court, in all other matters, come under justice, but this certainly comes under Parliament. In a sense, unlike the other courts, the Supreme Court is transgender; that is what they fall into. They get legislative power from two genders, under Article 4(c) and from us, under Article 4(a).

So, this is really a perverse Determination which this House should not follow, and I recommend that a Select Committee be appointed to go into it. There is no need to summon the Judges; I do not think we should go to that extent. There is enough which could be studied and the Select Committee could make its recommendations on. And, the majority of the Members of that Select Committee should be appointed from among the Members of the Women Parliamentarians' Caucus since, after all, this Bill concerns women.

But, now what happens is, the Determination deprives the majority of the population, the women, of their rights and also takes away the safeguard granted by the Constitution to another majority, the Buddhists. So, we cannot accept it and this House has to assert its own rights.

Secondly, Hon. Speaker, there is another matter on which I have to make an announcement. As you know, there has been a lot of discussion and heartburn about the cremation of Muslim COVID-19 victims during the pandemic. Initially, all countries stopped the burials and went on to adhere to the WHO Guidelines. But, in Sri Lanka, we appointed a Committee to go into that and, unfortunately, that Committee recommended that we should not allow burial of COVID victims, whereas the WHO took a different view. But then, the Supreme Court also upheld the decisions of the Committee. So, the

869 870

8

Government had to follow that as there was no choice at that stage. But now, all that is over; we have gone through all that.

In this country, any person should have the right to determine whether he or she should to be buried, cremated or the body should be given to a medical faculty upon his or her death. Therefore, the Hon. Minister concerned will bring in a new law which grants to you the right to burial, cremation or gifting your body to a medical faculty upon your death. During the COVID pandemic, we witnessed the pain undergone mainly by the Muslims over that issue, but I know that there were Hindus, Buddhists and Christians also who wanted the dead bodies of their loved ones buried. Therefore, we would like to apologize to them on what happened and I hope this House would support the new Bill that would be presented to the House.

Thirdly, since when we move on to the Public Business I may not be here, I just want to explain to this House about the tax on house rental income. We are going to have a Wealth Tax imposed and there will be a very high threshold. So, the income from 90-odd per cent of the houses given on rent by the people would not come under that and at least one house would be exempted from it. So, do not worry, the rental income on your house would be safe.

But, why is it that we are going to have a tax on the house rental income? Because house rentals are based on ratings. Then, we came up with the problem that rates belong to the provincial councils. So, if we go on the ratings, there is a possibility that the court could say that that money belongs to the provincial councils. So, we wanted to bring it under the Central Government. Therefore, we have used a different formula called rental income because Income Tax belongs to the Central Government. It is the same, we would have generally used the ratings, but to get over the Constitutional issue, we have done that. That tax is going to have a very high threshold and I do not think the vast majority of the people in this country should even be worried about their income from houses rented out. That is all.

But, we will have to get on with the Wealth Tax. I know, the SJB is very worried that the billionaires who are with them would get taxed. But, nevertheless, this is the reason for imposing it.

Thank you. ( - ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa - Leader of the Opposition) [ [ 8 8) [ [ 8 . [ 8 [8 [ :[

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Speaker, - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Sumanthiran? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Speaker.

Hon. President, I associate with your concerns about the Determination on the Gender Equality Bill. There may be issues that arise from the Supreme Court Determination. But, there is a point of Order I raise. That

875 876

8

2024 13

is, what was read out by the Hon. Speaker today is the Supreme Court Determination on the Sri Lanka Telecommunications (Amendment) Bill. The Supreme Court Determination on the Gender Equality Bill was not read out.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) It was read out during the last Sitting Week. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) It was read out during the last Sitting Week, is it? Very well.

Hon. President, I wish to state that your concerns are valid. But, we are a little concerned about the route you are taking. If you go to appoint Select Committees for each and every determination of the Supreme Court, there will be a confrontational path. So, with utmost respect, may I suggest that the Bill be re-presented, maybe, with some changes or without changes and then, Parliament could request the Supreme Court to have a fuller Bench to consider it again. Then, we would be following a particular path, given that some of the judgments you cited including that which was given by a ten-judge Bench are considered. All that is valid. So, instead of challenging the Determination of the Supreme Court in this way, I suggest that we follow a non-confrontational path by re-presenting the Bill and asking the Supreme Court to consider it all over again.

Now, Sir, I want to raise another matter. In the month of March, I attended a meeting with the President and the President tweeted saying, I invited Party Leaders to discuss the IMF Proposals. I always encourage open dialogue and shared commitment. TNA Leader and Parliamentarian, Mr. M. A. Sumanthiran, along with other stakeholders, joined me yesterday" and so on. Then, he had further said, Mr. M. A. Sumanthiran voiced a key concern regarding the availability of IMF technical assistance reports. I am committed to releasing these reports to the TNA and Parliament. We discussed further how our Government remains dedicated to following a structured roadmap for economic stability." To this day, neither I nor this House have received those Technical Assistance Reports, Hon. President, that you promised to give us. While I attended that meeting, you said you would give it. Then, you tweeted that. After that, you came to this House and said that it will be presented. Now, three months have elapsed and the Technical Assistance - TA - Reports of the IMF have not been presented. So, I am raising a very serious concern. I do not want this also to be added to the list of things that you promised to deliver, but never delivered. There is a long list of things that you have promised to deliver and not delivered. So, this is in writing and you have given this commitment to the country. You, yourself had tweeted this on your personal "X" account, but we are yet to receive it.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Hon. Speaker, the Hon. (Prof.) Charitha Herath questioned why I should be in Parliament. It is very clear in Article 32 of the Constitution, which states that the President can come to Parliament once in every three months. Also, I have every power and Privilege other than the right to vote. Earlier, some Presidents even chaired the Ministerial Consultative Committees. But, I have not chaired any of the Ministerial Consultative Committees. 8 8 [ 8[ 888 1973. 8 [ : 8 [ 8. : [ [ 8 8. . [ .

Here, there is no gender issue. What I have done is, taking up the National Policy on Gender Equality. : 8 . 2011 . : . ) ) 8 . [ : 202]. 8 [ . [ .

We have not gone on to recognize transgender. There is a big issue whether there is a third gender. India and some other countries recognize a third gender, not transgender. So, that also has not been resolved.

Actually, Sustainable Development Goal 5 talks of men and women, but, at the end, they say that in giving basic services, everyone must be treated alike, even transgender people. We all agree, whether it is the health service, education or employment, you cannot discriminate anyone. But, this Bill is about womens rights and basically, the National Policy on Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment is also on that. If you read that Policy, it would be very clear that it is all regarding the rights of women. There are a very few references to gender and those references are mainly in regard to equal treatment in health and other services. I have that whole Policy document here with me and if you want, I can read it. It states, I quote:

"The National Gender Equality and Womens Empowerment Policy shall ensure the adoption of policy, legislative and institutional frameworks for gender equality and womens empowerment;"

So, Hon. Speaker, gender equality is for the purpose of womens empowerment. It goes on to state, I quote:

"...the Policy shall ensure the de-jure and de-facto enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedom by women on equal ..."

So, this is to place women on an equal footing. It also states,

"... Policy shall ensure the recognition, addressing and redressing of all forms of discrimination against women...",

And, it further states,

"The National Gender Equality and Womens Empowerment Policy shall ensure the equal and equitable access to participation and decision making of women and gender minorities ...," .

There, we say "gender minorities".

I have my own views. I agree with the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa that transgender women should not take part in sports. It is a very sensitive issue. We cannot go into it. We have not accepted same-sex marriages. So, all those are out. Marriages are governed by the Ordinances. So, if you have a court determination which says that it is not, then what do you do with it? It is not like a normal judgment. So, all these are about women. I have my reservations on this Policy, but the Women Parliamentarians' Caucus went into it and this is the final document agreed to by the Women Parliamentarians' Caucus. So, kindly speak to them. : [ [ [ 8 8 : 8 8 [. [ . The Government has not gone for same-sex marriages, mixing these things or for anything else. We have only stuck to the decision. If the Supreme Court says that and removes all the safeguards on Buddhism, what will happen?

[ 8 8[ [ 8 8 [. : 8[ What is the Section they are talking about? It is there in every law in this country; . 8 . - 8 - : 8. That is, "This Act prevails in case of inconsistency". Every Act has that. So, let us talk about it.

I have asked for a Select Committee because I want to ensure that we do not go into other areas, we stick to Sustainable Development Goal 5 and certainly to ensure that this does not apply in case of Buddhism. We have enough protection under Articles 9 and 12. Only this Bench - Supreme Court 8; the Supreme Court has been very clear in cases - has decided to go rogue, . That is why I said they have eaten up all the previous judgments, that it is judicial cannibalism. There is a complete body of laws, which is very clear on rights and three Judges have eaten

887 888

2024 13

it up. So, what do you do for judicial cannibalism? If you could suggest some other way of dealing with it, I would not mind. Okay, if you want, we will speak with the Chief Justice also and ask him what we could do. But, this Bench had knocked out his judgment also, which is the governing one! You cannot go on like that.

(a) Is she aware that -

(i) every year in periods of dry weather in Kandy, reserved forests, forests associated with water catchments and small shrub jungles in many areas in the central hills including the Divisional Secretary's Divisions of Kandy, Panwila and Ududumbara are set on fire; and

It states, I quote:

1. The SLC administration consists of three primary arms: a. Regulatory b. Cricket administration, and c. Technical matters responsible for cricket and player management. We believe that each of those groups should be distinctly delineated and should not encroach upon one another. They should have enough autonomy to act appropriately. Although the Ministry of Sports and Youth Affairs is in charge of overseeing sports in

general, the responsibility for managing and running cricket activities lies with SLC. The administration of SLC should delegate technical responsibilities, such as coaching and player management, to qualified technocrats who are recruited under a process outlined in the report."

Then we are saying, I further quote:

"2. The existing framework of SLC has been specifically designed to cater to a select group of persons, enabling them to maintain their control over all aspects of cricket. Consequently, this structure has deterred individuals possessing expertise, ability, experience, and a strong desire to participate in cricket administration.

3. Thus, it is imperative to overhaul the entire cricket framework by implementing essential administrative reforms and constitutional amendments. The current situation grants the existing set of stakeholders unrestricted authority to carry out their goals and virtually unlimited control over finances. Therefore, we cannot expect their complete cooperation in implementing any significant reforms that would guarantee a transparent, independent, and equitable management of cricket based on merit and talent as it will be detrimental to those who are benefitting from the status quo.

4. Therefore, most appropriate method for implementing these reforms is by legislative action, specifically by enacting a law that introduces a new constitution to SLC, as outlined in the report.
