( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Hon. Member, Parliaments right on finance comes from the Magna Carta - there can be no taxation without representation. Then, it has gone on to the Budget with the 1688 Revolution. So, financial control on all matters lies with Parliament. As it went on, it was also taken up by the US Continental Congress. Thereafter, in time to come, firstly, the Bank of England was established and the Government took over the shares there. Then, in the 20th Century, the Federal Reserve Bank was established. So, until then, even financial and monetary matters were controlled by the Legislature. But, subsequently, in America, the Federal Reserve had been given independence by legislation. Following that, as you know, about 10 or 15 years ago, the Bank of England was also given the same autonomy to function. So, within the ambit of Parliament, Parliament has created an autonomous state, not a separate state and under that, we have given the powers. That is what we have agreed on. So, that is how, in most countries with a democracy, it operates; finance is a matter for Parliament. While finance is a matter for Parliament, Parliaments have, by law, given a certain amount of latitude and independence to their monetary authority. That is there in Singapore; that is there in England. That has become the norm now and we have been following that norm. It is the same with the Reserve Bank in India. So, Parliament finally decides what is good. This is why we created a separate Committee on Public Finance, to look into all the public finance matters. So, by law - through the Central Bank

Act after repealing the Monetary Law Act - Parliament has give more freedom of action to the Central Bank than what it had under the Monetary Law.

Hon. President, I do not think we can continue to live as prisoners of the past. When singing our National Anthem, we say, " " we say that we should live and progress as children of the same mother. But, do we do that in life? No, we do not. Therefore, it is time that we dispel hatred and promote love and reconciliation.

Until and unless we really reconcile with our people, Sir, I do not think we would ever reach our true potential as Sri Lankans. Unfortunately, every time we march 10 years ahead of time, some calamity occurs and due to that, we have to lag behind others by about 15 years. For example, from 1956 to 1971, from 1978 to 1983, the 30-year conflict, the Easter Sunday attack and like that, one after another, we have invited calamities. Therefore, we must find the way to live together and celebrate our diversity. Some may ask what relevance this has to today's Bills. I know these are Bills relevant to the Ministry of Finance. But, reconciliation is equally important for economic growth of this country. Therefore, it is very relevant. It is a matter which is very close to my heart and I thought that I should speak about this very important topic.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva. You have four minutes.

[4.03 p.m.] () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) What can I do within four minutes, Sir? ?

Since, there is nothing I could do within four minutes, I will just respond to my Colleague, the Hon. Ali Sabry. When the former President stood in front of the Ruwanweli Seya and said that he was voted in by the Sinhala people and that he was disappointed with the Muslims and Tamils, that sent out a wrong signal, that reversed all the work the previous Government was doing to bring in reconciliation. I am sorry that I have to say this to your face, but that was a wrong start.

You mentioned about the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera. I was part of his team and we all worked on a four-pillar programme on reconciliation. Like you said, Archbishop Desmond Tutu was able to bringing out the truth and serve justice in South Africa because it was a Catholic country. But, here, we have Buddhists, Hindus, Christians and people of the faith of Islam. Therefore, we were thinking of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission for this multi-religious community. The SJB is fully for it; let me speak on behalf of my leadership, we are fully for a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Not only the Tamil people, but also the Muslim and the Sinhalese people, we all suffered. So, that is first point.

The second point, Hon. Minister, is accountability. That is where problems arose. Now, I will be very specific. You all criticized the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera at that time, saying that he was trying to bring in a hybrid court. Honestly, there was nothing like that. All he said was, I will quote him, Participation of

Commonwealth and foreign judges in this process". "Participation", Sir, is a broad word. It could mean being a consultant - the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa and others also brought in foreign judges as consultants - or the other extreme of being a hybrid court. But, that is not possible within the Constitution of Sri Lanka. Therefore, that possibility does not exist, that question does not arise and we have always been for a proper and domestically-led accountability mechanism which is credible in the eyes of the world.

The third point, of course, is reparation, reparation for loss of life and loss of property. Reparation, even now, Sir, has not necessarily been fulfilled in the way those people need it to be a sort of resolve.

For instance, their properties are still being occupied, shall I say, by others. Poor women who were cultivating their land are now unable to do so because, occupiers have actually gone and put up buildings on those; hotels and mansions have been built on those. I visited a mansion that was built for former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. It was a massive building! It had two swimming pools and chairs imported from I do not know where in the world, that the furniture was exorbitant! So, the third thing is, reparation must be done.

Sir, the fourth thing is non-recurrence of this; we must never let this happen again. That is why we need a new Constitution. I am standing here as a member of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya and speaking on behalf of my party, that we are for reconciliation, that we are looking to build sustainable peace in this country. I must extend my hand to our friends in the North. We know that at a recent election, the ITAK had elected a new leadership and we have already spoken to the Hon. Shritharan. We wish to continue that dialogue further because we are a political party that has always stood for reconciliation.

() ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Suren Raghavan - State Minister of Higher Education) The Hon. Sithadthan resigned yesterday. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Oh, has he resigned yesterday?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan) According to newspapers, he has resigned from the party leadership.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) What do you mean? The Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan is saying that he has resigned from the leadership of his party.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan) According to media reports. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) I do not know what media reports you are referring to. We have not seen those.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) I do not want to get into an argument with him, Sir.- [Interruption] I am not aware of that.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) I will conclude, Sir.

All what I am saying is that we need to bring moderate thinkers together. I do not know why it has happened. Nevertheless, I am only speaking on behalf of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya and we are for the implementation of the constitutional amendment that we, as Members of Parliament, have agreed on. When the Hon. President comes here and says "Well, I will put it to Parliament to see whether Parliament is willing to accept it or not", it actually makes no sense. He is there to implement the law that Parliament has passed.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. ( ) (An Hon. Member) He is trying to pass the buck. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Yes, he is trying to pass the buck. Sir, this was absolutely not the speech I was going to make.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Sir, give me 30 seconds and I will wind up.

The speech I was going to make was on what the Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya said, that there are alternatives and that we do not have to go along with the IMF. I want to table* this article which appears in today's "Daily Mirror", in which the so-called head of their Economic Council says, "Will not deviate from the IMF programme..."

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan) Hon. Member, could you give me a minute? I stand corrected.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Give me just one more minute and you can speak after I finish.

So, what I am saying is, the head of their Economic Council is saying that they are not going to deviate from the IMF Programme. If that is the case, what is the alternative? I am asking the Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya to explain it in her next speech.

Thank you very much, Sir. - [Interruption.]

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member. I stand corrected and have an apology to make to the Hon. Sithadthan. It is the Hon. Sivagnanam Shritharan who has resigned from the party leadership. So, the names were confused.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes, Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya? () ( () () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya) Hon. Presiding Member, my name was mentioned by the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva a little while ago. He mentioned that I have said that there is no alternative and as the NPP, we had taken a decision not to work with the IMF. Then, he showed an article in a newspaper, in which a different thing was reported. I did not talk about the IMF today and was referring to the President's Special Statement, where he said that there is no alternative. What I talked about was, how he referred to his leadership and to this Government, saying that there is no alternative and shutting down the democratic space for a discussion about such other alternatives. I would kindly request the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva to not to interpret my speech, but to actually refer to what I said. Thank you very much.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Hon. Presiding Member, - ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes, Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva? () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Sir, I want to reply to my Colleague, the Hon. (Dr.) (Ms) Harini Amarasuriya. She has now started wearing yet another cap. Who I mentioned earlier was the Head of their party's Economic Council, not her, unless she thinks that she is also a Head of their Economic Council. I tabled that article in today's "Daily Mirror" titled "Will not deviate from IMF programme, but will renegotiate terms and conditions: NPP"

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please do not go into a debate on that. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Sir, that headline appears in today's newspaper. Hon. Member, I did not refer to you. I said you had better - [Interruption,] Let me finish, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you very much.

Next, the Hon. Selvarajah Kajendren.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC) Hon. Presiding Member, - ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes, Hon. Minister? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC) Sir, I just want to give a clarification regarding Santhan. Santhan is a convicted criminal. He was found guilty for the murder of the former Prime Minster of India and was sentenced to death, but later, it was reduced to life imprisonment. Then, the Government of India gave him pardon. After being pardoned, he has been staying in India. This Hon. Member and several others, including an Hon. Member from Jaffna and the Hon. Douglas Devananda, made repeated requests from us to facilitate his repatriation to Sri Lanka. We immediately decided, despite all the objections and his past actions, that we will facilitate for him to come and reunite with his family. We had done that as soon as possible on humanitarian grounds, not because we admired his conduct, the killing of a leader of the world's biggest democracy. So, we facilitated it. Thereafter, of course, the Indian Government had to sanction his coming to Sri Lanka. But, unfortunately, he fell ill; he was suffering from cancer. He was treated very well by the Indian Government, but he died due to his illness. So, on everything, do not try to achieve cheap political gains. That is what I said also in my speech earlier. We have played this game for the last 75 years, but no one has been going anywhere. Therefore, it is time for us to think as Sri Lankans and look at issues based on merits. We all are Sri Lankans and we will treat the Sinhalese, the Tamils and the Muslims as equals; we do not discriminate against people. Hon. Member, your unnecessary charge that the Governments of Sri Lanka and India are responsible for his death is totally directed at the gallery of your district.
