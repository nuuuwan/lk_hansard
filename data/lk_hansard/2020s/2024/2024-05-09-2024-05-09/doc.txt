(a) (i) Answers are given in Annex 07*.

(ii) Before issuance of permanent certificates, inspection of the service locations is mandatory and permanent/formal registration certificates and licences are issued only to those establishments, which are recommended by the Field Inspection Officers after certifying that those locations have been set up as per the relevant guidelines. Temporary registration has been stopped from 01.01.2024 and permanent/formal registration certificates will be issued to the institutes recommended after a field inspection and if there are major shortcomings due to which registration cannot be recommended, a field inspection will be carried out after they are rectified and further action will be carried out accordingly. In the event that minor shortcomings need to be corrected for the recommendation, temporary registration will be done for a very short time until they are corrected.

The reason for introducing this temporary registration system was due to the recent COVID pandemic and the fuel crisis in the country, owing to which there have been difficulties in travelling to different parts of the country. The system has been prepared so that photos can be uploaded at the required places to prove that the points mentioned in the guidelines have been met according to each category. According to the guidelines, the organizations which have submitted photographs in an acceptable manner must submit their other written documents (certificates/lease agreements, business name registration certificates, approved building plans, fire insurance certificates, public and employee insurance certificates, environmental protection permits etc.) after verification, provisional registration certificates are issued. This certificate is issued for six months and within those six months, field inspections are carried out to issue licences to establishments that are maintained as per the guidelines and to cancel temporary certificates in places where they are not (temporary or uncertifable) maintained as per the guidelines.

(iii) Answers are given in the answer No. (ii)

above.

(iv) Field Inspection Officers

The field inspections are conducted by a team selected from among the members of the Sri Lanka Hotel School Graduates Association and two officers each are employed for the field inspections. The services of those officers are taken for a period of one year and evaluations have been done at the end of one year. New officers will be re-selected through an interview based on the recommendations of the Sri Lanka Hotel School Graduates' Association to replace the officers who leave during the evaluation. The list of officers currently employed is given in Annex 08*.

Vehicles used in field inspections

The vehicles in the institutes pool are used for field inspections and a list of them has been given in Annex 09*. As these vehicles are used for the functions of the entire institution, in cases where field inspections are not sufficient, vehicles are obtained on rent via the online system upon the approval of the institution.

Making payments for field inspections

No separate fee is charged for field inspections and in submitting online applications, an amount of Rs. 2,662.74 with taxes is charged as per each category for all administrative activities i.e. issuance of certificates/permits or an amount of Rs. 1,331.28 is charged for issuing temporary certificates.

An amount of Rs.12,102.00 is charged as administrative fees for the issuance of licences to the institutions recommended based on the results of the field inspection and the amount published on the website according to the respective category and number of rooms. It ranges from Rs. 2,420.51 to Rs. 70,194.87.

Officers conducting field inspections are paid an allowance of Rs. 5,000 per day and an allowance of Rs. 3,000 for food and around 10 institutions are inspected daily. The number of institutions that can be checked will be determined according to the respective categories and the distance of the locations. During a field inspection for a few days, the same officials will make payments for the accommodation facilities and then after checking the bills, the money will be reimbursed.

(v) Temporary certificates are not issued or

certificates issued are not extended without inspection. During the periods when it was not possible to do field inspections, extensions were made based on the photographic data so that the service providers would not be harmed and by now, all those places have been subjected to field inspections and shortcomings have been pointed out or places have been recommended. The places where the shortcomings are rectified are re- inspected.

(vi) The details of the certificates issued

temporarily are given in Annex 6* submitted in answer to (b) (ii) of Question No. 2039/2024. Almost all those institutions have been subjected to field inspections by now. Field inspections are carried out at the institutes where shortcomings that had been pointed out are rectified and information is obtained through photographs regarding minor shortcomings. The shortcomings of the previous field inspections are referred back to the officials who notified such and further action will be taken based on their recommendations. And also, if they need some time to rectify the shortcomings due to the existing economic situation and

practical reasons, the Director will act as conferred by the Board of Directors regarding the reasonable requests received in that regard, based on the information provided by the officers in charge of the subject related to each category.

(b) Not applicable.
