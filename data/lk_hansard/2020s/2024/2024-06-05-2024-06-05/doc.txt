Sir, now I would like to read the letter sent to His Excellency Shri Narendra Modi by me. I quote:

"His Excellency Shri Narendra Modi Prime Minister of the Republic of India

Excellency,

I offer my heartiest congratulations to you on the resounding victory of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance which assures your third consecutive term as Prime Minister of India, the largest Parliamentary democracy in the world.

As a close South Asian neighbour with deep friendship and strongest ties, Sri Lanka is committed to work together with India to overcome challenges and explore new opportunities for enhancing cooperation, peace and prosperity as the world's largest population and a giant economy in the world.

I look forward to continuously work with Your Excellency to further promote the strong, longstanding bilateral ties that are built on the foundation of shared beliefs and principles.

Please accept, Excellency, the assurance of my highest consideration."

Thank you, Sir.

Sir, let me take this opportunity to congratulate Prime Minister elected His Excellency Narendra Modi on his record or remarkable achievement. He is the first Prime Minister of India after His Excellency Shri Jawaharlal Nehru to have had consecutive victories, three times in a row, at the Indian Parliamentary Elections and it is a testament to his noble vision, practical policies and to his system of governance, that for the third time in a row, the citizens of India across all States had expressed a remarkable and historic confidence in His Excellency Modis political and governance programme.

While congratulating Prime Minister Modi, I would like to, at this juncture, propose from the Parliament of Sri Lanka that India should be duly made a permanent

215 216

member of the United Nations Security Council. That is of utmost importance. As the country which possesses the largest population in the whole world and also examining the world economic, military and security power configuration, I feel that that representation of India in the United Nations Security Council must be promoted and achieved. We, all the 225 Members in this august Assembly, would like to propose that India be made a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. I think it is long overdue and should be implemented as quickly as possible. I am pretty sure that the five permanent members who are there right now in the UN Security Council would have no objection to establishing this world power reality in the United Nations structure.

Sir, Prime Minister Modi has been a remarkable person who commenced his work from humble beginnings. He was from a small family; he did not have a huge family background. He did not have a power base to commence his work, but with his remarkable achievements as Chief Minister of Gujarat and then afterwards, as a three-time Prime Minister of India, he has exhibited his stupendous energy, charisma, hard work and singular determination to make India number one in the world. When most of the countries in the region are going through sluggish economic growth, we see India as a unique country which has extricated itself from the COVID menace or catastrophe. India has been a shining example as to how you get yourself out of desperate situations, despair, economic catastrophe and transform and translate a bad situation into a good one. Sir, I would like to congratulate Prime Minister elected His Excellency Shri Narendra Modi on his remarkable achievement across most states. Of course, there had been states where he has done very well and certain States where the BJP-NDA Alliance is yet to make its imprint.

However, I think holding the position of Prime Minister three times is a remarkable achievement and we applaud him on his achievements and success.

We would like to have a very close relationship continuously with India, our great and brotherly neighbour. We would also like to have a strong, productive and constructive relationship with them. We saw India's brotherly, neighbourly relationship with Sri Lanka, with them becoming the largest single donor to us, contributing an amount of US Dollars 6 billion in grants, loans and financial support. We appreciate the support India has provided us when Sri Lanka had been suffering from a variety of challenges including economic bankruptcy.

Sir, once again I congratulate His Excellency Shri Narendra Modi and his team, the BJP-NDA alliance, on this remarkable achievement and let us work together to ensure that mutual benefits and prosperity are maximized and achieved.

Thank you.

That headscarf is a religious requirement for Muslim girls and particularly at exam centres, they have been forced to remove it. So, if there is any reason to check them, that must be explained and examination of their headscarves is permitted, but not permanently removing them because that is a religious requirement. That is also happening in some non-Muslim schools. So, in that regard, kindly issue a circular, clarifying matters and have that implemented.

That is an achievement for a nation which has fallen and is now getting up, which was attacked by terrorists in 2019, which was devastated by COVID-19, which was made to fall by the bad political and economic decisions and almost got its democratic foundations destroyed. But, today, thanks to the far-sighted leadership, the international community and all of us, even the most peripheralized citizen because he or she pays the much needed taxes, our nationa is rising up again. .

[3.02 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, I must, at the very outset, say that this issue relating to the non-academic staff of universities or their demands, as the current State Minister of Higher Education said a while ago, began way back in 2016. I, too, as Minister holding the portfolio of Higher Education for a short while around 2018/2019, attempted to resolve the problem by submitting three Cabinet Papers. It is a matter of regret that the issue remains unresolved to date and I am sure it should now be resolved by discussion with those trade unions. I am told that about 18 trade unions are involved in this. Particularly, I must say that they must be mindful that whatever the academic staff is getting for their research purposes and as various other allowances cannot apply to them and that they must also be reasonable in negotiating this increase. As the current State Minister of Higher Education already said, the issue pertains to be the amount that the Treasury would finally have to allocate, in case the increment is allowed. Also, there is an issue of further anomalies happening in other sectors. All that have to be taken into consideration and these issues must be resolved without any further delay as the entire university system has come into a serious paralysis situation.

341 342

Sir, having mentioned that, may I now move on to another matter which was adverted to by the Leader of the Opposition in his speech this morning. He very carefully analysed one of the serious lapses in our education system, particularly those relating to the English medium instruction classes and the need to establish a separate English stream in our government schools.

As a student who came from the rural areas and also who had had the opportunity of receiving admission to a popular school in Colombo, the Royal College, through the government scholarship scheme, I am one who will always attest about the gap and the seriousness of this gap between the rural schools and the city schools or the prominent schools in the country. Therefore, it is important that we pay our attention to this area.

In this regard, Sir, I would like to table* a letter from a particular charity based in Australia, who have been doing wonderful work in Sri Lanka from 2004 onwards.

I had a chance meeting with the Chairman of that charity, Dr. (Ms.) Donna Vaughan. I was impressed by the wonderful work they have been doing and have tried to assist them by taking them to meet the former Secretary to the Ministry of Education, Ms. Wasantha Perera. And also, I introduced them to the Governor of the Eastern Province to see that this is incorporated into the official programme of the Ministry of Education involving all our government schools. They are running a very worthwhile programme, through which in the last year alone they have enrolled more than 1,000 English teachers to be trained under the novel programme called Lotus English Literacy Programme, which has been to develop essential literacy skills in children as they learn English and to enhance their competency development in line with the Government curriculum and syllabi. So, that is a very important programme. It is now being run with the assistance of the Jaffna University, the Eastern University and the South Eastern University. So, that must be adopted officially through a memorandum of understanding to be signed with the Ministry of Education. I earnestly ask the Minister to instruct the current Secretary to the Ministry of Education to take it up because that was discussed with the earlier Secretary, Ms. Wasantha Perera and she had responded to this NGO, promising them that they would discuss it with the National Institute of Education and incorporate it, possibly, into our National Education Policy Framework as well so that the programme could be properly implemented all over the Island. I would like to commend that NGO called Partners in Micro-Development Inc, an Australian-based entity which has been working wonderfully in our country for several years, has trained several teachers and has implemented it as a model programme in several schools. There are thousands of teachers to be trained. I am told that, by next week, their

team will arrive here in Sri Lanka and they are due to train even teachers from the Central Province. It was at my request that they have moved to the Central Province, but there is a difficulty. I was able to connect them with the Governor of the Eastern Province, Mr. Senthil Thondaman, and he was good enough to instruct the Provincial Director of Education to incorporate that programme in an official manner. But, unfortunately, the provincial educational authorities of the Central Province still have not got involved properly with that programme. Therefore, I am requesting the Hon. Minister to go through the letter which I have tabled and which had been handed over to Ms. Wasantha Perera, former Secretary, and instruct the current Secretary on further action. Unfortunately, Secretaries to Ministries are changing like in "Musical Chairs"; every Secretary coming to the Ministry of Education does not last beyond a year. Therefore, I would prefer if the Minister takes it upon himself to instruct the current Secretary to have a discussion with the National Institute of Education, incorporate it into our National Education Policy Framework and see that this programme is implemented for the benefit of all our children studying in government schools.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 10 .
