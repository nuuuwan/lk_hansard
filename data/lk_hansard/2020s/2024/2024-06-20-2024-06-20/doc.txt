If people can get away with attempts on murder like this and if all these are going to go unquestioned, it would be a serious threat, not just to the public but to us as well. So, I would like to ask the DCC to, at least, refer this matter to the Hon. Speaker and please initiate an investigation on matters like this.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, I will refer this to the Hon. Speaker. The next speaker is the Hon. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka. You have 16 minutes.

He said, I just want to raise a point of Order. The Determination violates the powers of this House given under Article 4 of the Constitution" and was referring mainly to the Determination on the Gender Equality Bill and some of the provisions therein. Thereafter, he said, The Supreme Court cannot rule on a Bill; they can only advise us. Then, he also referred to the 1972 Constitution, which really surprised me - referring to history is fine - and said how the 1978 Constitution came up from it. But, if you all are looking at a precedent, then you should go beyond that, not just look at a precedent which is only there.

Then, he basically went on to, I would use the word denigrate, the highest court in the country, which I think he should not have actually done being the Chief Executive Officer of the country. If we take court verdicts, we know they are not always perfect. Neither are Parliamentary decisions. We know that as well. But, there is a way of correcting Parliamentary decisions. That is how you go forward. When there was an issue in the country, through an aragalaya, some people mobilized people around Parliament, thought they could burn Parliament and that was the solution. That is nonsense! We may not be suitable in some of the things we do and as has been referred to in the House today, some of the people sitting here may also not be suitable and I agree with that. But then, that has to be corrected using the democratic process and not by burning Parliament. Similarly, denigrating the judicial system and the Supreme Court, putting them down and trying to stamp them out is not possible; that is wrong. We may not agree with every judgment. That is a separate issue and that needs to be looked into. We have sworn to uphold the Constitution; that is the role we have.

Then, it goes without saying that when a pre-enactment review of a Bills is needed, it is referred to the Supreme Court and they review it, look at it constitutionally to see whether it is in line with the Constitution or not and gives its Constitutional interpretation. Any perceived, genuine issue in the Determination in terms of accuracy must necessarily be undertaken through an appropriate reference to the court and not through a Select Committee of Parliament. The President wants to refer it to a Select Committee of Parliament. We should go through the legal process, use the system that is there. Taking any other step would be contrary to the due respect of the Judiciary or for judicial independence, and that is what a responsible Legislature should avoid. So, it is very unfortunate that the President came and said such a thing here in this House.

Anyone is free to express disagreement with a court finding in a reasonable manner. That is fine. In a lot of countries, you can do that openly. However, no one may seek to usurp or relocate the constitutional jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. That is prohibited by the Constitution and is also against the doctrine of separation of powers. Our Constitution very clearly states that, but, sometimes, we misrepresent what the Constitution actually states. I think I had better quote Article 3 of the Constitution.

In the Republic of Sri Lanka sovereignty is in the People and is inalienable. Sovereignty includes the powers of government, fundamental rights and the franchise.

Then, the Article 4. (c) states, I quote:

the judicial power of the People shall be exercised by Parliament ..."

But, that should be,

"...through courts, tribunals and institutions created and established, or recognized, by the Constitution, .

So, I think this balance needs to be understood; for sure, it needs to be understood and needs to be upheld. We must not go on undermining it in anyway. Therefore, it is pertinent for us to remind ourselves that we have a responsibility. We look to the Supreme Court to get the constitutionality of issues properly considered and determined. That is what it is there for and that role cannot be taken over by the Legislature. There is separation of powers and we must maintain that. So, it is really worrying that the President said that. We know that there are the concepts of Parliamentary supremacy and constitutional supremacy.

In Sri Lanka, even though Parliament has the power to change the Constitution with the consent of the people through a Referendum, to institute laws and to set up tribunals, courts and other instutions, once they are set up, we cannot interfere in their processes and that is very critical.

Unfortunately, Sri Lanka does not have post-enactment judicial review. The President, the other day, referred to the process of creating the 1978 Constitution and said that two Hon. Members who are in this House

1365 1366

[ ]

2024 20

were also in that Parliament. Then, he referred to the 1972 Constitution and the transition that took place. I want to ask those two Hon. Members who were in that Parliament, why they did not think of that deficiency in the 1972 Constitution and include post-judicial review in the 1978 Constitution. We saw it being hijacked recently in passing the Online Safety Bill. That Bill was presented and the Supreme Court had given its Determination, specifying what Clauses could be passed and what could not be passed without a two-thirds majority. However, at the Committee Stage, the Government basically pushed through their Amendments, passing even Clauses which required a two-thirds majority with a simple majority, violating the Supreme Court Determination and the Constitutional process of this country. We must not let that happen. That is why those two Hon. Members should have thought about post-judicial review then and brought it in because when a constitutional change takes place, you can do or push for anything which may or may not be in line with the Constitution. So, breach of the rule of law or disregard of the constitutional provisions is a bad precedent.

In addition to that, there is also the breach of the social contract people have made, surrendering their power to Parliament and the Judiciary to act on their behalf. Human morality was shaped in the course evolution over millions of years, dealing with social and ethical dilemmas which cropped up in the lives of the hunters and gatherers. Most of the injustices in the contemporary world result from large-scale structural biases rather than individual prejudices. But, the hunter-gatherer brain did not evolve to detect those structural biases.

Judgments could be wrong and be biased, but maintaining the structural safeguards such as separation of powers among the Executive, Judiciary and the Legislature is paramount rather than thinking of individuals. Then, what should we do? Should we adopt the liberal dogma and trust the aggregate of individual voters, that voters would decide everything and reduce the justice system to majoritarianism? What kind of nonsense and crap is that? Then, you do not need the Judiciary and we can vote on everything in Parliament.

We now face global problems without having a global community. Neither the Facebook, nationalism nor religion is near creating a global community anywhere. That is the truth. The human quest to understand the truth and find justice has been failed. If you are in government and take the view that Parliamentary supremacy supersedes judicial supremacy, we are bound to fail, as we have already seen.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I am concluding, Sir.

Majoritarianism in judicial decision-making replaces justice based on the established truth. Laws and internationally accepted conventions and practices must be upheld. So, it is the law, the philosophy and the international conventions and practices that must be upheld. Therefore, I would say to the House that we must ensure that we build up the judicial institutions of the country rather than denigrate them, even though we know they have weaknesses, just like Parliament also has weaknesses. Let us uphold the rule of law in this country. Thank you.

) ) ( () - ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Suren Raghavan - State Minister of Higher Education) Hon. Presiding Member, today, we are debating two important Bills that have been presented to this House and to the people, I would say, because this House still represents the sovereignty and the will of the people of this country. The decision-making process of the 22 million people of this country is entrusted by their own will to the elected Hon. Members of Parliament, who will debate, decide and create laws empowering other institutions to enforce those laws according to the accepted Constitution.

Sir, I would like to say how the UK Parliament define themsleves. They say, "Parliamentary sovereignty is a principle of the UK constitution." That is number one. . . . They further say, "It makes Parliament the supreme legal authority in the UK which can create or end any law." . . . Also they say, "Generally, the courts cannot overrule its legislation and no Parliament can pass laws that future Parliaments cannot change. Parliamentary sovereignty is the most important part of the UK constitution." . . .

So, the whole argument of who has the right to define a woman and how to define a woman has become an epicentric argument in the West. We should enter into that argument, Hon. Mujibur Rahuman, with the realization and remembering that this country has a rich culture, values and nuances of social contracts, individually and institutionally, that without following those, if we try to adopt the things in the faeries of the West, we will have a broken society even greater than this. I know, Hon. Rahuman, that you belong to a community which places supreme value on men and women and their cultural aspects. So, how can we do these?

Therefore, this Bill needs to be debated further in a more deeply contextualized manner. But, on the whole, this Bill argues for empowering women; it argues for giving them more recognition and it argues for giving them their due place, which is overdue. Therefore, I, as the first Tamil Governor of the Northern Province, want to reiterate that in the North and the East, we have 16,000 war widows and war-disabled women. You know that, Hon. Charles Nirmalanathan. We did this calculation.
