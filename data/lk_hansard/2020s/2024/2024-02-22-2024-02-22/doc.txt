[12.13 p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Jeevan Thondaman - Minister of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development) Hon. Presiding Member, I would first like to offer my condolences to the family of the late Hon. Member of Parliament and State Minister, the Hon. Sanath Nishantha. Also, I would like to take this opportunity to convey my condolences to the family of the late State Ministers personal security officer, Mr. Jayakody.

As far as my late State Minister Sanath Nishantha is concerned, I must say this. Initially, when I took over as

the Cabinet Minister of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development, I was honestly a bit concerned as to who my State Minister was because I had no prior experience in working with him and the only experience I had had with him was whatever I had seen or what had been portrayed of him. When I had first met him and when we had spoken, I realized that I was not talking to Sanath Nishantha, the State Minister of Water Supply, but to Sanath Nishantha who was a great father to four beautiful children, a great husband and a family man who had his loyalty completely vested in the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa.

It saddened me at the way Sri Lanka behaved as a society upon his death and that, we must address as community leaders. Regardless of whatever political ideology one shares, whoever he supports in the realm of politics and regardless of who he likes or do not like, every human being deserves compassion. According to our Constitution, we give the first and foremost place to Buddhism. So, I do not think what happened upon his death is what Buddhism teaches us, to show insensitivity to fellow human beings, let alone after they die. Therefore, it is something that must be addressed.

Today, we have gathered in this House to express all our condolences on the death of the Hon. State Minister. Up there in the Speakers Gallery, I see my sister and her four beautiful children, the four very young children who, I do not even think, even understand the concept of life and death. Tomorrow, they should grow up to become contributing members of society; they should grow up respecting the values of society and respecting Sri Lanka. They should not be victims of society; they should not be traumatized by the treatment that was meted out to their father upon his death, and it saddens me that that is where we are heading, which has been evident not only with the State Ministers death, but also during the aragalaya period when we lost the late Hon. Amarakeerthi Athukorala, who, in my view, was a very decent and a very well-respected politician. His death was treated with the same level of resentment. But, I think once the Hon. State Minister&#39;s remains reached his home town for the funeral, the sheer turnout of the crowd in his area showed the work he had done for his community, his commitment to the community and more or less, his dedication.

Though the late Hon. Sanath Nishantha and myself come from different political backgrounds, hold different political ideologies and different political dynamics, one thing I must recognize. That is, in his tenure as the State Minister of Water Supply, he was completely dedicated to providing water to the rural areas. He had worked closely with 5,000 community-based organizations, which I was unware of before his death. Had I known that, then he would have been celebrated even more. But, the reality of the matter is, today, we have lost an efficient administrator.

Today, one thing that Sri Lanka, especially the youth of this country, must reflect on is not to be instigated by certain political entities into becoming something that is not humane. We must understand the fact that the late

Hon. Sanath Nishantha being a Parliamentarian, a State Minister, a loyalist of the SLPP, all that is secondary. What is primary is the fact that he was a husband and a father and that needs to be looked at.

Sir, today, I stand before all of you, on behalf of his family, to thank all the Hon. Members of Parliament who have spoken so far and who will speak after me. One thing we, as humans, must realize is that we really do not value someone when he is living, but we understand his loss only after he is dead. And, that is something that must change within us.

As far as the late Hon. State Minister Sanath Nishantha is concerned, I think his commitment towards solving the issues of the rural community was always his priority. When I had taken over the Ministry and while we were dealing with reforms suggested by the Asian Development Bank and other problems pertaining to the water sector, the Hon. Sanath Nishantha was somebody who looked at the human component. He had always come forward to me with innovative ideas and ideas for better and more efficient management. That was simply because, though he was my State Minister, he was my guide in the Ministry. I was the fourth Cabinet Minister of Water Supply and the late Hon. Sanath Nishantha had seen all four Ministers. So, his experience in the water supply sector has to be noted.

Apart from that, I would also like to take this opportunity to explain the aftermath of the accident that took his life. I was shocked to find out how certain people had spoken ill of him. I was even more shocked to find out how many people had shared the visuals of his death. What kind of animal do you have to be to look at another human being in that manner? This is not the society we want our children to grow up in; this is not the society we want to carve out as community leaders.

Sir, today, I am sitting in this Parliament as the youngest Cabinet Minister in the history of Sri Lanka; today, I am sitting here looking at the very dark future because if it keeps going on in this manner, I can assure you, not only will we lose our children, but will also lose Sri Lanka eventually, which is why I would like to urge all the Hon. Members of this House not to politicize his death, but to recognize the efforts made by a man who was committed to his ideologies and to his family. If this were to happen to any one of those Hon. Members, I do not think they would want their families to feel the way the late Hon. Sanath Nishanthas family feels even now.

I would like to tell his children that, at the end of the day, their father was somebody who was committed to his task and his family, regardless of what anybody says, and not only was he committed, but was also a genuine human being who stuck to his beliefs. As a politician, he did not say what everyone wanted to hear; he said what everyone needed to hear. With those comments, Sir, I would like to end my speech.

I would like to, once again, thank all the Hon. Members of this House who expressed their condolences

because he was my State Minister and would also like to thank the public who attended his funeral.

Sir, I also wish for a better Sri Lanka, in which his children could grow up into contributing members of the society. Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . [.. 12.21]
