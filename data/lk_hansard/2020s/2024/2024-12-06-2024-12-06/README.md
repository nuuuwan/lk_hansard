() ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramanathan Archchuna) Hon. Speaker, I am representing the Jaffna District. If you take the Jaffna District, there are three Members from the NPP and three from the other parties. Unfortunately, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and his team are not willing to allot time for me, even two minutes per debate. Therefore, I need justification that you will make sure that my voice is also heard because I cannot go to the Office of the Leader of the Opposition now. I need at least 30 seconds to speak at every debate, to bring out my voice in Parliament. Otherwise, it would be an injustice to the people I represent.

Thank you.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Speaker, - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Thank you, Sir.

Sir, I just want to make the point that whilst we might be seated in the Opposition, our party, being a party which has only one Member, does not agree with the main Opposition on most issues. So, we do not have a working relationship with the main Opposition and lot of us, this time, are single-member parties or independent groups. If we take the Committee on Parliamentary Business as opposed to any other Committee, we need to know what the functioning of Parliament is because we are totally independent. With regard to the other Committees, maybe, we cannot be accommodated entirely, but at least with regard to the Committee on Parliamentary Business, my mumble request, Sir, is that you must be flexible with regard to the numbers because these numbers that have been included in the Standing Orders are from an era where there was a two-party system. These numbers do not reflect the reality of todays Parliament. So, the practice, in previous Parliaments, has been to be flexible with regard to the numbers in the Committee on Parliamentary Business so that you can accommodate the reality of the present Parliament.

Therefore, in that respect, I think the Parliamentary Business Committee, more than any other Committee, must be flexible with its numbers so that, at least, every single constituent party which represents its own constituency knows what the functioning of Parliament is. We have been acting very responsibly in the previous Parliament; we had a very hostile Government, but we never unnecessarily went and fought with them. I think everybody will admit to the fact that even the small-party Representatives in the Committee on Parliamentary Business acted extremely responsibly. So, this is not a question of us going in there to fight, but we need to know what the functioning of Parliament is. Otherwise, we will be kept completely in the dark. I do not think that is a fair thing to happen with regard to our franchise or mandate.

I would like to remind the Leader of the House - they have come on a mandate which is historic and with a single-party majority - that what we are requesting for right now as the Opposition is exactly what the Hon. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake used to fight for on the Floor. All I want to say in short is, please do not become the very thing you have opposed so far, and we are not asking for any favours as such, but we are just asking for equity.

Thank you.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, I recall a debate at the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce. The Hon. Harshana Suriyapperuma and others participated with me. That was about two weeks before the Presidential Election. He, referring to and waving the JVP/NPP policy document said, We will do our own DSA. We have almost completed it. The basis for discussion on the debt restructuring shall be our DSA. The verbatim of that debate is there and anybody can download it. , , these gentlemen are now denying it, saying that they never said it. I do not plan to waste my time on this anymore, but I say that it was pure deception. Our people fell for it and you all did it knowingly. That is my point, you all did it knowingly. So, you all did not change a single word in the Agreement that President Ranil Wickremesinghes Government had almost agreed on. As I said, it is only up to the 12th of December for them to agree. Not only that, you never even sought to discuss debt restructuring based on your DSA or anybody elses DSA, as promised. 2024 3,275

Be that as it may. We will give you time; we will allow you to propose, in the 2025 Budget, your revolutionary plans to overhaul the economy. Since you say that we had been going completely on a wrong path,

It states, I quote:

When so-called senior members of parliament resort to fight and disruptions instead of engaging in meaningful political arguments, they tarnish the dignity of parliament. This supreme political space, meant to symbolize democracy and aspirations of the people, has long been dominated by a masculine ethos rooted in aggression and physical strength. While it is supposed to represent the working class and the diverse voices of the public, the Sri Lankan parliament often reflects the deep-seated systemic patriarchy that defines post-colonial Sri Lankan political culture.

Such scenes are not just embarrassing; they are a stark reminder of how power in this space continues to be wielded through force and intimidation rather than intellect or dialogue. They betray the trust of the people who look to parliament for leadership and justice, exposing a culture that prioritizes ego and dominance over the well-being of the public. It is a painful reflection of how much further we need to go to create a feminist, inclusive and egalitarian political culture.

opportunity till the 12th. As the Hon. Leader of the Opposition requested, bring it to Parliament, have a debate and take a vote on it. Then, we can go through the process after that. We can talk about what clauses we should let go, what we should agree on and whether we need to rethink the entire Agreement. Then, you also can vote.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Hon. Deputy Speaker, may I add something to this very important discussion? The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe brought that Agreement to Parliament. He did not really have to do it because previously, IMF Agreements were never voted for in Parliament. But, he did it to get commitment from the Legislature. It is true that you do not need Parliamentary approval to enter into this Agreement, but given the situation you are in, you can defend it by bringing it before Parliament and saying whatever you want to say about it; there is nothing wrong in doing that.

It is not just about promoting entrepreneurs; it is the concept of an entrepreneurial state. It is to say that the State should possess an entrepreneurial spirit in their system itself. It promotes creativity, the risk-taking ability and management of risks. That is the concept of an Entrepreneurial State. So, it is my duty to table it in all three languages and I expect you to, at least, be a little humble to study it because we have taken a lot of trouble to prepare it. Over the years, we have developed it. So, we would like you to look at it.

! ! Good evening! ,

Madam, this may be just the Vote on Account that we are debating and concluding in Parliament today, but in the eyes of many people, this is the hope of rebuilding the nation. The youth are hopeful; women are hopeful; the SME sector is hopeful; large businesses are hopeful; high-net-worth investors are hopeful and even foreign investors who are going to invest in this country are hopeful of that. But, Hon. Members, there is an even greater message encapsulated in this political victory.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees) Order, please!

.

, , .

Whereupon THE HON. DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and THE HON. SPEAKER took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Harshana Suriyapperuma) Hon. Speaker, I was mentioning that there is a greater message encapsulated in this political victory. That is, the people in the North are hopeful; the people in the East are hopeful; the people in the South are hopeful, the people in the estate sector are hopeful, the people who are trying to migrate from Sri Lanka are hopeful, the Sri Lankans living abroad, for the first time, are hopeful and most importantly, the law-abiding citizens of this nation are hopeful that as one nation, as Sri Lankans, we are going to rise once again and take this country to the next level bringing back the dignity we have lost.

159 , , , , Sir, the approach we are taking is based on zero tolerance for corruption, with transparency and accountability in governance as the cornerstone in this process. This is a journey and to this journey, we will provide political leadership. We have the political will to take this country forward and put an end to the menace of corruption in this country. But, we need to do it together; we need to join government institutions, large enterprises, the SME sector and work together with the citizens.

, , , , Vote on Account - foundation - - new chapter - , In this journey, we want to connect Sri Lanka to the global economy; we want to connect the next generation to global opportunities. We want to create that through a digital platform and by converting our economy into a digital economy and connecting it with the global digital economy. , we have started strong, we have shown a steady progress so far and we are determined to move forward towards our final goalpost. ,
