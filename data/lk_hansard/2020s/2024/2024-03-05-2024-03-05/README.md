911 912

are in English. I am wondering whether the Committee on Public Finance has been misled. I have received these two letters which are dated 06th and 11th December, 2023 and are addressed to the Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies by Sanjay Rajaratnam, Presidents Counsel, Attorney-General. They refer to the specific Amendments regarding these two Bills. The first letter with the subject title "Act to Amend the Value Added Tax Act" states, I quote:

I write with reference to the Legal Draftsmans letter dated 30th November, 2023 addressed to you, with a copy to me, enclosing the final draft of the above Bill.

I have considered the draft Bill and have to advise you that the provisions of the draft Bill are not inconsistent with the Constitution. The Bill is not subject to any prohibition or restriction imposed by the 13th Amendment to the Constitution and may be enacted by Parliament. Also, I have exactly a similar letter with the subject title The Social Security Contribution Levy (Amendment) Act. If there is a controversy here as to whether the Legal Draftsman and the Attorney-General have approved them or not, then, this is a breach of Privilege of the Committee because the Committee was provided with these two letters. We, in good faith, accepted these two letters as being cleared by the Attorney-Generals Department. If that is not the case, please be advised that that is a total violation of the Privileges of our Committee. Therefore, it should be immediately looked into.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you. Let the Hon. Minister of Finance look into that. . [ ] ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) . , , approve . approve , , - ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Susil Premajayantha, Attorney-at-Law) Approve . Clarification , .

[1.49 p.m.]

( () - ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Suren Raghavan - State Minister of Higher Education) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I thank you for giving me this opportunity to participate in and contribute to the ongoing Debate on economic recovery of this land, which you and I call our motherland. An unprecedented situation arose two to three years ago. Experts on world economy from no other place than the Johns Hopkins University predicted that Sri Lanka would be a Sudan, that this blessed land would be another killing field with bloodbath because, according to their calculations, we would become a failed State.

But, as the history has repeated again and again, with resilience and innocent faith, the people of this country, irrespective of whether they are from the Northern, the Eastern, the Southern, the Central or the Western Province, have come together during times of crises and have worked as one family with expectation and hope for their children and their childrens children.

1005 1006

[ ( . ]

2024 05

Very correctly, in this Parliament, we elected a leader who would give leadership with a forward-looking vision for economic recovery. Today, the value of the rupee against the dollar is one single indicator that - anybody, even a grade eight student, can understand - shows Sri Lanka is on the path of recovery. Of course, we are still not out of the dark. If anybody claims to say that everything in Sri Lanka is well and good, that everything is okay, I think he is still miscalculating the situation or maybe, in the dark. Therefore, at this juncture, it is so important for us to relook at some of the traditional ways of handling the economy and business.

A few minutes ago, I attended the Meeting of the Committee on Public Finance, for which we had invited the Governor of the Central Bank and his Board to give us explanation as to how they ended up increasing salaries of all the employees except for the Governor by an average of 80 per cent of the present salary. That is something that the ordinary people of this country also want to know. We asked them, How did you do that? The premise of the Governor, whom I really respect, and the Members of the Monetary Board, who are professionals, was that they had a bargaining Collective Agreement from the year 2000 onwards. But, my analysis is, we cannot run this economy as we ran it before the crisis any further. If from COVID-19, we have not learnt anything, if from the economic crisis, we have not learnt anything, we are a failed civilization that has failed to learn anything. Therefore, we need to understand the new dimensions, the new normal and how business could be done in a small, struggling but a hopeful and promising economy like Sri Lanka.

I thank the Hon. President as Finance Minister and the two State Ministers of Finance, the Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya and the Hon. Shehan Semasinghe, who are also concerned about economic affairs for presenting these Bills at a very appropriate time.

Sir - you come from a business family and you have some businesses of your own - as a citizen of this country, you understand the importance of the small and medium-sized enterprises in any economy. The World Bank says that 70 per cent of the economies of the developing countries run on small and medium-sized enterprises. The economies of developed countries like Japan, Germany, Sweden, Canada, to which our people are migrating, are also based on small and medium-sized enterprises. But, what did we do? Not only did the crisis hit those small and medium enterprises hard, but also our financial gurus, using the old tools, went after them and brought in the parate law, which further ruined the possibility of their existence. Therefore, we, as concerned citizens, appealed to the Hon. President and to the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms, the Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, and explained that situation. Sir, I will take just 30 seconds, since it is a moment of pride, to mention that my brother Suresh Raghavan, at national level, lobbied for this and campaigned. Sir, the parate law, at this time, is going to break our economy. Rather, we must endeavour to look after and protect our small and medium-scale businesses.

Sir, I do not come from a business family; neither am I a businessman nor an economist. But, as a student of political science, I understand that any countrys economy is interwoven with the political situation of that country. We cannot separate them; they are intrinsically interwoven. Therefore, if you want economic stability and political stability, those two have to go hand-in-hand, as it happens in any developed country. We have now established political stability. Some Hon. Members in the Opposition and some members of the civil society still hold the view and are propagating that this Government does not have legitimacy.

. , , , . . . . .

Sir, in this country, there were two banks that were directly connected to the SME sector. Those were the DFCC and the NDB. . , . .

They converted those development banks into commercial banks. Today, the NDB is called the NDB Bank - the National Development Bank Bank. That is a tragedy; that is a comedy.

Therefore, may I take this opportunity to suggest that in this country, we need a development finance fund. That fund should have at least US Dollars 1 billion so that any entrepreneur like you, Sir, or any other young person, particularly young people with innovative ideas and women with good training and creative ideas, could borrow money from that fund for investment in their businesses and in turn, could contribute to our economy. Worldwide, big corporations operate only 18 per cent of the world economy and it is the small businesses and enterprises which contribute to it mainly. Therefore, as a new economic order, I would suggest and appeal to the President, the Committee on Public Finance and the Central Bank that we create, as early as possible, a national SMME development fund for entrepreneurs and if possible, that fund should be open to every citizen who wants to do a business.

Then, let me talk about taxation. Everybody is talking about extreme taxes here, as if Sri Lanka is the country that taxes most, which is not the case. Sri Lanka, compared to other countries in world economic indices, is still a country having a lower rate of income tax and other taxes.

1007 1008

. , , ; nationally, we need transparency in the way we collect our taxes.

It is said that any living being will learn lessons as it go on living. , , . . , .

, . . . . , , , , . . 10 . 10 , . 80 , , . . Unless we have a radical change, a structural change with our public sector reforms, we cannot go forward as a nation.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up.

( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan) Therefore, may I kindly suggest to the Hon. Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, who has a complete, synchronized record of history about his services to this nation, that we immediately enter into a public sector reform programme, at least, by 2030. The productivity of Sri Lankas public sector has to be doubled, if this nation is to go forward, Sir. That is my third appeal.

Sir, I thank you for the time granted. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Next, the Hon. (Prof.) Charitha Herath. You have six minutes.

Before he starts, will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Jagath Samarawickrama to the Chair?

( ( ) - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana - Minister of Industries and Minister of Health) Sir, I propose that the Hon. Jagath Samarawickrama do now take the Chair.

. . Question put, and agreed to. .
