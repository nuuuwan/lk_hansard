ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION BILL: DETERMINATION OF

THE SUPREME COURT

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I wish to inform Parliament that I have received the Determination of the Supreme Court in respect of the Bill titled Economic Transformation, which was challenged in the Supreme Court in terms of Article 121(1) of the Constitution.

1471 1472

The Determination of the Supreme Court as to the constitutionality of the Bill concludes and upon careful consideration have suggested Amendments that will render the provisions of the Bill consonant with the Constitution as follows:

(1) Clause 8 of the Bill should be amended by deleting Article 4 contained therein, as Parliamentary supervision is adequately covered by Article 43 and 148.

(2) Clause 13 (b) requires to be deleted as the creation of an independent regulator could be established by an amending legislation.

(3) Clause 13 to be amended to empower the legal entity Economic Commission to purchase, hold and sell shares, stocks, debentures and similar assets.

(4) Clause 15 is inconsistent with the Constitution and can only be passed with a two-thirds majority and a Referendum. But if amendments recognizing the power of the President in regard to alienation or disposition of State land are passed in the manner and form as discussed by this Court, the provision can be passed with a simple majority.

(5) Clause 26 requires to be amended to prescribe the qualifications, experience and the terms and conditions of employment of the EC Director General through regulations for the purposes of clarity and transparency.

(6) Clause 45 to be amended to replace the term "investor" with "investment" for purposes of clarity, highlighting the importance of the term "investment" within the context therein.

(7) Clause 46 (5) should be amended to specify a timeframe for the Minister to refer to the Cabinet of Ministers any refusal, denial, or failure by a Specified Institution to respond to an inquiry or request under Subsections (2) or (4), thereby mitigating unnecessary delays.

(8) Clause 48 ((2) shall be revised to remove the requirement for consultation with the Secretary to the Department of Treasury regarding the appointment of members to the Invest Sri Lanka Board.

(9) Clause 55 (2) (b) to be amended to remove all references to the repealed law in the aforementioned Clause.

(10) Clause 57 to be amended to include a requirement

that every Order made under this Section to be laid before Parliament for approval within three months of its issuance.

(11) Clause 64(d), granting Zones SL the power to

acquire properties for establishing investment zones, is to be deleted. This Amendment reflects that Zones SL's authority is limited to recommending lands required for investment zones to the Economic Commission and does not extend to land acquisition.

(12) Clause 75 to be revised to specify that the

qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of employment for the Chief Executive Officer of Zones SL shall be prescribed by regulations. This provision aims to ensure the appointment of individuals with adequate qualifications and experience, thereby preventing appointment of unqualified individuals to higher positions such as Chief Executive Officer.

(13) Clause 90 (2) to be amended to extend the period

for Specified Institutions to provide written reasons for refusal or denial from fifteen days to twenty-one days, ensuring enhanced procedural fairness and transparency in the approval process.

(14) Clause 90 of the Bill to be amended to include a

new sub-clause stipulating that if a Specified Institution declines, denies or fails to respond to an inquiry or request, Zones SL must promptly notify the Minister. Within two weeks thereafter, the Minister shall escalate the matter to the Cabinet of Ministers for appropriate action. This Amendment is aimed at ensuring timely resolution and accountability in cases of denied information requests.

(15) Clause 94 (2) (5) of the Bill requires to be

amended to delete the words under the provisions of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka Law, No. 4 of 1978; because any terms and conditions relating to employment have not been laid down in the BOI Act.

(16) Clause 96 should be amended to require that every

Order issued under this Section be submitted to Parliament for approval within three months of its issuance. The Order shall only take effect upon Parliaments approval. The Amendment shall be incorporated to ensure consistency with other clauses of the Bill where Orders made under the Bill are referred to Parliament for its approval.

(17) Clause 147 to be amended to include that the

qualifications, experience and the terms and conditions of the Executive Director of the Productivity Commission to be prescribed by the regulations.

(18) Clause 175 is to be amended to specify that the

qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of the Director of the Institute of Economics and International Trade shall be prescribed by regulations.

(19) Clause 192 (1) and (2) are required to be removed

in their entirety.

(20) Clause 194(2)(m) to be amended to remove

references to the repealed law in consistency with the Amendment proposed at Clause 55. Furthermore, a proviso to be added, which states that the period that an employee served with the BOI shall be taken into consideration when calculating the statutory payments that are payable to such employee.

1473 1474

[ ]

2024 02

(21) Clause 194(2)(n) to be amended to incorporate

specific time periods in respect of the operation of the voluntary retirement scheme.

(22) Clause 195, the Interpretation Clause, to be

amended in respect of the placement of the acronym "BOI" and the interpretation of the word "Minister".

(23) Clause 196 to be amended to rectify the reference

to "any other written law" and it to be read as "In the event of any inconsistency between the Sinhala and Tamil texts of this Act, the Sinhala text shall prevail".

(24) Proviso to Clause 55(2)(b)(iv) has to be amended

by deleting the reference to the Board of Investment Sri Lanka Law, No.4 of 1978, as such a reference would not reflect the true position.

(25) Clause 55(2)(b)(v) has to be deleted to render the

rule-making power consistent with the Constitution.

Subject to the above, the Supreme Court is of the opinion that, if these necessary Amendments are made, the Bill and its provisions will become consistent with the Constitution and could be passed with a simple majority.

I order that the Determination of the Supreme Court be printed in the Official Report of today's Proceedings of the House.

PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT BILL: DETERMINATION

OF THE SUPREME COURT

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I wish to inform Parliament that I have received the Determination of the Supreme Court in respect of the Bill titled "Public Financial Management", which was challenged in the Supreme Court in terms of Article 121(1) of the Constitution.

In the said Determination, the Supreme Court has summarized the Constitutionality of the Bill as follows:

(1) Clause 3(2)(b)(iv) and the definition of "members of the judicial service" are inconsistent with Article 4(c) read with Article 3, Article 12(1) and Article 108 and shall only be passed by the special majority of Parliament and be approved by the people at a Referendum. Such inconsistency shall however cease, if the definition of "members of the judicial service" in Clause 71 is deleted and Clause 3(2)(b) is deleted and substituted with the new Subclause as set out in the Summary of the Determination of the Supreme Court.

(2) Clause 5(2) (f) is violative of Article 12(1), 43(1) and 52(2) and hence, Clause 5(2)(f) shall only be passed with the special majority of Parliament. The said inconsistency shall however cease, if Clause 5(2)(f) is amended as set out in the summary of the Determination of the Supreme Court.

(3) Clause 32(3) is violative of Article 3 and Article 12(1) of the Constitution and shall be passed by

1513 1514

2024 02

the special majority of Parliament and shall be approved by the people at a Referendum. The said inconsistency shall however cease, if Clause 32(3) is amended as set out in the Summary of the Determination of the Supreme Court.

(4) Clause 32(4) is inconsistent with Articles 3, 12(1), 148 and 156C of the Constitution and shall only be passed by the special majority of Parliament and be approved by the people at a Referendum. The said inconsistency shall however cease, if Clause 32(4) is amended as set out in the Summary of the Determination of the Supreme Court.

(5) Clause 34(2) is violative of Article 149 of the Constitution and shall only be passed with the special majority of Parliament. The said inconsistency shall however cease, if Clause 34(2) is amended as set out in the Summary of the Determination of the Supreme Court.

(6) Clause 38(3) is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 12(1) and 148 of the Constitution and shall only be passed with the special majority of Parliament.

(7) Clause 39(1) is inconsistent with Article 12(1) and shall only be passed by the special majority of Parliament. The said inconsistency shall however cease, if Clause 39(1) is amended as set out in the Summary of the Determination of the Supreme Court.

Clause 63 is inconsistent with Article 4(c) read with Article 3, Article 12(1), Article 55(1), Article 55(3), Article 108, Article 111(H)(1)(b), Article 148, Article 153C, Article 155G(1) and Article 156F of the Constitution and shall be passed by the special majority of Parliament and shall be approved by the people at a Referendum. The said inconsistency shall however cease, if Clause 63(2) is amended as set out in the Summary of the Determination of the Supreme Court.

Clause 68 is inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution and shall only be passed with the special majority of Parliament. The said inconsistency shall however cease, if Clause 68(1) is amended as set out in the Summary of the Determination of the Supreme Court.

(10) Clause 69 is violative of Article 4(a) read together

with Article 3 and 76 and hence, needs to be approved by the special majority of Parliament and by the people at a Referendum.

The definition of "State Owned Enterprise" is

inconsistent with Article 12(1) and Article 148 of the Constitution and shall only be passed with the special majority of Parliament. Such inconsistency shall however cease, if the said definition is amended as set out in the Summary of the Determination of the Supreme Court.

I order that the Determination of the Supreme Court be printed in the Official Report of todays proceedings of the House.

Hon. Speaker, I would also like to say a few words in English. I will not go over what I have said, but will talk of what we have to do in the future.

The efforts taken to restructure our debt provide Sri Lanka with the necessary breathing space to transform the economy into a resilient and stable economy. That could manage the lighter burden of debt service in the future. This breathing space should not be wasted. In the past, Sri Lankas economic growth was dominated by the non-tradable sector. During this period, particularly the post-war period, the economy expanded, but the tax revenue and exports, as a share of GDP, declined and the capacity to service debt continued to diminish. To reverse the trend, we must transform Sri Lanka into an economy where growth is driven by non-debt creating foreign exchange inflows. Export of goods, export of services and foreign direct investment must be the leading drivers of growth in the economy. Parallely, the fiscal and monetary reforms, reforms to State-owned enterprises and other reforms must continue to ensure that fiscal and external buzzers remain robust. A combination of strong revenues and robust foreign exchange balances are critical to ensure that Sri Lanka has a capacity to service the debt.

The Economic Transformation Bill embodies all of these critical factors. It provides the institutional framework to support the growth of exports and FDI in the economy. The Bill also provides the macroeconomic targets which will enable continued economic stability and sustainable, inclusive economic growth. Purposeful implementation of measures incorporated in the Economic Transformation Bill will create the required economic conditions that enable Sri Lanka to truly benefit from relief created by restructuring of debt. But, a failure to do so would mean that we would swiftly fall back into

1547 1548

trouble. The breathing space provided by debt restructuring will go on for two years.

What Sri Lanka requires now is a high-growth trajectory of 7 per cent GDP per annum. It may be high by Sri Lankan standards. We have stayed at a growth rate of 4 per cent or 5 per cent GDP, but Vietnam and some other countries have showed that you can go up to 7 per cent. If we maintain a 7 per cent growth for two decades, our GDP would grow from about US Dollars 85 billion to about US Dollars 350 billion, by four times. Are we always going to stay poor? Is our policy to stay poor? Should we not have policies which would make us, not us, the future generation, rich? In two decades, we would not be here, but the future generation would. We have to make them rich. So, that is certainly what we should follow and I ask this House and all political parties to get into high-growth policies and let us compete with each other on that. We cannot go on with a slow growth; we cannot go on this journey any further.

Therefore, while today is a major landmark and a cause for celebration, by no means, does it allow us to be complacent as a nation. The successful conclusion of the official debt restructuring should give us the confidence and encouragement to move forward on this path of economic recovery, towards the goal of a prosperous, inclusive and sustainable economy, a high-growth economy with a minimum of 7 per cent growth per year.

Sir, I am sorry that when I am making this Statement, one of my Colleagues or the only Colleague who came to Parliament with me, the Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan, is no longer here with us. He passed away on Sunday. He and I have worked together through difficult times and I know the contribution he had made. One thing, I must say. Though he was in the TULF and the TNA, he steadfastly stood for the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. He asked me, Do you think, Ranil, that I will divide the country? As a small boy, I went to see the Independence in 1948. None of us has seen that. We, most of us, were not even born then. Anyway, he had his own views on how power should be shared. There is no reason to fight over that, but I think he had done a sufficient amount of work, that we have only a little more to finish and the best contribution we could make for him is to finish that work on devolution and decentralization.

Thank you. ( - ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa - Leader of the Opposition)

I would like to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt sympathies and condolences regarding the sudden demise of the Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan, who was vocal about unity and protecting Sri Lankas territorial integrity. He was always championing the course of national reconciliation, amity, comity and good relations between ethnic groups, religious groups and people of all denominations in our country. I would also like to take this opportunity to express that the Hon. Sampanthans demise is a great loss for the country and for national reconciliation. He was always a progressive national leader. While speaking on behalf of the people he represented, he spoke of championing the course of Sri Lankanism. He was never a caste-oriented, creed-oriented, religion-oriented or ethnic-oriented politician.

Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to, once again, express our deepest sorrow and sympathies to everyone in the Sampanthan family and we all commemorate his laudable services to our motherland.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Speaker, on behalf of the Tamil National Alliance, I would like to express my gratitude to the Hon. President and the Hon. Leader of the Opposition for their sentiments with regard to the late Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan. The Hon. President was pleased to remark that the Hon. Sampanthan and he entered Parliament in 1977 together. He had repeatedly said that during the Hon. Sampanthans lifetime, the Tamil national question should be resolved. Unfortunately, the Hon. Sampanthan has now passed away and I wish to appeal to the President and the Government that before the Presidents term ends in October this year, that issue must be resolved to the satisfaction of all the people of this country.

Thank you.
