I would say that medical colleges must not be the ultimate profit-making institutes. I think what happened with the SAITM project was that; they were thinking of it as a project for ultimate profit-making. If you fall into that category, then, of course, there would be a fundamental contradiction between providing education at medical faculties and profit-making. So, to whoever who comes to set up a medical college, I would say, Please make sure that you

are not here to have making an ultimate profit as your target, which would undermine our purpose and be counterproductive of what we are trying to do.

Hon. Minister, I thank you and congratulate you for bringing in these Amendments. I hope that, today, these Amendments would be approved and that Sri Lanka would be looked up to as a country producing doctors of international level through medical pedagogical systems of absolutely high standards, who would go out and heal the humanity as Buddhists and Sri Lankans.

I thank you, Sir. . .
