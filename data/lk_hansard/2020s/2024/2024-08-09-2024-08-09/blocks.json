Initially, his principles were based on the command economic model, where the State had a primary role in the economic management process. However, with time, he identified the major fallacies, weaknesses and shortcomings of that extreme socialist model and over time, he persuaded himself that the way forward is a free-market economic system. So, under His Excellency President J.R. Jayewardene, he pioneered the economic revolution, the movement from a closed economy to an open economy. Sri Lanka was restricted and constrained through regulations and bureaucratic control and the whole country was in a stranglehold because of the statist system that was in existence. But, the late Hon. Ronnie de Mel managed to eradicate all those obstacles and to free up the system to ensure that through a free-market system, Sri Lanka would be able to create wealth.",

And, he was also one of the authors of the agricultural plan in 1957. He was distinguished as a scholar chosen to Oxford in 1942, becoming first in the London Matriculation Examination. Then, he was awarded a scholarship to Cambridge for becoming first in Degree Examination in 1947. So, such a towering intellectual personality adorned this House.",

I think it is because of the current political situation with the Presidential Election on and it is unfortunate. Though the Leader of the Opposition, being a presidential candidate, found time to come and say a few words about the Hon. Ronnie de Mel, I am sorry to see that the Hon. President himself, who had been a colleague of the Hon. de Mel in Parliament for several years, had not found time to do so. I do not want to delve into personal matters, but I would like to record my regret that he had not come and it would have been a little appropriate and fitting for him to have done that.

It is legendary today that a colourful person of his calibre had had such a chequered political history because of the type of politics in this country. He was a Parliamentarian representing the Sri Lanka Freedom Party originally, but who was overlooked for office for many long years, which left him quite frustrated, I assume. Finally, it was the late Hon. J. R. Jayewardene who saw the potential in the man and gave him the all-important ministry, the Ministry of Finance.",

Today, as we speak about the Hon. Ronnie de Mel, we also remember the late Hon. (Mrs.) Mallika de Mel, who was also a Member of Parliament. One reason why I decided that I should speak today is this. As a young banker, at that stage, I was working for an international bank, which had a foreigner as the Head. During the Budget Speech, they send invitations to all the CEOs of the banks to come to Parliament. But our bank's CEO, for some unexplained reason, came to me, gave me the invitation and asked me to go to Parliament for the Budget Speech. So, I came here as a young banker and sat through the whole Speech. That was in mid-1980s and the Hon. de Mel would start off his Budget Speech with a long explanation, a very long explanation, of the economy and after the markets closed, he would then go for the Budget Proposals. I used to sit there in wonder and listen to him because he gave such an interesting, analytical explanation of the economy and later also, I attended a few of those Speeches and watched the Hon. de Mel from the Gallery of Parliament.",

After the Hon. de Mel got his university degree, we heard that he entered the Cambridge University. Then, he was also in the Civil Service. I would not go through all those situations and disruptions in his career. He joined the Civil Service, served there for a long period before he resigned, joined the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and decided to contest the elections.

Ronnie de Mels life. He resigned from the Civil Service in 1964, joined the SLFP and contested the General Election in 1965 for the first time and at the next election, he got elected and came to Parliament. Then, of course, in 1977, the Hon. Ronnie de Mel switched sides and joined the United National Party. The point I would like to make here is, it was not so much party loyalty that he was concerned about, but he was philosophical. We heard that he started as a young person from a very left-leaning background and then, moved on as a pragmatist, considering what actually could be done and what should be done and later, joined the United National Party. Along with its leader, he championed the cause that the economy of the country should be opened. The younger people would never know the situation prevalent at that time. If we went in a car - I was a small \"batta\" then - the car was stopped by the police to see whether we were transporting rice. Rice is what we eat every day. But, that was what the",
