Hon. Speaker, I consider the late Hon. Ronnie de Mel as a pre-eminent personality, a politician who was multifaceted, possessing a plethora of capabilities, a man who was dedicated to serve the people and as a peoples personality, whose sole objective was to formulate positive, productive policies for the benefit of the country and the people.

He possessed an enormous amount of knowledge, was a reservoir of experience and his knowledge and abilities played an indispensable role in bringing Sri Lanka out from a closed economy to an open economy. Initially, his principles were based on the command economic model, where the State had a primary role in the economic management process. However, with time, he identified the major fallacies, weaknesses and shortcomings of that extreme socialist model and over time, he persuaded himself that the way forward is a free-market economic system. So, under His Excellency President J.R. Jayewardene, he pioneered the economic revolution, the movement from a closed economy to an open economy. Sri Lanka was restricted and constrained through regulations and bureaucratic control and the whole country was in a stranglehold because of the statist system that was in existence. But, the late Hon. Ronnie de Mel managed to eradicate all those obstacles and to free up the system to ensure that through a free-market system, Sri Lanka would be able to create wealth.

He presented, on a record number of times, the Budgetary Proposals. On the day of the Budget, I distinctly remember even though I was not in politics, the whole country, virtually everyone without exception, was eagerly awaiting to hear the Hon. Ronnie de Mels Budget Speech because his Budgets were sound, articulate, coherent and were full of positive policy proposals and policy substance. He was a man who adopted a rational approach to economic decision-making. However, with time, he perceived that free-marketism alone would not be able to achieve the national objectives, the national targets.

More and more, he saw the divergencies, the disparities that would be created because of unbridled free-marketism. So, he converted himself to be a social democrat. He believed that although the free-market system is very important to create wealth and income, when it comes to redistributive aspects, a capitalist system is not the most appropriate thing. You need

395 396

[ ]

2024 09

humanitarianism; you need pro-people thinking, pro-poor thinking. Therefore, he inculcated the social-democratic ideas into the free-market system and ultimately, he believed in the middle path, the social-democratic path.

. - .

Sir, at this moment, I would like to express my deepest sorrow, condolences and sympathies to all the members of the family of the Hon. Ronnie De Mel and to all those who worked with him. .

Hon. Deputy Speaker, I would like to pay our tribute to a quintessential political figure that this country has produced, who was also a towering intellectual. Particularly when you look at his profile, what comes to our mind is that he had quit the Ceylon Civil Service - the then Civil Service was unlike the present civil service and was of such good quality - had entered Parliament in 1967, led Sri Lankan delegations to Finance Ministers' conferences, aid group meetings, 20 World Bank and IMF meetings, several economic trade investment promotion meetings and umpteen number of bilateral meetings with several countries. And, he was also one of the authors of the agricultural plan in 1957. He was distinguished as a scholar chosen to Oxford in 1942, becoming first in the London Matriculation Examination. Then, he was awarded a scholarship to Cambridge for becoming first in Degree Examination in 1947. So, such a towering intellectual personality adorned this House.

Sir, I am sorry to see that the Government benches are all empty. To a certain extent, even the Opposition benches are nearly empty. I believe there is only one more speaker from the Government benches and perhaps, the Hon. Minister Nalin Fernando is waiting there to speak after me. I think it is because of the current political situation with the Presidential Election on and it is unfortunate. Though the Leader of the Opposition, being a presidential candidate, found time to come and say a few words about the Hon. Ronnie de Mel, I am sorry to see that the Hon. President himself, who had been a colleague of the Hon. de Mel in Parliament for several years, had not found time to do so. I do not want to delve into personal matters, but I would like to record my regret that he had not come and it would have been a little appropriate and fitting for him to have done that. We were also waiting to listen to what the Hon. President would have had to say about such a towering figure, under whose tutelage he also learned a lot about economic fundamentals.

Having said that, Sir, I want to quote the Hon. Ronnie de Mel at length from Hansard. In his colourful political career, he had had various ups and downs. There had been a variety of accusations thrown at him. It is legendary today that a colourful person of his calibre had had such a chequered political history because of the type of politics in this country. He was a Parliamentarian representing the Sri Lanka Freedom Party originally, but who was overlooked for office for many long years, which left him quite frustrated, I assume. Finally, it was the late Hon. J. R. Jayewardene who saw the potential in the man and gave him the all-important ministry, the Ministry of Finance.

After a few years, with all his monumental efforts to introduce the new economic policies, the market-oriented system gradually being absorbed into the policy framework of the country, he was seen as an architect who developed the country to such an extent.

407 408

2024 09

But, unfortunately, from 1983 onwards, this country got engulfed by ethnic tension. On the one side, in the North, there was the LTTE's armed struggle against the armed forces of Sri Lanka and then by 1988, almost on the verge of a Presidential Election - the then President J.R. Jayewardene, since there was the two-term limit, obviously could not contest again - there were reports to say that he even tried to see whether he could extend his term beyond the two-term limit. That was the time when the Hon. Ronnie de Mel decided that he must allow his conscience to speak. Sir, I would like to quote particularly from his famous or infamous speech of 25th August, 1988 on his resignation from Parliament. He had many a good word for President J.R. Jayewardene and started off like this.

Sir, I have received many personal courtesies and kindnesses from His Excellency the President for the last 13 years, and I have no hesitation in stating here quite openly that I have had and will continue to have a great personal regard for him which will not diminish but will probably increase as a result of this parting of our ways in the political arena, and his possible retirement soon. If he retires, I can only wish him and that gracious lady, his wife, Mrs. J.R. Jayawardene, all the best in their retirement.

So, he prefaces his speech like that. Having served the President for so many years as his Finance Minister, he was quitting his party at the last moment. His long speech is mostly in Sinhala, but I will try to quote only the portions in English because they are very interesting and the salient points which I want to highlight are in those words spoken in English. He further states, I quote:

I have always felt, felt very strongly, almost passionately that elections were essential to the whole process."

"Clean elections, free and fair elections, as we have had from 1947 to 1977 and even the Presidential Elections are essential."

"Both Presidential Elections and Parliamentary General Elections should be held at the correct time."

"I have said these things, I have expressed these views loudly and clearly not to hurt anyone, but to defuse the present tension, to restore peace in our land and save our country and our people from complete and total ruin and destruction.

Sir, this was the time when the Devinuwara Electorate, the entire Matara, the entire South was engulfed in flames by the famous second uprising of the JVP; the JVP insurrection was at its peak and his speech reflects some of his ideas then.

When the whole atmosphere in this House and in this country was charged with tension. I have been in this House for 21 years and I have never seen it charged with tension as on that day when I made that speech just half an hour before all of us had to go to attend the funeral of Mr. Harsha Abeywardena.

Everybody knows who killed Harsha Abeywardena, the Secretary of the United National Party.

It is not that I loved anybody less. Sir, but that I loved my country more. I could not help saying what I said that day. It came straight from my heart because I thought I had to make that speech to save this country from total destruction and total ruin.

The Hon. Leader of the Opposition, a while ago, talked about some disagreements the Hon. Ronnie de Mel had had with the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa. It all stems from this scenario. The Hon. Ronnie de Mel goes on to say, I quote:

The only possible way to reduce this tension and solve the present problems in the North and the East also in the South and in every part of the country is elections-quick elections, free and fair elections.

This was the time when there was this talk of putting off elections, not having elections because of violence. Now, we are in a situation where even without violence, elections are put off. So, that was the situation in the past; several elections had been put off. Finally, now, we are on the verge of facing another election and I hope this President would not have another change of mind to try and look at the tricks that the then administration was trying. The Hon. Ronnie de Mel goes on, I quote:

"When you deprive them of the vote, you force them to throw bombs and resort to violence. When you ban political parties, you send them underground, you force them to resort to violence."

These are abject lessons. This is what has happened in Bangladesh today. Sheikh Hasina, the Prime Minister who had been ousted and chased away from the country, was somebody who had even delivered her country out of its economic mess! Bangladesh today has recorded the fastest economic growth in the region. Yet, she was chased away. Why? Because she was acting against democracy; she was imprisoning Opposition Members and she disregarded all norms of holding free and fair elections. At the last election in Bangladesh, only about 40 to 45 per cent voted; for the first time after many long years in this region, a voting percentage below 60 per cent took place in Bangladesh. So, such was the situation.

And here, I am quoting the words of the Hon. Ronnie de Mel spoken on the 25th of August, 1988 in this House.

There were powerful elements - and there still are powerful elements - within the Government and close to the Government, who believe in military power, and military power alone, who believe in the militarization of this country, who ultimately believe in a military dictatorship.

See the strong words. These are the strong words which brought about this kind of dissention.

I believe only in peace, in Parliamentary elections, in Presidential elections, in clean and peaceful elections which are conducted in a free and fair manner.

"I blame sections within the Government for the delay in the solution of the problems in the North and the East. It is not only the intransigence of the LTTE, it is sabotage from within the Government that has delayed the sending back of the Indian troops.

The most interesting part, Sir, comes towards the end. There, he says, I quote:

There comes a time, Sir, in the life of every man and politician when he must take the painful decision to be true to himself, true to his conscience, true to his country, true to his people, when he must rise above friends - all of them are my friends, my dear friends, and I hope that they will remain my dear friends. I thanked all of them

409 410

earlier in my speech - a time when we must rise above considerations of friendship, when we must be prepared to move away from our own relations, when we must rise above personal interest, when we must even rise above party and other petty sectarian difference above power, above personal and above self. There are times when a politician must have the courage to disagree and even part company with friends, with dear friends, in my case with friends with whom I have worked so closely and so well for 13 years. Believe me, Sir, for me it was a very painful decision. I thought about this for nearly eight months, both here and abroad. But I cannot sacrifice for party what was meant for the country as Edmund Burke once said, What was meant for mankind.

"Certain section of the press in Sri Lanka have been writing a great deal of highly imaginative and inaccurate accounts sometimes of my resignation and its aftermath. It is the privilege of the press to indulge in flights of fancy. They have hinted that I will take an international job. It is true that I have been offered several international jobs at a very high level salary, higher, perhaps, than any other Sri Lankan ever been offered. But I have turned them down. I will live and die right here in Sri Lanka serving the people of my country till my last breath."

These are the words of the late Hon. Ronnie de Mel.

"At this time of deep crisis in the history of our country, in this dark hour, I will stay in my motherland and fight with my last breath to bring about peace, national reconciliation and national consensus which this country needs above all things. I seek the help and co-operation of all the sensible and patriotic people in all parties. And also to all those who have no allegiance to any political party, all men and women of goodwill and sound understanding, particularly the Maha Sanga, leader of other religions, intellectuals, professionals, public servants..." and so on and so forth.

"I appeal to all these sections to help restore peace, security, law and order, democracy and human liberties in this land."

This was a time when all of those were in peril.

"Let us fight to the last drop of our blood for peace, above all for free and fair elections. In a situation like this, not a problem can be solved by just continuing with the state of emergency and emergency laws."

He was very critical about his own Government's Emergency laws.

"We must evolve a political solution for the problems in the North and the East and a political solution for the problems in the South. The army cannot suppress and keep down the youth of this country forever. I put my trust in the people and the people alone. I salute the power of the people, the victory of the people and the peoples' power. Thank you."

This is what the late Hon. Ronnie de Mel said in his last resignation speech.

What happened thereafter? Thereafter, we see from the records of Parliament that he rejoined his party again. I wanted to clarify this matter since the Leader of the Opposition did mention about certain disagreements and disenchantments between late Hon. Ronnie de Mel and his father, the late Hon. Ranasinghe Premadasa. Then, what does the late Hon. Ranasinghe Premadasa do after he becomes the President? In 1989, the United National Party appoints the Hon. Ronnie de Mel on the National List. Then, he was again allowed to contest in 1994 General Elections as a United National Party member. He was appointed Minister of Ports and Shipping of the late

Hon. Ranasinghe Premadasa's Cabinet. Then, he was appointed Minister of Economic and Industrial Development in the next Parliament. So, though there were differences, the late Hon. Ranasinghe Premadasa did respect his seniority and recognized his value to his team. He did accommodate him in his Cabinet and decorated him, despite all what happened just before the Presidential Election, where the late Hon. Ranasinghe Premadasa was a chosen candidate finally. And, I did mention yesterday at the Sugathadasa Stadium how the Hon. Ranasinghe Premadasa became the President. It was because of my late leader, the Hon. M. H. M. Ashraff. At the last moment, we left Mrs. Sirima Bandaranaike's DPA coalition over some disagreements and joined the late Hon. Ranasinghe Premadasa's campaign in an indirect way, through which we were able to make him win with a very slender margin. That was all history, but yet, the late Hon. Ronnie de Mel remained a good friend of my late leader, the Hon. M. H. M. Ashraff. Subsequently in his days in Parliament, the late Hon. M. H. M. Ashraff always sought the counsel of people of the calibre of the Hon. Ronnie de Mel when it came to matters of the economy and finance in this country.

We have really lost a true son of the soil. As a Thomian, I would say that Thomians always talk about their grit and determination and all those qualities - grit and determination - were quite apparent in the late Hon. Ronnie de Mel throughout his political career, as all Thomians proudly claim to possess.

Sir, having said those words and conveying my condolences to all the family members of the late Hon. Ronnie de Mel, I may now digress momentarily out of his Vote of Condolence. Because of its urgent importance, I would like to raise another issue. The Hon. Ronnie de Mel was thought to be the Minister who opened this country to the outside world. But, what has happened today? See the headline of the Daily Mirror newspaper of today. It states, SL Immigration handicapped in on-arrival visa processing. The article goes on to state, I quote:

Several attempts made to contact the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration were unsuccessful. Currently, the departments official website displays a notice about the suspension of the visa issuance system effective August 2 at 17:00 Sri Lanka Standard Time.

This is very unfortunate.

Then, Sir, I would like to table* for the consideration of the press and this House a letter written by the stakeholders of the tourism sector - the Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators, the Hotels Association of Sri Lanka, the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises in Tourism, the Sri Lanka Association of Professional Conference, Exhibition and Event Organizers, the Sri Lanka Tourism Alliance and the Ceylon Hotel School Graduate Association - to the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration.

It is a very harsh letter, accusing him of sabotaging the on-arrival visas being handled in the Airport despite the Supreme Court ordering him to immediately revert to the earlier system because there was fraud that was exposed by the applications we filed to the Supreme Court. Sir, I would now like to read some excerpts from that letter to show very specifically what it states.

...for the purpose of facilitating the immediate restoration of the status quo ante, you would have to facilitate the Mobitel ETA platform. It is common knowledge, and accordingly, we too are made to understand that Mobitel Ltd. stands ready and willing to immediately go live and to provide services as in the past through a very smooth transition.

Nevertheless, we understand that the back-end software provider, who provides the gateway i.e. Informatics, must wait or is awaiting expeditious instructions from you, in your capacity as the Controller of Immigration and Emigration, in order to facilitate the connectivity and activation of the Mobitel platform.

However, we understand, to our great concern, that you have most conspicuously failed to provide the relevant instructions, thereby precluding, because of your own deliberate action/inaction, the due implementation of the considered and formal interim order granted by the Honourable Supreme Court, which is the apex court of the country. In view of this very serious failure on your part, the irresistible inference that arises, regarding which we will be compelled to complain to the Supreme Court against you, is that you are deliberately contriving to frustrate, undermine and be contemptuous of the sanctity of the clear order/interim order of the Honourable Supreme Court.

You, Sir, as a public officer, as defined in Article 170 of the Constitution, are strictly enjoined by that very Constitution, and the doctrines of the rule of law and public trust and of the principle of equal protection of the law, to honourably abide by an order of the apex court, and that too especially, when you were represented by counsel, and you were heard, and the adverse decision taken against you by the Supreme Court was after a consideration of all arguments adduced by all counsel in the case. The tourism industry is receiving multiple complaints from foreign travellers and tour operators who prefer to receive efficient online visa authorization, rather than receiving a visa upon arrival, which is the only option presently available in the country.

The undue delay, directly occasioned by you, as well as certain other respondents, is resulting in tourism bookings being directed to other destinations, to the severe detriment of Sri Lanka, and the destruction of Sri Lankas legitimate need to solicit as many tourists as possible and to augment its foreign reserves.

What more to say, Sir? The Minister of Tourism and Lands has also been thrown out of Parliament with todays Supreme Court Judgment. That is the final impact of all the wrong things they have done.

This letter finally states, I quote:

Please be advised that we will have no qualms should you fail to act on this letter, and duly comply with the interim order of the Supreme Court, to report you to the Supreme Court for an appropriate order of court to be made against you, in addition to whatever other contempt proceedings that we may decide to institute against you.

All these stakeholders in the tourism sector had copied this letter to Mr. Parinda Ranasinghe, PC, the Hon. Attorney-General and also to the Chairman of the SLT-Mobitel (Pvt.) Limited.

It is a simple thing to migrate to the earlier platform provided by the SLT-Mobitel (Pvt.) Limited. I have shown and spoken at length about the massive visa fraud that has been committed in this country. It is about 100 times more than the Central Bank scam, I have said. I have proved it with details and statistics in this House. Having said all that, now, we find that the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration, despite the Interim Order by the Supreme Court, is deliberately sabotaging and preventing smooth travel arrangements for tourists to come to this country. Tourism is a foreign exchange-earning sector. We are going to lose all those earnings, if we continue in this disastrous fashion ignoring all court orders. The entire tourism industry is up in arms against this move and this is exactly what the Government is doing at this time. This is very unfortunate.

The late Hon. Ronnie de Mel must be turning in his grave at the extreme fraud this Government is committing and continuing to commit, defying court orders. This is a shame, Sir! Therefore, Sir, through you, I implore the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration - I have already read the letter sent to him by the stakeholders of the tourism industry - to revert back to the earlier system without delay and facilitate smooth travel arrangements for all tourists coming into the country.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Next, the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne.

[1.49 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, it is a privilege to say a few words about the life of the late Hon. Ronnie de Mel. Today, as we speak about the Hon. Ronnie de Mel, we also remember the late Hon. (Mrs.) Mallika de Mel, who was also a Member of Parliament. One reason why I decided that I should speak today is this. As a young banker, at that stage, I was working for an international bank, which had a foreigner as the Head. During the Budget Speech, they send invitations to all the CEOs of the banks to come to Parliament. But our bank's CEO, for some unexplained reason, came to me, gave me the invitation and asked me to go to Parliament for the Budget Speech. So, I came here as a young banker and sat through the whole Speech. That was in mid-1980s and the Hon. de Mel would start off his Budget Speech with a long explanation, a very long explanation, of the economy and after the markets closed, he would then go for the Budget Proposals. I used to sit there in wonder and listen to him because he gave such an interesting, analytical explanation of the economy and later also, I attended a few of those Speeches and watched the Hon. de Mel from the Gallery of Parliament.

In 1948, he went to university, graduated with a First Class (Honours) Degree from the University of Ceylon and then joined the Ceylon Civil Service. He actually got a First Class Degree in History.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Weerasumana Weerasinghe to the Chair?

( ) (The Hon. Gamini Lokuge) Sir, I propose that the Hon. Weerasumana Weerasinghe do now take the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Jayantha Ketagoda)

. Seconded.

, . . Question put, and agreed to.

Whereupon THE HON. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and THE HON. WEERASUMANA WEERASINGHE took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Presiding Member, though he got a First Class Degree in History, he was known around Sri Lanka and the world more as a person who knew economics and finance. I think it exemplifies the fact that, at that time, when you entered university and received education, the field of your education did not really matter, but what mattered was that you were prepared intellectually, analytically and made a thinker. That is why the Hon. Ronnie de Mel was able to really master the subject of economics and for 10 long years, present 11 Budgets in Parliament, becoming the longest serving Finance Minister of the country.

I might pay tribute to the Hon. J.R. Jayewardene, too, for two reasons. One is, he appointed somebody independent as the Finance Minister of the country and that is very important because the primary responsibility of the Finance Minister is to maintain the macroeconomic policy, control inflation, the interest rates and exchange rates, creating stability and the environment so that the economy could grow. Then the other reason is, not interfering in every detailed matter handled by the Finance Minister of the country.

The Hon. Ronnie de Mel was really an example we had. His life also reminds me of three principles, which I think are ideal to be had by public representatives. One is, they need to be ethical; that is my first "E". The second is, they need to be people with experience and thirdly, they should have education. Also, experience is very critical. After the Hon. de Mel got his university degree, we heard that he entered the Cambridge University. Then, he was also in the Civil Service. I would not go through all those situations and disruptions in his career. He joined the Civil Service, served there for a long period before he resigned, joined the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and decided to contest the elections. That experience stood him in good stead when he actually entered Parliament and became a Minister.

So, ethics, absolutely important, experience, which does not need to be told about and I cannot even explain how important it is and of course his education, exemplify the Hon. Ronnie de Mels life. He resigned from the Civil Service in 1964, joined the SLFP and contested the General Election in 1965 for the first time and at the next election, he got elected and came to Parliament. Then, of course, in 1977, the Hon. Ronnie de Mel switched sides and joined the United National Party. The point I would like to make here is, it was not so much party loyalty that he was concerned about, but he was philosophical. We heard that he started as a young person from a very left-leaning background and then, moved on as a pragmatist, considering what actually could be done and what should be done and later, joined the United National Party. Along with its leader, he championed the cause that the economy of the country should be opened. The younger people would never know the situation prevalent at that time. If we went in a car - I was a small "batta" then - the car was stopped by the police to see whether we were transporting rice. Rice is what we eat every day. But, that was what the

police checked for; that was the symbol of the closed economy. Then, when he came along with his party leader and said, We are going to open the economy, it was like a shock treatment to the economy of the country. But, we know that history is history. It shows how Sri Lanka progressed, protectionism was attacked and then, how Sri Lanka was integrated with the rest of the world. Long before the Internet came about, those people integrated Sri Lanka with the rest of the world. The Internet generation should know that and as we look back, we realized that that is their legacy.

The Hon. Ronnnie de Mel was not just theoretical, but very practical in his approach. You need to be able to understand the circumstances in which you are operating, practically put forward the ways and means which would really help the country move forward and say how the country should be modernized and globalized. Sir, I will not say more than that, but would like to pay tribute to him at this time and just very briefly say this also.
