Then, Sir, I would just like to raise one last matter. That is regarding the right to ownership of land of the estate community. Since I do not have much time, I would just like to make it short and very clear. I would like to inform all the Hon. Members of this House that we keep comparing ourselves, who had been brought down to Sri Lanka, with the other Indians who had also been taken 200 years ago from Tamil Nadu and Kerala to Malaysia, Mauritius and the Seychelles. They all have been integrated into those societies. But, how come in Sri Lanka alone, they are ostracized? It is simply because the country is not ready to include them in social dialogue and whether we like it or not, those are the things that must be explored. All those countries have given them equal standing; it was not equality, but equity that had been granted. We also need to pursue equitable justice and that is what is required. That is why I urge all the Hon. Members of this House to support us in our bid to get land ownership for this community. I would just would like to say that all other countries which we keep comparing ourselves to, have understood that social progression will lead to economic progression.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, please wind up now.

309 310

[ [ [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Jeevan Thondaman) Okay, Sir.

Apart from that, there is another matter which needs to be brought to light as well. Well, it is not a handout or a charity that we are asking for. That is what this community has owned after 200 years of oppression and historical injustices.

Sir, I would like to end my speech by saying that actually when land rights are given to this community, you will notice economic upliftment because that is what social inclusion of this community would lead to.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . . [ 8 .

[3.49 p.m.]

. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) I thank the Hon. Presiding Member for giving me this opportunity to participate in this Debate on the Hon. Presidents Address made on 07th February, 2024.

Sir, the Presidents Address the other day listed how he and his Government have succeeded in pulling this country out of a dangerous economic situation and went on to state what the Government intends doing in the future. The Speech was, more or less, directed to the voters of this country, presumably keeping the coming Presidential Election in view. Of course, such speeches, sometimes, do camouflage the real intention of the Government and its President, who may want to stage

another Referendum to extend the life of the present Parliament, by-passing the holding of the Presidential Election, the Parliamentary Elections, the Provincial Council Election and the Local Government Election. There is so much speculation that the uncertainty of the present times could lead to a hung Parliament, if Parliamentary Elections are held and this might prompt the powers that be to avoid such elections and go for a Referendum, like how former President J.R. Jayewardene did. The economic situation might come in handy while searching for the reasons that could promote the holding of a Referendum.

Sir, there are a few matters that I wish to bring to the notice of the Hon. Members of this Assembly, which fall out from the Presidents Speech and which need your earnest attention. Firstly, the Hon. President has called upon the people to unite in the pursuit of our nation-building dream. Which nation does he refer to? Maybe the Sinhala nation only. What about the Tamil nation who have occupied the North and the East of this Island for over 3,000 years and still remain the majority in those areas? Shaking hands is possible, if both parties are firmly on terra firma as equals. A person standing at the bottom of the well cannot shake hands with those who are standing outside the well. He or she must be brought up from the bottom of the well to shake hands with those standing on terra firma. Thus, there is an urgent need, on the part of the President, to revitalize the forgotten people of the North and the East.

After the war, there is a tendency on the part of the powers that be to treat the North and the East as occupied subservient territories. That is why two-thirds of the military are stationed in the North and the East even 15 years after the war; that is why the livelihoods of the local people, both on land and sea, are being usurped by the armed forces steadily, leaving the offspring of the Northern and the Eastern soil in penury; that is why Buddhist places of worship are coming up in areas where no Buddhists live now and that is why Hindu places of worship are being destroyed with the help of the armed forces and Buddhist places of worship are being built on those sites despite court orders prohibiting such actions.

The Hon. President has avoided speaking about the North and the East and its political problems, which remain unresolved. There is a tendency among Sinhala leaders to believe that the problems of the Tamil-speaking people were over with the end of the war. After treating the war as an insurrection by the Tamil youth, by continuing to pay all government servants in the North and the East during that time their monthly salaries and other dues, it is wrong for the Government to presume that the conflict was a total war between the Sinhalese and the Tamils. The political problems of the Tamils remain the same as before the start of the war and even after the end of the war. If the Government intends washing off its hands with regard to the Tamils of the North and the East, it must say so. We, Tamils, could work out some other device to help our suffering people. After all, the geopolitics of the times have placed before us many options.

331 332

The Government at that time refused to open up a Chief Ministers Fund in the Northern Province when I was Chief Minister there, while certain other provinces were allowed to. If the ethnocratic Centre feels that the Government of the country is of the Sinhalese, by the Sinhalese and for the Sinhalese, it must declare it to be so. Paying lip service to democratic ideals and peace would not do. The President has failed by not identifying the sufferings of the peoples of the North and the East and mentioning reliefs to those suffering masses.

Our sufferings are peculiar to our areas. We do not have rivers in our terrain, only tanks and wells. Therefore, saving drinking water is a priority which needs to be attended to. During heavy rains, proper drainage of rainwater should have received the earnest attention of the Government. Our famers have suffered because of the heavy rains and lack of proper drainage facilities. Our roads need immediate attention after the heavy rains. The farmers, whose crops got destroyed due to the heavy rains, are in dire straits. Immediate action by the Government is solicited in regard to these.

Secondly, the Presidents Address lacks empathy towards our people and their suffering. It is, more or less, a technological outpouring with statistics interspersed. After all, the people suffer today consequent to the wrong policies followed and the wrong decisions made by politicians in the past; they suffer today due to the huge loans taken for the personal glorification of politicians; they suffer today due to the prosecution of the war on borrowed money and they suffer today due to corruption and mismanagement of our finances. Is the President only interested in covering up the wrongdoers and the wrongdoings?

Thirdly, I would like to place before the Hon. Members a matter that needs urgent attention by the President and others. The Hon. President, in page 7 of the English version of his Policy Statement, states thus, I quote:

We are launching a programme to double and triple the productivity in agricultural land in the dry zone over the next three to four seasons. Policy decisions have been made

And, so it goes on.

Then, I would like to point out that there is an intrinsic link between agriculture, in particular in Sri Lankas dry zone rice cultivation, and health epidemics. There is an unexpected increase in the number of disease cases in a specific geographical area. Here, the area is the dry zone of Sri Lanka. The root cause of the epidemics has been found to be toxicants such as arsenic, cadmium and lead found in fertilizers and also in weedicides and pesticides. The primary source of exposure to toxicants is the diet of our people, in particular rice, which is consumed at all meals. The countrys national agriculture is intrinsically

linked to the national health and the well-being through the diet. Diseases which have emerged due to the consuming of affected food are, inter alia, chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure, birth defects, thalassemia, cancer, low birth weight, anemia and malnutrition. Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder from parents to children through genes, where the body does not make enough haemoglobin, an important part of red blood cells. In these circumstances, it is necessary not only to highlight the catastrophe that the Sri Lankan people are faced with, but also understand how Sri Lanka arrived at this predicament and learn lessons to address the multifaceted crisis.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over.

. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Give me just one more minute, Sir.

In Jaffna, we are giving priority to the making of organic fertilizers such as compost manure, sea weed, fertilizers from kitchen, fish meal, wood ash, liquid organic fertilizers, earthworm castings and others. We cannot immediately stop the importation of chemical fertilizers as done some time ago. But, as we progress along in our manufacture of organic fertilizers progressively, we could reduce and finally do away with the inorganic chemical fertilizers. Let me commit this matter to the attention of the Hon. President and the officials of the relevant departments. In this connection, I am beholden to Dr. Kamal Gammanpila who educated me with regard to the serious effect our fertilizers, weedicides and pesticides are having on the diet of our people.

Let me conclude my speech, calling upon the President to empathize with the suffering masses and to adequately cushion the low-income families from the sudden increase in prices of essential foodstuffs.

Let him also look into the problems of the Tamil-speaking people of the North and the East, who have been left to themselves after the war. It is high time that discussions are started among all communities as to why a confederal Constitution should not replace our present Unitary Constitution so that all communities could live in equality and peace. It is also high time that our people realize the need for a secular Constitution in this multi-ethnic, multilingual, multi-religious ambience. I thank you, Hon. Presiding Member.

[5.06 p.m]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) Hon. Presiding Member, I wish to convey my gratitude for the opportunity given to share my perspectives, concerns and suggestions regarding the Policy Statement delivered by our President, the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, at the inauguration of the Fifth Session of the Ninth Parliament of Sri Lanka on 07th February, 2024. I consider this opportunity a privilege to address this distinguished Assembly. Thank you, Sir.

Before commencing my remarks today, I believe it is fitting to commend the Hon. President Ranil Wickremesinghe for delivering an unparalleled and historically significant speech the day before yesterday.

357 358

[ [ []

7]74 ]9

The Presidents Address clearly demonstrated his leadership acumen and his dedication to steering our country towards development on the global stage.

Two years ago, Sri Lanka faced a severe economic crisis, casting doubt on the livelihoods of ordinary citizens. Many families struggled to meet their basic needs, as the prices of essential goods soared beyond affordability. Parents went to bed hungry after sacrificing whatever sustenance they had for their children.

During this time, Sri Lanka found itself isolated and labelled as economically insolvent by international financial institutions. Inflation surged, triggering an economic downturn which pushed many poor families to the brink of despair. However, within a span of less than two years, the President managed to reverse that dire situation. Our once troubled economy is now on the path to recovery, with numerous pressing issues being addressed to provide relief to those affected by the crisis.

Securing a loan from the International Monetary Fund - IMF- stands as one of the significant accomplishments of the President.

The tourism sector which had collapsed entirely is now rebounding and is poised to become a vital source of foreign exchange for the country. Investors from India, other neighbouring countries and from Europe are showing interest in investing in Sri Lanka. The credit for fostering such a conducive environment undoubtedly belongs to our esteemed President. It is doubtful that anyone other than President Ranil Wickremesinghe could have achieved such a remarkable progress. At the time of our President assuming office, Sri Lanka possessed minimal foreign reserves. Today, we have boosted an ample reserve. Comparing the current situation with that of 2021 and 2022, it reveals a stark contrast; the bankrupt economy has transformed into a thriving one.

Reflecting on the past, one could recall the lengthy queues for essential commodities and fuel as well as the complete collapse of the construction sector due to material shortages and exorbitant prices. As our economy emerges from bankruptcy, prudent fiscal management becomes imperative. Utilizing available resources for national advancement rather than squandering them on current expenses is paramount. The President has outlined numerous plans to elevate our country to the status of a developed nation on the global stage. Implementation of his proposals and recommendations will undoubtedly facilitate the achievement of this goal.

Repeated elections within a short timeframe are unsustainable for our country. The pre-election period disrupts governmental functions, leading to inefficiencies and waste of resources. Consolidating elections into a single parliamentary election as opposed to separate presidential and parliamentary contests would mitigate these challenges and reduce expenditure. The country cannot afford to have two elections within a period of six months. The moment the Presidential Election is called for, the Government machinery would not function properly, three months before and three months after the election. Then, the candidate who wins the Presidential

Election would dissolve Parliament immediately because he would think his party could win the election and form a government. Again, when the Parliamentary Election is announced, the same thing is going to happen as was during the Presidential Election, which means three months before and three months after the election, the State machinery would not function properly. So, again, an invaluable period of six months is going to be wasted without being used for the betterment of the country. In this way, one whole year would go to waste.

During that period, no investors would come to the country. When the Executive Presidency is abolished, we would have only one election. That is, the Parliamentary Election and less money would be spent on it.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) [ , [[. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) Give me one more minute, Sir.

The President says that the year 2024 would be a promising year and that in 2025, the country would set a remarkable progress economically. How can we achieve this goal if investors are not coming to our country? Investors would not come because the political situation of the country is questionable; they would not take any risk by investing here. The economy would crash and would go back to the state it was in when the President took office two years before, where we had major shortages of fuel, food and other basic items.

I strongly hold onto my position or stance that the existing presidential system must be abolished because Presidents, in the past, made arbitrary decisions without consulting Parliament or the Cabinet, which resulted in many tragedies that affected the country tremendously. After a Presidents retirement from office, the Government has to spend a huge amount of money for the maintenance of the luxury bungalow and the security given to him while paying him a monthly pension. Actually, with this system, nothing good is going to happen to the countrys economy other than wasting State funds which could be made use of for the countrys economic advancement.

We hope that our President would create a country where everyone belonging to every religion would be able to live in unison while protecting ones own ethnic identity.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) [ [[. [ .
