Lakshman Kiriella because, I am very sorry to say, he messed up the Debate in the morning also. We could have had a better Debate in Parliament, if they did not waste time here. Hon. Kiriella, the question I asked you was, how many points in the IMF Programme are included in this Bill? You did not know that. That is the point I raised in the morning. You have not read this Bill, first of all. You are talking nonsense! You know only to insult people. You are talking nonsense!

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, secondly, this Economic Transformation Bill should have had a much wider stakeholder discussion, a wider public dialogue. The Hon. President believed in the Harvard Kennedy Schools Growth Lab approach. The Growth Lab approach speaks about public participation. He spoke on behalf of public participation in 2023. But, how much opportunity was given to exporters, local entrepreneurs and investors to express their views about this Economic Transformation Bill? There was not sufficient public discussion. Therefore, there should be more public consultation before a Bill like this is brought into force.

Another issue is Chapter I of this Bill. As my Colleague, the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva, pointed out, Chapter I of this Bill is highly irrelevant because we do not need to specify selected economic targets, especially when they are mostly laid down by the IMF, which we may not agree on. It includes growth targets like gross financial needs, debt to GDP ratio et cetera. For example, look at the revenue to GDP target, regarding which it states that we should have 15 per cent by 2027. The Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, State Minister of Finance, says that the revenue to GDP target has already hit 13 per cent and that we may reach 15 per cent by the end of this year. But, the Bill states that we are hoping to achieve it by 2027. So, there itself, there is a discrepancy. Therefore, Chapter I is something that we cannot agree with.

Another thing which the Opposition opposes in this Bill is, the process of appointing directors or members to the five agencies in the Economic Transformation Bill. These appointments are made by the Minister at his discretion. This is just like the National Electricity Advisory Council - we opposed it - to which the Minister could appoint members without any checks and balances. These key appointments must go through the Constitutional Council, if there is to be any transparency and accountability. Therefore, there would be a lack of confidence among investors, if these appointments to the five key institutions proposed in this Bill are made by politicians. Take, for example, Invest Sri Lanka, which will be a public company. There are no key performance indicators for them at all. Without KPIs, these directors could be just lackeys of the Minister, who could do globetrotting without trying to achieve any targets at all. Therefore, we believe that the appointment of these key members, the directors, should go through the Constitutional Council and that there should be transparency and accountability in appointing those holding these positions.

Another issue is that the BoI unions, too, had many concerns and some of those concerns had been addressed by the Supreme Court Determination. However, the unions rightly point out a lack of a transitional provision in this Bill. There are 1,600 enterprises operating under the BoI, out of which only 280 enterprises are located inside the BoI Zones and the other enterprises are located outside. How are those enterprises located outside the BoI Zones going to be administered and what concessions would be given to them? And, by whom would the issues

of the other companies which have BoI approval and which do not work within those Zones be addressed? Is it the Economic Commission or the "Zones SL"? I think there is an Amendment proposed, which states that they will give a transitional provision of three months, but that is not cited in the Bill very clearly. Right now, there are already 133 projects pending BOI approval. How would you manage them? What is the transitional provision the Government has provided in this Bill to accommodate them.

Then, there is another issue. According to Clause 13.(b) in page 12 of the Economic Transformation Bill, the Economic Commission has regulatory oversight of the zones and the power to appoint a regulator. Likewise, "Zones SL" also has certain regulatory powers, but in the Supreme Court Determination, it has been decided to strike off Clause 13.(b) completely. That is, to take off the requirement of a regulator, to deny a regulator because the Attorney-General has given written submissions to delete Clause 13.(b). So, when you take that Clause out, that means there is a lack of a regulator in place. The "Zones SL" will manage private zones while the State manages the other zones. There has to be equal treatment to the private zones managed by "Zones SL" and the State zones; the facilities and the concessions given to investors in those investment zones must be equal. Therefore, a regulator is a must, if you need to attract foreign investment into the zones. So, we believe that there has to be an amendment to make sure that there is a proper regulator in place to ensure confidence among investors.

2048 400 8 4 2023 - - 42 4 42 2048 4 32 8 73 32 73

We propose that the Government relook at the Bill and

2743 2744

[ ]

2024 25

create a coherent legislation to govern zone development and management, to make a robust regulatory and institutional framework to govern zones as a priority. That is one of the key proposals we make. Secondly, there must be minimum standards and criteria for investor selections. That is very important to ensure that you get the right investors to come to Sri Lanka for zone development also. Thirdly, there must be proper regulatory independence. Without regulatory independence, there would not be any confidence in the foreign investors coming into this country. We believe that this Bill does not sufficiently address any of those problems I mentioned now.
