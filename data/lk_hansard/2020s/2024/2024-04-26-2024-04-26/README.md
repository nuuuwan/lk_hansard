Sir, the Answer to the Question is as follows:

01. Yes. In the first quarter of 2024, there has been an 89 per cent growth of tourist arrivals over the same period in 2023. The statistics are given below.

02. Visa income is computed by the Department of Immigration and Emigration. We will refer this Question to the Department of Immigration and Emigration. They had gazetted the increase in visa fees in September, 2023 and was announced to be implemented from 17th April, 2024. The Gazette Notification will be given for circulation among the Members.

03. The comparison will have to be requested from the Department of Immigration and Emigration. As per the proposal by the Department of Immigration and Emigration, it is a structured visa tariff. Yet, a final decision is pending. The other fees added to the visa fees, as proposed, are the processing fee of VFS amounting to US Dollars 18.50 and a facilitation fee of US Dollars 5.00.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Minister, I am not at cross-purposes with you. It is a fact that this matter is actually handled by the Committee on Public Finance. The matter was reported to the Committee on Public Finance and I, as a member, was also there. We discussed the matter with the officials who came there and had a thorough examination of this issue. Then what happened was, the Chairman of the Committee on Public Finance, the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva, reported this to Parliament. That is how it happened, but the House, as a whole, had no opportunity to discuss it. On that, we must agree. But the fact is, the Committee on Public Finance was informed, I agree.

( ) (The Hon. Harin Fernando) Hon. Member, I just want to clarify this. Normally, when a Gazette Notification is made, first, it goes to the Cabinet and then, we have to present it to Parliament. At that particular point, had there been questions like "Why US Dollars 75 is charged?" or "What are the conditions?", those should have been raised. I say again, I am not in favour of this and I am not happy about it. I do not like people being charged a higher visa fee because what we have to compete with is, countries which give free visa. It absolutely is going to be a bit of an issue, but we have presented it to Parliament. We have appointed a new committee to study it and take a holistic approach on our visa process. Currently, there are pluses and minuses in choosing that company.

Also, let me clarify about this US Dollars 75 visa fee. It is for a multiple entry visa for six months with a minimum stay of 60 days on a visit. The industry itself told us that there is a serious problem for persons who come to extend their visas, that they have to go to the Department of Immigration and Emigration and suffer for hours and days to get their visas extended. So, they said, "Even at a higher charge, give us visa for a longer stay". So, what they have introduced is a US Dollar 75 visa with multiple entry for six months and a minimum stay for two months or 60 days on each visit. So, that is completely justifiable. But, there was a slight mistake. One of the questions was, why that single-entry visa was not there. Yesterday, the Hon. Minister brought it to the Cabinet, we

approved it in the Cabinet and now, we have to present it to the Ministerial Consultative Committee, which will be held today. Then, on the 07th of May, it will be presented back to Cabinet and implemented. Am I correct Hon. Minister?

04. I am tabling* the visa fees of many countries as Annex, which were given in the Cabinet Paper.

Mostly, those are countries competing with Sri Lanka. Policy differs from country to country. As we did for seven countries, some countries have waived off their visa fees for selected countries. From a tourism perspective, ideally, we would like to waive off visa fees for selected countries for a specific time frame. Discussions are ongoing and it will be determined in the coming days. The stakeholder views, too, will be taken into consideration.

05. It is best that the Department of Immigration and Emigration responds to this question.

06. Correct. There has been an omission of the 30-day tourist visa. That, too, will be looked into in the final determination. There are many scams going on and the Government is aware of those. Every step will be taken to mitigate such occurrences.

It has to be done properly; you must follow the guidelines. They are in a hurry and they publish gazettes. That does not make it regular. That is my point.

, , , , , . ! ! ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. Rauff Hakeem. You have eight minutes.

[1.38 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem

Hon. Presiding Member, the Chief Government Whip read out a list of occasions on which this same matter had been discussed in this House. During the past five years, umpteen number of times, we have had detailed debates on the subject of the Easter Sunday attacks, the causes that led to the attack and the failure as far as the intelligence network in this country is concerned.

I would like to initially point out some of the headlines in the newspapers of yesterday and today. Your party Leader, Madam, in his contribution to the Debate says this. I will read that from the "Thinakkural" newspaper: " ;

?

?"

That is, your party Leader, the Hon. Anura Dissanayaka. Then, there is also another caption in the "Virakesari" newspaper:

"

"

So, we can go on reading from newspapers like this.

Then, there is also this issue, which I would like to refer to. The Island newspaper of 23rd April, 2024 states, I quote:

Shangri-La Hotel in Easter Sunday mystery:" "SJB demands to know who occupied rooms 616 and 623 while Zahran was on 6th floor

That is a very explosive expos which had been brought out by our former MP and Colleague Mujibur Rahuman at a press interview. Then, in today's The Morning newspaper, we have the comments made by the Hon. Udaya Gammanpila, who says, I quote: Easter Sunday attacks Debate:. " Oppo, divided over critique of SIS" "Gammanpila wants PSC on sensitive intel

Madam, I would like to start from there. We are pointing fingers at each other without looking at the root causes of the problem. Basically, it is widely accepted that there are gaps in the investigations. I have pointed out several such gaps. Madam, your own party Leader also, in his speech, pointed it out at this time and several times before. You, too, perhaps, have spoken about this and so is the Hon. Sajith Premadasa. In his latest speech also, he pointed out various issues regarding which there needs to be a further investigation. But, what is the Government's response regarding that? The Minister of Public Security says, We have completed investigations; we have filed charges against so many people - 20 odd people - and those charges are pending before the High Court. Then, the Attorney-Generals Department also says, We have filed charges and cases are pending. That is not the issue. Since all these new matters have come to be exposed, there is a necessity for a further investigation. This whole thing has shaken up the entire criminal justice system, the entire law and order machinery of this country.

Our intelligence network is under suspicion. There is a question whether there was a rogue group within the intelligence network who assisted the terrorists. On top of it, the previous speaker had also been, through innuendos, trying to point out various things because he also stands accused of some allegations since one of his party men who have now taken refuge abroad had also, by an affidavit to the UN Human Rights Council, come out with another set of startling revelations. So, in this background, what is necessary is to have a proper further investigation into all these new issues that have now cropped up so that we can allay the fears.

Now, I will come to what the Hon. Udaya Gammanpila says. He is a little upset that we are questioning the security network of our own State Intelligence Service - the SIS. I think, perhaps, he is referring to the allegation about this so-called Tripoli gang. That is a famous issue, the Tripoli gang and their operations. There are some members against whom there is an allegation about being involved in summary killings for political purposes using the Tripoli gang. This is a very serious allegation hanging over the head of our own intelligence network. I remember, our current President Ranil Wickremesinghe himself questioned about the Tripoli gang in this House when he was in the Opposition or, perhaps, in the Government, I cannot remember when it was. We had been part of his Government earlier, that is no secret. So, the issue is, do we have lack of confidence in our own intelligence network?

Now, look at the headline in the Daily Mirror of 24th April 2024, which states, I quote:

"Iranian Presidents visit - Sri Lanka withstands western pressure"

"Tight security for Iranian Presidents visit to Sri Lanka"

"Katunayake-Colombo Expressway closed from 2pm to 3pm today

I was personally witnessing how the security was provided. It was so tight-knit that I do not think even a fly could have crept through it. From Katunayake to

685 686

Colombo, wherever he went in Colombo - I went to the Opening of the Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project close to Ella - and from Ella through Wellawaya up to the Mattala Airport, every 50 metres, there were policemen blocking every entry to the road. Watertight security was provided for the VVIP visitor, the Iranian President. Such was the issue - there is this burning problem in the Middle East - and there are enemies targeting him and therefore, it is our responsibility as the host country to provide security, So, a wonderful security network was provided; the entire visit went without an incident.

Similarly, way back in 2019 when this Easter Sunday attack took place, we had intelligence information from India on the 04th of December. On the 07th of December, the Indian Defence Secretary came here and security was provided for him; he never had any issues. So, such was the confidence in our intelligence network and our security establishment. But, what went wrong? That is the problem.

So, there are so many issues to be resolved. That is why I am suggesting that, as Parliament, let us now stop pointing fingers at each other, but look at ways in which we can resolve this issue. First of all, there must be a fresh investigation. There must be commissions appointed to go into the new evidence that have surfaced. Added to that, I suggest that we must have -

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Yes, Madam, I am concluding.

As far as the Intelligence Service is concerned, Parliament must be taken into confidence. We must appoint an oversight Committee led by the Party Leaders both from the Government and the Opposition. Intelligence briefings must be given to Parliament, to Party Leaders or very senior Members. I am part of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on National Security and periodically, we discuss this issue. But, we must have a permanent oversight Committee on intelligence in this country. You must take the Opposition into confidence. Intelligence should not be the exclusive preserve of the Executive; that must change. It is only when that is an exclusive preserve of the Executive that, sometimes, the Executive can, for political purposes, manipulate the intelligence network. That is what had happened and that is what the Cardinal is suspecting, the Christian community is suspecting and the Muslim community, which has also been traumatized as victims in this, is also suspecting had happened.

There is one last point, Madam Presiding Member. The JVP was also resorting to some sort of terrorism way back. They are still celebrating their dead. Madam, the Il

Maha Viru Dinaya, you all celebrate. The LTTE also had a political objective. They are also celebrating the Maaveerar Thinam. But, does the Muslim community celebrate Zahran and his colleagues? They are terrorists, we agree. We do not celebrate them and we did not have a political objective.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) So, there was a hidden political agenda by somebody else. That is the issue. Therefore, that has to be looked into; a proper inquiry has to be conducted. The Attorney-Generals Department and the Police Department must stop saying that the chapter is closed because there are new evidence that need to be examined and truth has to be brought out.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . . 9 .

US Department of Justice : The three defendants named in the criminal complaint, all of whom pledged allegiance to ISIS, are: Mohomad Naufer, the second emir for the Group of ISIS supporters that called itself ISIS in Sri Lanka who allegedly led the groups propaganda efforts, recruited others to join ISIS and led a series of multi-day military-type trainings; Mohamed Anwar Mohamed Riskan who allegedly helped manufacture the IEDs used in the Easter Attacks and Ahamed Milhan Hayathu Mohamed, who allegedly executed a police officer in order to obtain the officers firearm, shot a suspected informant and scouted a location for a separate terrorist attack.

2 . .

Ambassador Samarasinghe, we stand ready to continue providing support to your government. It would not make sense for the United States to conduct an additional investigation into the attacks.
