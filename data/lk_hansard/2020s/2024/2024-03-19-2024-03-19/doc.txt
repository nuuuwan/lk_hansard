You are going to cannibalize the entire Colombo shopping district by creating a total market distortion here. So, what I am saying is, you had better consider these matters. Hon. Prime Minister, I asked the officials whether they had even done a study to understand the fallout of having this duty-free complex there. They have not even done that. So, I urge you to kindly consider all these matters. And, the first thing do is to appoint a Director General to run that organization.

Thank you very much.

[12.29 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I wish to second the Motion of No Confidence moved by the Chief Opposition Whip, which is a historic Motion that has been placed before the House. I say historic because this is the first occasion in the history of this country that such a Motion of No Confidence has even been placed before the House and is being debated for three days.

It is not a happy occasion when we have to support a Motion of No Confidence in the Speaker of this House because the Speaker is the guardian of the Privileges and powers accorded to Parliament and its Members. But, unfortunately, it has become necessary to place before this House, the country and the whole world that the Speaker has breached that confidence placed in him when he was elected as the Speaker of this House.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran, you may continue your speech.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, as I began my speech on this issue, I was pointing out the fact that this is the first time, on many fronts, that a No-Confidence Motion of this nature is being debated in this House.

Before I continue, I must disclose my interest in the matter in terms of the Standing Orders and the etiquette for Members of Parliament. Sir, I was the counsel when the Bill called the Online Safety Bill came up in the Supreme Court for determination and also after the purported endorsement of that Bill on the 01st of February, 2024 by the Speaker, I moved the Supreme Court by way of a Fundamental Rights Petition - I was the petitioner - seeking it to rule that the Speakers endorsement is not valid in law, insofar as it is not a legislative act, but was an administrative act by the Speaker. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court had refused to grant leave to proceed in the matter that I petitioned the Supreme Court, and uncustomarily, they had actually given reasons for not granting leave to proceed, in which they had cited Article 80(3) of the Constitution saying that the Court has no jurisdiction to look into the matter, where the Speaker had already endorsed the Bill. Now, I want to place on record here that I do not agree with the decision of the Supreme Court in refusing to grant leave to proceed and I am moving the Supreme Court again to review their decision, which any apex court in any country has the power to do.

Having disclosed my interest in the matter, may I continue to say that this is the first time that a Determination of the Supreme Court in regard to a Bill had been blatantly violated by Parliament, unfortunately, and that is primarily the reason why this No-Confidence Motion against the Speaker has been presented. In every country, when the Legislature passes a law, there is a requirement that someone either endorses it or grants his or her assent to it and it is only upon that act that the said Bill would become law. Why is that requirement there in all the legislatures of the world? Then, we needed the Queens assent, prior to Independence, the requirement was the Governor-Generals assent, even now, in the Provincial Councils, the Governor must assent, here in Parliament, the Speaker and if there is a Referendum, the President must endorse. Why is that requirement there? The answer to that is there in the Constitution itself. Sir, let me read from Article 75 of the Constitution, certain provisions which talk about the legislative power of Parliament. The side note itself of Article 75 states Legislative power. Article 75 states, I quote:

Parliament shall have power to make laws, including laws having retrospective effect and repealing or amending any provision of the Constitution, or adding any provision to the Constitution: Provided...."

So, there is a proviso.

".... that Parliament shall not make any law -

(a) suspending the operation of the Constitution or any part thereof; or"

So, there is a prohibition on Parliament to suspend any part of the Constitution. Let us say that there is a Bill before Parliament which purports to suspend the operation of a provision in the Constitution. Then, it is taken up for debate, said to be passed and the Speaker endorses it. Thereafter, does it become law? No, it does not. Merely because the Speaker has endorsed something which went through Parliament, that does not make it a law because the Constitution specifically states that you cannot suspend the operation of the Constitution or any part of the Constitution.

Then, another prohibition is there in the Constitution, which states, I quote:

"(b) repealing the Constitution as a whole unless such law also enacts a new Constitution to replace it.

You cannot merely bring in a Bill to say the Constitution is repealed. Even if you pass it with a two-thirds majority, it would not become law; even if the Speaker endorses it, it does not become law.

Then, Article 77. That is also important because the Speaker, in justifying his conduct in endorsing this Bill, says, "I acted on the advice of the Attorney-General". I must say that he can listen to the advice of the Attorney-General, but the law does not give the Attorney-General the power to endorse any Bill and the Speaker is also not expected to merely act exactly in the way that the Attorney-General advises him. If that is the case, the law would have said that the Attorney-General could endorse the Bill. The Speaker can listen to advice, but he is not a robot. He has to exercise his mind as to whether the proper legislative process has been followed. Why do I say that? It is because as per Article 77, the Attorney-General is supposed to examine every Bill, which states, I quote:

It shall be the due of the Attorney General to examine every Bill

And, if there is any inconsistency with any provision of the Constitution, he must say it at that point, before the Bill is even gazetted. In Article 78, the next Article, the requirement to gazette the Bill is there. I am saying this because when the matter came up before the Supreme Court, the Attorney-General came and presented a series of Amendments, running into 18 pages. It took about three hours for him to list his so-called Amendments. If that is the case, why did the Attorney-General, acting under Article 77, which was his duty to do so, not do that prior to the Bill being gazetted? The Constitution states that it is the duty of the Attorney-General to examine and make this known. He did not do that. After it was gazetted, after it was read the First time in Parliament, and after 45 petitions were presented to the Supreme Court - that is also a first, the highest number of petitions

1501 1502

2024 3

ever received, challenging a Bill and that shows the importance of this particular bill - he came to Court.

What would have happened if nobody challenged this Bill? Then, it would have been just passed and the Attorney-Generals 18-page Amendments would not have been made. After it was challenged by no less than 45 petitioners, the Attorney-General comes to Court, the Determination states that. In pages 12 to 19 of the Determination, the Attorney-General's suggested Amendments are reproduced. At the beginning of the hearing that was done and those Amendments were given to all the counsels of the petitioners. So, the Attorney-General, to start with, had not carried out his duties in terms of Article 77. He waited till it was challenged by 45 people and then came to Court and said, Well, these are the Amendments that we are prescribing. But, the Court went into even those and in a Determination that runs into 62 pages, the Court clearly laid down what Amendments could be done and what could not be done. It very specifically mentioned that these 34 particular Clauses out of the 56 Clauses in the Bill - a unique Bill, this is - are inconsistent with the Constitution and cannot be passed into law by a simple majority, and if those are to be passed, they must have a special majority. That is, a two-thirds of the number of Members of Parliament, including those not present; 150 votes had to be obtained, if that was to become law. That is so clear in the Determination.

Then, this is what Article 79, the next Article, states about the Speaker endorsing a Bill, I quote:

The Speaker shall endorse on every Bill passed by Parliament a certificate in the following form:-

This Bill (here state the short title of the Bill) has been duly passed by Parliament.

He must say that it has been, not passed, but has been "duly" passed by Parliament. That word duly is there not for nothing. Only when it is duly passed can the Speaker endorse it saying, "This Bill....", stating the short title of the Bill, ".....has been duly passed by Parliament." Sir, that Article further states, I quote:

Such certificate may also state the majority by which such Bill was passed:

Then again, there is a proviso, which states, I quote:

"Provided that where by virtue of the provisions of Article 82 or Article 83 or Article 84 or Article 123(2) a special majority is required for the passing of a Bill, the Speaker shall certify such Bill only if.

I stress the words only if ".

"..... such Bill has been passed with such special majority:

So, if the Supreme Court says that this Clause cannot be passed without a special majority, as Article 79 states, the Speaker can endorse it as having been duly passed only if - unfortunately, our Speaker does not seem to know what is meant by only if - it is passed by a special majority. Then, it goes on to state, I quote:

Provided further that where by virtue of Article 83, the Bill or any provision thereof requires the approval of the People at a Referendum, such certificate shall further state that the Bill or such provision shall not become law until approved by the People at a Referendum.

But, that is not relevant here. It is after Articles 75, 77 and 79 that Article 80 appears and Article 80(3) states, I quote:

"(3) Where a Bill becomes law upon the certificate of the President or the Speaker,

It states only "Where a Bill becomes law....".

It does not state that upon the Certificate of the Speaker, a Bill becomes law, no. Then, it states, I quote:

Where a Bill becomes law ....., no court or tribunal shall inquire into, pronounce upon or in any manner call in question, the validity of such Act on any ground whatsoever.

There was reference by the Proposer of the Motion to the law in Singapore with regard to online safety. Let us say the Speaker went on a trip to Singapore. He found the relevant Act of Singapore. He thinks, Oh, this is a very good law. We must also have it in our country. He buys a few copies and comes here. He sits in his Chamber and endorses it and signs it. Then, does it become law? No, it does not. It becomes law only if it is duly passed by Parliament.

If the Supreme Court has determined that it shall have a two-thirds majority for it to be passed, let us see what happens. And where do we find that provision? That is in Article 123(4) of the Constitution. Article 123(4) gives the Supreme Court the power to determine any Bill that is challenged before it and it also states, I quote:

Where any Bill, or the provision of any Bill, has been determined or is deemed to have been determined, to be inconsistent with the Constitution, such Bill or such provision shall not be passed....."

"Shall not be passed".

".......except in the manner stated in the determination of the Supreme Court:

Provided that it shall be lawful for such Bill to be passed after such amendment as would make the Bill cease to be inconsistent with the Constitution.

In the Determination of the Supreme Court I am referring to, the Supreme Court has said that the Bill is inconsistent with the Constitution and it cannot be passed except by a special majority. But, the Supreme Court has also gone on to say, but if these amendments are made, then, it will cease to be inconsistent with the Constitution. So, it was important or necessary for the Government to bring in those Amendments that were prescribed by the Supreme Court, if that Bill was to be passed by a simple majority. If the Government decided that they are going to pass that Bill by a two-thirds

1503 1504

1

majority of the whole number of Members of Parliament including those not present, then, they could have gone ahead because the Supreme Court has determined that it requires a special majority. But, if it was going to be passed by a simple majority, as in this case - it was passed only by a simple majority - then, those Amendments had to be brought in at the Committee Stage. But, several of those Amendments prescribed by the Supreme Court were not there.

The Government is required to place on the table of every Member of Parliament the Committee Stage Amendments that are proposed to be made before 12 noon. It was a two-day Debate on the Bill. Before 12 noon of the first day, a list of Amendments was tabled and because the list of Amendments was tabled, I was able to examine those Amendments along with the Supreme Court Determination and I found that 13 recommendations or Amendments prescribed by the Supreme Court were not there in the list of Amendments that the Government was moving. When the Committee Stage commenced, the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara and I raised objection and said that those Amendments were not there in the list of Amendments that was tabled before us. There was a huge protest. Sir, it is not that the Speakers attention was not drawn to this; it was drawn and there was a big protest. Most of us came down to the Well of the House and told him, You cannot do this. You are violating the Supreme Court Determination. I even gave a document in writing, listing those 13 points.

It was given to the Speaker and thereafter, the Assistant Secretary-General of Parliament told me that the Additional Solicitor General who was present in the Officials Box had assured that those would also be carried out. I accompanied the Assistant Secretary-General of Parliament to the Officials Box to see whether that was the case and I was given the assurance that those Amendments would also be moved by the Minister. So, I came back and told the Speaker that that assurance was given. The Hon. Minister moved several Amendments, but later when we looked at the purported Act that had been endorsed by the Speaker, nine of those were missing. Some of those Amendments are inconsequential, but certainly, six are very important Amendments. The Human Rights Commission headed by a retired Supreme Court Judge has also issued a statement saying that the Act does not have the Amendments stipulated and prescribed. It is not just a recommendation by the Supreme Court; it is stipulated and Article 123(4) states that it cannot become law unless those are complied with. That statement says that.

Sir, I will give you some clear examples. Clauses 20 (1), 29(6), 30(1), 31(1) of the Bill contained penal provisions regarding doubling of punishment in the event of a second or subsequent conviction. In page 42 of the Supreme Court Determination, this is what the Court held, I quote:

A careful consideration of the penal sections in the Bill shows that the courts are vested with the discretion to impose punishments as the said Clauses set out minimum and maximum punishments.

However, taking into consideration the theories that are applicable to imposing punishments for crimes, we are of the opinion that the punishments set out in the Bill for repeat offenders are excessive and therefore, such Clauses are violative of Article l2 (l) of the Constitution. Hence, the said Clauses should be passed by a special majority in Parliament. However, if the punishments stipulated for a second or subsequent conviction are deleted, the said inconsistency will cease and therefore, the said Clauses can be passed by Parliament by a simple majority.

If you read the Act that we have now, all of those Clauses are there as they were in the Bill; there is no change in those provisions on doubling of the punishment in case of a second or subsequent offence. The Supreme Court had very clearly said that those are violative of the Constitution, that you cannot pass it except by a special majority, but it was passed with a simple majority and the Speaker had endorsed it. I myself brought all of these six matters to the Speakers attention by an e-mail I sent and said, Do not endorse the Bill because there are still some issues on which there is the Supreme Court's clear Determination that a two-thirds majority is required. This was not passed by a two-thirds majority. So, do not endorse the Bill. That is why the requirement of an endorsement is there and not for the Speaker to listen to the Attorney-General and say, He advised me. So, I am signing. Then, we do not need a Speaker; we can have the Attorney-General sit in that Chair. The law has vested in the Speaker the power to endorse a Bill and he endorses it saying, It is duly passed by Parliament, not saying that it was just "passed by Parliament". So, all of these provisions I just read out clearly state that you cannot endorse a Bill unless it has complied with the Determination of the Supreme Court. I only gave one example. There are several such examples.

Then, Section 20 of the Act. As stated in page 61 of the Determination, the Supreme Court required an Amendment to an illustration in that Section.

It states, I quote:

"Amend the illustrations to section 22(l) of the Bill."

Currently, in Section 20 of the Online Safety Act, that illustration appears as it appeared in the Bill; no amendment had been made to the illustration. Anybody who is capable of reading would understand that. You do not need legal acumen, you do not need legal expertise, but if you are able to read and if you are literate, you would know what it states. I am saddened by the fact that I have to say this in this House, questioning the very literacy of the Speaker. If he cannot read this and understand what it says, then is he capable of chairing the Proceedings of this House or occupying the office of the Speaker? That is why we have lost confidence in the Speaker. It goes without saying, you do not have to pass a Motion of No-confidence, but, surely, the country knows that he cannot be the Speaker, if he cannot read that. The Supreme Court says that you cannot pass it without a special majority, but just as it was in the Bill, it appears in the Act he had now signed and endorsed. There is not one, not two, not three, but at least six such occasions of clear violation of the Determination. So, how can he continue to be the Speaker?

1505 1506

The majority is not always right. When this Motion is put to vote, it will be proved that the majority is wrong. Not only is the Speaker unable to read and understand, but the majority in this House also cannot read and understand! That is what you are going to prove when you vote against this Motion in two days' time. That, we are able to show. We have learned President's Counsels seated in the first row and even they will be shown up as not being able to understand the simple, plain English that the Determination is written in. That is what you are going to prove to the country, that you all are also not literate.

You did this the last time when there was a No-confidence Motion brought against the then Minister of Health. You ganged up together and defeated that Bill; you also ganged up together and defeated that Motion of No-confidence in the then Minister of Health. Where is he today? You had confidence in him. All of you together gloated that you have defeated the No-confidence Motion in him, but where is the then Minister of Health today? Where is the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella today? That is what will happen to the Speaker, too, and you all will be collaborators. You will show yourselves up to the people of this country. Not just the Speaker, but every Member who will vote against this Motion would show himself or herself up as an illiterate person who does not understand anything and is not capable of walking into the hallowed precincts of this House. If that is what you want to do, go ahead and do it. You could go ahead and do it, that is your choice. But, any grade one student in this country will be able to tell you that you are wrong; any child who has been taught to read will tell you that you are utterly wrong when you make that decision to vote against the Motion of No-confidence in this Speaker. This is not a private matter; this is not a personal issue. This involves the very honour of this House!

To what have you brought this House today? A mere charade of a passage of a Bill, which all of us know could not have been passed.

Even if we went through that charade, we know that the several provisions of the Constitution I have just read prohibit the Speaker from endorsing that Bill because it was never duly passed by Parliament. So, we have an illiterate Speaker and a bunch of illiterate Members in the Government side who will vote against this Motion two days later. It is up to the country to thereafter decide - the Hon. President says this is an election year - on every one of you, who will have to face the constituency and answer, firstly, whether you are literate or not and secondly, by what power of imagination you thought that the Speaker was right.

Sir, I am putting this question not just to the Hon. Members of the Government benches, but also to the country. I tell the people, you all wanted a system change and you are justified in doing that. In two days' time, when a Vote is taken in this House and the Government Members vote to defeat this Vote of No-confidence, you all will yet again be justified for calling for a system

change. But, do not say that all the 225 Members must be thrown into the Diyawanna Oya. One side of the House, those who vote against this Motion, are the ones who must be thrown into the Diyawanna Oya. They are the ones who close their eyes to what is staring them in the face and will be voting against this Motion. They will be voting with their feet; they will be voting against their own conscience and they will be voting against any sense of reason. That is what I have to say to the country.

I am also addressing the Hon. Speaker. If you have any honour left, please resign. The Mover of this Motion said how the Speaker of the Scottish Parliament admitted his mistake. So, admit your mistake. You do not have to be a legal expert to know what you have done. Admit your mistake, tender your resignation and thereby, guard your honour.

Thank you. . . Question proposed. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. Minister, (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. You have 30 minutes.

But, I just want to remind him one or two facts, which are more relevant to his speech. In the first place, I could not believe whether he was making his speech in Parliament or in a Pradeshiya Sabha in Jaffna or Pottuvil or somewhere else

Sir, the Hon. Sumanthiran argued the passing of that Bill and got a decision from the Supreme Court. Now, he is so frustrated and that frustration was displayed throughout his speech. Most of the time, Hon. Member, you are frustrated. Can you remember, when the Determination on the Twenty-First Amendment to the Constitution was made, while seated in the same seat, did you not say that the Supreme Court must be sent home? 1 . 1 1 1 1 that we should not violate the Determination made by the Supreme Court. What is this double standard? Then, Sir, the other issue is -

Even when the Supreme Court is wrong, we have to comply with that. But, I have the right to say that they were wrong. Even in this case, I just said that they were wrong in rejecting my petition to interfere in this matter. So, my position has not been contradictory.

Can you do it? When Parliament has passed a Bill, just because some Party Leaders make a request to hold it, can the Speaker hold it or delay the endorsement of that Bill? Can you do it?

Now, I will show you what the provisions are. Article 78 of the Constitution, states, I quote:

(1) Every Bill shall be published in the Gazette .......

(2) The passing of a Bill or a resolution by Parliament shall be in accordance with the Constitution and the Standing Orders of Parliament. Any one or more of the Standing Orders may be suspended by Parliament in the circumstance and in the manner prescribed by the Standing Orders.

Then, Article 79 of the Constitution states, I quote:

The Speaker shall endorse on every Bill passed by Parliament a certificate in the following form:-

What does it say? Once a Bill is passed, the Speaker "shall" - he has no discretion. It may be a good Bill or a bad Bill, but it is the decision of the Members of Parliament, not of the Speaker - endorse it. If Parliament, by a majority, has passed a Bill, it is the duty of the Speaker to endorse it. It states he "shall endorse". That is given in Article 79 of the Constitution.

Then, Standing Order No. 74 states, I quote:

As soon as may be after a Bill has been passed ......

It is insisted.

.....by Parliament the Speaker shall endorse on the Bill in Sinhala and Tamil the Certificate specified in Article 79 of the Constitution.

Let us assume that there had been some Amendments contrary to the Supreme Court Determination. Then, what is the duty of the Speaker? If the Bill has been passed by a majority, it is the duty of the Speaker - he "shall - to endorse it.

They are calling the House of Commons a "Zombie parliament".

"...... with opposition parties arguing the relative shortness of the average parliamentary day shows an administration running 'out of steam.'

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) In Parliament, we have the right to abstain from voting. According to him, when you abstain from voting, you are a puppet. That is absurd! It is a right we have in Parliament. The Constitutional Council is a committee. The right we have in Parliament, a committee also has. It is common sense. Therefore, the right we have in Parliament, the Constitutional Council also has.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) - ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Let us not make this a debate. Just make the clarification.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) . 1. common sense 1 in an uncommon way. It cannot be common sense in an uncommon way. Then, it is not common sense. Common sense is somewhat different. In Parliament, the Hon. Members can vote for or against. If they want to abstain from voting, they can abstain. If they do not want to come to Parliament, they can stay at home; they can stay at home for three months. Can the members of the Constitutional Council stay away for three months? The Judges of the Supreme Court are decision-makers. We are not decision-makers; we are the Legislature.

( ) (An Hon. Member) We are policymakers. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) Yes, we are policymakers. Judges are decision-makers. When you appoint judges to the Superior Courts of this country, the Supreme Court - [Interruption.] Sir, I will take time from the time allotted to Hon. (Dr.) Suren Raghavan.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, his 15 minutes had already been given to you.

We have not given them that power by the Constitution. What has been given to them is the power to either accept or reject something. That is the law. Otherwise, they must resign.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Sir, - ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) You all are Presidents Counsels and as a layman, may I ask you this question, Hon. Minister. Is there or is there not a provision for them to abstain? If there is provision for them to abstain, may I suggest that you amend the rules so that they cannot abstain. - [Interruption] If it is a situation like that, then there is an issue. Is it specifically stated that they cannot abstain? - [Interruption] No, it does not say anywhere that they cannot abstain. - [Interruption]

1525 1526

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Yes, Hon. Minister? () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) I am thankful to the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva for raising that. Even with regard to the Supreme Court - you can go through their rules and the Constitution - it is not stated anywhere specifically that they cannot abstain, but the nature of their obligation or that office is such that they cannot abstain. In that case, we will have to make amendments in so many other laws. It is not that we cannot do it, we can, but why should we complicate it? For what purpose? We appointed them to the Constitutional Council to take decisions. The powers of the President had been curtailed or removed from him and given to the Constitutional Council. So, please take decisions.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) In the case of the Supreme Court, Sir, sometimes, judges recuse themselves due to personal reasons; if it is a personal matter, they do not want to sit in judgment. I do not know under what circumstances those two members of the Constitutional Council abstained. It could even be on a personal matter. In a situation like that, a judge could recuse himself or herself and a another judge could be asked to sit in judgment. But, in this case, how do we deal with it? What if there would be personal issues?

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, please be brief on that. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) In case a judge cannot consciously come to an impartial judgment in respect of a certain matter due to a personal reason or an involvement of some person known to him, certainly there is a conflict of interest and he could say, I will not sit on this Bench; I do not want to hear the case. Then, the case is referred to another judge who do not have a conflict of interest in that case.

In this case, qualifications have already been given in the Constitution. In addition to that, there are Rules for the Constitutional Council. I think the Hon. Member has not gone through those. The Constitutional Council drafted their Rules running into 56 pages! At a particular time, we were blamed, saying that the President was not allowing those to be printed. But, that, we did with a purpose. Can you understand, Rules running into 56 pages? It is an insult to Parliament! Thereafter, we redrafted the Rules. Now, those run into only four pages. The Rules has specified that in the event there is a conflict

of interest for a the member of the Council, he must record it saying, "I have a conflict of interest in this regard", but still, he has to take a decision. So, while recording it, he has to take a decision because - in the court, if one judge is not available, we can get another judge - you cannot do so in the Constitutional Council as there is only one Constitutional Council; that is the apex body.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you, Hon. Minister. Next, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris. You have 12 minutes.

Order, please! Before he starts, will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. S.M.M. Muszhaaraff to the Chair?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) Sir, I propose that the Hon. S.M.M. Muszhaaraff do now take the Chair.
