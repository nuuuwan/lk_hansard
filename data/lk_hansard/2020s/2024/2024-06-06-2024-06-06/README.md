The issue at hand, Hon. Minister, is to what extent the Draft Bill would permit these proposals to be implemented practically in a manner which ensures that the benefits flow to the citizens of Sri Lanka by making electricity accessible and affordable. Can we develop our renewable energy sector so that it would yield a dollar income and not one which would be exploited by foreign companies? Has this Act got those safeguards? Unbundling, using new technology is good, but would the systems yield benefit to our country or would those benefit some fly-by-night investors, as it had been happening in the past? And, it is happening right now. So, there is no doubt that foreign capital and foreign technology are very important for the country; we do not doubt that for a moment. But, there has to be safeguards to see that that is implemented.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, there are some key issues that I want to raise with the Hon. Minister. The difference between the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka Act, No. 35 of 2002 brought by the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya and the Act brought by you, Hon. Minister, is this. With this Act, you have brought in the National Electricity Advisory Council. According to Clauses 3.(4) and 3.(8) (a) of the Bill, the power to appoint and remove members of the National Electricity Advisory Council is vested with you, the Minister. The Minister could also co-opt members as and when required. What I am trying to say is that as per the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka Act, No. 35 of 2002, the members of the PUCSL, which is now playing the proposed NEACs role, are appointed by the Minister in charge of policy planning with the concurrence of the Constitutional Council. That gives accountability and is very transparent. Therefore, in this proposed Act, we think the appointment mechanism should be changed. Also, Section 7 in the 2002 Act clearly states that the members of the PUCSL can only be removed by bringing the matter before Parliament, whereas, according to this Bill, you can remove any member whenever you want. So, there are checks and balances in the existing Act.

Then, as per Clause 3.(12) of the Bill, you, Hon. Minister, can give directions to the NEAC as you like. As per Clause 4.(11) (a), the Minister could ask for detailed and specific guidance to be given to the Regulator and as per Clause 4.(11) (b), the Minister can provide detailed and specific guidance to the National System Operator. So, you have powers going beyond all these provisions, to

tell the Regulator what to do and to give him detailed and specific guidance. Okay, those would relate to the principles, but it also means that you can influence the Regulator and the National System Operator.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , 4 [ 4.

( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) I am going to finish, Sir.

Part VIII of the Bill details the instructions on tariff settings as against the Electricity Reform Act, No. 28 of 2002. As per Section 29 of 2002 Act, the functions on tariff principles and settings are vested with the Regulator and a broader framework is provided whereas, as per this Bill, the Minister can issue a detailed policy. There is a long list and I am not going to read it out. To an extent, I believe, the methodology rests in your hands. But, Hon. Minister, you have been telling me that it is the Regulators job to develop the methodology. I hope you would certify that because that independence has to be there.

One other thing we are very concerned about, Sir, is consumer protection. In the Electricity Reform Act, No. 28 of 2002, there is a Chapter - Chapter IV - dedicated entirely to the purpose of consumer protection. But, I feel that this Bill is silent on consumer protection. So, there are issues with regard to that. - [Interruption.] Okay, I would like to see how good those safeguards are, as compared to those in the 2002 Act.

( ) (The Hon. Kanchana Wijesekera) It is in Clause 31. ( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) Okay.

Hon. Minister, I am also concerned about the fact that there are issues relating to certain appointments. We are going to bring in some Amendments and will share those with you. These are progressive Amendments; these Amendments will ensure that Sri Lanka would derive the benefits.

I would like to wind up by telling you, Hon. Minister, why these checks and balances need to be there. Hon. Minister, I have been raising this issue hundreds of times. With regard to the Adani Group's renewable energy project of generating 500MW - we do understand that we need the technology and the financial strength of Adani Group; we need the investment - when the Cabinet

493 494

2024 ]6

approved their unit rate of 8 US cents, we told you that there would be another tender that was going to be opened two weeks ago. There were more than five international bidders and we believe that their unit rates would be below 6 US cents, and you could use that to negotiate with the Adani Group to bring down the rate. But, so far, your Ministry has not even allowed the opening of the tender; you have illegally stopped the opening of the tender. We ask the Minister, if we give you more powers, what more could happen? There are systems that have to be adhered to. So, we are looking forward to seeing that the Minister makes sure that that tender is opened and we get the least cost - that is why we are talking about the least cost - for any wind power or solar power project that we would be given out.

Thank you.
