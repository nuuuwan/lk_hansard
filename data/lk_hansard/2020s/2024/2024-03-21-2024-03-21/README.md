Hon. Eran Wickramaratne,- Vote of No Confidence against Hon. Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana, the Speaker,- Whereas, by allowing the government to adopt certain Clauses of the Bill titled Online Safety during the Committee of the whole Parliament of the said Bill contrary to the determination of the Supreme Court in respect of that Bill disregarding the strong objections raised by Members of Parliament of the Opposition to the effect that some Clauses of the Bill concerned were being passed in contravention of the determination of the Supreme Court regarding the Bill;

Particularly,

(a) And whereas by allowing the passage of Clause 13 of the aforesaid Bill with a simple majority without incorporating the amendments specified in the determination of the Supreme Court, which had determined that the said Clause was inconsistent with Article 12 (1) of the Constitution and as such, should be passed with a special majority, and if it were to be passed with a simple majority, the amendments so specified should be effected;

(b) And whereas by allowing the passage of Clause 17 of the aforesaid Bill as it was with a simple majority while the Supreme Court had determined that the said Clause was inconsistent with the Constitution and hence should be passed with a special majority and while the Attorney-General had informed the Supreme Court that the Clause concerned would be removed during the Committee of the whole Parliament;

(c) And whereas by allowing the passage of Clauses 20, 33(6), 34(1) and 35(1) of the aforesaid Bill with a simple majority without incorporating the amendments specified in the determination of the Supreme Court, which had determined that the Clauses concerned were inconsistent with the Constitution and as such, should be passed with a special majority, and if they were to be passed with a simple majority, the amendments so specified should be effected;

(d) And whereas by allowing the passage of Clause 21 of the aforesaid Bill as it was with a simple majority without acting in pursuance of the assurance given by the Attorney-General to the Supreme Court that the amendments necessary to pass the Clause concerned with a simple majority would be moved during the Committee of the whole Parliament when the Supreme Court determined that the said Clause was inconsistent with the Constitution and hence should be passed with a special majority;

1805 1806

2024 21

(e) And whereas by allowing the passage of Clause 22 of the Bill as it was with a simple majority, without incorporating the amendments specified in the determination of the Supreme Court, which had determined that the Clause concerned was inconsistent with the Constitution and as such, should be passed with a special majority, and if it was to be passed with a simple majority, the amendments so specified should be effected;

(f) And whereas by allowing the passage of Clause 31 of the Bill as it was with a simple majority, without incorporating the amendments specified in the determination of the Supreme Court, which had determined that the Clause concerned was inconsistent with the Constitution and as such, should be passed with a special majority, and if it was to be passed with a simple majority, the amendments so specified should be effected;

And whereas it has been stated in the letter dated 08th February 2024, sent to the Speaker of Parliament by the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, confirming this, and pointing out that the Supreme Court determination has not been followed with pertinence to passing certain Clauses of the said Bill and therefore, that there are serious concerns regarding the fact whether the number of votes required to pass the Bill as it is, has been received in Parliament;

And whereas at the same time, whereas by allowing the Bill to be passed at the third reading without calling for a Division, despite the request made by the Chief Opposition Whip calling for a Division, at the third reading of the Online Safety Bill;

And whereas and by endorsing the certificate on the said Bill, ignoring the request made by a group of Opposition Members from the Speaker at the special meeting of the Party Leaders which was held on the 01st of February 2024, not to endorse the Bill until it is seriously scrutinized, as certain Clauses have been passed by the government contravening the determination issued by the Supreme Court at the Committee of the whole Parliament of the Online Safety Bill;

And whereas, when the name for the post of Inspector-General of Police, recommended by the Hon. President was considered at the meeting of the Constitutional Council held on the 26th of February 2024, 4 members of the Constitutional Council voted for the appointment of that recommended person for the said post and 2 members voted against while 2 members abstained from voting and as such while the said recommended name for the post of Inspector-General of Police remained unapproved as per the provisions of the Constitution, the Speaker has unlawfully aided and abetted and sponsored the President to appoint the person recommended by the President to the post of Inspector-General of Police in an illegal and unconstitutional manner by stating in paragraph 4 of the letter dated 26th February 2024 that intimated to the President that:-

"However, as there are no provisions with regard to abstaining from voting at a meeting of the Constitutional Council as per Article 41(e) of the Constitution and if abstaining from voting is deemed as being opposed to, before the law and in relation to the aforementioned issue if it is deemed as a tie in voting as per Article 41(e)(5) of the Constitution, I hereby inform that I exercise my casting vote as the Chair.

And whereas, the Speaker has acted in a manner in blatant violation of the Constitution in handling the affairs of Parliament;

And whereas, the Speaker has acted in a manner that public confidence in the supreme institutions of Parliament and the Constitutional Council would be eroded;

And whereas, the Speaker has blatantly violated the Standing Orders of Parliament;

And whereas, the Speaker has blatantly desecrated the independence and dignity of the office of the Speaker by clearly exhibiting that he acts partially;

And whereas, the Speaker who is bound to protect the rights and privileges of the Members of Parliament impartially, has himself violated the rights and privileges of Members of Parliament;

And whereas, the Speaker has neglected to perform the functions and responsibilities of the office of the Speaker.

That this Parliament resolves that it has no confidence in Hon. Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana, the Speaker any longer."

, , this whole exercise of bringing in a No-Confidence Motion against the Speaker is politically motivated. The Speaker had nothing to do with it; he had acted within the law. You cannot expect the Speaker to overrule the opinion of the Attorney-General without reasonable cause. When the Attorney-General says that the Committee Stage Amendments to that Bill had been brought in terms of the law, how do you expect the Speaker, a layman, to override him? Then, the Chief Justice must sit in the Chair of the Speaker to overrule him. Therefore, this entire exercise is without any merit whatsoever.

Secondly, as far as the Constitutional Council is concerned, there is no provision in terms of the Constitution, their own Rules nor in terms of the previous practices of the Council to abstain from voting; they must vote either for or against something. So, the manner in which those two Members had acted has brought the Constitutional Council into disrepute, which warrants a No-Confidence Motion against them for acting against their own Rules, not against the Speaker. Therefore, Sir, with great respect, I would say that this No-Confidence Motion is not worth the paper it is printed on. It is politically motivated; it does not have any merit. Actually, if you want to bring in a No-Confidence Motion on the appointment of the IGP or on the passing of the Online Safety Bill, you must bring it against the Minister concerned and who brought in the Bill. But, the Minister has been spared. Why? You are scared of him. That is the truth.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, please wind up now. .. . ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC) I will wind up, Sir.

With respect, finally I would say that we all will vote to defeat this No-Confidence Motion and that we have full confidence in the Hon. Speaker. Thank you.

[1.20 p.m.] () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Okay, thank you, Sir. In that case, I will change my start.

Sir, I have here a Determination of the Supreme Court of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. I will quote it:

"In the matter of an application under and in terms of Article 126 read with Article 17 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

Weheragedara Ranjith Sumangala, No. 137/2, Beliaththawila, Kindelpitiya Millewa PETITIONER

vs

Bandara, Police Officer, Police Station, Mirihana. 1st RESPONDENT

Inspector Bhathiya Jayasinghe, Officer-in-Charge -Emergency Unit, Police Station, Mirihana. 2nd RESPONDENT

Egodawele, Chief Inspector, Head Quarters Inspector, Police Station, Mirihana. 3rd RESPONDENT....."

The list of Respondents goes on and then comes, I quote: M.W.D. Tennakone, Superintendent of Police, Nugegoda Division, Office of the Superintendent of Police, Nugegoda. 5th RESPONDENT

Mahinda Balasuriya, Inspector General of Police, Police Headquarters, Colombo 01. 6th RESPONDENT"

Thereafter comes the Hon. Attorney-General as the last Respondent.

This is a case in which the 5th Respondent, M.W. D. Tennakone, also known as Deshabandu Tennakone, was found guilty of torture. This Determination of the Supreme Court, which I quoted, was made by S. Thurairaja, Kumudini Wickremasinghe and K. Priyantha Fernando. The case is about how a man was tortured. At certain times, the man was hung upside down at the police station, sometimes, a balm was applied on his private parts and at yet another time, he was forced to inhale chilli powder put into a plastic bag, which his head was inserted into and tied around his neck. In the Determination, this is what the Judges say with regard to Mr. Deshabandu Tennakone, I quote:

1863 1864

With regards to the 5th Respondent, it is clear from paragraphs 22, 23, 24 and 25 of the aforementioned Affidavit of Nimal Perera dated 08th June 2011, produced marked P12, he, then a Superintendent of Police, has paid a visit to the place where the Petitioner and several others were detained on 17th December 2010. The affidavit further states that the 5th Respondent himself.

That is, M.W.D. Tennakone.

.beat the Petitioner with a three-wheel rubber band after stripping him naked and ordering him to rub.

A balm. Sir, I do not want to mention the name of the balm because, apparently, people are associated with its brand name and the brand name has nothing to do with this. So, I will leave the brand name aside.

on his genitalia. The 5th Respondent is specifically referred to therein by his name and rank, as it was then.

The Counter Affidavit of the Petitioner along with the aforementioned affidavits marked 'P10', 'P11' and 'P12', was filed before this Court on 02nd March, 2012. Written Submissions of the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents was filed on 19th November, 2013, almost 20 months later. Even at that point, nothing was filed on behalf of the 5th Respondent."

Sir, I am reiterating the fact that even 20 months later, nothing was filed on behalf of the 5th Respondent. It further states, I quote:

"In the interest of justice, on 19th May, 2020, the Court directed the Registrar to serve notices on the 3rd and 5th Respondents informing them of the next date of hearing. The notice sent to the 5th Respondent was not returned. Written submissions of the Attorney-General on behalf of the 5th and 6th Respondents was filed on 26th September, 2023.

As can be seen, the Respondents of the instant case were afforded ample opportunities to plead their cases before this Court. Upon direction by the Court, the 5th Respondent, too, filed Affidavit dated 05th October, 2023. The said Affidavit only related to the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act. The 5th Respondent, represented by the Attorney-General, has not at any point during the proceedings rejected or objected to the allegations against him hereinbefore set out.

Therefore, I find the 5th Respondent to have tortured the Petitioner in violation of his fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 11 of the Constitution. For this very reason, and by the very fact, I find the 5th Respondent to have further violated the Petitioner's rights under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

It is also revealed by the Minute on the document marked 'Rx(1)', the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents Statement of Objections and the excerpts from the ' ' annexed thereto marked 'Rx(2)' that the 5th Respondent himself ordered the investigation and that he has had intimate knowledge of the investigation.

With regards to the violation of Articles 13(1) and 13(2) of the Constitution, from the aforementioned facts, it is clear that the 5th Respondent had knowledge of the Petitioner's detention on account of his visit on 17th December, 2010 for a brief session of torture."

Sir, I am not saying this; this is stated by the Supreme Court of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

"The 5th Respondent had received the anonymous complaint describing the involvement of the Petitioner and 3 others by name only 5 days before the arrest, and, when the 5th Respondent arrived at the torture chamber on 17th December 2010,"

So, the Supreme Court accepts that there was a torture chamber on the 17th of December, 2010 at the Mirihana Police Station.

". he had inquired from another Police Officer ' [who are they]', to which the other Police Officer replied ' [Sir, this is the parties involved in that Sargent Majors case]'. Such a loose reference to a matter alludes to the fact that not only did the 5th Respondent have knowledge of the arrest of the Petitioner and the 3 others, but that he was kept updated on the events that transpired after the arrest on 15th December 2010. As such, it appears that the Petitioner was kept detained without producing before a Magistrate within the legally stipulated time frame with full knowledge of the 5th Respondent. Therefore, I hold the 5th Respondent, too, to have violated the fundamental rights of the Petitioner enshrined under Articles 13(1) and 13(2) of the Constitution.

While findings of fundamental rights violations are ample, the wrongdoers - especially the big fish in the pond - are seldom held duly accountable."

"Senior officers, under whose authority and direction their subordinates may act, have a special duty to ensure that they do not abuse such authority or go beyond such direction. Senior officers cannot merely give orders and thereafter sleep on this duty. They are to closely scrutinize the conduct of their subordinates. The stars that adorn their uniforms are not ornaments of power, but rather, reminders of the immense responsibility that comes with their authority." ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have only two more minutes. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) But, Sir, you said, I can have more time. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes, but you have already - ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) Sir, give him more time. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella is giving me more time.

Sir, I want to reiterate what the the Judge states in the Determination: "The stars that adorn their uniforms are not ornaments of power, but rather, reminders of the immense responsibility that comes with their authority." And, it further states, I quote:

1865 1866

[ () ]

2024 21

"Gross neglect of this duty would render them complicit in the actions of their unruly subordinates. The concept of commission by omission is well recognized in our constitutional jurisprudence by cases such as the Easter Sunday Cases, SC/FR/163/2019, SC Minutes of 12th January 2023.

I am of the view that supervising officers are to be directly held liable for the conduct of their subordinates in appropriate instances, even in the absence of direct participation. Supervising officers can be held liable where there is affirmatory participation or participatory presence on the part of such supervising officers; or, where they have, directly or indirectly, implemented or enabled unconstitutional policies by turning a blind eye towards unconstitutional practices directly under their authority.

What is revealed to us in the instant case, apparent from what I have cited above from the affidavits, is a pattern of grave derelictions, which has persisted for a considerable period of time. Where such a pattern is observable, what other inference are we to draw than, either the wrongdoings have taken place with the blessings of the direct supervisors or that such supervisors have slept on the wheel? In either case, such supervisors are directly complicit in the actions so enabled.

From the circumstances established in the instant case, it is clear that the 5th Respondent has enabled, through his actions as well as inaction, the conduct of the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents, making him directly liable for the fundamental rights violations hereinbefore established. No material has been produced before this Court by the 5th Respondent so as to distance himself from such violations.

Therefore, I hold the 5th Respondent to have violated the fundamental rights of the Petitioner guaranteed under Articles 11, 12(1), 13(1) and 13(2) of the Constitution." Sir, I would like to end with this quotation.

"5. The 5th Respondent is ordered to pay as compensation a sum of Rs. 500,000/- (Rupees Five-Hundred Thousand).

The 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents are to pay the aforementioned sums, within six months from the date of judgment, out of their personal funds."

Sir, why did I quote this? I quoted it because it is on this matter that the Constitutional Council had split when it came to the appointment of this Mr. M.W.D. Tennakone also known as Deshabandu Tennakone as the Inspector General of Police. In that instance, it is very clear that if there was not the exact number of dissenting votes to those in agreement, the Speaker has no role to play. Whether those Members of the Constitutional Council who abstained should be asked to resign or not is a separate matter; why they did not vote or why they abstained is a separate matter. In fact, I brought it to the attention of the Hon. Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms and said that if there is a conflict of interest in cases before the Supreme Court also, the Judges could recuse themselves.

There is no rule to say, other than the accepted practice or what is expected of them, that they should vote either Yes or No. The accepted practice coming down from the Thirteenth Century and very specifically illustrated in Erskine May is also expected to be followed by the Hon. Speaker. So, in this case, for the Speaker to suggest that those members who abstained fall either under Ayes or Noes cannot be done. Abstinence means abstinence; it does not mean Yes or No.

I recall that at one point, when there was a vote on a Resolution in Geneva, in favour of the Resolution, there was a certain number and against it, there was another number. Then, there were certain other countries which abstained and the Government at that time added the number which abstained to the number of votes they received and said, We won the Resolution. Actually, it was the other way round. The Resolution was brought in by someone else and the Government said, "We defeated the Resolution", which was not the case. The United Nations did not accept that position.

So, you see that in this case, there had been a grave violation of the fundamental rights of those people and the Constitutional Council was not willing to appoint a man found guilty of torture by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka. Let us not talk about the torture of the Tamil people that happened then. How many Tamil people were tortured? Who talked about them? We tried to talk about them here. People who talked about that torture, whether it is a journalist from a national newspaper or a regional reporter, were killed. How many were killed for trying to talk about that torture? The petitioner in the case I referred to earlier is a Sinhala man and his name is Ranjith Sumangala. Here, I am not trying to make a distinction between the torture of a Sinhala man and a Tamil man. But, torture has continued to happen and these officers have always been in office. It is a well-known fact that torture happens in the Police and that they hang people upside down. Sir, I am going to table* this 60-page Supreme Court Determination made by Justice S. Thurairaja, Justice Kumudini Wickremasinghe and Justice K. Priyantha Fernando so that the people of this country would know why the members of the Constitutional Council opposed to the appointment of Mr. Deshabandu Tennakone as the Inspector General of Police.

We cannot have a person who had been found guilty of torture in charge of the Police! How could it be? How could it be, Hon. Presiding Member?

Is this not a democracy? Do people not have rights? If those officers have only been accused, that is another matter. You can say that they have only been accused, but not convicted. But, here, it is a conviction. So, purely on that matter, I have lost confidence in the Speaker. I am sorry, I am really sorry to say that; it is not the man, but the position. He wields so much power. We found out during the Debate in this House that the Hon. Speaker did not actually cast his casting vote at the Constitutional Council, he did not. The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella specifically stated that. And, it was much later that he wrote to the Hon. President saying that it was a 5: 4 vote.

Sir, there are many other issues that I wish to take up, but I am in no mood to do so because this is not something I enjoy doing; this is something that I do not enjoy doing, but I am doing it because it has to be done.

1867 1868

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

So, it is on that basis and many other things that I support this Vote of No Confidence against the Speaker of Parliament.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. Douglas Devananda. You have 12 minutes.
