.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, at the very outset, I wish to thank the Hon. Nalin Bandara Jayamaha from the SJB for giving five minutes of his time for me to speak today. I truly appreciate that because this Bill with regard to the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation is something that specifically concerns the Tamil people, especially the people of the North and the East and there are a few matters that I wish to raise. So, in that regard, I truly do appreciate the Hon. Member for giving me his time.

2024 2

Sir, if we were to consider the bona fides of the Government with regard to bringing in this Bill to make the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation a legalized body, listening to the speech made by the Hon. Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms this morning, it is impossible for us to support it because the Hon. Ministers remarks on his notion of reconciliation show that he is clueless. His idea of reconciliation is one of majoritarianism; his idea of reconciliation is that Sri Lanka is a Sinhala-Buddhist country, that nobody else must assert their identity at any point and whatever that Sinhala-Buddhist nation believes in must stand and nobody else can have any other opinion. So, it is in that spirit that the Hon. Minister made comments with regard to the existence of political parties which have ethnic memes to them like the Tamil National Peoples Front, the Tamil National Alliance and the other Tamil parties. He makes these comments saying that those parties must not be allowed to exist.

Why did we exist? Why did we have to identify ourselves as Tamil and not be a part of this larger identity or the common identity? The island of Sri Lanka, from its very inception, had various names being called and those names, in reality, were practised simply as majoritarian because your intent was to have only a Sinhala-Buddhist agenda and for the State to essentially serve the interests of the Sinhala-Buddhists and only the Sinhala-Buddhists. Everybody else had to be subservient; they had to keep their mouth shut. If they were to assert their identity, then they should not have a place. They are seen as terrorists or enemies who need to be contained. So, it is in that backdrop, Sir, that you had this so-called "Ceylonese" identity initially, which then became a Sri Lankan identity, that you had the non-Sinhala-Buddhists essentially realizing that they do not belong to that identity because that identity, in effect, is only Sinhala-Buddhist and not "Sri Lankan" as a common identity. So, it is for those reasons that we began to exist. Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan and Sir P. Arunachalam were Members of the Ceylon National Congress. Sir P. Arunachalam had to leave. He was a thoroughly disillusioned man. He fought for the Independence of Sri Lanka, Ceylon at that time. He was thoroughly disillusioned and had to leave because his notion of a "Ceylonese identity, which was all-encompassing, was dashed because the moment Sri Lanka was able to, in some way, try and manage its own affairs, he was sidelined; he was not even able to rely on the assurances that were given to him.

The irony is, bringing in the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation Bill, the sort of comments the Minister of Justices made this morning alone, in my view, Sir, are enough for us to vote against this Bill and that is what we are going to do. We will be calling for a Division and will be voting against this Bill.

But, Sir, that is not the only reason for our decision. What is the context in which this Bill is being brought? There have been talks. The Hon. President announced to the whole world that he is going to find a negotiated solution to the Tamil national question. He first said, before the Independence Day; soon after he became

President, before the following Independence Day, he said he would find a solution to this problem. We did not go for the talks because we know who he is. We have experience from 2001 onwards, that as Members of Parliament at that time and at the height of the peace process, we know how he dealt with that peace process. So, our party did not go for the talks, but the other Parties went. All the parties elected from the North and the East which went for the talks had very clearly stated that the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution is not a solution to the problem, that, if at all, it is merely a starting point. That is the mandate. They have not even got a mandate to discuss the Thirteenth Amendment. But, you have the President, even before the talks could reach a finality and at the very second instance, declaring that the Thirteenth Amendment, minus police and land powers and on the condition that everybody else agrees on the powers that have to be given to the provincial councils, will be implemented. So, there is no implementation of even what is already there in the Constitution; even what is there in the Constitution today, in his own words, the President is going to withdraw. He starts off by withdrawing police and land powers and then goes on to say that if only everybody else agrees will the other matters be, in some way, allowed to be handled by the province. The law is different, Sir. Our views are very clear: the Thirteenth Amendment gives absolutely no powers at all to the elected Chief Minister, on the contrary, it gives all the powers to the Governor and if at all, all other powers are vested in Colombo. Therefore, if at all, the provincial councils can only be the extension of the administration of the Hon. President through the Governor and not by the elected Chief Minister or for that matter, the Board of Ministers. So, this is the reality. A unilateral decision has been taken by the Hon. President that the solution is going to be what, in his view, would be the Thirteenth Amendment, not even what is in the Constitution today.

This law, Sir, makes the President the appointing authority of the members of the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation on the advice of the Minister. We know what the Ministers views are; he has already said that this morning. So, what is the point in having this Office? There is absolutely nothing that is going to come about it; this Office has nothing do to with reconciliation. It is essentially an Office that is being created, where you could have the Government decide unilaterally on what they think is reconciliation and then, take it to the grassroots and force it down the throats of a reluctant population. That is what this is all about.

I am also in the Sectoral Oversight Committee which considered this Bill. I did not agree to this Bill. However, there was an Amendment suggested by the Chairman of the Committee, who spoke just before me, where he said, At least let the appointing authority be the Constitutional Council; let there be some semblance of independence. But, that has been rejected by the Government.

So, this has nothing to do with reconciliation, nothing to do with actually discussing with aggrieved parties like the Tamil and Muslim parties and genuinely trying to

121 122

reconcile. Instead, what it is all about is window-dressing, to go before the international community which does not know the details and say that we have been good enough to give legal status to an office, a dedicated office that works for reconciliation. That is the only reason why you have created this. This, along with the the a bogus Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation or the "Truth Commission" that you all are going to bring in, the purpose of which is simply to ensure that criminal accountability for genocide would never be accepted in this Island - that is, the bogus reconciliation political process and the bogus "Truth Commission" which puts a full stop to any form of accountability to the crime of genocide that took place against the Tamil people - is to put the final nail in the coffin of reconciliation, justice and accountability. That is what is happening here and all of this is happening so that you can go before the Human Rights Council and the international community in March, make the bogus claim, "Sri Lanka is suffering economically and despite that, we are taking these steps. Kindly, do not put any more pressure" and get the international community to turn away. But, we are not falling for it, Sir. Therefore, we will be voting against it.

Sir, I will just say one more thing. Clause 10 (o) of this Bill, states, I quote:

"to guide and facilitate peace and reconciliation programmes conducted by local organisations including community based organisations;"

Why on earth do you have to guide them? What does that have got to do with local organizations? Why do you have to have contacts with local organizations? Why can they themselves not decide on what reconciliation is for them? No, this Subsection is going to be used to threaten local organizations and to insist that they fall in line with the Government with regard to reconciliation. Otherwise, they, too, would face the consequences of the PTA or any future legislations that would come for the purpose of trying to contain genuine voices from the grassroots, asking and demanding a political solution and justice.

Hon. Presiding Member, some of the speakers who spoke prior to me are lawyers. At least, that is what the world calls them. There is a golden rule in law to say that you do not give up the goodness of today because you have an imaginative better tomorrow. The UN Declaration of Human Rights states that all of us are equal. It is declared so, but am I equal to Bill Gates or am I equal to Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi?

No. In practical sense, we all are not . But, that is the ideal condition we are looking for. Therefore, peace and reconciliation are the ideal goals for all of us and as Sri Lankans, we should work towards that.

The first step starts today. I stand here as a victim and a witness to racism. In 1956, my parents house was burnt down; in 1971, my sisters house was burnt down and in 1983, I, as a young man, had to run for my life because my house was completely burnt down. Nobody can deny that, in this small country, we, both sides, have historicized racism; there is no way the pot could call the kettle black. History is very clear about it. Whether it is textual, practical or philosophical, we have been divided nations, not united nations. Therefore, if we look at the past and ask for the ideal medicine, you will never get that medicine. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we had to do that, we took the medicine that was available, because we had to survive and progress. Therefore, I would ask from those who call this a political gimmick, What do you prefer? The war ended in 2009 and about the way the war ended, everybody has questions, but are we, as a civilized nation and members of a State, not going to reconcile ourselves? That is exactly the question that everybody is trying to avoid. Everybody is trying to play their own political games so that, as they said, after the next election, they could look better. I think I want to be honest to the Hon Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms, who would also be contesting from the Colombo District. He does not have to do this. He also can play popular games when the election comes. No. This is a historical moment. Are we willing to sit down, reconcile and then take a step forward, however weak or a baby step it would be? Or, are we going to sit down in the same place and cry about our past and the unknown future?

[2.37 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Today, of the two Bills that have been brought in, one is the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation Bill. One issue I am really concerned about is, it is 14 years after the armed conflict that the Bill has been brought in and the Government has, in a sense, hurriedly brought this Bill to Parliament and want to get it passed. I would also say that, still, there has not been much of a discussion on the details of it with civil society participation. That is one of the biggest issues.

We know that we already have the Office on Missing Persons and now, you have brough in the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation and there is also a lot of talk about the Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation. The Commission for Truth was also talked about 14 years ago and I remember myself, at that time, going to South Africa with the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera to study the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission to see how, after a long conflict, our country and its people could be reconciled and even meeting Archbishop Desmond Tutu. But, nothing much has actually happened. That is the real issue.

Laws are important, but reconciliation is far beyond laws. So, one of issues I have is - you have the Office on Mission Persons, the OMP, the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation, which is now being given some legal basis and then, there is also conversation of a Truth, Unity and Reconciliation Commission - all these bodies may have overlapping mandates. So, should the legal system take over 14 years after a conflict, after thousands have gone missing and thousands have been killed, are we actually trying to resolve all these issues through these mechanisms or are we going through another charade of truth and reconciliation? So, this is really a question that arises because it has been so many years after the conflict. There had been thousands of cases where the Criminal Justice Law had been subverted to prevent accountability for extraordinary human rights violations over a period of time. This is not just about the minority communities of this country. Of course, the victims of the war were mainly Tamil-speaking people and there were other victims as well, but other human rights violations were also there over a long period of time. Kishali Pinto-Jayawardena, on the 02nd of July, 2023 on her "Focus on Rights" in "The Sunday Times" said that there had been thousands of cases where the Criminal Justice Law had been subverted to prevent accountability to extraordinary human rights violations. That is correct.

Today happens to be the 09th of January; yesterday was the 08th of January. I remember the 08th of January 15 years ago. I was not a politician then, but was in the private sector and a person of the civil society. On that day, the news came through that Lasantha Wickrematunga had been murdered near a defence establishment and I still remember the chill that it

137 138

created. I remember the reaction of the present President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who was the Leader of the Opposition at that time, when that news came and everybody was like, What is going on? What is happening? A journalists life has been taken because he has been writing against the Government, against those who are in power. He has been writing about them and exposing them .

Lasantha Wickrematunga is not my subject today, but he is emblematic of many in the media, particularly those in the North and the East, who basically sacrificed their lives as a result of this conflict. It was a killing in broad daylight, I remember that. Today, I would like to remind myself again of Lasantha Wickrematunga and I do that every year. I do that not only because of Lasantha, but because it is emblematic of actually having justice and upholding human rights in this country. Today, my question is, 15 years later - the then Leader of the Opposition is, today, the President of the country - still the Attorney-General has not made any headway on that. There is a need, therefore, for an independent Public Prosecutor because the State prosecutors are mishandling prosecutions in regard to torture and grave crimes, magistrates hearing cases are being transferred, family members of victims are not being represented and pardons are conferred by the Office of the President on convicted perpetrators of State-sanctioned murders of civilians. It is important that the prosecutorial and investigative arms have the discretion to make investigative and prosecutorial choices without fear of interference or repercussions. This must include decisions on whom to investigate, whom to charge, which charges are to be brought and which sentences are to be requested. These decisions must not be subject to Government influence or veto.

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka recently cautioned of arbitrary arrests, police raids without proper warrants and extrajudicial killings. Public confidence is being undermined even with the Yukthiya programme and that is why we need to be extremely careful. I salute the Judiciary of the country which recently declared those responsible for the current economic crisis in the country including former President, former Prime Minister, former Minister of Finance and former Secretaries to the Ministry of Finance and two former Governors of the Central Bank.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . . ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I am concluding, Sir.

Also, the court has recently talked about State officials including the Acting IGP with regard to torture, and those are judicial decisions, not political decisions.

So, Hon. Minister, you have brought in this Bill and I have just a few suggestions to make quickly. One objective of this Bill is to promote national unity and peaceful co-existence, which is very good. We believe that the composition of the decision-making board of ONUR would be more inclusive rather than one individual actually appointing the members so that it does not look partisan.

The second point I am making is, include ex-officio representatives from all the other bodies including the Office on Missing Persons, if the new Commission is coming up.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I am concluding, Sir.

My final point is, you are moving an Amendment to Clause 10 in page 10, where you delete and say, "to assist, guide and facilitate peace and reconciliation". My proposal, Hon. Minister, is, because you talk about a civil society here, remove the word "assist" and say, "guide and facilitate" or remove the word "guide" and say, "assist and facilitate civil society". I know that this problem is not about you, but we are putting the system right in this country.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) .

So, please consider removing the word "assist"; " " .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, just a few minutes ago, the Hon. Minister said that the late Hon. G. G.

On page 4 of that Act, it states that the late Hon. G. G. Ponnambalam voted "Nay".

I concede that late Hon. G. G. Ponnambalam voted for the Indian and Pakistani Residents (Citizenship) Act. That law was brought after the Ceylon Citizenship Act to give citizenship. You, as a person who cannot understand the laws, should not remain the Minister of Justice. That is my point.

[4.10 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Hon. Presiding Member, today, a very important Bill - the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation Bill - has been presented to Parliament for its Second Reading. When the initial Bill was drafted, we all were asked to come for a discussion in Parliament and it was chaired by the Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry, Minister of Foreign Affairs and -

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) It was not this Bill. That was the TRC Bill. This is a different one.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Of course, that is correct.

Anyway, what I was trying to point out was that there was a discussion held. When that Bill was also brought forward, we raised that there was no judicial mechanism in that. So, with no judicial mechanism in that Bill, we, as the Representatives of the victim community, rejected that and from then onwards, we still have not heard back from anybody as to how the justice mechanism is going to be included into that Bill. When we had the most recent meeting with the Hon. President also, we brought his attention to the fact that no changes had been made to it and the Hon. President said, We will discuss about that. But still, there is no progress on that as well.

So, again and again, what we see, Hon. Minister, is that there are various Bills being brought in to set up various offices. This Bill, I see again as one of those Bills that has been brought forward as mere eyewash. There are no real reconciliation efforts on the ground, there is no reconciliation happening from the Government side, but Bill after Bill is being presented. If we are to be very serious about reconciliation, we need to address the justice mechanism within transitional justice. Without there being any justice-centred approach, any

reconciliation efforts you bring forward would be rejected. You saw that the President went to Jaffna a few days ago and there were massive protests against the President. The President, on the other hand, was chairing the District Development Committee meeting and various other meetings, talking about various matters. But, that was not the primary concern of the people of the Northern Province. When he came to the Eastern Province also, there was a similar response.

Sir, the people of the North and the East had been constantly, again and again, voting for our party to ensure that there is a permanent political solution in this country. Since the end of the war, they had been voting for us to ensure that there is accountability in this country, but what we see is that you all are presenting Bill after Bill without the consensus of the victim community. So, where do you see reconciliation actually happening? Are you all really interested in reconciliation or are you really trying to appease whoever you want to, showing them that you are very serious about reconciliation?

Sir, I have a feeling that the Government has a sadists view. Setting up commissions, bringing in reconciliation efforts and relating their stories are to put the victims again under more stress. For them to believe that there is some genuine reconciliation going to happen, the things on the ground must change. You all had arrested people under the Prevention of Terrorism Act on the 28th of November, last year. Four of them had been released and the other six are still in jail. What is reconciliation when the right to memorialize the dead is also being taken away from our people? So, Hon. Minister, in whatever reconciliation efforts you may take, in whatever Bills you may present, if you all are not genuine and sincere and there is no justice mechanism, nothing will come out of it. And, even within the justice mechanism, there has to be some sort of international involvement, there have to be international judges or observers. I think when you were the Minister of Justice between 2015 and 2017 in the previous Government, there was some agreement about international involvement, but all that has been put aside now.

You know that the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation Bill or any Bill that you bring forward needs the approval and acceptance of the victim community, and as Representatives of the victim community, we reject this Bill. So, I will be voting against this Bill today. I think if you do not have the victims on board and if you do not have the support of the victims, none of these reconciliation efforts will actually work out.

Even on land issues, you all are doing the exact opposite of what reconciliation requires.

Over 200 cattle had been killed in Mailaththamadu and Madhavanai in the last two months. Why? Because some person wanted to start a pet project to change the demography of Batticaloa, to colonize it by bringing in illegal encroachers. The ones who are paying the price are the livestock farmers.

The Tamil people in Colombo are celebrating their New Year.

Sir, the pasture land owners in Batticaloa are still struggling. They cannot even take their cattle to their pasture land. So, Hon. Minister, what reconciliation are we talking about? Is reconciliation only one-sided? You need to get consensus from both sides.

Anyway, I am not agreeable to that.

( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody, Attorney-at-Law) Sir, my position is, a clear criterion has not been set out in appointing such professionals. Since these are appointments of professionals, it is always better to have a council, in which qualified professionals are represented.

2021 45,514 2022 7,956 2023 No data has been received.

(c) (i) The observations of the Coconut Research

Institute regarding the increase/decrease in coconut production before and after the ban on chemical fertilizer are given below:

It takes about three years to show the effect of chemical or organic fertilizer in coconut yield. Also, water, which is a major factor affecting the yield of coconuts, i.e., if the rainfall is at optimum level, its effect on yield is about 3 per cent to 40 per cent.

Therefore, the effect of limiting the import of fertilizer in the year 2021 will be reflected in the coconut yield from the year 2023. As per the forecast of the Coconut Research Institute, the coconut yield in the year 2023 is 2,957 million nuts. That is a decrease of about 434 million nuts compared to the year 2022.

As favourable weather conditions prevailed in the year 2022, the effect of non- application of fertilizer is not represented separately by these data.

(ii) The steps taken by the Coconut Research

Institute to increase the coconut production in Sri Lanka are given below:

1. Making the coconut growers aware

through the Coconut Cultivation Board to adopt Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) to improve the productivity of coconut cultivation. 2. Taking necessary steps to increase

the number of seedlings produced from the high-quality hybrid coconut varieties produced per year As well, the steps taken by the Coconut Cultivation Board to increase the coconut production in Sri Lanka from 2016 to 2023 (November) are given below:

(1) During the period from 2016 to 2023 (November), the Coconut Cultivation Board has provided 21.33 million coconut seedlings to the coconut growers at a concessionary price. The number of coconut seedlings provided annually is given in the table below.
