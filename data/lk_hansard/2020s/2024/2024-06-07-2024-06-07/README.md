: :

GENDER EQUALITY BILL: DETERMINATION OF THE SUPREME

COURT

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I wish to inform Parliament that I have received the Determination of the Supreme Court in respect of the Bill titled Gender Equality, which was challenged in the Supreme Court in terms of Article 121(1) of the Constitution.

In the said Determination, the Supreme Court has determined the constitutionality of the Bill as follows:-

The Supreme Court held that the promulgation of

this Bill is inconsistent with Article 12 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has also held that the objects of this Bill in Clause 2 read with Clause 3 and Clause 4 would be inconsistent with Articles 9, 10, 12, 14(1)(e) and 27(1)(g) of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has also held that Clauses 4, 7, 17, 18, 25, 26 and 27 are inconsistent with Articles 9, 10, 12(1), 14(1)(e), 14(1)(f), 27(1)(g) of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has held that power being vested in the Council set up under Clauses 5 and 6 read with Clause 7 are inconsistent with Articles 9, 10, 12(1), 14(1)(e), 14(1)(f) and 27(1)(g) of the Constitution.

Therefore, Clauses 17 and 18 of the Bill, which set out the requirement of the office of Gender Focal Point, and the provisions in Clauses 8 to 16 and 19 to 24 of the Bill, which are incidental provisions for the existence, management and exercise of powers and duties of the Council are also inconsistent with Articles 9, 10, 12(1), 14(1)(e), 14(1)(f) and 27(1)(g) of the Constitution.

The objects of the Bill are inconsistent with

Articles 3, 4(d), 9 and 10 of the Constitution and they are inseparable from the other provisions of the Bill. Therefore, the Supreme Court has determined that the Bill, as a whole, is inconsistent with Articles 3, 4(d), 9 and 10 of the Constitution.

The Supreme Court has determined that the Bill,

as a whole, cannot be enacted into law, unless the appropriate procedure laid down in Article 83 and/or Article 84 read with Article 80 of the Constitution, which requires that the number of votes cast in favour thereof must amount to not less than two-thirds of the whole number of Members of Parliament (including those not present), is approved by the people at a Referendum.

I order that the Determination of the Supreme Court be printed in the Official Report of todays Proceedings of the House.

So, now, I am not in a position to answer that, but if you raise a separate Question on the VFS, Hon. Member, we can get down the details and give an answer.

I was ready for it because I knew that this question would be raised by you. Generally, you like to raise questions and come into arguments with me because your prime focus is the camera. So, do not worry, I will allow you to have your statement made before the camera.

. . . . - ISB holders - that we have agreed for a 7 per cent haircut. The point I am trying to make is, when the negotiations and discussions are still going on, it is not fair that some outsider - of course, you have all the right to say what you want - comes and makes a description of what the decision of the Government is going to be. That is the point I am trying to make. The whole restructuring process was approved in Parliament and once the discussions were concluded, we have presented a Report on the discussions. Similarly, once the ongoing discussions with the ISB holders are concluded, we will certainly report to Parliament because it is good for all the Members to know what the outcome is.
