. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Speaker, I rise, on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition, the other Hon. Members of the Opposition as well as my own party, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, to congratulate you on your attainment of this high Office. This Office, in particular, is called the guardian of all our rights. So, we expect you to function impartially in this Office and to uphold the decorum and traditions of this House.

Particularly with your ascension, Sir, we have come to realize that the accountability of this high Office is such that though whatever institutional safeguards or constitutional safeguards maybe there, sometimes, the media and its impact on matters of good governance play a crucial role. That is why within a short period of time, we have had to elect a new Speaker once again. I believe this is a very good example for everyone. In the same vein, we would also like to appreciate the former Speaker who had tendered his resignation, bowing to the criticism that arose. We are proud that, in keeping with such traditions, this House has been able to display that type of decorum to the people and the country.

Also, we should, in the meantime, ensure that the conduct of affairs in this House is done to such a degree that all those who have to bow down to criticism would use this Chamber, in all fairness, to vindicate themselves by very high conduct. Therefore, Sir, your ascension to Office in these circumstances is very important. We, once again, wish you all the very best in your exalted Office!

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Gayantha Karunatilleka) . . .

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Speaker, at the outset, let me congratulate you on being elected the Speaker of this august Assembly. It behoves you as well to bring back decorum to this august Assembly and we, as Members of Parliament, will give

1033 1034

our unstinted support to ensure that you carry out and discharge that responsibility to the best of your ability. You have been elected as the Speaker of the entire Parliament and I am sure that you would discharge that responsibility to the best of your ability. I wish you all the best on behalf of the United National Party and the NDF!

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Jeevan Thondaman) , .

Sir, I would like to wish you strength and wisdom in conducting the Proceedings in a fair and equitable manner. You have been appointed at a very crucial period, where we are recovering from our economic crisis. Also, amidst one of the largest single-party majorities this country has witnessed, the degree of equity should be higher.

Once again, Sir, I would like to wish you all the best and we would provide you with our fullest support.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) .. . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you. But, at the same time, I must also say that I do not envy your job because you are a Member of a party which has just been elected with over a two-thirds majority and coming from that party and taking up the position of the Speaker means that you must disregard that mandate to some extent because your job here is not about that mandate, but rather to safeguard the interests of every single Member of Parliament and also be fair by all parties present in this Parliament disregarding their mandates.

Sir, in that respect, I would like to urge you to learn from the mistakes of the previous Parliament, which also had a two-thirds majority, but where minor parties were not given adequate hearing and chances because the previous Parliament chose to stick to outdated Standing Orders not reflecting particularly the composition of the Opposition of that Parliament.

Sir, ultimately, it is you who are the custodian, the protector, the final interpreter and the arbiter of the Standing Orders. So, I urge you to show that flexibility and progressiveness when you make the Rulings after hearing the views of this House. If you would be fair, you can be assured of the Tamil National Peoples Fronts fullest support.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) () . () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramanathan Archchuna) Good morning to the Hon. Speaker and my Colleagues in Parliament!

Sir, I would like to congratulate you and I am so proud that a Colleague from my profession has become the Hon. Speaker. Again, I wish you all the very best and hope you would do what is necessary for the Government you are coming from as well as to the Opposition parties we represent.

Thank you so much. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Dilith Jayaweera) . . .

That is what we are asking for.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION BY HON. (DR.) RIZVIE

SALIH

() ( ) ( ( ) - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rizvie Salih - Deputy Speaker and the Chair of Committees) Hon. Speaker, I wish to clear my name from the totally false, malicious smear campaigns now trading on social media.

There is an allegation that I had falsely referred to myself as a specialist doctor. I wish to clearly state that during the last General Election, certain third-party workers featuring the names of common candidates of my party incorrectly referred to me as a specialist doctor. That term has never been used by me in my clinic letterheads, prescription pads, official seals, stationery or visiting cards. As soon as I became aware of this error in the common list of candidates for Colombo, I instructed the relevant individuals to halt the distribution of those materials and to ensure that no further circulation occurred. However, by that time, some of the leaflets had already been distributed. Furthermore, any of us who have addressed political meetings, big or small, know that those introducing us, sometimes, exaggerate us with glorified titles or comparisons, which is unfounded.

1101 1102

2024 17

I also want to make myself clear that I possess a Postgraduate Diploma in ENT Surgery. That was in the era when the Ministry of Health along with the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine selected doctors, after having competitive exams among them, for courses of study, awarded them diplomas in their relevant fields and sent them to man the base hospitals which mainly lacked those specialities. At that time, there were exams held to recruit doctors for training under specialized units in main hospitals. There were diplomas in child health, ophthalmology and laryngo-otorhinology and even anaesthetists were trained and awarded diplomas so that they could go and manage base hospitals where such specialties lacked and such consultants were not available. Likewise, I was also selected after a competitive exam by the Ministry of Health and trained as a DLO surgeon to serve in such hospitals.

My last appointment in the government health sector was as ENT Surgeon in the Base Hospital, Nuwara Eliya. The Nuwara Eliya Base Hospital caters to a wide segment of the estate population, very useful contributors to the economy of this country. But, it is sad to say that in that era more than now, they were highly compromised healthcare-wise. We performed surgeries, which were life-saving. Whenever there is an airway obstruction, Hon. Speaker, you, as a doctor, know how important a surgical procedure a tracheostomy is for the removal of that foreign body from the airway, which, otherwise, would certainly cause death, and there is no time to transfer the patient to another hospital. From the Nuwara Eliya Base Hospital, the ambulance has to go all the way to the Peradeniya Hospital and there was no time for such transfers as it would have certainly caused death. Therefore, I am glad that the Ministry of Health along with the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine made that wise decision at that time to train us with such specialities so that we could be sent to make a contribution at the base hospitals. So, that was my last posting.

I again wish to reiterate that since 2019 when the Sri Lanka Medical Council brought in regulations to have specialists registered or even before that, I never identified myself as an ENT surgeon or an ENT specialist.

However, in Nuwara Eliya, you could imagine, when I walked into the ENT clinic, they addressed me as "ENT surgeon". When the doctor with a Diploma in Opthalmology -DO- walks into the eye clinic, they address him "eye surgeon". Even the doctors with a DCH -Diploma in Child Health- are called "paediatricians" there. I never advocated them to call me ENT sugeon, but what were I to do when they did? I was not going to knock on the heads of the patients who called me that. They might call me "ENT surgeon" and that is wrong nomenclature, but that is the fact I could point out. So, I think somebody who probably knew me from that time went and included that title in the poster. That was a poster for the common candidates from my party, with which I had nothing to do. But, the very little canvassing material that I printed never carried that title.

Another malicious allegation is that I am not a doctor and that I am not even registered to practise in Sri Lanka! I categorically state that that claim is blatantly false, misguided and misleading. To set the record straight, I would like to say that I hold a valid Certificate of Registration from the Sri Lanka Medical Council, which unequivocally states in black and white that I am lawfully entitled to practise medicine and surgery in Sri Lanka. That certifice, like all the Sri Lanka Medical Council-issued certificates, needs to be validated every five years with a payment of a fee. Sir, you know that and I have done that validation five times since I first received it. My private general practice is registered in the Colombo Central under my name. My SLMC registration, in turn, is validated every year by the Private Health Services Regulatory Council attached to the Ministry of Health. I would like to say that the Provincial Director comes, inspects my clinic, inspects my documents, goes through the procedures in my dispensary and the little laboratory I have and makes sure that everything is in order before it is validated. I have always conducted myself professionally in my public life with transparency and honesty and I welcome scrutiny. Finally, I thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to address this matter, whether it stems from genuine concern or malicious intent. Sir, I table* the relevant documents.

Hon. Speaker, we have significant challenges ahead and I hope our collective focus will shift to addressing the pressing issues which truly matter for the progress and prosperity of this nation.

Thank you.

Sir, I filled up a bio data form, which only had "Mr. Harshana Nanayakkara" and I was also shown the computer screen.

But then, when a friend of mine called me and said, "Your name is there on the Parliament website as "Dr. Harhana

Proctors. 1873 the Council of Legal Education established the Law College and the Law College was born. From that time, there were two types of exams, one for the Proctors and the other for the Advocates. . 1973 a huge change took place. The Administration of Justice Law (No. 44 of 1973) merged the two professions. To date, in England, Barristers and Solicitors remain separate as specialized branches. But, in Sri Lanka, from 1973, everybody is an Attorney-at-Law. There cannot be any "" after that, except in the Attorney-Generals Department because the Attorney-Generals Department has been using the titles "State Attorney" and "State Counsel" and the Sinhala translation is " ".

deliverables due to the way we have conducted the process, Madam Chair, we have instilled confidence not only into local investors, but also into international investors. We have seen record-breaking performance in the Colombo Stock Exchange. Therefore, we are so humbled and happy to announce now that even the international community has recognized our efforts and accepted nearly everything we have offered. Out of the 11 series of Bonds, 10 series - I am being informed - have been accepted 100 per cent, as of now. One of them is pending due to legal challenges. That shows the confidence they have in our deliverables and the performance resulting from the genuine approach we are taking. Creditors understand that it is not an easy situation, but they know that they can trust the new Government. That is how we were able to finalize our Staff-level Agreement within a short period of time.

Similarly, we are determined to continue this journey to get maximum benefits for the citizens of this country, to continue the growth trajectory we have started and provide maximum relief to the SME sector, enabling them to start production. Why? It is not of a US Dollars 18 billion economy that you all - the previous governments - had built over a period of 70-odd years that we are talking. Within a limited period, we are planning to grow our export economy by 100 percent. So, you can imagine the effort we are supposed to make to reach the destination we are planning to. Therefore, we cannot take haphazard decisions; we cannot take irresponsible decisions. As a responsible Government, we have a plan in place, we have a team that is capable of delivering it.

. . . . . You all actually justified the unjust treatment meted out to the Employees Provident Fund in the Domestic Debt Restructure. Therefore, we propose that the already approved Domestic Debt Restructure for the Employees Provident Fund be amended by including a state-contingent debt instrument similar to what has been agreed with the ISB holders or a clawback clause agreed with the bilateral creditors. Given the expected upside and better than baseline performance, this amendment can be structured in a way not to disturb the parameters of the DSA. . . that it is so lucrative that everybody is jumping to get it. Everybody is jumping to get it!

The primary function of Parliament is legislating laws and financial control; .

. . .

Otherwise, it is illegal and unconstitutional. If it is a sovereign debt which we all are bound by, bankruptcy must be declared by Parliament. But, all the oversight Committees, the then Opposition as well as the Hon. Members at that particular moment in Parliament had overlooked that fact.

Now, there is no point in bringing new ideas or any suggestions because this is a done deal, which is basically going to be useful for the country in its move forward. Some governments were making various statements, but finally all reconciled to the fact that this is the only way forward. The Government of the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe had to bear the burden of the entire process, recoil the entire problem that was there and take the process forward. . . . " " .

So, the story goes on. On the 01st of September, 2022, the Staff-level Agreement between the IMF and the Government is reached to check debt sustainability and to decide on the way forward for the restructuring of debt. On the 20th of February, 2023, the IMF team comes to Colombo and sits down for discussions with the Government of Sri Lanka and ensures that debt restructuring and debt sustainability is looked at for their viability. Then, on the 20th of March, 2023, the IMF approves the Agreement. Later, it is brought to Parliament, debated and voted on. Then, the Extended Fund Facility - EFF - effectively comes into place. That basically bestows on the Government almost US Dollars 3 billion or SDR 2.286 billion, which is the specific deposit to be reserved and utilized under a 48-month programme. So, that is the start of the IMF programme which comes into effect from the 20th of March, 2023.

Debt restructuring has been in three stages. The first stage was Domestic Debt Restructuring, which happened on the 01st of July, 2023, where the domestic debt was looked at and a solution was provided. There were weak points which could be looked at and debated, but finally, that particular first step was taken with the least impact. Then, the second was, bilateral and multilateral debt. The Paris Club and the countries which are not in the Paris Club, all got together with the Official Creditor Committee co-chaired by Japan and India under the

auspices of France and confirmed on the 26th of June, 2024 that there is agreement between the Official Creditor Committee and the Government of Sri Lanka. So, that gives the right to start the second step, and the restructuring process comes into place.

By any chance, if this Agreement had not been fulfilled, then what would have been the implications to the country? We would have had to face the impact of economic instability, loss of investor confidence, social unrest, a humanitarian crisis and strained international relations. Then, on the other side, by restructuring debt, the benefits accrued to the country are, restored access to international markets -Sri Lanka had been shied away at that particular moment by creditors, where we were not able to even open LCs, Hon. Presiding Member- economic stability, IMF support, improved credit ratings and economic growth. Lack of those were the factors which basically led the country to totter at that particular moment with the leadership of the Government gone, and the responsibility fell on the then President Ranil Wickremasinghe to carry the baby forward.

With that crisis, Sir, what was left behind for the country? We had US Dollars 100 billion debt with domestic debt being at US Dollars 57.3 billion and external debt at US Dollars 43.2 billion, out of which bilateral debt is US Dollars 10.6 billion, multilateral debt, US Dollars 11.6 billion and the balance being ISBs. Debt sustainability was one of the biggest problems at that particular moment. There were many visits from the IMF and debt sustainability was being looked at, various ideas came about and the least harmful aspect was being looked at. I do not think any government has faced this type of situation before. I, being a former Minister of Finance, must say that we had discussions with the IMF on the 16th EFF and we found that discussing with such people was not an easy task.

But, I must say that we have the right to decide. While they can have their say, we must have our way and that is the way to negotiate with these foreigners. Just because they have experience, it does not necessarily mean that we need to get pushed and cornered. Debt sustainability was looked at and Government debt from 2024 to 2048 was US Dollars 60 billion with the interest and the capital payment. So, debt servicing was looked at. With those factors being looked at, the second stage was over.

Then, the third stage was the most difficult aspect, having to deal with commercial creditors including international sovereign bond holders and the China Development Bank. On the 19th of September, 2024, just two days before the Presidential Election, they come into an agreement in principle and with that, the then Government signs the Agreement two days before the election. It was thought that that was a deal, an election "gundu made just before the Presidential Election. Finally, it was proven that it was a done deal. Then, the Government changed.

I must say that the NPP had a completely different opinion on this matter, but with that opinion, they went before the people at the Presidential Election and won.

The Government changed and then, the IMF and the Hamilton Reserve Bank was informed on the 01st of November, 2024 by the new Government that they would still pursue the same process adopted by the Wickremesinghe Government. Then, on the 12th of December, 2024, we had the restructuring of Macro-linked Bonds concluded.

There may be many differences of opinion that could come about, but the problem is, if there had been no Agreement in place, then this country would have been in jeopardy or a much more dangerous situation would have prevailed. There is a quote which said, "A good plan of today is better than a great plan of tomorrow. Look back with satisfaction and move forward with confidence." So, on that particular basis, as I said, there could be various opinions like "Could negotiations not have been done better?", "Would the haircut not have been a greater rate rather than 28 per cent?" or "Would the GDP-linked bonds not be on a more successful rate?". Many options may be put forward, but the time is running out. People have been looking up to the then Government; businessmen have been suffering; small and medium businesses have been virtually non-existent with 30,000 to 40,000 companies having gone bankrupt. So, that was the reason why the Government under President Ranil Wickremesinghe had to go for this debt reconciliation process and ensure that a final conclusion had been brought to that. When the new Government came, there was a Hobson's choice for them. You all could consider getting back to the negotiating stage.

the new Government must get their act together. You cannot leave the war only in the spans of the soldiers, the Generals must take commands. You can leave the economy only in the hands of government servants, but the political direction must be given. That is the necessity at this particular moment.

Then, coming back to the economy, now, that you have an agreement in place, you have to get the economy moving. . . . . . Statutory Reserve Ratio 8.5 8 . Single-digit lending rate . . . .
