Hon. Speaker, for the foregoing reasons and since there is the second Nakba now taking place particularly in the Rafah Region of the Gaza Strip, this Parliament urges the international community, through all means available, be it the UN General Assembly, the Security Council, the International Court of Justice or the International Criminal Court, to forthwith ensure a permanent ceasefire, punish the perpetrators as war criminals and guarantee the setting up of an independent, sovereign Palestine.

Having said that, Sir, let me say that right now, in various parts of the world, protests are taking place against Israeli attacks on Palestine. It is very evident that encampments are being set up in US universities and that universities in various other parts of the world, too, are now rising up against what is happening in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. We must understand that with the progeny of the Holocaust, many Jews are now taking part in these protests against the Israeli Government, calling upon the Israeli Government to bring this horrendous war to an end. But, the entire world seems toothless when it comes to Israel.

The founding ideology of the ethnonational Jewish State contained a few Palestinians and they would have ideally wanted no Palestinians to exist within the Israeli Territory. But, the fact remains that there is the Gaza Strip now, there is the West Bank, there is East Jerusalem and that there is also quite a number - almost 30 per cent - of Arabs living within the State of Israel apart from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights.

Therefore, Sir, it is now time for us to call this to a halt. In this regard, it is important for us to realize the whole attempt by Prime Minister Netanyahu with his original pledge that he will free the hostages. None of us want the hostages to be harmed and all the peace-loving people in the world want all those hostages to be released. We make that appeal to Hamas, to see that they are released unharmed. But, unfortunately, there may be a few, who would have already met with their deaths. Then, recently, the Egyptian negotiators, along with the Qatari negotiators, came to negotiate with Hamas and the Israeli demand to release all the hostages, both civilian and

1675 1676

military hostages - was placed before them. The Israelis did not expect Hamas to accept that condition. But, with Hamas having accepted that condition, Israel has now gone back on it. What does it show? It shows that it has never been the intention of the current Israeli administration to free the hostages. They want to finally sacrifice their hostages and eliminate the entire civilian population from the Gaza Strip. This is an unfolding genocide and this has to be called into question. Therefore, we see that the hostages are simply a sideshow.

By yesterday, even the Egyptian Government has publicly announced that they will support the South African demand to haul up the Israeli Government. That is, for the case before the ICJ, the Egyptians will also start supporting. It is unfortunate that many countries in the region still maintain diplomatic relations with Israel despite the fact that such atrocities are taking place. Therefore, in the name of humanity, we are requesting that even we take a bold stand against what is happening today in Gaza.

Sir, the Hon. State Minister of Foreign Affairs is here. The other day during a Parliamentary debate, I heard him bragging about the achievement of the President. What is the achievement? He said, "We have balanced the Israelis and the Iranians. We got the Iranian President to come here and also sent our naval forces to the Red Sea". What a shame, Hon. State Minister of Foreign Affairs! You claim that this is one of the biggest achievements in your Foreign Policy. What a shame! Then, you collected money from poor civilians all over our country - from various mosques, schools and various others - for the people in Gaza and are now posing for photographs. There are some shameless Parliamentarians also going and posing with them. Some of our Parliamentarians are also seen posing for photographs, handing over this money. So, what is your President doing? He is rocking the cradle while pinching the baby! That is what he is doing by going and supporting the American request. We have become virtual slaves to the US.

This "bear-hug diplomacy" - that is what they call it - by President Biden is the main cause for this. They are giving the Israelis bombs; they are giving 2,000-pound bombs to bomb the entire Gaza Strip, whereas the entire Democratic Party or a vast majority of them are against the military assistance that is being given to this genocidal Israeli administration.

. . rose.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. State Minister, you can reply later; you will have your time.

What I am doing is, I am calling into question your justification and bragging about this whole concept. - [Interruption.] Hon. Speaker, I have very limited time. Sir, I am also taking the time allotted to the Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana. Please add that time as well to my time.

I know that the Hon. State Minister is very restless when we try to point out his slavish

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

attitude towards this imperialist US administration and the Israelis. Then, what about your Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment? He is sending poor Sri Lankan workers to Israel. To do what? To work in the Israeli farms, to fill the vacancies created by the poor Gaza civilians! Israel chase the Gaza people out, deprive their livelihood, kill them in thousands - they kill children, women and old people - and since vacancies have been created in those farms due to that, you send our poor Sri Lankan workers there! Because of the economic plight your Government has pushed this country into, there are no other means for our people also and there are people who are willing to go and work there. . [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) . .

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. State Minister, you go ahead and reply. ( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Sir, first of all, I regret the attitude of the Hon. Member. I think he is also misrepresenting what I stated. I stated that we took part in the Combined Maritime Forces because it is in our interest. Though the Hon. Member wants to cut all ties with Israel, we, as Government, have to look at Sri Lankas interests. That does not mean we would abandon the people of Palestine. I think the Hon. Member is extremely jealous of the the Foreign Policy we adopt and the good links the President and we have with all the countries. So, I am very sorry that the Hon. Member feels that way.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) The Hon. State Minister took one-and-a-half minutes and I will add it to your time, Hon. Hakeem.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Sir, one has to sing for his supper, is that not so? You see, as the State Minister of Foreign Affairs, he has to sing for his supper. The President is the provider. Therefore, he has to sing his praises. So, we do understand that. - [Interruption.] There is no problem, Hon. State Minster.

Then, those monies collected to be given to the people of Gaza had also been collected by the poor people of our country and you go and pose for photographs handing over that money. That is not the issue. If you really want to help the poor Gaza people, call for action against Israel in the International Criminal Court; support the cause of the South African Government. the South African President and the Brazilian President! They are the leaders! You know that the entire Third World is against this horrible crime that is being committed.

Sir, this is white supremacism and settler colonialism that is taking place; it is a settler colonialist, white supremacist project to see that the entire Middle East is always kept in turmoil. They are the people who killed all those poor Jews in hundreds of thousands. Not only under Hitler, but several years before Hitler, they started killing Jews in their hundreds of thousands. All that was done by the same white supremacists. Now, they want to wash off all their sins and that is why they went and agreed to this horrendous plan.

Now, Sir, look at the plan. When you look at these documents I have here with me, you can see what has happened to Israel. This document shows how Israel was in 1917 and how the entire land area expanded by 1948. Then,we can see how it further expanded by 1995 and finally, their land area at present. After Trumps conceptual map, we see that the Palestinian Territory has been shrunk to small pockets. The Palestinians have been pushed into such desperation, but still, Israel keeps on grabbing lands.

Sir, I am tabling* this Report titled "State of Palestine: Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and the Occupied Syrian Golan".

Sir, this is a document produced by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. See how Israeli settlements are spread all over the

1679 1680

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

Occupied Territories of Palestine. Having grabbed their land and having killed 750,000 people way back in 1948, Israel still continue to murder people in open daylight, in front of the entire media of the world. And, when some media start reporting that, they ban them from reporting; Al Jazeera had been banned from reporting in the Occupied Territories.

Sir, I must say that even the other States around the war zone must also stand up and call the bluff. There is no point in having diplomatic relations. They cite the Abraham Accords and various other things and try to somehow curry favour with the US imperialists because they are also depending on them for some supplies. Then, see how bravely the Iranians replied to Israel by sending those missiles; they did not bother. Israel bombed the Iranian Embassy in Syria; that was an invitation to war. The Iranians were very strategic. The Iranian President and their military officials retaliated so as to say, "We can strike you, Israel. However much you try to have your own Iron Dome and various other things, we have the power to strike you, if we want to." They taught them a lesson. Thereafter, Israel is now silent because they do not want a regional war. If a regional war starts, then what happens?

See what is happening in Ukraine. Who started the war? It was, again, Biden and his party. The entire US administration has to be responsible for what is happening to Ukrainians. They try to bring President Putin before the International Criminal Court, but have no guts to question Netanyahu; only President Putin is a war criminal. What about Netanyahu? What is this double standard? That is what we are asking.

Where is our President in this? I know he goes and boxes in the international arena. Sometimes, he goes and boxes beyond his weight. In the Climate Change Summit and other places, he is able to box beyond his weight, but when it comes to the Israelis, he acts " ." That is his role. But, that would not do. We must appreciate our former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was brave enough, whenever this issue came up, to openly side with the Palestinians and who did not want to mess around. Palestinians have named a street in Palestine after him, in honour of what he did. President Premadasa was also someone who was able to send back the Israeli Interest Section from Sri Lanka. But, does this President have guts to do so when such atrocities are taking place? You just want to collect Muslim votes. Not only the Muslims, but the entire Sinhala community, the right-thinking people in this country, everybody is against what is happening in Gaza. Also see what is happening in US campuses, how the students are rising up against these atrocities? They are questioning their own universities and their funding arrangements.

Sir, in this situation, I earnestly call upon Parliament to take this Adjournment Motion very seriously, pressurizing our Government, our country to take a bold stand, to call into question the actions of the Israeli

Government and even threaten - I am not urging them to do it right away - to withdraw diplomatic ties with them, if they continue with these horrendous crimes in the Occupied Territories of Palestine.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) .

So, Hon. Deputy Speaker, we have always stood by the two-state solution, with the State of Israel and the State of Palestine coexisting as nation states peacefully side by side. However, the present Israeli administration has embarked on a process of State terrorism or State-sponsored terrorism to vaporize the Palestinian people from Mother Earth; . That is the strategy of the Israeli Government. Societies in the western world including the United States and the United Kingdom have, in no uncertain terms, unreservedly, condemned the State-sponsored terrorist attacks of Israel against Palestine. This is an attempt to annihilate Palestine. We have to decide, are we, as Sri Lankans, going to be patient observers of the State-sponsored terrorism of Israel or are we going to take a proactive stand, walk the talk and do something productive to establish permanent peace, permanent reconciliation, permanent friendship and brotherhood between Israel and Palestine? We have seen throughout the years that there had been many an attempt by policy-makers, decision-makers and leaders who have been in their political extremes, in the name of peace, reaching compromises, coming together and following the middle path. That is how Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin arrived at peace; that is how Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat compromised and came to an agreement. But, unfortunately, extremists on both sides destroyed that peace process.

. . . . . . . .

. . . .

So, I propose that, today, the Sri Lankan Parliament resolves unreservedly, without preconditions and reservations, that this State-sponsored terrorism of Israel must stop; the military aggression has to stop. The terrible carnage that has been carried out and the immense devastation caused are unbearable to us all human beings. - - .

. . . . they are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. - International humanitarian law - permanent members . . I urge the permanent members of the UN Security Council to follow the highest principles of ethics, morality, decency, humanitarianism, adhere to the laudable principles of the international humanitarian law and protect the Palestinians rights, to protect their right to life. . Do not make this just another event in the global battle for attaining supremacy, in the balance of power struggles. This is a humanitarian issue; . . ?

[12 Noon] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for the time allotted for me to speak on this very important Adjournment Motion that has been moved by the Hon. Rauff Hakeem. I wish to approve of and support the sentiments expressed by the Proposer and the Seconder of this Motion.

The situation that prevails in Palestine today is horrible, a very serious issue and cannot be ignored by any civilized country or people. Sir, while I speak on that issue, I will also refer, later in my speech, to the doublespeak and hypocrisy shown by the Members of this House as they debated this issue. Much was said about the hypocrisy of the West, the white supremacists and I concur with those sentiments. The world is aghast at the blatant hypocrisy that the western nations promote or pay lip service to human rights, the international humanitarian law, genocide, persecution and international crimes of that nature. They are turning a blind eye, not only just

turning a blind eye but they are also supporting State terrorism that is being prosecuted by the State of Israel on the hapless people of Palestine.

The political situation of this issue is rather complicated. As I said at the last Adjournment Motion on this same subject debated in this House, I do not wish to go into that aspect but only limit myself to the concern for humanitarian issues. People are being killed on a mass scale; a disproportionate number of children have died already and women and children who have died account for more than half the number of the dead. That demonstrates the injustice of this whole operation.

It is also important to note that there is a complicit arrangement between Hamas and the State of Israel, much the same way the Easter Sunday bombings happened in this country. It is always useful for leaders of countries whose popularity is dipping to show an enemy of the State and then become popular on that. This is the most heinous way of remaining in power. We have seen that happening in our country, too. But, what is happening in Palestine is being exposed by the right-thinking people in the western nations today, not only those in the western nations, but also by the right-thinking Jewish people. I have seen a video of a Holocaust survivor who says, Not in my name, not in our name and he explains how what is happening today is very similar to what he and others had to undergo under the Nazi regime. He cites similarities and says, How can I support this? This cannot be done in my name." Yes, the Holocaust was a horrible thing that happened to the Jews. But, what they are doing now to the people in Palestine is exactly similar.

A lot of people even in this country choose to support Israel and many of them belong to the Christian Church. I can criticize this being a Christian myself. They somehow think that since that is a Promised Land, nobody else should live there. That is contrary to what the scriptures of the Jews and the Christians say. There is repeated exhortation in the Torah, the Holy Book of the Jewish people, to treat the others well in their country, to treat the aliens very well, reminding them that they themselves were aliens in Egypt under bondage. I am not suggesting that either the Palestinian people or the Israelites are aliens in Palestine. No, that is not what I am saying. What I am saying is, the exhortation to them is, Do not treat the others in the way you yourself were treated. Remember how you struggled for your freedom. Remember the injustices that were perpetrated on you and do not repeat that on others.

What is happening today is so sad that a race which was almost annihilated - six million of them perished - and which gave rise to the concept of genocide themselves are now doing this to the others. This must stop. And, we, so far away from that theatre, are concerned and we must be concerned. That is not an internal affair of Israel, as much as what happened in this country is not an internal affair of Sri Lanka. When international crimes are committed, it is an international concern. We are hypocritical when we say what happened in Sri Lanka is an internal matter for Sri Lanka,

1697 1698

but what happens in Palestine is not an internal matter for Israel. That is also a doublespeak I want to expose, not only the doublespeak of the West.

Sir, I would like to refer to this particularly week. This is the week in the month of May that we commemorate the large scale of civilians who were slaughtered in Mullivaikkal by State forces knowingly that there were more than 400,000 people trapped in a war zone and without any due regard for their lives or for their safety. That is why we use the symbolism of kanji and we will commemorate them through this week, solemnly remembering what our people had to undergo under Sri Lankan State terrorism that was unleashed on our people. We have a right to commemorate that. The Israelites themselves do something like this, eat the Passover meal. They celebrate the Passover festival by eating unleavened bread to remember that they had to hurriedly make roti before the dough leavened and hurriedly leave Egypt from bondage. They have done this for centuries, for more than a millennium to remember that and as an oral tradition, pass on the story to the future generations. And, we will also do that; we are doing it. It is a solemn occasion where we remember that our people, during those days, could not even have access to kanji, so desperate was the situation. Internationally a commemoration has a very important place. To stop a commemoration of that nature itself exposes the face of the State. That is what happened two days ago in Sampur, where a few women were commemorating this event by cooking kanji and distributing it, remembering their own dead in Mullivaikkal during those times. And, what did the police do? The police got an order from the Magistrate. I cannot even begin to wonder what that Magistrate was doing giving such an order. But, the police got an order. Then, later in the night, male police officers went to that place. We saw video footages of those females being dragged away, kicking and screaming, by the police. All for what? For drinking kanji and for remembering their dead just the same way this House is expressing concern today over people being bombed in Palestine. But, you all did it to our people and today, you do not even allow us to remember that occasion in a solemn way. So, what are your standards? Is this not doublespeak? Is this not utter hypocrisy? You are so concerned about the people of Palestine and so are we. We stand in solidarity with the people of Palestine because we know what it was to suffer at the hands of State terrorist forces. We know it. So, we stand with them in solidarity and we can speak about it.

It is a matter of regret that the Mover of this Adjournment Motion, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem, was the Minister of Justice who went to UN Human Rights Council and defended the State of Sri Lanka. And today, he is moving that Benjamin Netanyahu be tried before the ICC. Why not President Mahinda Rajapaksa, why not President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and why not all those who were in that chain of command who perpetrated that violence, those genocidal acts and the persecution on our people? You want Heads of State of other countries tried before the ICC. The ICC is good for you also when it is for the other person; international intervention is good for you. You call for a UN intervention for the others, but not

for yourself. What happened here were blatant international crimes. There is no clean war anywhere in the world; no war is clean; no side wages war cleanly. In such a context, when it has been revealed that violations took place, that international crimes happened, let there be an independent inquiry. For it to be an independent inquiry, it must necessarily be international. This is the reason why we are opposing any domestic mechanism because a domestic mechanism would mean that one side, one faction who fought the war is going to be sitting as the judge and that is not independent. So, as we condemn what is happening in Palestine right now, as we condemn the State of Israel in committing acts of genocide on the people of Palestine, we do so with a consciousness that identical matters happened in our own country in this month, this week 15 years ago. But, no one has been taken to the ICC, no international prosecution has happened. The Hon. Members from both sides keep shouting saying, Ours is an internal matter, while expressing concern about Palestine. How blind can you be to your own hypocrisy? Wake up! If you are true to what you are saying here today in the House, sign the Rome Statute. If Netanyahus prosecution before the ICC is good for you, sign the Rome Statute. Do not fear, if your hands are clean, go before the International Criminal Court, go before an international tribunal and show yourself.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . 1] .

- - . . . . Hon. Deputy Speaker, this is how the international media reports this: At least 21 people were killed during strikes in central Gaza. . . The international media further reported In Rafah, witnesses reported intense air strikes near the crossing with Egypt, and AFP images showed smoke rising over the city. , .

, . , . Israeli troops on Tuesday seized and closed the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing - through which all fuel passes into Gaza - after ordering residents of eastern Rafah to evacuate. , ! , - fuel - block .

Sir, another news item reported "Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 34,971 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the territory's health ministry." Sir, mind-boggling and hair-raising figures, these are! Israel's offensive has killed at least 34,971 people and most of them are innocent women and children. How long are we to tolerate this? How long are we to look the other way when these things are happening? And the saddest thing is, the moment the UN Security Council takes a decision against Israel, America vetoes it.

Now, I am going to refer to certain figures given by the US State Department officials, in other words, almost from the horse's mouth. It is no ordinary report, but a US

State Department report which stated, ".... it was reasonable to assess that Israel violated norms on international law in using weapons from the US but it did not find enough evidence to block shipments. The State Department submitted its report two days after President Joe Biden publicly threatened to withhold certain bombs and artillery shells if Israel goes ahead with an all-out assault on Rafah, where the UN said 1.4 million had been sheltering." Good heavens! There, 1.4 million people have been sheltering and Israel bombs that place. The facts and figures are given by the US State Department, but hurray, nothing happens.

Then, this is how it was reported by the media as to how the UN Secretary-General himself referred to what is happening in Gaza: "UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres said on Friday that Gaza risked an epic humanitarian disaster if Israel launched a full-scale ground operation in Rafah". Sir, I repeat "Gaza risked an epic humanitarian disaster". Who says this? The UN Secretary-General. This was said a few days ago and right now, I believe, the assault on Rafah continues. It is shameful how one country can slaughter people with impunity. The same media report further states, "In New York, the UN General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to grant the Palestinians additional rights in the global body and backed their drive for full membership, vetoed by Washington at the UN Security Council". These are things, Sir, that happened just a few days ago.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Jayantha Weerasinghe, PC) .

We all appreciate that there must be a two-State solution to this problem. Why is it? That is because, at every turn, it is the US Government which stands against that. So, my humble plea and sincere wish is that before long, this so-called international community, with or without the backing of whoever it is, should come to appreciate that two-State solution. . .

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, when you define "terrorism", it means killing the innocent to achieve a political aim. Therefore, whether the cause for terrorism is justifiable or not, we cannot justify terrorism because innocent civilians are killed. Also we know that terrorism is no more local or regional, but it is global and transnational. Therefore, there has to be a concise and concerted effort on the part of the international community to address that menace.

[3.26 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) Hon. Presiding Member, today, we are debating the Israel-Palestine war situation. Then, there is another war, the Ukraine-Russia war. In this world today, we also see trade wars or, in other words, cold wars, especially between the United States and China. Trade sanctions are also being imposed on certain countries which are having dealings with Middle Eastern countries.

Sir, the idea of bringing in this Adjournment Motion is to press upon the Government and the international community to call for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Palestine because of the cost of human lives, whether they are Israelis, Middle Easterners or Palestinians. So, we cannot allow this war to continue in this manner. Therefore, the idea of this Motion is to ask the international community to get together and call for an immediate ceasefire.

1751 1752

Sir, the UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres released a statement this morning and I wish to quote from it.

The Security Council just approved a long-awaited resolution on Gaza, demanding an immediate ceasefire, and the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.

This resolution must be implemented. Failure would be unforgivable.

As has been stated, Sir, there are tens and thousands of internally displaced people - IDPs. There are over six million Palestinians living as refugees in other countries. What they are saying today is, An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. However, this is not going to do any good for world peace as the great Mahatma Gandhi once said. He said, I quote:

Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever. An eye for an eye will only make the whole world blind.

they are planning on further escalation of the war in Rafah. Over 1.3 million people are living in that area. President Biden of the United States says that he would not support Israel with US weapons, if any further infiltrations are carried out into areas such as Rafah. However, Sir, we see, as I said before, further escalation of hostilities and further loss of human lives. Therefore, we really cannot allow this to go on. If we need to have peace, I think the international community has to band together and have ceasefire agreements entered into, not just between Israel and Palestine, but also to stop the escalating war situation between Ukraine and Russia.

Sir, I also wish to bring to the notice of Parliament that the SriLankan Airlines - I heard the Hon. Minister also mentioning this - is going to have an agreement with Mahan Air of Iran. There are sanctions imposed on all Iranian companies and even on Mahan Air. So, if the SriLankan Airlines enters into any agreement with Mahan Air, then the SriLankan Airlines would also have to face sanctions from the United States of America.

Sir, all over the world - especially in universities and in major cities - people are protesting, demanding for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Palestine so that the aid provided by the United Nations and other countries could reach Gaza. We also need to know the actual cost of that war and the exact number of casualties. So, unless all the countries in the world including Sri Lanka and the United Nations call for an immediate ceasefire, this war will not end and more human lives will be lost. Therefore, Sir, we cannot allow this to go on.

All over the world, people are talking about entering into an era of peace and reconciliation. So, Sri Lanka must also join and support that peace initiative. We, as Sri

Lanka, had also gone through a 30-year old war and our people also suffered from that and know the painfulness of the war. Therefore, I urge Parliament and the Government to call upon the United Nations to bring about an immediate ceasefire in the Middle East.

Thank you.

[4.13 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Wasantha Yapabandara, Attorney-at-Law) Thank you very much, Hon. Presiding Member, for giving me this golden opportunity to speak about this very crucial issue.

First of all, I would like to draw your attention to a UN Report I have here with me. According to this Report, Israel has launched four protracted military assaults on Gaza in 2008, 2012, 2014 and 2021. Thousands of Palestinians had been killed including many children and tens of thousands of homes, schools and office buildings had been destroyed. The 2008 assault involved the use of internationally banned weaponry such as phosphorus gas. In 2014, over a span of 50 days, Israel killed more than 2,100 Palestinians

1765 1766

[ . ]

2024 1

including 1,462 civilians and close to 500 children. During the assault by the Israelis, about 11,000 Palestinians were wounded, 20,000 homes were destroyed and half a million people got displaced.

Sir, I would also like to draw your attention to this map of Israel and Palestine prepared by the UN OCHA, which shows how the Palestinians got expelled gradually. When you look at this map, you will clearly see that in 1917, there were only 6 per cent Jews, out of the total population there. Then by 1948, Israel had captured 78 per cent of the land area. So, when you look at this map, you can see clearly what happened to the Palestinian people, that they got marginalized.

What is the duty of the United Nations in this regard? They have a duty to perform in this crucial matter. In the current situation, Palestinians have lost their land and have no food or access to their daily needs. So, this is a very pathetic situation. I believe that the UN has a duty to protect these very innocent Palestinian people and their land.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes. Some of the Hon. Members who are here are also Members of the Committee on Public Finance. This is a serious matter and I will refer it to the Hon. Speaker and ask him to allow you to raise it on the 22nd of May.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Sir, I want you to have a meeting with the Hon. Speaker.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) I will do that. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) This is the first time it happened in our Committee; , .

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) It is contempt of Parliament. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) . .

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Clearly, it is contempt of Parliament. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) .

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Now, please commence your speech. [4.27 p.m.] () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Hon. Presiding Member, I just want to make one major point. On the 10th of May, the UN General Assembly approved a Resolution to make Palestine an observer with more powers than it used to have, which means they only cannot vote, but could participate in debates and so on. For that Resolution, 143 countries voted in favour, only nine countries were opposed to it and 25 countries abstained. That shows there is a global backing for what the Palestinian people are asking for. I do not want to go into great detail about that because it has been debated at length here today, but I must say that that terrorism is emanating from a State. It is like what

happened in World War II; what is ironic about it is, Jews were persecuted in the Holocaust and it is happening again. Apartheid happened in South Africa and it is now happening in the Middle East. Therefore, as responsible human beings around the world, we all have to stand up for justice, what is right and what is wrong.

The only reason why Palestine is not a full member of the United Nations is because the United States vetoed the Resolution brought in to make it a full member. I just want to mention that in the process of Palestine attempting to become a full member of the UN, of the 15 member-countries in the UN Security Council, 12 including Russia, China, France and Japan voted in favour of that Resolution while the United Kingdom and Switzerland abstained and only the United States vetoed it.

Sir, while it is true that we are talking of a two-State solution, what does it mean in practise? We have to have a practical two-State solution. Some countries are against it, particularly the United States. I am sorry to say that because the United States is a country I like and is a global leader. Is the United States vetoing this Resolution because they think that by making Palestine a full member of the UN, it would then have the status for creating a two-State solution? So, I think it is time for the US to speak to its colleagues in the UN Security Council and when it is put to vote the next time, for the umpteenth time, to look at it from a perspective of equality for all the people. I hope they would see facts for what they are. Thank you very much, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva, I want to mention that the matter you raised before your speech is a serious violation of the Standing Orders and Privileges. So, I will refer it to the Hon. Speaker. But, according to the Standing Orders, you will have to raise it on the next Sitting Day before the main Business starts since Parliament has now been adjourned and this is an Adjournment Debate which is going on. I checked it up in the Standing Orders.

The next speaker is the Hon. Madhura Withanage. Order, please! Before he starts, will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Wasantha Yapabandara to the Chair?

( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Sir, I propose that the Hon. Wasantha Yapabandara do now take the Chair.

Achieving the enchantment of peace in Palestine is not a mere aspiration, but a fundamental necessity for the well-being and prosperity of the people who have been living in the region for decades. Israel has created a conflict which has caused Palestinian people to suffer untold hardships, face violence and displacement, leaving a trail of destruction and despair in its wake. The cycle of hatred and retaliation has only perpetuated the cycle of violence, deepening wounds and creating further division among the people who are living in the region.

Sir, Sri Lanka is deeply concerned over the continuation of violence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, especially in the Gaze Strip, causing tragic loss of thousands of civilian lives and extensive destruction and damage to properties. Also, Sri Lanka continues to stand with the people of Palestine in achieving their legitimate aspirations and is always maintaining a consistent policy on the Palestinian issue and has been

extending unwavering support for Palestine in multilateral fora as well through successive governments. I am pleased to inform that during the UN General Assembly Session held last Friday, Sri Lanka, with 77 other countries, co-sponsored the Resolution on granting full membership of the United Nations to Palestine and voted in favour of the Resolution with 143 countries. Resolution co-sponsor . Resolution co-sponsor .

Sri Lanka has been calling on all parties involved to take sustained measures to address the worsening humanitarian situation and prevent further escalation of atrocities. Sri Lanka joins the like-minded countries in calling for an urgent and immediate ceasefire and unfettered humanitarian access to the people of Gaza. Sri Lanka firmly believes that efforts by the international community and the Israeli and Palestinian authorities should be augmented to make peace a reality in the lives of the Palestinian and Israeli people.

As you are aware, the Government of Sri Lanka established a Children of Gaza Fund and on 1st of April, 2024, donated US Dollars 1 million to UNRWA for assisting the affected children in Gaza; . . . .

While recognizing the legitimate and sensitive security concerns of both the Palestinian and Israeli people, we support the diplomatic efforts to find a lasting solution to the conflict and request both parties to engage in a dialogue to achieve durable peace. The two States living side by side in harmony with one another within secured borders is key to achieving long-term security, peace and prosperity. I wish to reiterate the importance of the early implementation of the United Nations General Assembly Resolutions regarding a two-State solution on the basis of the 1967 borders.

I wish to read out the following from the Statement delivered by President Ranil Wickremesinghe on the Palestine issue at the NAM Summit recently held in Uganda. It states, "No Resolution is possible without a State of Palestine. Therefore, in line with multiple UN Resolutions, the international community must recognize the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem as territories coming within the State of Palestine and in addition, there should be no change in the ethnic composition of Gaza. Sri Lanka also proposes that the State of Palestine be established within five years and no more.

Last year, my Minister met His Excellency Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian National Authority and assured Sri Lankas steadfast support for the Palestinian cause. Since 1968, Sri Lanka, as the Chair of the United Nations Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the

1785 1786

[ ]

2024 1

Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories, has been one of the most significant voices at the United Nations on the subject of the unfortunate conditions of the people in the Occupied Territories.

Sir, perpetration of violence and terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations, should be condemned. All acts of violence and terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation and for whatever reason and wherever those are committed and by whoever.

We recognize the legitimate security concerns of both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. We also acknowledge the deep pain, loss and suffering both the Israeli and Palestinian sides have experienced as a result of the ongoing hostilities. We urge the international community to prioritize the well-being and security of all individuals involved and to work towards a lasting peace that ensures safety, dignity and rights of both the Israelis and Palestinians. We also call upon the international community to play an active role in supporting the peace process and make every effort to prevent any further expansion of hostilities.

Sri Lanka remains committed to supporting a negotiated settlement in line with the relevant UN Resolutions leading to two States living side by side based on the 1967 borders.

Until everyone enjoys peace, no one will be safe. Therefore, disproportionate use of power and suppression of legitimate rights of any people or community would only escalate further tensions and create a situation where security of both Palestinians and Israelis are threatened with the possibility of violence escalating and spreading into other regions. Therefore, Sri Lanka once again urges all parties to act with restraint and to respect human rights

and act in a manner which advances humanity. The international community also has a huge responsibility in implementing the UN Resolutions without hindrance and must act towards attaining long-lasting peace in the region on the basis of those Resolutions.

I wish to place on record that the Sri Lankan Government continues to extend support to the Palestine Mission in Colombo. The Government of Sri Lanka, reflecting its solidarity with the Palestine people, also maintains a Representative Office in Ramallah.

Sir, we reaffirm our resolute support for the Palestinian cause as the people of Palestine strive to gain their legitimate rights and aspirations. Once again, let me endorse our solidarity with the Palestinian people in achieving their inalienable rights and establishing an independent, sovereign State based on the relevant UN Resolutions.

Thank you. .. 5.30 .
