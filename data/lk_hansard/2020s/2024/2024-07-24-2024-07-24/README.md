of time; we have suffered serious damage because of that. We have raised this issue umpteen number of times in this House. The Minister of Health is also here. I asked the previous Minister about this matter in the House and also submitted a Question, asking them to give us the details of COVID victims whose dead bodies had been cremated forcefully. When I asked that Question, the Ministry said that they do not have the details; they were totally trying to hide facts. What we want is the details, as to how many COVID victims you had cremated, why you cremated them and who their next of kin are. You are now apologizing after doing all those things. But, at least, these details, you must make available to us. Please reply regarding that as well.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) But, there is some speciality in this. This interim relief is an extraordinary interim relief, which is not normally given. It has been given until the final Determination of the case is made.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) The court has realized that the case is very strong. That is why they have done that.

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Susil Premajayantha, Attorney-at-Law) For example, in the case of Development Officers, there were four petitions. Fifteen months ago, the then Bench issued an Interim Order subject to the final Determination. Still, the final Determination has not been given. Then, the case was settled in the Supreme Court. Similarly, in this particular case also, an interim relief has been granted until the final Determination is given. So, that is the normal procedure.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, you have two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) .

digitization . Personal Data Protection Act board director .

Sir, now, I am going to switch on to English because of the limited time. So, definitely, we need to look at both the protection of the individual and the ethical side of things.

The AI Act of the EU was brought in December, 2023 and was published in 2024. It gives an implementation timeline as well. When you look at its implementation timeline, it is very interesting and is a six-year period. - [Interruption] Yes, it comes into effect in August, 2024 and six months later, in 2025, the regulations, general provisions and rules on prohibited AI are going to be effective. In May, 2025, the codes of practice are going to be implemented. In August, 2026, high-risk AI systems will come into force and in August, 2027, three years later, they are going to further look at the obligations concerning the high-risk AI systems regulated under the EU law. By 2030, they are going to ensure full compliance with the law. So, if you look at the timeline, it takes six years.

I say that introduction of laws related to AI is inevitable. So, how should we look at it? In the EU Act, there are three basic things they have looked at. The first they have looked at is, the risk-based approach because AI applications are unacceptable in some situations. Therefore, they must be limited, there is no question about it. Unacceptable AI applications such as social scoring by governments are banned. Some governments socially score every individual. Can you imagine that? That is totally unacceptable and they are using AI for it. Therefore, we must reject it. We have chosen a democratic system of life, where the individual's freedom is important. Therefore, we must completely reject it in our law. The second is, transparency and accountability. The EU Act mandates that AI systems should be transparent and accountable. The third is, ethical standards. Ethical standards are very important; ethical principles including respect for human dignity, privacy and non-discrimination are absolutely important.

Therefore, we should include them in our law, there is no question about it.

. Personal Data Protection Act 6 . . Netflix 100 10 . ChatGPT 100 2 . AI . . .

. . . . . - - . . . So, I would like to propose this to the House. There are huge advantages in using AI technology. We cannot get in the way of science and development; that is going to happen, anyway. There are no country borders to that and also there are huge advantages in having that. But, with every development, there comes the negatives. Those negatives are related to human life, human rights, societies, communities, community values and ethical and religious values. So, we must see how we could safeguard and protect those. That is why a Select Committee of Parliament is needed, so that we could go into those. Now, we have examples like the legislation adopted by the European Union; there are case studies. So, look at bringing in necessary laws and implementing them. Therefore, I would recommend a Select Committee be appointed becasue AI is a very quickly-changing sphere, with experts also permitted to participate in it so that they could contribute to this process and we could get the best possible law for our country.

Thank you very much, Sir, for the time given. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Next, the Hon. Jayantha Weerasinghe, PC. You have 13 minutes.

) ( () () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, there is no doubt that artificial intelligence and its related technological advances will have profound consequences on the way we live, the way we work and how we govern ourselves. So, this is an important Debate, where we could discuss logically and rationally both the strengths and the opportunities provided by such technology and how we could safeguard our society from the threats of the new technology while making use of the opportunities it offers. In that sense, I feel this important Adjournment Motion that has been presented today has been framed far too narrowly because the threats from AI and such technology are not confined to just one particular sector, but to many aspects of our lives.

There is no doubt that artificial intelligence has even currently and also in the future will have great implications on us and could be used for economic growth, improving public services, education and for facilitating language use between different communities and cultures. So, there are huge advantages this technology offers in terms of what could be done with it. But, at the same time, there is no doubt that there are threats this technology also brings about. Job

displacement as a result of automation is a serious issue, particularly for a country such as ours where our employment opportunities continue to be restricted. It can also perpetuate economic inequality because access to technology, as we know, is not equal. Access to technology could be very unequal and the more we rely on technology, the more unequal access to technology becomes. There are severe concerns for individual privacy as well as security risks. There is also a great danger that this kind of technology could amplify or perpetuate existing stereotypes and biases and that the way the algorithms work within technology could promote certain kinds of very unhelpful and risky behaviour and attitudes. So, there is no doubt that all of these threats need to be taken into account. Therefore, as a strategy, we have to think about how we combat those threats.

We have to make use of the opportunities this technology offers because we cannot ignore the fact that this technology is advancing and will be available in our society, whether we like it or not, and we need to make sure that we use the opportunities offered by it. It is important that there is education and awareness about this technology and how to use it; there needs to be support for transition to this technology. Also, we must address how we can minimize the threats it could cause to various sectors. We need not only to think about policy and regulation pertaining to this technology, but also how we need to modernize our laws and regulatory processes with regard to different areas on which this technology might have impacted. For example, we may need to look at the labour laws and how technology is transforming the way we work increasingly, where there are gig workers and contract workers who have very fragile contracts and who are offered very little protection and safeguards. We may need to look at these new and unconventional ways in which work is now organized with the advancement of technology and how our labour laws also need to adapt.

Sir, there is no doubt that this technology is going to come and as a society and as a country, we need to be prepared for that; we need to have proper laws and regulatory mechanisms in place to deal with it. We also need to promote the ethical use of technology such as AI. Therefore, we suggest that such a discussion takes into account the broader concerns and that we all engage in a collaborative discussion with those in the industry, the Government, the public as well as the academia in formulating the laws and regulatory mechanisms on managing the new technology that is already with us.

However, it is hard not to be cynical at this point about the Government bringing in this Motion because this Government has demonstrated, over and over again, that it disregards ethics, regulatory frameworks and politicizes any issue to its advantage. So, whether such a Government is capable of dealing with a complex issue such as AI technology and come up with sensible ways to regulate it, in which the ethics around the use of technology could be put into any kind of usable framework, is really doubtful.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, you have two more minutes.

) ( () () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya) Sir, I also want to point out that the greater threat to religion and culture in our society does not necessarily come from technology, but is actually from the politicization of religion and society and the abuse of religion and culture in the name of politics and for political power. I want to point out two such examples and then, I will wind up. Yesterday, the Government issued an apology for enforced cremation of Muslim COVID victims. The implementation of enforced cremation was political opportunism and the apology just before an election is also political opportunism. In that sense, this kind of politically opportunistic behaviour also poses a greater threat, in our mind, to religion and culture. Then, there is a huge problem with regard to the appointment of a principal to the Jaffna Central College. The appointment of a qualified lady selected by the Ministry as the principal has been suspended due to intervention by a powerful politician. Sir, you know that that is not acceptable. The lady who was selected as principal had all the qualifications and yet, a powerful Minister intervened, got her appointment suspended and put someone unqualified in her place. So, these are also issues that we need to deal with. The way in which politics intervene in our education and the cultural and religious lives needs to be looked at. Politicization of the religion and culture for opportunistic motives is an extremely sensitive matter which needs to be handled sensitively. So, just as much as we talk about artificial intelligence and ethical guidelines and framework for that technology, I am sorry to say, we are very cynical about this effort because this Government has not demonstrated, thus far, any principle stand when it comes to ethics and regulatory framework or talked about any dignified way in which we could engage in our political lives.

Thank you very much, Sir, for the time given. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Next, the Hon. Thushara Indunil Amarasena. You have ten minutes.

(a) (i) I accept.

(ii) I do not accept.

The Commissioner General of Official Languages is a post in the Special Grade of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service. The above criterion is considered when making appointment to the said post. Accordingly, there is no difficulty in dealing with the language requirements of the citizens who use Tamil language when administering the Sinhala/Tamil, English/Tamil Translators and the rest of the staff of the Department and directing them towards the goals of the Department.

(b) (i) He has not acquired the proficiency.

The post of Commissioner General of Official Languages falls under the category of Head of the Department. It is not indicated in the Constitution that the respective officer should have the proficiency in both Sinhala and Tamil languages to hold the post of Head of the Department. Therefore, proficiency in the Tamil language is not an essential legal requirement to hold this post. However, no hindrance is caused to the duties, since Translators are serving attached to the Department.

(ii) A Distinction has been obtained for English

language at the G.C.E. (O/L) Examination.

(c) Not relevant.
