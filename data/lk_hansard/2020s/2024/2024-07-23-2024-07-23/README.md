Lakshman Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Presiding Member, you called out the names of the eighth and the thirteenth speakers in the list to speak. Even after that, you have not given me time to speak.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) This turn goes to the Government side and then, the next turn is yours.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) You deprived me of my time. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) I went according to the instructions I received. That was, to give time to the Hon. (Mrs.) Rohini Kumari Wijerathna, Member of Parliament.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) But, you cannot change the list without my approval. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) I did not change the list. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) Then, who changed it? By whom was it changed?

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) I was told to give her the chance; the Secretariat advised me and I followed that advice. It is not my responsibility to -

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) Just now, the officer at the Table told me that you changed the list; he told me now that you changed the list and that he did not have any say in changing the list.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you know very well that I have no authority to change the list.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) I agree. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) I have no authority to change the list. I can only go by this list given to me.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) I agree with you 100 per cent. But, when I called Mr. Abeyrathne, the officer at the Table, he said that he did not have anything to do with the list and you changed it.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) No, I have no authority to change the list. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) You can ask him. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The Hon. (Mrs.) Rohini Kumari Wijerathne spoke to the Secretariat and asked for the change in the list.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) Please, bear with me. ? ? He told me that.

( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) Hon. Presiding Member, may I intervene? ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes, Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe? ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC) Hon. Presiding Member, I do not want to get entangled in any argument, but I must say that we have to follow the Parliamentary traditions and conventions. In fact, that is a responsibility of the Chair. The officers are there to assist the Chair. All the decisions have to be taken by the Chair. I think what the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella raised is a valid point. Madam, there is no doubt that you have the authority to even accommodate an Hon. Member who is not in the speakers' list. But, it is a matter of courtesy and something that has been followed throughout or from time immemorial that you, at least, speak to the speaker whose name is there in the list as the next speaker and get his permission before making any change. Maybe, there had been a mistake. So, without having any ill feelings, let us try to follow that tradition, at least, in the future.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) I apologize to the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, if there has been any inconvenience caused. But, I only followed the instructions I was given based on the request made to the Secretariat by the Hon. (Mrs.) Rohini Kumari Wijerathna. So, that was what I was told to do.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) I apologize to you, Hon. Kiriella, once again, if there has been any inconvenience caused to you. The next turn

2451 2452

will be yours. Once again, I must say that I followed the order of the list and the instructions given to me. - [Interruption.] Okay. Thank you very much.

Hon.Vadivel Suresh, please continue with your speech.

, ; . Plantation Management Monitoring Division - PMMD - .

Hon. Minister, all these lands belong to the Government. The golden shareholder is the Secretary to the Treasury. And, I do not know how this sort of an amendment came about to give those plantations to these 22 plantation companies. In those days they were under the Government, under the JEDB, the SPC and the Elkaduwa Plantations. They divided those among 22 companies, I think, for easy management. Ultimately, now all these 22 companies come under five owners. That is the biggest joke. In this country, mainly, only five people are running all those 22 companies. As a result, government welfare programmes and everything has stopped. The plantations are run by those companies in a different way under different rules and regulations and violating the labour laws in this country, Hon. Minister. So, we have to overcome this issue. It is in a different way that they are maintaining the estates. I have said earlier also that they are violating the rights of children, women and all; the comapnies do whatever they want, violating all the rules and regulations.

There is a very good example. The Wages Board decided to increase the salary of the plantation workers. The Government gazetted it and the Hon. President also

announced it. But, the plantation companies have the power to go against that Gazette Notification and get a stay order. Rs. 1,700 per day is a small amount. The workers are working day and night. As a result, the workers got upset about the setup and left the plantations. In 1992, when the Government handed over the estates to those companies, there were about 1.2 million of workers. Hon. Minister, now, there are only 143,000 workers. Out of those 143,000 workers, 80 per cent are women. So, it is difficult for them and they do not want to work. For the Rs. 1,000 daily wage, there had been a court case and now, for the Rs. 1,700 increased wage also, there is a court case.

Hon. Minister, the workers cannot even put up a toilet. If they put up a toilet, extend their kitchen area or put up a new shelter, they are given three punishments. One is, they immediately stop their work. The other is, they make an entry at the police station and after that, file a court case. Some people who have been framed like that are dead and gone. So, there would be three punishments for just putting up a toilet, a basic human need - immediately, their work would be stopped, reported to the police station and thereafter, a court case would be filed. So, that kind of things are happening there. Therefore, Hon. Minister, I thought of bring those for your kind consideration.

Then, Sir, estate schools do not have deeds; those estate schools, which were gazetted as government schools, do not have deeds because their lands belong to the estates. If a small sports event or something like that is held, there would be so many police entries and cases filed and the principals of those schools find it difficult to carry out their day-to-day work. There are a lot of issues. So, we want to know whether the RPCs have sold out those lands or whether they still belong to the Government. The Secretary to the Treasury is the golden shareholder of those estates and the Ministry of Agriculture and Plantation Industries created the PMMD - Plantation Management Monitoring Division - in 1992 to monitor how the companies are managing the estates. But, the companies have cut trees and closed down tea factories in the estates. The closed factories are called "silent factories". They have removed and sold all the iron in those factories. The valuable trees have also been cut and sold. But, the PMMD do not monitor those things; they monitor what the workers do. If the workers put up a small shelter or something like that, they send a quit notice. In that Department, there is a lawyer to send quit notices. So, where can those people go and live?
