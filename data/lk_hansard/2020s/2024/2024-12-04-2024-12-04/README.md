. ? That is, peacebuilding and social cohesion. It is a very important topic. This country will never go forward unless there is an effort by the Government with peacebuilding and social cohesion. Our international friends have worked with us for so long, giving us resources, sharing their knowledge and training with their expertise. But, how much have we achieved when it comes to social cohesion and peacebuilding? We have not progressed that much.

If that is the case, then this society must reject all forms of racism outright. But still, we feel that there are certain elements of the society who are continuing it because old habits die hard.

Sir, all this time, most Governments that were in power only paid lip service to the concept of social cohesion and peacebuilding; it was just a sideshow either to please Geneva, to get a donation or just to please some international donor. But, this Government does not consider peacebuilding and social cohesion as a sideshow. It is our main project and to that end, we will push Government policies forward.

Sir, we understand that we are culturally different; we have different ethnic identities and different cultural identities. We respect them all and the Government will make policies to encourage and preserve each others cultural identities. But, having said that, I say that there is a problem. No matter how many laws you bring in, no matter whatever policies are spoken about, to build peace, social cohesion and friendship, the bridge of friendship must be built first. But, where should it start? In our own minds! " " geographically " " " " - "them vs us" and "us vs them" - . Now, that mindset block has to be settled first because that is a serious problem. We are here to represent all Sri Lankans of all ethnic origins, all races, all castes, no matter whatever the division is. We have to create a unified Sri Lanka. Social inclusion, gender equality and inclusive principles, while respecting cultural diversity, are essential. Otherwise, this country will not go forward. I am happy to say that my Ministry, the Ministry of Justice and National Integration, takes this job seriously and I encourage all those actors in the Government as well as those who are non-government to

be hopeful and work with us in peacebuilding and bringing about social cohesion because this Government is pretty serious about it.

Secondly, Sir, as I told you, some of these habits, the old ones, die hard; they tend to die hard. That is why even this time around, we have had to deal with certain issues.

It is normal for the Opposition to test our strengths and limits from time to time. That is something we accept. . ; . . . But, to any person, any citizen in this country who thinks that race and religion could be used again for political gain, I say, think again and again and again. This Government will not stand for racism or religious extremism in any form or the other! It will be defeated with whatever laws we have in force.

. . . . . . ? . there will be true social cohesion and peacebuilding. So, I am inviting all the Hon. Members of Parliament to help the Government with that initiative. Yes, we will fight over our politics on another day, on another topic. But, for this, let us unite because this country has suffered enough, enough tears had been shed in the North and the South and enough blood has run through this land. It has to come to an end and that can only happen by respecting each others cultural identities and diversities.

. . . ? ? . belongs to the people. Laws are there to protect people and their interests. Laws are essential for those who are marginalized, weak and poor. So, when it comes to laws, we must focus not only on making them, but even on their implementation to make sure that people's rights are protected. .

. .

. . the rule of law . ? ? , , ?

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Harshana Nanayakkara) the Proceeds of Crime Bill, the Rescue, Rehabilitation and Insolvency Bill and some amendments to the Audit Act, those three legislations, will be presented to Parliament. The whole idea of those is to recover stolen assets, trace proceeds of crime with one law and to effectively deter money laundering, drug trafficking and all related vices. The amendments to the Audit Act and the Rescue, Rehabilitation and Insolvency Bill would be to improve creditors confidence, to protect the debtors rights and to bring some uniformity and update. So, this Government is serious about what we said before.

I will say this much within the two minutes left, Sir. First, let us build this country together. Let us fight over politics later, that is another matter. Also, I invite all of you, let us uphold the rule of law. There are so many laws' delays, causing massive issues. Some of the delays are due to resources not being there, human and technical. There are over one million court cases pending in our entire court system. The ease of doing business in this country is at a very low ranking; the rule of law, far less. And since I have only two minutes, I cannot give you the statistics.

I thank you very much for the time given, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . 11 .

The PTA was used to arrest these political prisoners and to date, these prisoners have been rotting in prisons. So, I would like to urge the Government to take immediate action to address that issue. The political prisoners of this country must be released; the Government must take action. The current Minister of Justice and National Integration and also the Prime

261 262

Minister have been very active in the past about the Prevention of Terrorism Act. This morning, I saw a cartoon done by Namal Amarasinghe. In that, unfortunately, the cartoonist has projected the PTA, which stands for "Prevention of Terrorism Act", to say Power To Anura. So, we do not want to see these sort of things happening in public. The PTA was something that even the JVP or the NPP agreed to repeal. The NPP members joined us in a signature campaign across the Island to repeal the PTA. But now, under your Government also, the PTA is being used. Therefore, I want to raise this matter because we do not want the Government to be attacked on these sort of things. So, the Prevention of Terrorism Act has been used. . , . . .

Sir, there has to be an accountability mechanism. The previous Government proposed a TRC. I do not know if you all are going to go ahead with that or not. We want to know the Governments official position on the accountability mechanism. The Geneva sessions will come up; the UN Human Rights Council will take this up. So, we want to know what the Governments position on this matter is. We want accountability. Those who committed crimes against humanity, those who committed crimes against the Tamil people must be punished. Therefore, we want to know the NPPs stand on this matter. The JVP or the NPP must be accustomed to these issues because you all faced similar issues with people going missing. Therefore, you must be sensitive to this matter. So, we want to know what the Governments position on these issues is.

Furthermore, there are other issues as well: land issues. . , . , , 8 . , - . , , , , . .

, . , . , , ,

, . forest . 1983 .

Regarding the forestland issue, the position of the previous Government was to go back to the 1983 survey plan of the lands available in Sri Lanka. If we go back to that plan, some of these forestland issues can be resolved. So, we want to know the Governments position on that matter. The Minister of Justice and National Integration is here and we want to know about that because the demarcation of forestland is a big problem that we face in the North and the East. I am sure that the forestland issue is there in other parts of the country as well, but it is a major problem that we face in the North and the East.

Furthermore, there are other administration-related issues, which are not in existence in majority areas. . . , . . , ; , . , .

withdrawal of army camps. I would like to welcome the Government's action in that regard even though that extent of land was small. So, an army camp had been removed because it was not necessary and some road blocks had been removed. We welcome that. Thank you. Those are things that the previous Governments should have done. Also, some of the temples that were not accessible to the Tamil people, now, we can access. So, we thank you; we welcome the good initiatives of the Government. But, we want you to take further action on these matters. There are many army camps that need to be removed because they occupy State lands, schools and temples. So, we want the Government to take further action. While we welcome what you have already achieved, we want to encourage the Government to take further progressive steps in the right direction.

Another important thing is, devolution of power in this country. I would like to thank the Hon. (Dr.) Nalinda Jayathissa because yesterday at the Cabinet press briefing he, as the Cabinet Spokesman, had clarified the question I raised in the House yesterday about the JVP General-Secretary Tilvin Silvas statement. That is what I wanted. I was hoping that it would happen in Parliament in the morning, but, however, that was explained yesterday. So, thank you for that. We welcome the fact that you will have the provincial councils till you bring in a new Constitution. But, when you bring in the new Constitution, you must remember that the Tamil people

263 264

[ ]

2024 04

of this country are also a people entitled to political rights. In the North and the East, the percentage of Sinhala people has increased by 1200 per cent in the District of Ampara! Since Independence, the percentage of Sinhala people has increased by 1200 per cent in the Ampara District, whereas in the rest of the country, it has increased only by 200 per cent. In the District of Trincomalee, that percentage has increased by 700 per cent, whereas in Gampaha, the percentage of Sinahala population has increased by 200 per cent. Therefore, the State-sponsored colonization projects carried out for the last 75 years have changed the demography of the North and the East. Now, since there are other communities living in those areas, there is no right for any Government to say that the Tamil people are not entitled to a political solution. So, when you bring in a future Constitution, you must remember that the Tamil people are entitled to equal political power in this country and that devolution of power must be addressed. If you change the system to not recognize the Tamil people as the majority living in the North and the East based on todays numbers, you will also have to face the repercussions that the previous Governments faced. So, therefore, I would like to bring it to your attention. I saw a statement that when you bring in a new Constitution, you are going to make public consultations, but in your Election Manifesto, you said that you are happy to take forward the Constitution-making process of 2015 to 2019. The Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya, the present Prime Minister, was part of the Committee which put forward recommendations, I think, in May, 2016. So, you all agreed to some of those. We are open for dialogue; we are not here to disrupt the Government.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Next, the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam. You have eight minutes.

[1.12 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you and the Members of the Government for having won an unprecedented mandate. I think it is fully well-deserved.

I would also like to remind the Members of this House that in the last Parliament, it was the NPP and our party which refused to speak to President Ranil Wickremesinghe's Government because we believed that he did not have a mandate. So, when we consider the words of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake with regard to democracy or the lack of it in the past and his references to that term whilst he made his Policy Statement, I would like to remind him that our party was one that stood consistently along with the NPP in refusing to engage with a Government that we believed was a rogue government which did not have a mandate.

Sir, I would like to particularly welcome the President's following comments on page 01 of the English Text of his Address to Parliament. I quote:

. I also acknowledge that there are communities that did not trust us but instead placed their faith in other political movements.

The essence of democracy lies in the coexistence of diverse political ideologies and groups.

Our government and I are committed to fulfilling the needs and aspirations of the citizens from every community, both those who voted for us and those who did not.

Sir, I make specific reference to those three paragraphs and subsequently, he goes on to say the following, which is a very important part of his and this Government's policy. I quote:

We will not allow ethnic-based politics in our country. Similarly, we will not tolerate religious extremism. We are a people who have suffered enough from ethnic conflicts.

I make that particular reference because I believe there is a possibility of a contradiction with regard to the first three paragraphs I quoted and this particular paragraph. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the NPP, during the campaign, have made it quite clear that they are against racism and the terms they used with regard to racism are, "nationalistic politics" and "religious extremism". Those are the general terms that are being used.

Now, I would like to remind the President and the Government that our party, the All Ceylon Tamil Congress which I represent in Parliament and the oldest

295 296

[ ]

2024 04

Tamil political party in Sri Lanka, and the Tamil National People's Front believed in a Sri Lankan identity. We were a party which believed in working with the governments of the day. We joined governments, our leader G.G. Ponnambalam became a Cabinet Minister and we believed in fully cooperating. As long as the Tamil identity was protected, we felt that a Sri Lankan, all-encompassing identity is what is best for Sri Lanka. But, unfortunately, if you look at the 76-year history of this country, that Sri Lankan identity has been just a facade for what is essentially a Sinhala-Buddhist, almost a racist identity, to simply say that we are all Sri Lankans in a country where Sinhala Buddhist nationalism has become the mainstay of politics to the exclusion of all other identities. I say it very particularly because in the previous Governments as well as in previous Parliaments, this notion of racism was spoken of. Mahinda Rajapaksa spoke of racism; Gotabaya Rajapaksa spoke of racism and we should not accept it. Their version of racism was this. After 75 years of distinct racism against the Tamil people, we have been disenfranchised, our lands have been grabbed and the ethnic composition of the North and the East has been systematically tampered with, where colonization took place. Even today, just before this Government coming into power, colonization schemes were taking place in the East. If I am to mention a few, in Mayilathamadu and Madhavanai areas in Batticaloa and also in the North of Vavuniya, there was a distinct colonization project that was going on.

To talk in terms of racism, when the Tamils bring up the issues they have faced for over 75 years, in being deliberately targeted in areas where we have historically habited, where our ethnic composition has been systemically changed, altered by the State policies and when we rebel against those policies of the State, there is a potential for this last paragraph of the Hon. President's Address to Parliament to also be coined by this Government as racism. So, I would like clarifications because after 75 years of systematic anti-Tamilness in the North and the East, which are our areas of historical habitation, when we talk of discrimination and racism that have been meted out against us, to simply say that we must not talk about Tamils, Sinhalese and that we must talk of Sri Lankans is simply to erase that history of discrimination and racism that had been meted out for 75 years against the Tamil people; it is systematic racism. For example, Sir, in the UN Human Rights Council, Prince Zeid, who was the High Commissioner for Human Rights, made it a point that Sri Lanka cannot have an entirely internal inquiry for accountability because of the history of the ethnic conflict for over 35 years and that the institution of Government has been so corrupted that they cannot deliver justice, particularly in an ethnic-conflict sense. So, these are important realities that we must address, if we are to ever genuinely create security for all ethnicities, for the Tamil people, particularly who, they believe, have been discriminated against.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you have only one more minute.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) And without doing that, to simply say that we must only talk in terms of a Sri Lankan identity is going to make matters worse.

Since I have such a little time, I would also like to mention one more thing. I think the whole of today, we spoke in terms of the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Sir, memorialization of the Tamil people, the LTTE cadres who had died as well as the Tamil people who lost their lives, is identical, is no different from the JVPs memorialization; there cannot be any difference. Both those armed struggles were silenced by the State and both those armed struggles were legitimate. There were legitimate reasons why people were forced to take up arms. That is where we come from. So, without addressing those legitimate reasons and finding solutions, to simply allow one as completely unbanned and to commemorate their dead, whereas the other to have certain restrictions, I do not believe is fair, especially because those restrictions are based on a circular that came into being in 2011 during the very same Government that your present Government calls a racist Government. So, that Government had come up with the circular, which is being applied today with regard to how you can commemorate or the restrictions with regard to commemoration, and I think it is completely unfair and I strongly urge this Government to put that mistake right. I also would like to say that the PTA must not be used at all, not only in the North and the East but also in the South.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, your time is up.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) There are provisions in the Penal Code and in various other legal instruments that the police and the other authorities could use. The PTA, certainly, is not one of them and it is important to point out that the police use the PTA as a weapon; they use it to prevent bail and to punish before you can even face justice. That must not be allowed completely, Sir. In that sense, I would urge my good Friend, the Minister of Justice and National Integration, to look into that matter. He is someone I go back a long way. We were in Bar School together in London. I know him in a totally different incarnation. We will not talk about that in this House. I certainly have a lot of trust in him; I have a lot of respect for him. I know that he is certainly not a Member who can be categorized as communal-minded or as having a strong Sinhala, Buddhist nationalistic bias. So, I would urge him to look into this matter as well as the question of Tamil political prisoners. There are nine prisoners who still continue to be incarcerated. I would urge you to release them as early as possible. I would like to mention one individual. He is known as ''Morris''. I think the Hon. President and the Hon. Vijitha Herath know him. He has been transferred

297 298

without any reason from the Colombo Magazine Prison to the prison in Hambantota and that was a victimization. The person who made that transfer previously retired. There was no reason whatsoever for that transfer. Therefore, I would urge you to have an inquiry with regard to that.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Harshana Nanayakkara) Hon. Ponnambalam, all your concerns will be addressed. What you have listed was 70 years of past history. We have taken over now and it has been less than a month. You can rely on us. We are the true friends of the North. Therefore, whatever genuine grievances you have - there may have been mistakes in the past - we shall address them, including the issue of political prisoners after a proper legal assessment. So, there is nothing to be suspicious about our motives and intentions. Let us work together on this. If there are any concerns, please direct them to my Ministry and I will definitely look into them. Thank you very much for raising those concerns.

( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramanathan Archchuna) Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees, Hon. Members of Parliament and the beloved citizens of the motherland called Eelam.

. " , " '' , , , , , .

It is with profound gratitude, a deep sense of responsibility and a heart full of hope that I rise before this august Assembly as a Representative of the resilient and determined people of the Northern Province.

Madam, allow me to begin by extending my heartfelt appreciation to the venerable Tamil leader "Methagu" and brothers and sisters whom we lost in the past, whose visionary leadership continues to inspire generations. I also bow in solemn remembrance to all those who have selflessly given their lives in the pursuit of peace, equality and unity in Sri Lanka. Their sacrifices resonate not only with the Tamil community, but also with our Sinhalese and Muslim brethren, who have suffered and endured for the sake of this nations progress.

. - 1966 - football team captain . 1983 Jaffna . - - . Tragically, he was forcibly disappeared from the Padaviya Hospital in May, 2009 during the Tamil genocide at the end of the bloody civil war, despite being severely wounded and bedridden. His life and sacrifice exemplify the complexities and responsibilities of our shared history. I am sorry, I have to speak here very truthfully.

Let me unequivocally state that my presence here today is not to advocate division, but to champion unity, harmony and prosperity of this beautiful nation. The mandate from our people is resoundingly clear. We must move forward as one cohesive entity undeterred by ethnic or religious prejudices and strive together towards a shared vision of peace and development.

Hon. Members, my journey to this House is a testament to the power of determination, resilience and the unwavering support of the Tamil people. Born into a community often misunderstood and marginalized, I encountered systemic barriers designed to suppress my voice and thwart my ambitions. My journey to higher education was fraught with injustice. In 2006, I was denied university entrance as a medical student due to systemic discrimination. Undeterred, I took my case to the Supreme Court and after two long years, I was finally granted admission to the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Jaffna. Graduating in 2015 marked not only a personal milestone but also a victory against oppression. At this point, I have to thank the Hon. Sumanthiran, former Member of Parliament.

From my first posting as a doctor to the Base Hospital, Chavakachcheri after my internship at Kalubowila Teaching Hospital to my tenure as a medical administrator, I have witnessed stark inequities and systemic corruption that plague our healthcare system, particularly in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. My tenure as Director of the Base Hospital, Chavakachcheri was marked by significant reforms achieved within just three days, but those efforts were met

309 310

with staunch resistance from entrenched interests. My exposure of corrupt practices led to my unwarranted imprisonment for 19 days, a sobering reminder of the immense challenges faced by those who stand against systemic corruption. Yet, it was the unwavering support of the public that shielded me from the darker machinations of my political opponents.

Contesting this Parliamentary seat independently, without the backing of established political parties, I stand here today as a testament to the resilience of our people, who demand for accountability, equity and meaningful reform. Hon. Members, as we stand at a crossroads of history, we must confront the lingering wounds of our past with courage, clarity and genuine commitment to reconciliation.

The Prevention of Terrorism Act, a relic of a wounded, troubled and painful era, must be repealed to restore justice and freedom to those unjustly detained.

We must extend an olive branch to our displaced brothers and sisters all over the world, facilitating their return to their homeland with dignity, security and the assurance of a better future. Furthermore, the lands confiscated by the armed forces in the North and the East must be returned to their rightful owners, fostering trust, reconciliation and a sense of belonging among our people. It is imperative to provide dual citizenship to diaspora Tamils, enabling them to invest in our nations future and to peacefully live out their twilight years in their ancestral homeland.

Similarly, the preservation of cultural heritage of all ethnic groups including Sinhalese, Muslims and Indian-origin Tamils including us must be prioritized to ensure that no community feels marginalized or compelled to take up arms again. Our collective history has shown us the devastating consequences of marginalization and we must work tirelessly to ensure that such injustices are never repeated.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees) .

( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramanathan Archchuna) Madam, give me thirty seconds. Allow me to emphasize the immense potential of our diaspora. Those individuals possess the expertise, resources and commitment necessary to contribute meaningfully to the development of our nation. By ensuring their investments are secured and by granting them dual citizenship without bureaucratic obstacles, we can harness their capabilities to rebuild our economy and strengthen our nations foundation. This approach not only fortifies our economy, but also reduces the need for our women to seek employment abroad under precarious and exploitative conditions.

Let us also remember the plight of those displaced by the ethnic conflict and currently living in camps in Tamil Nadu. They must be brought back to their homeland with dignity, where they could rebuild their lives as equal citizens. I would like to emphasize that there are numerous political prisoners currently incarcerated as a result of the ethnic conflict. I urge the Government to either release them or expedite their cases in court.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees) .

( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramanathan Archchuna) Give me just five seconds, Madam.

The Tamil people have endured systematic neglect and exploitation for decades, but the recent elections have demonstrated their desire for genuine change as evidenced by the election of independent Representatives like myself. We, as leaders, must heed this clarion call for change and act decisively.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees) .

( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramanathan Archchuna) Just a few seconds more, Madam.

Hon. Members, the scars of our internal conflict have left indelible marks on all communities, not just the Tamil people. The sacrifices made by all Sri Lankans - the Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims and others - must be honoured with steadfast commitment to unity and reconciliation. We must address that.

Thank you, Madam.

Surely, all Hon. Members in this House are interested in having this country as one united nation, all unitedly working for the welfare of the people of this country.

We may have our differences on economic grounds and on other political grounds, but surely on questions of religion, race and language we must have one united policy that will harmonize the various diverse factors and bring them together as one nation.

Madam, I have risen today to also express my wholehearted support for the Hon. President's unwavering commitment to develop our nation's IT industry. The Hon. President, in his Address to Parliament mentioned the IT industry. This commitment is not only a testament to our vision for a prosperous future, but also a strategic move to position Sri Lanka as a global contributor in technology and innovation. The Sri Lanka Association for Software Service Companies, SLASSCOM, whose objective is to grow the IT and BTM - Business Technology Management - industry in Sri Lanka, aims to make it the country's top export revenue earner. SLASSCOM has submitted a proposal to the Hon. President for the Government to consider implementing it, to boost the country's foreign revenue.

Let me highlight the proposals of the SLASSCOM. According to their Vision, SLASSCOM proposes that the knowledge and innovation industry should aim to bring in US Dollars 5 billion in export revenue, employ a strong workforce of 200,000 and facilitate 1,000 start-ups by 2030.

Then, skills development and STEM - Science,

345 346

Technology, Engineering and Mathematics - education. Ensuring access to STEM education is crucial. SLASSCOM highlights the importance of widening STEM education in National Schools and improving access to higher educational opportunities for STEM students, thereby enhancing the output of skilled workers. Leveraging public-private partnerships to invest in higher education and attracting competitive STEM talent is essential. This includes enhancing access to finance by offering student bank loans with reasonable terms and providing scholarships for STEM subjects to increase awareness and demand for STEM-related courses.

SLASSCOM emphasizes the need to retrain under-employed or unemployed graduates as well as G.C.E. Advanced Level qualified students, who lack access to suitable employment, in technology-related skills. This can be achieved through public-private partnership mechanisms. Madam, annually, 7,000 STEM graduates could easily be transformed into billable resources in the ICT sector, contributing significantly to the industry.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is up. ( .... ( () .... ) (The Hon. (Dr.) M.L.A.M. Hizbullah) I will finish in one minute, Madam.

The goals of achieving US Dollars 5 billion in export revenue, employing a 200,000 strong workforce and facilitating 1,000 start-ups by 2030 are within our reach. The country needs this most urgently to boost our revenue and ensure sustainable economic growth. I personally endeavour to promote this "Vision 2030" for international investment, which will help us generate a US Dollars 5 billion revenue and create 200,000 employment, paving the way for a prosperous future for Sri Lanka. We are prepared to give our fullest support to realize the vision of the Hon. President.

Thank you, Madam. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 14 .

Sir, I want to bring to the attention of the Government the necessity to revive an earlier project that existed called CRIP - Climate Resilience Improvement Project - which was funded by the World Bank and the ADB, particularly to attend to the infrastructure shortfall in most of these flood-prone areas, where they can set up new infrastructure facilities. So, that was called CRIP - Climate Resilience Improvement Project. I request the Hon. Leader of the House and the other Ministers to inform the Ministry of Finance and the Department of External Resources to request the World Bank to revive that project and make sure that enough funds are made available to create the necessary infrastructure, particularly for drainage purposes, so that this unfortunate flooding of the low-lying areas in the country could be prevented. Massive work had been done in many areas through the CRIP and I hope that project could be revived. With the difficulties of our serious debt crisis, we will have to depend on multilateral funding which is at very low interest rates and that could be made use for such an important project. So, I hope the Government will take into account the revival of that particular project.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Next, the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam. You have 11 minutes.

[7.13 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I do not wish to repeat some of the concerns that have already been raised, but I wish to flag about three or four points.

The first one is of particular concern, Sir. In 2016, with World Bank funding of US Dollars 55 million, the Strategic Cities Development Project - SCDP - commenced. That Project was completed without the participation of the Jaffna Divisional Secretariat and the Nallur Divisional Secretariat because the sort of project overlapped from Jaffna and Nallur. The Jaffna UDA was kept out and the Jaffna Municipal Council was also completely kept out. Instead, the implementation of the project was by the UDA Head Office in Colombo. Particularly, the SCDP Management Unit and the SCDP Implementation Unit were formed with persons who did not have any adequate qualifications, as they were political appointees. The master plan for the drainage system implemented under that project was to be drawn up and prepared with a funding of Rs. 1,870 million. That was allocated to a private firm by the UDA in Colombo, but the plan was made without rainfall data or elevation data. Sir, that matter was brought to the attention of those implementation committees and questions were raised by well-meaning experts who happened to be observers and who had heard about this oversight, a deliberate oversight is what we can say. But, they were completely ignored and the plan went through.

Today, Sir, we talk about the damage caused by a natural disaster, because of the recent cyclone. But, because of this project being done in such a haphazard, negligent way without getting adequate data for the necessary planning, flooding has been made far worse. This matter has been repeatedly brought up to the notice of the previous Government. My colleague and former Member of Parliament, the Hon. Selvarajah Kajendren, both in 2020 and 2021 and thereafter every year, has brought this matter up at the DCC meetings, at the Kachcheri, then here in the House at every Budget Debate and at every opportunity with the relevant Ministry, asking that this matter be investigated because it is a crime. So much money had been allocated and that project had been implemented without the necessary data, which is fundamental for that project to be successful and as a result, Jaffna is seeing a flooding which had never been seen in the way it is being seen today. Therefore, I would urge this Government to look into that because this Government came on the pledge of making sure that there would be no corruption. And, this project stinks of corruption, Sir. The Hon. Prime Minister is here and I would urge her to kindly look into this matter as it is passionate for us. We actually have insider information and it is with that information that we repeatedly tried to bring this matter to the attention of the previous Government, not the Rajapaksa Government, but the Ranil Wickremesinghe Government. But, of course, they were both together.

That project was started in 2016. So, you can just imagine why it was hushed up. Therefore, I would urge this Government to look into that.

The second matter I want to raise relates to Batticaloa in particular. We were visiting Batticaloa around the 26th

and the 27th of November and the complaint we got right across the region, despite the fact that there is a problem with drainage, lack of it et cetera, was because of the rainfall being so heavy, all the sluice gates in those tanks were opened at the same time and as a result, the water just could not be controlled. There was no coordination and that was another very important reason why Batticaloa faced such a calamity over the last few days.

Finally, Sir, the Hon. Minister of Fisheries, Aquatic and Ocean Resources and the Hon. K. Ilankumaran, who is a Member of Parliament for Jaffna, visited the coastline just after this cyclone. They are fully aware that trawlers as well as small boats in the Jaffna region have been completely damaged. The reason for that is this. As they are surely aware - there have been repeated requests that breakwaters be built and I know that for a fact because I have been a Member of Parliament since 2001 till 2010 and even during the peace process, we made those requests - if proper breakwaters had been built, those trawlers and boats could have been saved. In Jaffna, there are certain other areas where breakwaters had been built and those boats are completely safe. So, despite repeated requests, that has deliberately been overlooked and since the Hon. Minister of Fisheries, Aquatic and Ocean Resources also represents Jaffna, I appeal to him, at least now, to allocate necessary funds to build those breakwaters.

405 406

There was a move with the previous Government to develop the Point Pedro Harbour and move all of these fisherfolk into that harbour. People do not want that; they just want these breakwaters to be deepened and the bunds to be built properly. That is all they are asking for. Surely, that cannot be very expensive, Sir! So, I appeal to the Hon. Prime Minister and the Hon. Leader of the House to bring this matter to the attention of the Government. Fisheries is the one sector that had been worst affected during the 35 years of the war since the fisherfolk could not go out to sea to do their fishing. There were permanent bans for fishing in the North and the East and they were allowed to go out only up to about 500 metres or maximum, one kilometre into the sea. So, having faced bans for over 35 years, when they are now trying to rebuild their lives, for them not to be supported, I think, is a travesty and I would strongly urge this Government to look into it. It is important because the particular Minister of the previous Government who was in charge of fisheries, I think, is one of the persons that you will have to look for with regard to corruption. I do not think there is any doubt with regard to his background and how he has performed or not performed his duties. I would urge you to look into that as well. So, these problems are all man-made; all these are not natural reasons for the disaster to be so badly exacerbated. Therefore, if the Government could, with whatever resources they have, look into that, it would make a huge difference.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Next, the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti. You have 13 minutes.
