, , Participatory democracy demands a fundamental process of timely, frequent, fair and free elections. This country's democracy had been damaged due to some former leaders who tried to take up arms and others who took up arms in the North and opposed the democratic form of elections. In the world, we know that no government whatsoever, which had postponed elections, had ever been popular among the people and had also very seldom been elected. Those fundamental facts are in front of us to see. There is no question that the justification of existence of Sri Lanka as a Republic and a multi-religious, multiethnic and I would say, a multinational State with nuances is, fair, frequent and free elections. Now, after the unprecedented economic crisis it had to face with the peripheralized, marginalized citizens suffering more than anybody else, this nation has come through the last 23 months and formed a stable and progressing Government.

Rejuvenating our economy has become and should be our number one priority at all times. The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran is here. He is a contributory Member of the Committee on Public Finance and he was very happy about the draft Act I mentioned earlier, except for one or two clauses which, I think, he raised about, using his vigorous legal eyes. So, we would be able, after a long time or possibly for the first time in our history, to bring about that Act on financial discipline under a leader who has foreseen this need, who is able to negotiate with and convince the international community and also to get the same officials to join this journey towards economic recovery.

Our priority should be, at least by the 2030-2040 period, to keep our debts less than 95 per cent of GDP, to maintain, minimum, a five per cent economic growth and to keep our inflation below three per cent. That is the priority, yes. Therefore, the Finance Ministry may play a bigger role in governing the State and the other Ministries may have to follow their instructions. The Hon. (Dr.) Nalaka Godahewa raised that question and I was able to very candidly answer him back, Yes. So, what do you think? I had been in the private sector for a long time before I became an academic. If the marketing department of a company messes it up with all their activities, it is the finance department which would take over and say, There are new financial regulations now.

Sir, I was in Mullaitivu about two days ago. The people there are still suffering from the effects of the war which ended in 2009, the COVID-19 epidemic which started in 2019 and other issues. They are still a suffering community and are only a fraction of the nation's entire lamenting citizenship. It is true that the memories of a broken land, bleeding wounds of a finished war and uncertainties of an unknown future is evident, not only in Mullaitivu, but also in the entire Northern Province, the Eastern Province and more or less, in all the other seven provinces, too.

[1.25 p.m.] . . ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, for the opportunity given to speak on this Adjournment Motion.

One might wonder why, at this time, the Opposition is moving this Motion for resolution by Parliament. Just three days ago, on Monday the 08th, there was an attempt before the Supreme Court by a person who was put up by someone to get the Supreme Court to say that the term of the President is six years and not five. A five-judge Bench

of the Supreme Court clearly articulated and told him to read Article 30(2), which had been amended by the Nineteenth Amendment and which very specifically says that the term of the President is five years. Then while that matter was there, the State tended to quote a document stating to be an announcement by the incumbent President saying that he believes that the term is only five years. I also appeared in that matter and it seemed rather curious why the incumbent President should say that at all. Nobody asked for his opinion on the matter. The matter was there for judicial interpretation and this letter was given.

And, I made the remark, following Charles Dickens, that there is a willing witness and an all-too-willing witness in relation to that announcement tendered to court. Now, things are becoming clearer as to who is behind this. Yesterday, we saw an announcement that the Cabinet had considered and approved the presentation of an Amendment to the Constitution, to amend Article 83(b) of the Constitution. That is an exercise purely designed to bring about confusion in the country and delay the holding of the Presidential Election.

When the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution was presented to this House, it was the then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who moved it. It was announced that only the amendments which do not require a Referendum were to be done at that stage because we were then moving to prepare a new Constitution for the country and because Article 83(a) of the Constitution was listed as one of the Articles which require a Referendum if it was to be amended, Article 83 was not touched. But, that did not mean anything at all, as to what the term of the Presidency or what the term of the Parliament were to be after the Nineteenth Amendment took effect because Articles 30(2) and 62 (2) were both amended by the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution, decisively changing the term from six years to five years and that is what is in existence as the law of the country today.

Article 83(b) merely states that if you are to extend the term of Parliament or the Presidency for more than six years, beyond six years, you need a Referendum. But, that can be allowed to remain as it is; there is no necessity to seek to amend that Article now and reduce the six years mentioned there to five years. That comes into operation only if Parliament attempts to increase the term of office of the Presidency or the Parliament beyond six years. For posterity, if that needs to be changed, that could be done in the new Constitution. But, at this stage when the Election Commission is about to make the announcement for the holding of the Presidential Election at the expiration of the five-year term, which is what is the extent and which is what the Supreme Court, on the 08th of July, has again decisively stated, not that they needed to say it, but that is what we can read and is so plainly there in the Constitution, to try to bring in an Amendment to Article 83(b) is for the specific purpose of trying to obtain an interpretation from the Supreme Court that such an amendment requires a Referendum. That is because Article 83(a) states that if Article 83 is to be touched, it would require a Referendum. So, it is a wholly

2049 2050

unnecessary, an absolutely unnecessary exercise that the Cabinet is moving to do, unnecessary for purposes of understanding what the term of office of the President is, but necessary for the incumbent, necessary for the incumbent to confuse and say that Article 83(b) needs to be amended before the Presidential Election is to be conducted.

If the incumbent thinks that the people of the country are so dumb, that they cannot see his hand behind this move, he is sadly mistaken. Why in the world would anybody now seek to amend Article 83(b)? Surely, it was he who moved the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution and advisedly left out Article 83(b) because that would have required a Referendum. He himself having done that, knowing that Article 83(a) specifies Article 83 as one of those which require a Referendum, now wants an interpretation from the Supreme Court that to amend Article 83(b), a Referendum is required. That has absolutely nothing to do with the term of Office of President expiring in five years, as the law stands today, because Article 30(2) very specifically states it is five years; you do not have to amend Article 83(b) for that.

So, this exercise, I want to announce to all the people in the country, is a subterfuge; this is an attempt to pull wool over peoples eyes into believing that somehow Article 83(b) also needs an amendment before a Presidential Election is to be conducted and that is a fallacy, that is false, that is wholly untrue and this exercise would only be for the purpose of delaying, not holding the Presidential Election that is due before the 17th of October this year. And, if the President and the Cabinet persist in this move of introducing an amendment to the Constitution at this point in time, they would be kicked out of office even before October this year. Then, people will have to get on the streets. Therefore, I am asking the Government and the Cabinet - all of those who are going to speak today can say, No, no, we are ready for the election - to hold the election without engaging in this subterfuge of an amendment to Article 83(b).

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) 27

"SL's new visa fee does not discourage intl visitors: VFS Global"

Public Finance Committee

The Director General of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority was there. I showed him the figures and pointed out very clearly how the tourist arrivals have dropped because of this new visa fiasco; I very clearly pointed out how that has been happening. Therefore, this drop in tourist arrivals is purely because of this unnecessary service fee - US Dollars 25 per tourist who comes here - that has been charged. A very large drop in tourist arrivals is seen during the period from January to April this year when you compare it with that of last year. Those figures were shown to the Director General of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority and he agreed with me and said that that is

2061 2062

because of the increase in visa fees. So, there is a large impact on our tourist arrivals because of this fraudulent visa deal with the so-called consortium that has been formed. Therefore, the Government and the Cabinet, who approved this deal, will have to take responsibility for this large drop in tourist arrivals, as a result of which our exchange earnings have also been seriously impacted on.

Sir, since time is limited or due to the brevity of time, I table* my detailed reply to the VFS's statement in the Business Page of the Daily Mirror newspaper of today.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) 25

I want to ask the Hon. President as to why we are creating this confusion, particularly at this time when we all know that the Constitution very specifically states in Clause 30(2) that the term of the President is five years. Therefore, this is unnecessary confusion, an unnecessary debate. Why do you have to bring it even to the Cabinet? There was no necessity for it. Obviously, when you do that, because there is no trust, people begin to think that actually there has to be an ulterior motive in doing that. I want to say this to the Hon. President: you have some more months to go and there are things you could do, which would create confidence in the country. You go and make the commitment that the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution would be implemented. I am telling you, please implement it. You do not have to wait to do that. Please implement the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution in this country.

We know that over a period of time, politicians had gone for several devolution mechanisms. In 1971, there were Divisional Development Councils; in 1973, District Political Authority; in 1978, District Minister system and in 1981, District Development Councils. All these devolution mechanisms were games played and then in 1988, the Provincial Councils System was brought in. All those were initiatives of the Central Government, but people widely believed that the last one was on the insistence of the Indian Government; that is what the people thought. Whichever way, without getting into the politics of it, I am telling the Hon. President now, since

2069 2070

this has been in our Constitution, implement it. We do not want any more commitments. It is in the Constitution. Those are things you could do. So, why are you not doing the things you could actually do? But, what are we doing in this country? The things that we should do, the things that are in the Constitution, the things that are in the law, the things that are legal and things that would solve the problems of this country are not being done. So, that is not an argument only about the North and the East, but an argument about devolution and an argument about the South as well. Lots of people forget the fact that over the past 30 years, we have had this Thirteenth Amendment in the Constitution and that it is only for six or seven years that the Provincial Council of the North has been in operation. But, in the south of the country, we have had provincial councils operating all along; we have had them all along. What had you actually been doing? You never gave funding to the Northern Provincial Coucil. Even today, the Central Government funding is about 68 per cent on Recurrent Expenditure and about 86 per cent on Capital Expenditure. Out of that, 75 per cent goes for salaries. And, what did you do? You created something without a logic or thinking about the economy. These fundings are powerful tools, if they are properly used for empowerment and properly given.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , , ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I am going to conclude, Sir.

There is an argument that provincial councils are not economically viable because there is duplication. That is absolute nonsense! Somebody said that if you abolish them, the GDP would grow by 0.5 per cent. But, the GDP would grow by 2 to 5 per cent, if you actually make them work.

Then, we have had a Colombo-centric development model for the last 50 years and the people outside Colombo have not been benefitting by that. They also must benefit and there has been no capital investment in that regard. So, finally, I am telling the Hon. President, "Sir, there is something you could do. Please implement the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution rather than just creating confusion over the Presidential Election".

Thank you, Sir, for the time given. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) 7
