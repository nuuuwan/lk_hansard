Hon. Deputy Speaker, I want to make a very serious assertion that this particular enactment is tantamount to promoting authoritarianism, totalitarianism and dictatorship. Sri Lanka is a democracy; Sri Lankas democracy has to be protected. In order to do so, we need to protect the freedom of media - social media, traditional media and non-traditional media. We sincerely believe that free media is an integral part of Sri Lankas democracy. It is the fourth pillar that protects and enhances the democratic values and virtues of our system. The Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary would be positively impacted on by having a free, productive and constructive media which provides the people of this country with truth.

I also would like to mention that free media does not mean that one could indulge in character assassination based on untruth. We completely disagree with those types of activities. We want truth to be victorious and truth to prevail, but restricting media space is not the approach we would subscribe to. So, I would sincerely request the Hon. Minister and the Government to take a step back, go ahead with further consultations with Internet intermediaries and stakeholders and try to ensure that we come up with a productive and constructive piece of legislation.

() ( () () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, this so-called Online Safety Bill, I think, has become a classic example of how the current Parliament is making a complete mockery of the legislative process. If you examine the history of how this Bill has come about and how it has been presented to Parliament, it is very clear that the due procedure given in the Standing Orders and followed in our Parliamentary traditions in terms of legislation has completely been violated.

This Bill was gazetted on the 15th of September, 2023 and 46 petitions were filed against it. When the case came up in the Supreme Court, on the very first day, the Attorney-General presented 31 Amendments. This is a Bill which has 57 Clauses and Amendments were proposed to over 50 per cent of those Clauses by the Attorney-General. The petitioners were not informed of those amendments and the lawyers appearing for the petitioners were not given any time to discuss the amendments with their clients. The case went on for three days without any discussion or a chance being given for those citizens who petitioned the court against the Bill to examine or discuss the Amendments proposed by the Attorney-General on the first day itself. So, it is there that the first violation of this legislative process occurred. So, a proper judicial oversight was denied and the opportunity for the public to object to the amended Bill was also denied.

Then, the Bill was presented to the Sectoral Oversight Committee. Yesterday, it was argued that the Sectoral Oversight Committee submitted a Report in relation to the Bill. I took a look at that Report. Basically, it is a two-page Report with the agenda. There is no real discussion, no real analysis or anything that is expected from a

Sectoral Oversight Committee. So, once again, it is very clear that the Sectoral Oversight Committee was simply used as a tool to bring this Bill forward for its Second Reading.

The Minister who presented this Bill is already talking about Amendments to the Bill. The Bill has not even been passed. So, he is promising the parties that the Bill will be amended, even before the Bill is passed. That itself shows that the Minister and the Government are well aware that this is a highly flawed piece of legislation. So, if the Minister himself agrees that this Bill needs to be amended as soon as possible - in fact, he spoke to me yesterday and said that within this week, further amendments would be presented to the Cabinet - what is the mighty hurry to rush this Bill through at this point in time? Why can we not take in all those amendments that have been discussed with the Minister by the industry and present a better piece of legislation at a later date, if the Minister himself is accepting that amendments are necessary? So, at this point, the Government is rushing through this flawed piece of legislation, which the Minister himself is accepting - otherwise, he need not talk of amendments even before the Bill is passed - is in need of amendments, ignoring all the voices of the Opposition. Forget the other political parties, forget the Opposition - this Government has consistently ignored the opinion of the Opposition and let us forget about that - but this Government is claiming that it is going to work with the tech industry to take Sri Lanka to the next step with regard to artificial intelligence. But, those in the tech industry, who have been named as Internet intermediaries in this Bill, have strongly opposed to the Bill, have many criticisms regarding this Bill and have also proposed serious amendments to that. But, this Government has chosen to ignore that as well. So, it is very clear that the intention of this Bill has nothing to do with online security.

Yesterday, the Minister talked about the need to protect women and children from online abuse. Women and children are trotted out regularly by this Government as a smokescreen to hide their most devious and most dangerous measures.

So, this Bill has nothing to do with protecting women and children. Already there are laws, existing laws - even the civil law was recently amended - that anyone can take action against defamation. The necessary laws are already present in our judicial system. The problem is not the lack of laws, but the implementation of the laws. If the Minister takes the trouble to actually talk to women and children who have faced this problem in this country, who have faced not just online abuse, but even physical abuse and harassment, the treatment that is meted out by the police, the very Department that the Minister looks after, he would get an understanding that it is not the lack of laws that is preventing justice from being meted out to women and children or protection of women and children in this country, but the lack of institutional or cultural change within the police which enables them to deal with the issues of women and children in a sensitive manner. There are many stories of how women and children are

treated by the police of this country. So, this is not because of the lack of laws; this is to do with their attitude, lack of resources and lack of leadership.

The narrative that the Government is putting forward, that the main intent of this Bill is protection of the vulnerable communities is a complete untruth. It is very clear that the one and only intention of this Government is to suppress dissent, to suppress dissent at a time when an election is due in a few months. Listening to the speeches made by the Members of the Government during this Debate, it is also very clear that what is being talked about, what is being presented is an effort to control criticism and dissent.

All the examples that have been brought forward today and yesterday refer to online criticisms that have been levelled against them, against all of us. That is part of public life. So, deal with it; we have to deal with it. When those online onslaughts were in favour of the Members of the Government and against their opponents, it was not a problem. But now, when it is turned against them, suddenly, they have become highly indignant and worried and are talking about online safety. There is no use in beating around the bush here. The intent of the Government is clear. It is about controlling dissent; it is about taking control of public discourse or public narrative at a crucial time in this country when democracy needs to be protected at all cost. That is not the intent of the Government and that every instrument is going to be used to stifle dissent is very clear.

At the same time, when we think about bringing in these kinds of legislation or laws which have an impact on certain constitutionally-protected rights, there is a need to balance competing rights. That is a hugely important thing for us to consider. And, in this instance, when it comes to matters like online safety, because it is very much on the edge of how we balance competing rights, that becomes even more critical. In a way, the Internet and the Internet revolution has democratized the media, has democratized the sharing of information. The citizens themselves are now creating information and news. That is a good thing, not something to be scared of; that is what we want. In a vibrant democracy, citizens have to be more engaged. We cannot be afraid of engaged citizens; we cannot be afraid of critical citizens. At the same time, we agree that there need to be measures which ensure that in the interest of allowing the right to express themselves, to express their dissent, other people are not harmed, that people are not slandered. Those rights have to be maintained.

However, when there are such competing demands, we need to be extremely careful about which of those rights we uphold and how we balance those many rights that, as an Assembly, we are committed to protect.

I also want to say this. If this Government thinks that bringing in these types of laws is going to thwart the will of the people, that it is going to crush the voice of the people, I think they are making a huge mistake. I repeat, they are making a huge mistake. If they want to win over the people, then they have to look into themselves,

223 224

(

2024 54

properly listen to what the people are saying, try to understand why this dissent is emerging in such a forceful manner and make some attempt at course correction. Rather, what this Government, those in power are doing is, try to crush that, not even acknowledge that there might be a basis on which citizens are feeling so angry and so excluded and unrepresented by those in power, who they themselves had elected. There are lessons to be learnt here, if those in power are willing to learn. But, the Government has demonstrated over and over again their unwillingness to learn. Therefore, I again say, you are making a big mistake. You are not going to be able to thwart the will of the people or crush their dissent. Also, I want you to think about the damage you are causing in your petty interests, your petty efforts to maintain power at any cost. Think of the damage you are doing to this country, to the reputation of this country internationally; think of the damage you are doing to the potential investors and the environment attracting investors to this country.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up.

() ( () () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya) I am winding up, Sir.

So, all of these issues cannot be secondary to the petty interests, the utterly selfish efforts of this Government to remain in power at all cost. There is still an opportunity for you to take a step back, an opportunity to do some kind of course correction. But, if you go ahead with this, the citizens of this country will reply in an effective manner.

[2.51 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Madam, I should actually have 12 minutes. From the initial 14 minutes, it has been reduced to 11 minutes now. It is unfair since we did not even break for lunch. So, you must not reduce it so much. We have only one speaker from our party today. - [Interruption] It does not matter, but they can reduce it from that party. We do not disturb the Proceedings of Parliament. So, Madam, please give me 12 minutes.

Hon. Presiding Member, I would like to commence by stating that we are debating this Bill - a highly controversial Bill - all in the dark. I say that because Parliamentary procedure under Standing Order 50(2) states clearly, I quote:

"Every such Bill shall be referred to the relevant Sectoral Oversight Committee without a motion immediately after the First Reading. The Committee may suggest amendments to the Bill. No further proceedings to be had until the Committee has reported back to Parliament or until the expiration of period of time allowed by Parliament."

Hon. Presiding Member, this matter was taken up by the Speaker yesterday morning. Just before the Sitting of Parliament started, the Opposition, combinedly, met the Speaker and brought it to his notice about the only supposed Report that has been tabled in Parliament on this Bill, which is the one I have in my hand and which states as follows, I quote:

After consideration, the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Media, Youth, Heritage and New Citizen, agreed to the Bill entitled Online Safety subject to the amendments proposed by the Supreme Court Determination to the Bill and resolved that the Report of the Committee thereon be presented to Parliament by the Hon. Lalith Varna Kumara, the Chair of the Committee, on Tuesday, 23 January 2024.

So, the Report that we are supposed to consider is what I have just read. We do not know what Amendments have been made to the Bill. Officially, we have only the original Bill with 57 Clauses, of which 31 had been asked to be amended by the Supreme Court. In addition, the Sectoral Oversight Committee considered the views of an expert committee appointed by the Hon. Minister himself and in doing so, they increased the number of Amendments to 42. That means, out of the 57 Clauses, 42 are to be amended and this House is debating a Bill being in the dark with regard to those Amendments, The Sectoral Oversight Committees Report should have given us a complete version of those Amendments, but it has not been done and instead, we are supposed to be debating this Bill, which is so controversial, without having any idea about those Amendments .

Hon. Presiding Member, on the 22nd, a think tank had a closed-door discussion and I was fortunate enough to be invited to that. In fact, the Government Members and prominent civil society activists, who the Government consults, were also invited. In those discussions, civil society leaders who are highly respected, extremely guarded in the way they express opinions and who do not get emotional about things and very senior members of the legal fraternity made accusations to the point that they said that democracy is being dismantled and this Act is a substantial nail in the coffin of democracy in this country. Those are the opinions expressed by people - both men and women - who are highly respected and whom you can hardly accuse as being radical, anti-Sri Lankan and anti-Government. I cynically told them, "We have been warning you. My party has been warning you for, at least, the last several years that this is what is going to happen".

253 254

But, when we said it, you all said that we were radical. But, today, it is you all who are being targeted. That is the reality, Madam.

Hon. Presiding Member, when the Minister of Public Security was making his speech yesterday on the Second Reading of the Bill, he stated that the Asia Internet Coalition - AIC - had been consulted and, in fact, they had given their consent. Despite the fact that all the Amendments they had suggested could not be included, the Minister had assured them that this Bill with the Amendments suggested by the Supreme Court and certain other Amendments from the Sectoral Oversight Committee will, first, be passed and thereafter, he would bring another Amendment to incorporate the further suggestions the AIC and others had suggested and that they were very happy with it. Those were his words, they were happy with it. Well, after listening to his comments yesterday, Madam, the AIC has issued an emergency media statement on the 23rd of January, 2024, which states this. I quote:

Despite our commitment to constructive collaboration, the AIC has not been privy to proposed amendments to the Bill. We unequivocally stand by our position that the Online Safety Bill, in its current form, is unworkable and would undermine potential growth and foreign direct investment into Sri Lankas digital economy. We firmly believe that for the Bill to align with global best practices, extensive revisions are imperative."

Those extensive revisions, Hon. Presiding Member, I am reliably informed, were suggested at the Sectoral Oversight Committee, to which both the Government and the Opposition Members of that Committee had agreed. So, it was just a simple case of the Minister accepting that, according to the Constitution, if those full Amendments would have made this Bill respectable and credible in the eyes of the international community, whose money or investments you want, then, the rightful thing to do is not to hurry it through, but instead, call this Bill back, cancel the original Gazette, incorporate all the Amendments, make the Bill credible, regazette it, present and debate it in Parliament and pass it without a Vote. That is the proper way to do it, if you want to win the credibility of the international community, the goodwill of the international tech community. But, you did not do that. How long would it have taken? One month? Two months? After all these years, can you not wait for those few weeks to make sure that the whole world accepts what could potentially be a disastrous Bill? No. Instead, whilst knowing this Bill is completely dangerous, that it is being condemned by extremely responsible sections of this very country and that, admittedly, it has serious shortcomings, you still chose to go through with it.

There cannot be any other intention, Hon. Presiding Member, than the intention of trying to curb public opinion. You want to manipulate public opinion, to manipulate information in an election year. You are terrified that the peoples genuine opinions will come out and therefore, you are rushing these Bills through so that you can shut the people up, shut genuine debates, shut the

fact that people could expose you for what you are and that is, a bunch of frauds, a bunch of people who do not have the electoral mandate to sit in this House. You have an unelected President who has been rejected by the people and an unelected Minister who is shoving these draconian Bills down the throat of this country. So, that is the reason, Madam. Otherwise, you all need not to have rushed. You are going to prorogue Parliament in a few days, which means we are not going to even sit for a couple of weeks. So, what is the hurry? In the meantime, you could have made sure that a substantial part of the process of this Bill is completed so that after the prorogation, you could have presented it in the proper way, won the credibility of both sides of the House, passed it and shown a face of credibility to the international tech community, whom you need. So, there cannot be any other intention because everything is weighed against what you are doing today and the only thing that the Government can benefit from by rushing this draconian Bill through is, achieve that very purpose.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . Please wind up now.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) The draconian nature of the Bill is what you want so that you could shut everybody up and manipulate information thinking that you could win another fraudulent election. It will never happen, Madam Presiding Member. It will never happen because, today, even though you might try to do that, the people are far smarter and you will face the consequences of every single action you are taking to reverse democracy.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I also agree with the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara. The Supreme Court Determination very clearly sets this out and Clause 7(5) is an additional Subsection that is being introduced now, and that is totally inconsistent with the Supreme Court Determination. It is a new Subsection that you are introducing and it is contrary to the Determination.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Charitha Herath) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Yes, the Hon. (Prof.) Charitha Herath?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Charitha Herath) 63 Determination . Standing Order number " .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, there is one more matter. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Yes, Hon. Sumanthiran? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) There are a number of matters that are directly contradictory to the Supreme Court Determination. I just want to draw your attention straight away to one matter. In page 59 of the Determination, the Supreme Court has stated that there must be certain "Exceptions from the applicability of the Bill". Now, that has not been included in your Committee Stage Amendments. The Supreme Court, in its Determination, very specifically states at page 59, "if SMS messages and MMS messages are the only user-generated content enabled by the service" and that those must be exempted from the applicability of this Act. But, that does not appear in the suggested Committee Stage Amendments put forward by the Government. You would have had to draft a new Clause for that exemption.

( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody, Attorney-at-Law) Sir, when this was taken up at the Sectoral Oversight Committee, the Chair did not take steps to peruse the Amendments Clause by Clause. As a result of that, this Bill had not been looked into the way it should have been looked into. That is why there is an absence of a Report by the Sectoral Oversight Committee and why we raised the issue that you cannot take this Bill up for consideration without a Report from that Committee. Now, you are facing these issues. So, Sir, you have to a take a decision now. But, I do now know, now, that is beyond your control.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I suggest that we go through this carefully because I have 13 items here with me - I can cite the Supreme Court Determination page by page and paragraph by paragraph - where your Amendments do not comply with the Supreme Court Determination. It is a very serious issue because if we pass this law without complying with the Determination, it would not be a law. So, we got this document containing Amendments only yesterday after the Debate started and overnight, we examined it. This is not to delay or do anything like that, but the law that we pass must comply with the Supreme Court Determination. I can give this document I have here with me to the Hon. Minister, where I have in writing, page by page, references to the Supreme Court Determination and non-compliance with that by the Amendments that are being proposed now. It is a very serious issue. The law would not be law after it is passed, if it does not comply with the Determination.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Speaker, this is the very reason why we wanted the Debate adjourned for us to discuss this a little more seriously. Now, I know the predicament of the Government. You have to do this carefully rather than rushing through, contravening the Supreme Court Determination. Now that the Hon. Sumanthiran, who led the debate in the Supreme Court, has pointed out all these lacunas, it is humanly not possible for the Government to consider all these across the Floor of the House and decide. There is a procedure laid down by Parliament, where you could refer it to the Standing Committee. It does not take very long. You can refer it to the Standing Committee and then, -

He has factual details to prove that there is gross contradiction between the Government's Amendments and the Supreme Court Determination.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Susil Premajayantha, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Chairman, at the top of page 15 of the Supreme Court Determination, this Amendment is allowed by the Supreme Court.

[6.57 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Speaker, I wish to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by the Hon. Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the House.

I do not wish to repeat what they said, but I remember one incident where Mr. Fernando safeguarded the integrity of the House. That was when the former Speaker, the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya, had to be brought into the House under police escort to conduct the affairs of the House. I still remember Mr. Fernando standing in front of the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya to protect him from various attacks and the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya was able to perform the duties of the Speaker at that time.

Particularly, during the COVID crisis, he showed his sporting capabilities; he looked after the MPs as well as everyone in Parliament and safeguarded the integrity of the House. At the same time, I would like to say that we used to meet him at the Party Leaders Meeting. He is a very courteous person. He is a very decent, civilized and a cultured person. I think everyone in this House appreciated that.

So, without much ado, I would like to wish him and his family all the success in life in the future. I am sure, with his all-round ability as a graduate and with his sporting capabilities, he might be gainfully employed in the future to his satisfaction.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) The Hon. Rauff Hakeem. [6.59 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Speaker, I, too, associate myself with the sentiments expressed by the other Hon. Members in wishing Mr. Narendra Fernando a contended retired life. I am sure, he will - as has been mentioned by other Hon. Members - carry with him some of those precious memories which are rare in public life.

He is someone who has a rounded personality. I have had the privilege of being involved with him even in sports outside this House and having come to this House, I have been able to see him as somebody who has served with such dedication for the last 42 years.

Particularly, as you know, Hon. Speaker, Serjeant-at-Arms is the second seniormost unelected official of this House who assists you in the conduct of affairs of this House. Very often, we see Hon. Members involve in both minor and grave mischief within the Chamber. Whenever that happens, it is important that the Serjeant-at-Arms has the qualities and the demeanor not only to be courteous and patient, but also to be stern and firm to see that the Mace is protected from the rioting Hon. Members. Sir, we have seen those happenings every now and then and even a while ago, when some of us got onto the Well of the House, trying to bring our protestations to your notice.

Having said that, I would like to read from Parliament and its Sovereignty, a book in the Library and which talks about this famous event. In Chapter 5, The Officers of Parliament, it states, I quote:

......Charles I, miscalculating, thought that he could rely on Speaker Lenthalls support when he forced his way into the Commons to arrest the five Members. Lenthall to Charless surprise showed that he interpreted his duty as owing obedience to the House rather than to the monarch. He said that he had neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak but as the House is pleased to direct.

So, with such events in the history and in the annals of the House of Commons, we, too, in line with those precious traditions, have to uphold the dignity and decorum of this House. In doing that very duty, Mr. Narendra Fernando has indeed served us well for the past 23 years in the Office of Serjeant-at-Arms. Of course, he was elevated to that office way back in 2018. But, he had been promoted to that office after serving so long as Assistant Serjeant-at-Arms and the Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms.

Sir, I wish him the very best in his retired life! ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Speaker, I must say, after listening to the Hon. Prime Minister, the Hon. Leader of the House and the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, that there is nothing more I could possibly add about the illustrious service and career of Mr. Narendra Fernando, not only as the Serjeant-at-Arms, but also as the Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms and the Assistant Serjeant-at-Arms.

When I first became a Member of Parliament in 2001, he had, that year, become the Assistant Serjeant-at-Arms. Thereafter, I think in 2006, he became the Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms. Eventually, since I got elected in 2020, he has been the Serjeant-at-Arms. So, whenever I have had the fortune of being a Member of this House, he has always been present in this Chamber. I can tell you, Sir, that there had been other very courteous gentlemen who had served as Serjeants-at-Arms right through my being a Member of Parliament, but no one has come as close to epitomizing the term "an officer and a gentleman" as Mr. Narendra Fernando does. He is one of the most courteous individuals I have ever come across, courteous to the point that even trying to accommodate some difficult moments, he has been extremely fair-minded and has never been partial. On the contrary, even if he felt that we were probably doing something that we should do differently, he would approach us in the most fair way in getting us to change our views when it came to our conduct in this House.

Sir, now, I must say the only thing which I do not think anybody else said. Since I have known him as serving in this Chamber from 2001 till now, he has not aged one bit! All of us look terrible when compared to him and I was shocked to hear that he is 60 years old. So, I think we also must take a leaf out of his book and probably shave our heads to hide our ages. He is quite a remarkable gentleman and I think all the Members of this House will miss him greatly.

We wish him and his family a great future and I am sure that if there is anybody who deserves the complete well wishes of this House, it is you, Mr. Fernando, not only as the seniormost government servant in Parliament, but also as a genuine individual, whom we will all cherish and miss.

Thank you.
