QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE

BRAIN DRAIN OF GRADUATES OF STATE UNIVERSITIES

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Speaker, an article published in the Daily Mirror newspaper of August 13, 2025 states that more than 50 per cent of students graduating from State universities in several standard subject areas leave the country and never return. It also states that that has been revealed by a research conducted by Professors Wasantha Athukorala and Lakshman Kumara of the University of Peradeniya.

Taking this opportunity, graduates who obtain degrees using our public funds, the very root of Sri Lankas development, go abroad and contribute their skills and talents to the countries they go to, and I present the draft bill today before this Parliament regarding the invisible but severe deficit of the huge and modest investment that the Sri Lankan people make on it.

Every student who graduates from our universities gets that opportunity because the rupees of the common people such as farmers, workers, teachers and small business owners have been invested. However, a strange and worrying trend that we see increasingly is that immediately after graduating, people go abroad without fulfilling their legal and contractual obligation of serving the country for even a minimum period of time. That is not only a waste of money, but also a waste of human and financial resources. That is a drain of our capacity, causes a slowdown in national development and even a defeat for the very purpose of providing free education. When graduates violate their contracts and go abroad without rendering any service to the country, they destroy the trust of the country and deprive the generations to come of the same opportunities.

After the Government, the taxpayers and the public invest in education of a doctor, engineer, accountant or a scientist, if they leave without serving the country for even a short period of time, it could be considered a public investment made for another country.

So, will the Sri Lankan people continue to spend funds on education of those who have no intention of actually serving the country? Or should we not make it mandatory for those who violate the contract to repay the full cost of their education, whether legally or otherwise, if they do not serve the country for a period of time?

Therefore, will the Prime Minister and Minister of Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education explain to this House the real causes for this national concern?

2405 2406

Hon. Speaker, as per the agreement, I have submitted the Question in both languages. So, now, I will ask the following questions in Sinhala.

1. , , 00 ?

2. (GDP) ?

3. ? , ? ? ?

4. , , , , ?

5. , ?

6. What reforms would the Government introduce to make bond repayment compulsory, enforceable and recoverable, including through foreign missions, when graduates do not fulfil their obligations?

7. How does the Government plan to ensure that the students of the future understand that this is not just about earning degrees, but about honouring, paying gratitude and giving back to people who made their education possible?

8. Will the Government commit itself to publishing an annual public report on graduate migration, bond compliance and recovery of costs so that taxpayers would know exactly how their investment had been used or lost?

Thank you, Sir.

REVIEWAL OF POLICIES IN LEASING SECTOR:

STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF LABOUR AND

DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC

DEVELOPMENT () ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Anil Jayantha - Minister of Labour and Deputy Minister of Economic Development) , 27(2) 2025.08.06 . , .

1. Question No. 1 pertains to lease contracts and the Central Banks involvement in it. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has not issued specific or separate regulatory directions to provide protection for all the borrowers who face involuntary default in the leasing sector. The existing Financial Consumer Protection Framework and Regulations are applicable to all the borrowers appropriately.

Direction on Customer Charter of Licensed Banks

and direction on Financial Customer Protection Framework for Finance Companies and Specialized Leasing Companies were issued in 2011 and 2018, respectively with the objective of safeguarding the interests of customers, maintaining a healthy relationship with them and strengthening customer confidence.

Further, the Financial Consumer Protection Regulation issued on 09.08.2023 states that financial service providers, including their agents or third parties acting on their behalf, must not engage in unfair business practices that harm financial consumers. It also states that financial service providers must not act in bad faith or display negligence when offering financial products or services. The term unfair business practices includes deceptive, abusive or misleading conduct, aggressive debt collection methods, increasing credit limits without obtaining prior consent from the consumer and imposing excessive fees, penalties, future interest or charges that are disproportionate to the actual cost incurred et cetera.

2409 2410

[ ]

2025 22

Further, the recovery actions are mainly governed by the terms and conditions agreed to between licensed banks, finance companies or specialized leasing companies and borrowers through finance leasing and loan agreements.

2. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has not issued specific or separate regulatory directions on recovery of possession of vehicles or equipment. However, the Finance Leasing Act, No. 56 of 2000 specifies the procedure for recovery of possession of vehicles or equipment. Licensed banks, finance companies and specialized leasing companies - LBs, FCs and SLCs - usually engage in negotiations with customers before recovery of possession of vehicles or equipment. LBs, FCs and SLCs consider the recovery of possession of vehicles or equipment as the last resort.

3. Directions are issued in line with the best international practices and to ensure adequate risk management procedures are followed within the sector. Demarcation between willful defaulters and involuntary defaulters is difficult at the regulatory level. However, LBs, FCs, and SLCs are advised to engage in negotiations with borrowers in good faith on a case-by-case basis.

4. The method currently in place is to review the hardships caused by events outside the borrowers control and provide appropriate relief. For example, at the time of the Easter Sunday attack, the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent economic crisis, a debt moratorium scheme was introduced with several concessions including temporary grace periods and established Business Revival Units and Post-COVID Revival Units with the objective of facilitating sustainable revival of viable businesses affected by those extraordinary macroeconomic conditions and financial hardships resulted from the pandemic.

5. Borrowers are able to seek redress through the Mediation Boards or the Financial Ombudsman. Further, a customer who is subject to unfair treatment can lodge a complaint to the Financial Consumer Relations Department of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka may call for additional information/documents, for a hearing from all/any party involved and/or conduct a spot examination/inquiry, as applicable. Based on the determination, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka may require LBs/FCs/SLCs to take specific actions where necessary. Also, borrowers have the option to take necessary legal action under contract or consumer law.

06. While the existing provisions are intended to be fair and balanced, if systemic issues are observed, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka may consider further policy refinements, considering aspects including not only the interest of borrowers, but also the interest of depositors.

07. At present, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka collects information from three banks - licensed banks,

finance companies and specialized leasing companies - for supervisory purposes. Therefore, the granular level breakdown of leasing contracts is not available with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. The large institutions have a large market share due to their wider branch networks, availability of resources et cetera and not necessarily due to regulatory asymmetry.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Speaker, - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Ravi Karunanayake? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I thank the Hon. Minister for his response. The reason why I put this Question forward was that there is certainly an inhuman aspect when it comes to repossessing assets, for which payments are not made on time. Creating a company only for business interests is not good, because the ultimate borrower basically goes to a finance company for the simple reason that he does not have capital. Sometimes, it happens that a borrower had already paid 50 out of 60 instalments, and for not paying the last 10 instalments, he is deprived of his asset as well as what he had paid before. So, that is where I call for intervention. But, I think the Answer skips around the issue. I know that you only give the Answer that is given to you, Hon. Minister. So, I think a humane touch needs to be pushed for by asking the Central Bank to relook at the manner of repossession of assets and the duration in which the company could repossess the asset. If a borrower has paid 90 per cent and is in the final couple of months of his lease, repossessing the asset at that stage is not fair. Therefore, I would like you to intervene on their behalf. Now, that is happening on a regular basis, and you can see that it also gets media publicity due to its unreasonableness.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Anil Jayantha) Thank you very much for the points highlighted by the Hon. Member from the Opposition. We will take the facts revealed in the Answer as well as the practical situation into account. As I said, our objective is to have a highly stabilized financial sector with less volatility. Again, thank you for the points highlighted. We will take them into account.

[2.28 p.m.]

() ( ) ( () - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harini Amarasuriya - Prime Minister and Minister of Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education) Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees, first of all, I would like to thank the Hon. Sivagnanam Shritharan for initiating this Debate on this Adjournment Motion. This is a matter that is important and worthy of discussion in this Assembly.

Madam, we are living in a time when we all are witnesses to a yawning gap between human rights discourse, treaties, laws and resolutions and the actual protection of human rights and human beings - people and communities. This is what, unfortunately, we are all witnesses to. We are living through an era where some communities, some people and some nations are viewed as deserving only, in the words of the Italian philosopher Agamben, a bare life, a life through which they can barely exist, a life they live in states of exception. They are not deemed worthy of the humanity that all of us lay claim to; certain people, certain groups and certain nations are considered as not deserving that humanity. So, that is the era in which we are living.

We, as the new Government in Sri Lanka, are committed to ensuring the protection of all of our peoples without exception, without division. For us, all are equal citizens of this country who are worthy of the same respect and the same level of acceptance, dignity and humanity; for us, there is no division, nor is there any state of exception for any human being, for whom we are responsible.

However, if we look around what is happening globally, from what we are witnessing today, there are important lessons for us to learn as a new Government: the importance of strong and committed leadership and having strong institutions which could withstand the pressures of change and corruption and most importantly, the importance of inculcating a culture of respect for human rights in any society. We can see how easily institutions could be dismantled or weakened, if that culture of respect for human rights is not normalized or accepted within a society.

It is a fact and it has been spoken of before as well that we, as the new Government, inherited a governance system steeped in corruption, privilege, abuse of power, complete and utter disregard for the rule of law - I would say "contempt" for the rule of law - and contempt for those who do not belong to that same privileged class. That system was also supported by a discourse which promoted racism, division and conflict between and within communities in order for that kind of privileged system to sustain itself by creating division between people and communities. Therefore, Madam, we cannot dismiss or ignore the impact of that legacy that has been

2479 2480

there for over 70 years in this country; this is what we inherited. These institutions, these norms, these laws, this general sense of who we are, all of this is what we are dealing with today and what we must address and, in many instances, dismantle. We cannot dismiss lightly the impact of the political culture that had been maintained and survived in this country during those years till not barely a year ago and what it had meant for us as a people and as a country.

Madam, it is also correct to say that if we look at all the perpetrators who have participated in violations of human rights, even those at the lowest level, many may not have intended to be evil; they might not even have considered themselves evil, wicked or even as breaking the law.

But, it was this culture of impunity, abuse and racism which allowed them to do what they did and not feel as if they had committed an act of unspeakable evil. So, that is the reality we have to confront and dismantle in this country.

Again, may I refer to another Italian philosopher, Hannah Arendt, who had written widely on these issues and this is something she had said, I quote:

The sad truth is that most evil is done by people who never make up their minds to be good or evil.

It was circumstances, cultures, institutional practices that allowed them to choose either to be good or be evil, and the more these cultures and institutions promote evil, the more these people would follow that path. So, that is why it is extremely important for us, as a Government, to create a culture, a different culture where respect for human rights is normalized, accepted and is considered a paramount part of how we engage with each other, how we relate to each other and how we live with each other. It is of paramount importance for us to dismantle the narratives and the value systems which upheld things like racism, misogyny, sexism, casteism, classism, all of these things that encouraged or created a culture where human rights were violated and could be ignored; dismantling this culture along with the institutions which supported such a culture is of extreme importance to us.

And, having listen to all the Hon. Members of the Opposition who have spoken with all humility, I would like to place on record that a different kind of culture of good practices is slowly - I grant you slowly - but gradually emerging. I think acknowledging this is extremely important. What we are seeing today is the space for people to act based on a conscience, based on an engagement with their own conscience and based on an understanding of what is good and what is evil. We, as a Government, firmly believe that in each human being, there is goodness and a desire for goodness. What we are seeing today is the ability for that goodness to flourish, for that goodness to emerge, for that conscience to be stirred and for their actions to be guided by that conscience and by that goodness, which is inherently

there in all of us. The ability to highlight their empathy, to be able to act with empathy, to be able to understand and relate to someone elses experiences - the suffering, emotions, feelings of someone - and to respond accordingly is what we are seeing emerging slowly in our country. So, I think, with all humility, we must acknowledge that that is beginning to happen, that this stirring of our conscience, the flourishing of goodness, the expectation that people would act with the goodness within all of them is happening, that that space is slowly emerging. Therefore, I think we need to acknowledge that; I think it is important that we acknowledge that because this is how change and transformation begins.

I am not saying this lightly. There are examples of that change and I think it is important that we acknowledge those changes and how the culture of good practices is emerging. We can start with the statements, the narratives that we have framed as a Government. We have consciously tried to avoid narratives, statements, discourse that sow seeds of division, hatred or violence.

We, as a Government, have consciously, always and consistently tried to promote ideas that bring about unity, respect, empathy, accountability and respect for human rights. We have consciously done that; all the Representatives of our Government, starting from our President, have consistently spoken about all of this. It is important that the Government, starting with the President, consistently maintain this narrative, this discourse, that we have stood by our pledge not to resort to racism and to provoke violence and hatred as a means of survival and maintaining our power. That is an important shift which, I think, we need to acknowledge. We have restored, I think to a great extent, the respect for the rule of law or at least the expectation that the law will function fairly without discrimination from top to the bottom, that the law will apply equally to all. All this is important. Our interventions when it comes to mass graves, the detention of people and all of that have attempted to correct ourselves when things have gone wrong.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees) , .

( ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake) , .

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harini Amarasuriya) We have tried our best to correct when things have gone wrong because, as I said, we had to inherit a legacy where things had gone wrong and where institutions have not transformed as much as we, as a Government, would have expected them to. So, when things went gone wrong, we have been willing to re-correct and also listen

2481 2482

[ ( ) ]

2025 22

and be responsive to public sentiments. There are several such examples. Most recently, if we take the Presidents intervention with regard to land in Mannar, sand mining and other development projects in Mannar, he stated very clearly that those would take place only after public consultation. I think the Hon. Adaikkalanathan also participated in those discussions. So, we are always willing to listen, to give space for those voices, not just of our Hon. Members of Parliament, but also of the public in general, to be heard. When there was concern over the implementation of the Gazette on land acquisition in the North and the East, when there were protests, we listened to them; we heard you. There was also a case filed with regard to that, but even prior to that, we heard you; it was not that case which propelled us to take that action. So, we are willing to listen, to hear out what people have to say and to re-correct things.

We also understand the indivisibility and the intersectionality of human rights. This is why, for us, socio economic development is fundamentally important, why addressing gender concerns is fundamentally important and why we acknowledge how class, gender, race and caste play a role in how human rights are experienced by people. We understand that and that is why we acknowledge this in how we work and how we plan and that we consider all of these rights as equally important and have to be paid attention equally. That is especially why when it comes to sectors like education, our policy is that we will leave no child behind. So, when there are special needs among the Malaiyagaha Community or in the North and the East, we will make special provisions; we will take extra effort. And, when it comes to development in areas which have been underserved, we will make special efforts because we understand how these rights are linked to each other.

So, Madam, once again, I would like to thank the Hon. Sivagnanam Shritharan for raising this and even in his Adjournment Motion, he has raised many of the issues that are linked with each other. Therefore, this, I think, is an extremely good move where instead of speaking of selected issues of a selected community, we are able to widen this discussion to talk about human rights, as they affect every aspect of our lives.

In conclusion, let us, of course, acknowledge where we have gone wrong. That is important. But, as a Government, we would request all of our Colleagues here to also acknowledge that there is a culture of good practice emerging and that there is a stirring of conscience which, we think, is fundamentally important to creat a new kind of society and a new culture that is far more respectful and empathetic towards each other and human rights.

Thank you very much for the time that was granted to me.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees) . 00 .

[2.44 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees, I am glad to follow our affable Prime Minister, the Hon. (Dr.) Harini Amarasuriya. She, in her inimitable style, delivered a very sensible speech, perhaps, regarding the Adjournment Motion that has been moved today. She, in her own style, referred to those pending issues with the sensitivities involved in them and said that they are very keen to bring the culture of impunity to an end to create a new sensible culture, a new era, which is to unfold from now onwards with the new regime in power.

Be that as it may, may I, Hon. Prime Minister, now refer to the matter that is gaining much publicity at the moment, the arrest of former President when he visited the Criminal Investigation Department. In all humility, Madam Prime Minister, when you attended a function a few days ago, there was, I believe, a YouTuber who was showing his affection in a very inappropriate way, in my opinion. You have been our Colleague and now, you are our Prime Minister. So, we have to show some decorum to you; whenever you are seen in public, we cannot behave as we are chums. That particular YouTuber also went on record virtually, announcing that the former President would be arrested. So, it appears that there is an inspired leak and that worries us. How can such matters be made public by a mere YouTuber? He, in his own inimitable style, may be having enough hits for his YouTube channel, but how dare he announces that much ahead of the incident! So, there is an inspired leak by someone in authority. How can that happen? Is this the new culture that you all are trying to bring about? And, that worries us. Whatever said and done - I have my differences, I have been in and out of his Cabinets, I have been against him and for him, but that is different - he was once a Head of State. He is summoned for some wrong that is perceived to have been done by him. Then, he is summoned to the CID to record a statement. What does normally happen when statements are recorded? You have other witnesses who had come previously and given statements about a particular matter regarding which an inquiry is being held. Then, you compare their evidence with the statement made by the person concerned, whoever he may be. He may be a VVIP, but that does not matter. Everybody is the same; the rule of law applies to everybody in the similar way. That is what this Government wants to brag about. But, what is the normal thing you ought to do? You report matters and file a "B" report before the magistrate. I mean, there is a basic courtesy that you extend to a former Head of State. What I feel is, this is unbecoming. There could have been a "B" report filed and he could have been sent summons to appear before the magistrate and then, if the magistrate felt right, the former President's attorneys could have made submissions and the magistrate could have decided whether to remand him or to bail him out. But, like a common criminal, to take a Head of State in and then produce him before a magistrate is unbecoming. He may be granted bail, that is a different issue, but I am saying that we, as Members of Parliament, do not want our

2483 2484

former Heads of State to be treated in this manner. The Hon. Minister of Justice and National Integration is a very senior criminal practitioner and he knows that that is the normal practice. Everybody should be treated equally, but when it comes to a former President, at least, some courtesies, minimum courtesies should be extended to him. That is my humble opinion and I do not want to say anything beyond regarding that matter.

Having said that, let me also speak about another matter since the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs is in the Chamber now. There is this particular Report by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. That is to be debated from 08th of September onwards for one whole month. That is going to take place in Geneva and I am sure the Government is getting ready to meet all the challenges that would be made in Geneva. But, what pertains here is some reference made to the Attorney-Generals Department. This Government has gone on record saying that they will create a new Public Prosecutor's Office. That is a welcome move. But, let us take into account what the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights says in his Report. I quote:

"The wide prosecutorial discretion afforded to the Attorney-General, a general reluctance to act on uncorroborated evidence, limited investigative capacity of the police, lack of qualified forensic experts and shortage of Tamil-speaking officers are collectively hindering victims' access to justice and perpetuating impunity."

"A key obstacle to justice has been the need for reform within the Attorney-Generals office to ensure an independent prosecutorial authority to prosecute grave human rights violations. In its policy manifesto, the Government had pledged to introduce a Directorate of Public Prosecution, independent of the Attorney-Generals Department. An expert committee has been established to study the establishment of an Independent Prosecutors Office. The Government reported that a Committee has been tasked to develop initial proposals and that feedback from public, the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka and civil society would be sought on the draft concept paper." ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees) , .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Well, I have some suggestions regarding the Independent Prosecutor's Office, but a very limited time has been given to us. So, I cannot deal with it in detail. But, once again, I would like to bring the attention of this Government to that matter, particularly since the Hon. Prime Minister made a very sensible speech. However, in moving away from the culture of impunity, her Governments approach should not mean that they want to do certain things for exhibitionism. The exhibitionist culture of this Government, particularly in matters like what happened today, is merely for gallery purposes, in

my opinion. You are trying to humiliate a former President merely to get some people to clap or applaud from the galleries to this Government. In my opinion, that is quite unbecoming when it comes to people of a certain stature. Of course, the rule of law applies to everybody the same way, but even in the minimum of cases, they file a B Report before the magistrate, summon him and then, give him the opportunity to be heard. Then, let the magistrate, with his discretion, decide what should be done. And, you should not humiliate a former President this way. That humiliation was already forethought and that is why the YouTuber announced two days ago that the former President would inevitably be arrested. So, this is certainly very unbecoming of this Government. Having said that, I conclude.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees) . 20 .

[4.32 p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Arun Hemachandra - Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Employment) Hon. Presiding Member, I think today is a very important day because many things have happened within a very short time. I must also thank the Hon. Sivagnanam Shritharan, Member of Parliament, for bringing in this Adjournment Motion because this gives us room to bring up certain issues and positive things and explain as Government Members. However, one thing I have to mention here is that it is so disappointing to see that none of the senior, prominent speakers from the main Opposition Party have taken part in this Debate. As usual, they have opted out of these kinds of debates and that shows the interest they have placed in solving this ethnic conflict as well as the other ongoing issues in this country.

Before I get on to the main topic of today, let me start with a citation from the Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights that was published. In page 13, it states, I quote:

The new Government has a historic opportunity and a clear mandate from communities across Sri Lanka to implement transformative reforms and deliver truth and justice, laying the foundation for sustainable peace.

2521 2522

[ () ]

2025 22

He also says, I quote:

The Government has pledged a fresh direction on several long-standing issues, including addressing some emblematic cases to deliver justice to victims, restoring the rule of law, eliminating ethnic discrimination and divisive politics.

This shows how much trust the international community has placed in the newly elected Sri Lankan Government. We are not here to justify any unlawful deeds of the previous governments. We are here to change the system and we know that changing the system is hard. If we consider it comparatively, it is harder than just getting on with the existing system. But, though it is hard to do, we are here to change the system and with the support of all the Hon. Members, we believe that that system change could be achieved as early as possible.

And, also with regard to the rule of law, I can see many steps being taken and I am pretty sure that it shows that the Judiciary of this country is working in an independent manner. Certain high profile cases have been taken up and many former Ministers were arrested. With regard to persons who had been at higher positions than that, at the presidential level, certain actions are taking place. So, things are moving. Maybe, things are moving at a little slower speed. However, we have the urge to change things and it is happening.

The Minister of Foreign Affairs, my Minister, made a historic speech today. He also emphasized the need to repeal the PTA and especially mentioned that by early September, a repeal Bill would be presented to Parliament, which, we feel, would be one of the major turning points. I, as a Member of the JVP, know that the PTA was brought in during the 70s and our party was one of the key victims of the PTA. If that was brought in for oppression, we believe that, now, we have the chance to repeal that and replace it with something which is not oppressive. But, if we need to address certain issues like underworld activities or some drug-related crimes, we would introduced some legislation on par with the global judicial system, but that would not be an oppressive law.

Also, I have to mention one other thing. Todays Adjournment Motion is entirely based on the Tamil community. However, we also have to acknowledge that certain issues are faced by the Muslim community also. As a Member of Parliament from the Trincomalee District, who was voted in or elected also by the Muslim people, I believe that we could bring about a system change which would treat all citizens in this country, whether it be Sinhalese, Tamils or Muslims, and we are paving the way for that.

Also, we have to address certain issues related to land in this country. Sir, as you know, this country was experiencing a different political culture for the last 76 plus years and now, we have the chance and a mandate to change certain things. If we take land-related matters which involve the Department of Forest Conservation, the Department of Wildlife Conservation, the Department of Archaeology, the defence authorities and various other

bodies, certain people's lands had been taken over by them during the war time. And, certain lands were being used by them for cultivation purposes. So, for certain reasons, those lands were taken over. All the Governments that were in power before the NPP came to power were not interested in solving those problems.

But, now, we, as a very strong Government elected by the people with a two-thirds majority, are addressing those issues one by one. And, I would also like to remind the Members of the Opposition that certain issues are deep-rooted and it is hard to change them, but we are changing them. I would like to tell you that a couple of days ago in the Trincomalee District, we took a decision to release 55-plus hectares of land demarcated for the Department of Forest Conservation and which have been used by the local people for agricultural purposes. We followed all the proper procedures and there were no issues hindering that process. So, it is going on now.

Also, with the Department of Archaeology, we have a very strong communication and have urged them to involve more Tamil-speaking officers so that certain things could be communicated to the people in those areas in an easy manner. So, things are moving: the PTA is going to get repealed, land problems are getting sorted out and many other things are happening. An equal ground has been created and now, every citizen will have his own role to play.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , .

( ) (The Hon. Arun Hemachandra) , .

So, in this regard, I would like to remind one thing to the Members of the Opposition: please do not try to divert the path of the Government. Please try to help us; please try to point out, if there are any shortcomings. We are trying to correct the system; we are trying to change the system and produce something new and for that, we need your cooperation. By trying to topple this Government, you would bring back that system which was entirely corrupt. I am pretty sure that the people of this country would not be happy to see that happen. Therefore, we urge all the Members in this House to support this Government to go forward.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 8 .

[4.48 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rajeevan Jeyachandramoorthy) Hon. Presiding Member, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to speak on this extraordinary Adjournment Motion, which has been brought in by the Hon. Sivagnanam Shritharan regarding human rights issues especially in the Northern, the Eastern and the Central Provinces.

First of all, I wish to state clearly that our Government is fully committed to protecting, promoting and upholding

the human rights of every citizen in this country, whether he be Tamil, Sinhalese, Muslim, Burgher or Malay. Human Rights are not privileges; they are the very foundation of democracy and peace.

Sir, when we debate about human rights, we must not confine the Debate only to the past. We must also look at the present and the future, whether our people live with dignity, whether they have access to justice, whether their children can study in good schools and whether they enjoy equal opportunities in employment and healthcare. We all know that challenges remain in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces because of the decades-long conflict and that in the Central Province, estate workers have faced historic disadvantages, but our Government has not ignored these realities and has taken concrete steps to overcome those problems.

( ) ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon. Major General (Rtd.) Aruna Jayasekera - Deputy Minister of Defence) Hon. Presiding Member, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to make my remarks on this very important subject of human rights.

Sir, first, I would like to speak about the status of human rights in our country and how the NPP Government responded and respected human rights over this very short span of nearly eight months of being in power. Human rights are the crux of democracy and dignity of every Sri Lankan citizen. Therefore, we must change this political culture and the behaviour by respecting human rights - HRs. We observed and exhibited that during the elections and the post-election periods by conducting violence-free elections. So, the NPP Government is committed to protect human rights of all without any discrimination, exception or compromise. We reiterate our unwavering commitment to justice, reconciliation and the rule of law; we abide by the rules of law and the principles that have been established. What matters mainly in the entire process is the rule of law, democracy and governance. Sir, all are bound by the law and must abide by the law, irrespective of who he or she is and regardless of race, caste, religion or whatever position held by him or her. So, the NPP Government, as a responsible government, is always responsible for maintaining the rule of law, as we have promised on stage before the elections.

As you are aware, we have had a very bad situation for the past couple of years. We were stuck in an economic crisis. There was not only an economic crisis, but also a collapse of democracy due to bad governance, which led to a crisis of democracy. So, after coming in to power, the foremost responsibility of the NPP was to establish the rule of law. We did it, we are doing it and we will do it in the future as well. We received a huge mandate across the country and that mandate shows the expectations of our people across the country. We work on three principles: to be pro-democracy, be against corruption and to stand for social justice. Therefore, I

2535 2536

must be thankful to the Hon. Sivagnanam Shritharan for bringing in this very important, timely and topical Motion today.

Sir, national security is the foremost component of and plays a vital role in governance and social, political and economic stability as well. There would be no economic stability, if there is no national security. So, the NPP Government will take all the measures to ensure that there is national security, before any crisis or any incidents occur or activities would be committed by anybody. Therefore, the foremost thing is to ensure the rule of law and to respond accordingly, irrespective of who the individual is. We will address strategic security concerns and contours geopolitically and geostrategically to ensure the rule of law and the stability of this country and of this region as well.

Sir, let me now move on to certain specific information and facts on how the security forces are being informed, educated and be made aware of the value of human rights and how best they should protected. Also, we believe that the rule of law is the foundation principle of democratic governance and the cornerstone of national security. It also provides the framework for protecting civil liberties, ensuring Government's accountability and maintaining public trust in institutions.

We have been speaking since morning about respecting human rights and their value. One unfortunate incident happened recently, on the 07th of this month, at a camp located in Muthiyankadu, where there are only a fistful of soldiers. The incident occurred just before midnight and on the following day, the soldiers who had occupied the camp were interrogated by a team of police inspectors. Then, three soldiers were taken into custody. So, the Government would always make sure that independent investigations are conducted.

Then, out of a total of 85,486 acres of State and private lands in the North and the East held and used by the military over a period of time, since 2009, we have released over 75,000 acres up to 21st of August and I will table* these statistics for the record.

More lands are to be released in the years to come. Next year, another 12,000 acres are planned to be released. About another 12,738 acres are still being held by the military, taking into consideration the strategic values, security concerns and the camps that have to be there to ensure national security. Then, the lands scheduled to be released this year include another 700 acres of State land and 43 acres of private land. Those lands will also be released very soon.

In Jaffna, we have opened the road running from Vasavilan Junction to the T-junction, which had been closed for over three decades. The Pulmoddai-Kokkilai

Road has also been opened for transportation of materials, the sand of the Lanka Mineral Sands Limited on the 10th April, 2025. Also, on request by the people, the road that runs alongside the Sri Lanka Air Force Station, Batticaloa will be released soon. And, more lands will be released in Trincomalee also, about 32 perches in Cod Bay and Thakwanagar and another 37 perches in Mutur and Kinniya. Then, there are four specific lands that had been raised about by the Hon. Shanakiyan Rasamanickam at the last Meeting of the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Defence. All four lands with one school, one playground and a corporative building have already been released. So, those are the actions taken by the Government and especially by the security forces.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) () . 00 .

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Harshana Nanayakkara, Attorney-at-Law - Minister of Justice and National Integration) , . . .

First of all, Hon. Presiding Member, I would like to thank the Hon. Sivagnanam Shritharan for bringing in this Adjournment Motion on a very timely and important matter. We, as the NPP, regard this topic very highly and as timely with the Session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva to take place shortly. You can see that there are six or seven Ministers sitting on our Front Benches and also other MPs to support this topic. I believe there are also about nine to ten MPs representing the North and the East. I thank you all for being here even at these late hour. I would have thanked the main Opposition party, the SJB, if at least one of its Members had been present in the Chamber, but they are not. Even when I looked at the speakers list, Sir, out of the 19 speakers from the Opposition, there were only three MPs who are neither Tamil nor Muslim and they, too, are junior MPs. Out of the three, two did not even come to speak. So, it is obvious what the SJB thinks of this topic. They think that human rights is a problem for the Tamil and Muslim people.

We are the NPP. Look at our speakers list. It is all-inclusive and very attentive because we understand human rights from the perspective of human rights.

2543 2544

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramanathan Archchuna) Then, you will have to come and - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Harshana Nanayakkara, Attorney-at-Law) Sir, I should not be disturbed. I am very glad that there are certain Members of Parliament who were doctors in hospitals. So, the people of the North have decided to make him an MP, which is very good, because if he continued as a doctor, it would have been disastrous for the patients. - [Interruption.] Anyway, in that sense, we thank the people of the North for sending him here as a Member of Parliament. The only thing is we have to put up with his nonsense. That is all.

Today, Sir, I heard the speakers; I heard you all with my ears, my mind and with my heart. I would like to say that I would not paint all the MPs representing Northern Province with the same brush. You all spoke the truth; you raised the concerns, but I cannot help but say that some of the narratives are too outdated. And all the speeches put together, the narrative was simple: this Sinhala Government is racist and they are not helping the Tamil cause. Now, that narrative is false. It would have been very true with the previous Governments, but not the NPP because we are all inclusive. We believe that nobody's human rights should be discriminated against on the basis of their gender, race, class, religion, disability or age. We want to have an inclusive society and we have extended the hand of friendship to the North a long time ago. The Northern people also extended their hand of friendship to us on the 14th of November last year and we will not let that hand go.

Some MPs exercise their vocal cords not to speak words, but to spit racial hatred and venom. I think it was correct when the Hon. Bimal Rathnayake said that some politicians of the North, not all of them, are more fearful of peace, love, brotherhood and comradeship with the South than they feared the war, because their racial and divisive politics are coming to an end. They cannot feed on hatred. So, I am telling them, "Please change your script; please change your narrative.

Even the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights who visited this country for merely a few days saw the progress we have made. But, your version is simple: "They do not do anything." I say, yes, there is a lot to be done; yes, we have not yet been able to solve all the problems affecting the people living in the North, the East and even in the South, but we have made progress, we have started delivering. So, if you do not praise us, at least, give us the credit.

Sir, in page 3, the OHCHR Report states, I quote:

Since formation of the Government, OHCHR has observed a noticeable shift in discourse among Government actors toward a more inclusive vision of national identity, although this has not yet resulted in concrete deliverables.

True. How can there be concrete deliverables? We have only governed for nearly one year now and we have four years left. We will deliver on all the promises we have made to the people in the North and the South.

Sir, there is a Vedic saying in Atharva Veda that states, War begins in the minds of men, which simply means that conflict originates from human thoughts and attitudes before being manifested physically. That same line, they use in the Preamble of the UNESCO Constitution. So, if war starts in the minds of men, or rather the people, then peace also must be built in their hearts and minds, not on law books. And, the National Peoples Power has embarked on that difficult and challenging journey. There will be no war, no conflict ever based on racist politics, never in this country again.

Also, Sir, if I may say so, we have made progress. However, I am going to ask a few questions from the Hon. Members who said that we have not made any progress. With regard to the Prevention of Terrorism Act - the PTA - they used their vocal cords to the highest extent and said, Oh, this Government is not doing anything under the PTA! Come on, unless you were dead since February, 2025, you know that we appointed a Committee headed by Presidents Counsel Mr. Rienzie Arsecularatne to look into the repealing of the PTA. They met for 14 times. Today is the last day they met and now, that draft Report is ready for public consultations and to be presented to the Cabinet by September. So, we have done that. Therefore, why are people still saying these things even today?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramanathan Archchuna) What about political prisoners?

( ) (The Hon. Harshana Nanayakkara, Attorney-at-Law) No, I should not be talking about insane people. - [Interruption.]

So, basically, we have started doing that. And why do I ask you to change your script and narrative? Because, otherwise, you would not have any politics to talk about when there is no PTA. We are replacing it with a law that has an international definition on "terrorism" and in such a way that the human rights or the freedom of expression of any person would not be challenged or harmed.

Also, it is good that some people still pay attention to what I say. Yes, there are long-term prisoners. But, there is a problem and that is why I asked you to change the lenses through which you watch us, the NPP. The issue of long-term prisoners does not come up only under the PTA. Even in the South, there are long-term prisoners with death penalty and life sentence without remissions and it is not a good situation. So, as the NPP, we know that it is a problem faced by not just the Tamil people, but even others in this country as citizens. That is why I have

2545 2546

2025 22

appointed a Committee with His Lordship Justice Thurairaja as the Chairman to look into sentence remission for long-term prisoners. So, when that is done scientifically and logically, I will be able to present it to the Cabinet soon and then, there will be a policy for the sentences of those who have been imprisoned or incarcerated for lengthy periods to be remitted and for suitable places to be given to end their sentences.

So, have we not progressed, have we not done enough or are you deliberately choosing to ignore what we do? I am not referring to the Hon. Members who are here - I know that you all are moderates - but to the ones who were spitting racist venom and have left the Chamber. I just wish they were here.

Further, I must thank the UN Resident Coordinators Office who helped us with UN experts in drafting the amendments to the Prevention of Terrorism Act and also for assisting us technically in looking into sentence remission. They are assisting us technically, providing us with information. So, they have offered help and that international assistance and help, we accept.

Further, if we take the Online Safety Act, yes, it is an oppressive Act. We have appointed a Committee consisting of the Minister of Justice and National Integration, the Minister of Public Security and Parliamentary Affairs and the Minister of Health and Mass Media. We are working together to come up with a law to protect individuals from cyberbullying and harm, and it would be done in such a way that it would be a law which would never prevent a person from expressing his political or any other thoughts freely. We will bring in that law.

It is true that we have not delivered any concrete deliverables. Why? Because it has only been one year since coming to power. But, have we not started? We have done a hell of a lot more than the previous regimes had done because we are not doing politics thriving on racism. Our politics are inclusive; our intentions are also inclusive.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramanathan Archchuna) We are looking at the outcome.

( ) (The Hon. Harshana Nanayakkara, Attorney-at-Law) Further, regarding the Online Safety Act, we have appointed a Committee with Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne as the Chairman. Then, the Committee on the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act is meeting for the first time next week. I have sent letters to the Committee and brought them back. There is already a draft, but there will be a consultation process. This Government will never bring in a law to harm any section of the community. So, we will have a consultation processes. Already, we have met a lot of parties; I did, personally. So, we are working

on that. By next year, the MMDA will also be finalized. That is why I asked you to change your narrative since there would not be much for you to talk about, if this is the line you try to be in.

Then, what about the Independent Public Prosecutor? Long before the IMF put it in their Programme and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights came here, we had already appointed a Committee with His Lordship Justice Kodagoda as the Chairman to look into the establishment of an Independent Public Prosecutors Office because that was in our Manifesto. We are a party that delivers on the promises in our Manifesto. That process has already started and we are working on those, but a little bit of speeding up is necessary. But, no one can say that we are not going in the right direction, because we are.

Also, I must tell you that we acknowledge the concerns raised by the UNHRC Report. Unlike the previous Governments, the NPP does not deny or dismiss them. We treat that as a call to strengthen democracy, justice and reconciliation. We did not create this mess, the previous Governments did. But, we are surely going to solve it. We will face the truth with courage; we will not run and hide.

Sir, I explained about the Independent Public Prosecutor. Not only that, we talk about the South also. The Batalanda Commission Report is now with the Hon. Attorney-General for him to contemplate and study on possible criminal charges; it is being worked on. Has any of these things, what we are doing now, happened before, during previous Governments? No.

As regards the rule of law, we said that we will establish the rule of law. Nobody is above the law. I was not going to comment on that because it is not part of the topic today. But, one Hon. Member of Parliament - I will not mention his name, but he is a senior lawyer - made a remark when Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe was arrested to the effect that the Government should not have done that or should have made an exception because he was a former President. Sir, the Goddess of Justice is wearing a blindfold. She wears a blindfold because she does not look at the social status, the educational qualifications, the pedigree or his school when sentencing a person. That is why we say justice is blind; justice only sees justice. The Goddess of Justice does not play any games by covering her eyes. So, I am a little surprised that that particular Member mentioned that. So, neither the Ministry of Justice and National Integration, the Ministry of Public Security nor this Government instigated any of these actions against the former President. Just like for any other normal person, investigations went on and the law is taking its course. We do not interfere with the Judiciary; we do not interfere with internal investigations. We have made the Judiciary, the Police and the investigating authorities truly independent. Is that wrong? Should we make an exception based on the social status of the accused? I doubt it very much. And, I will leave it at that. I would have spoken more, if that Hon. Member who made the remarks was here, but he is not.

2547 2548

Further, I am not saying that everything is rosy; I am not saying that our Government is perfect. We would make a mistake or two. Talk to us sincerely and openly, and we will correct ourselves. The Government is new, our attitude is new, but when it comes to the defence establishment and the police establishment, they are still old. So, there will be isolated incidents. Do not try to portray it as Governments policy or as the Government is sponsoring it. There was an unfortunate incident where a Tamil died and a hartal was held. Even before the hartal, those responsible army officers were arrested and remanded, and prosecution and action against them are taking place. So, what was the purpose of the hartal? Well, it was not a success, in the first place. The reason was, the people in the North know that we are not racist. So, that is not going to work. If we do unlawful arrests, let us know and we will work on it.

Then, is there any other government which has released at least 500 acres or more land to the people of the North and the East? We have opened up roads. Did they do it before? Why can any of you not say, Yes, NPP, we applaud you for the good things done, but let us do more. That, we would like to hear; that, we are asking for. So, we invite you to work with us to serve the people in the North, the East and the South.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , .

( ) (The Hon. Harshana Nanayakkara, Attorney-at-Law) , 3 . Now, I will speed up a little bit. So, work with us on these things.

Recently, there were some returnees from India. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the effect that those returnees are being detained when they come here. When the Hon. Minister in charge of public security saw it in The Hindu newspaper - I am sorry, we saw it in "The Hindu" newspaper, not that it was officially communicated to us - we acted, gazetted and instructed that that should not happen. It was a technical issue. On Monday, we will be informing of the actions to the Cabinet. So, an isolated incident took place, we acted on it. When I inquired, that particular letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had been sent on the 13th of August, 2025. They have stopped the flight on the 14th of August. None of us received that communication and by the 17th, it was on The Hindu newspaper. It is true that they sent the letter to our Foreign Mission, but surely we are only a WhatsApp away. So, I hope our international friends understand that we are here to work together. We are a Third World country and we may not be as efficient as European Governments and their bureaucracy. So, give us time and cooperate with us. Therefore, I would say to the UN and our international friends, we want your help, we

want your assistance and we are open and willing to work with you, but be reasonable. That is my request. Also, I would like to say that, for decades, a lot of Gazans have been waiting to be resettled. I hope the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees would look into that matter, too, and warn Israel that they are being naughty, if the situation arises.

Then, with regard to the Office On Missing Persons, it is true, there were weaknesses. What did the UNHRC Report say about the OMP, to which I agree? It states this much, I quote:

"...the Office on Missing Persons has not clarified the fate and whereabouts of thousands of forcefully disappeared persons and faces lack of trust from victim communities. Successive Governments, particularly during 2019-2022, have undermined the institutions independence by appointing members lacking credibility and independence. A lack of political will, weak institutional framework, limited resources and capacity have also prevented the Office on Missing Persons from achieving its core mission."

Which is true and which I agree to. That is why from the time our Government came in, we have been trying to expedite things. On Monday, I am putting up a Cabinet Paper to appoint a 75-person expert panel - that is not enough staff - to investigate these expeditiously, for which I am asking for allocations and the Cabinet will give those to me.

The ONUR - the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation - is working with the UN Resident Coordinators Office and the UN to establish a reconciliation plan and a roadmap. So, we are on it.

Then, taken the Chemmani mass graves, of which people are talking about. You all are talking only about Chemmani. There are 17 mass graves sites, with which the Office on Missing Persons is currently engaged, assisting effectively in court cases and allocating money and experts. We are getting cooperation from the ICRC; we are speaking with our international partners and friends to get expertise to help us because we do not want to cover up anything. For us, the graves in Chemmani are important; the Matale grave is important and also the Port City is important. As long as it is a human being and a Sri Lankan, that is our responsibility. His race, caste and religion are immaterial to us.

I have to conclude now because of the time constraint. Finally, I just want to say, let us work together on this; it is a sincere invitation. What people say and what they actually mean are two different things. Let us do politics on other fronts, but let us work together in this. Humans are humans. We cannot divide them on the basis of geography. Whenever some Opposition Member, a Representatives from the North, says "our people", I say, do not use the term "our people" just to represent your ethnic community. Use the term "our people" to represent people, both from the North and the South. We have friends in the North, unlike previous governments. I have friends and family in the North. We walk on the streets; we talk to them and ask them, What do you think of the Government now? And they say, Sir, we have a lot of problems and all the problems are not getting solved, but

2549 2550

2025 22

we are being positive that something good is happening. I have distant members of my extended family in the North. We go there like normal citizens and talk to them. When my mother-in-law visits her hometown, Tellippalai, we speak to people. They say, Okay, you guys are not perfect, but we are happy because you are heading in the right direction.

So, let me invite you, let us finish off this racial hatred and divisive politics. Clean Sri Lanka means, clean minds and hearts. We are clean in mind and heart. When it comes to human rights, we are not just ticking off boxes for the UN or complying with the human rights conventions. We are doing what we do from the bottom of our hearts and we are not just ticking off boxes. We are not doing this out of fear for the UN; we are doing it because that is the right thing to do and that is what we have promised to do. So, I invite all the people from Point Pedro to Dondra, let us unite and protect each other because, for us, all are brothers and sisters, at the end of the day. Thank you very much.
