. . ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . () ( ) ( () - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harini Amarasuriya - Prime Minister and Minister of Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education) Hon. Speaker, I just want to draw your attention to Standing Order No. 27(2), which allows for this type of Questions to be raised. And, I know this matter has also been discussed at the Committee on Parliamentary Business. It states, I quote:

The Secretary-General shall, upon receipt of any notice in respect of any question, unless the Speaker rules any question out of order, include in the Order Book for answer on a day not earlier than seven clear days from the day on which the notice was given: Provided that, any question relating to a matter of urgent public importance may be asked by the Leader of the Opposition or a leader of a recognized political party at the conclusion of questions...

I will respond to this Question raised by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, but I also want to place on record that this Question could have easily been asked under the normal Questions for Oral Answers. The nature of this Question is not of urgent national importance. It asks how many State universities are there in the country. These are matters that could be raised under Questions for Oral Answers, Adjournment Questions and also as an Adjournment Motion. So, there are several other ways to raise it. Standing Order No. 27(2) must be used to raise issues of national importance, of urgency. So, I request the Hon. Speaker to give a Ruling on the nature of the Questions to be raised under Standing Order No. 27(2) and on the appropriateness of the Questions raised. There are 13 parts to this Question raised by the Hon. Member under Standing Order No. 27(2). This Questions was brought to the notice of my office only yesterday. So, it has 13 questions under two sections: section A has seven questions and section B has six questions. Hon. Member, most of these questions could be raised under any other provision. If you want to raise an issue specifically about the Sabaragamuwa University, that could have been raised as a single Question and I am happy to answer it. I will answer all of your Questions, but I am raising this as a point of Order and for your Ruling, Hon. Speaker, since this is not appropriate, in my view.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harini Amarasuriya) Sir, I do not want to get in to a debate on this. I am not asking the Hon. Member to respond either. I am asking the Hon. Speaker to make a Ruling on the nature of the Questions that may be permitted under Standing Order No. 27(2). I will now proceed to answer your Questions. That is a separate issue. But, in my mind, this is a misinterpretation, a misrepresentation and if I may say, an abuse of the privileges given under Standing Order No. 27(2). Standing Order No. 27(2) is specifically to raise an issue or issues of a particular significance at the moment.

Questions such as How many State universities are there in the country? and What is the intake per year to all universities? are not urgent issues. I am happy to answer this. How many students leave the country for higher education? again is a question that could be asked under Questions for Oral Answers or as an Adjournment Question. So, there are many other ways in which these Questions could be raised. So, I am requesting the Hon. Speaker for a Ruling on this.

Now, I will answer the Question with your permission, Sir. - [Interruption.]

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harini Amarasuriya) Hon. Speaker, I did not raise this expecting a response from the Hon. Member. I am bringing this to the notice of the Hon. Speaker and you said that you will give a Ruling on this, Sir. So, I will wait for your Ruling. In the meantime, I will answer your Question, Hon. Member. Sir, the Answer is as follows:

A 1. There are 17 universities and 18 higher

educational institutes under the purview of the University Grants Commission. The proposed intake for the 2024/2025 academic year, GCE (A/L) 2024 is, 43,237. There are another five universities which had been established under separate Acts and they will also be admitting students according to their Acts.

2. This is also very variable because it depends on

the programme that the student is enrolled for and the average cost - this is according to the costs calculated in 2022 - is Rs. 405,313.

3. This somewhat a vague question because all

students who sit for GCE (A/L) do not necessarily intend to get into State universities. They may have multiple motivations: some of them may go directly for employment; some of them may go abroad and some others may enter private higher educational institutions. There are external degree programmes conducted by universities under the purview of the UGC. There is also the Open University of Sri Lanka, which offers open and distance learning facilities for students or adults to enter into higher education at any point. Then, there are the Institute of Technology University of Moratuwa, the Institute for Agro Technology and Rural Sciences under University of Colombo and many higher educational institutions offering vocational streams within the State sector also. In fact, there are also 29 non-State universities and higher educational institutes approved by the Ministry of Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education, where students who have not been selected directly from GCE (A/L) could also get admitted to.

4. It is noted that most students leaving the

country for higher educational opportunities do

so privately through various private institutions and therefore, there is no data available with the Ministry of Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education about the number of students who leave for higher education.

Also, it is not necessarily because of lack of opportunities; that is not the only reason. It is also their choice. The students can choose to study abroad and that is a choice we have to respect and allow for. It does not mean that they are going abroad because there are no opportunities here.

5. Currently, private higher education providers

offering local degree programmes are recognized under the provisions of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978, and that recognition is granted through the procedures that are stipulated in the Act.

In line with the Governments vision to enhance the quality and diversity of higher education in Sri Lanka, I have directed the University Grants Commission to take the leadership in the development of a comprehensive policy framework for the non-State higher education sector. Once a review is done on the existing landscape in the non-State higher education sector, we will then take appropriate steps as to how this should be regulated and how recognition should be provided to the non-State higher educational institutions. But, we first need to get accurate information about the current existing landscape.

6. As to the foreign students in universities and

higher education institutions under the purview of the UGC, the numbers are as follows:

In 2023, there were 240 foreign undergraduate students and in 2022, there were 217 foreign undergraduate students. In 2023, there were 806 postgraduate students and in 2022, there were 724 postgraduate students.

7. The Government continues to implement the

Interest-Free Student Loan Scheme, which was introduced in 2017 as proposed under the 2017 Budget Proposal. This initiative was launched with the intention of expanding access to higher education and this scheme enables eligible students to pursue degree programmes at recognized non-State higher education institutes through interest-free loans. Initially, a maximum loan amount of Rs. 800,000 was provided from intake 1 to 7. However, according to Cabinet Decision No. 24/1721/607/127 dated 02nd September, 2024, this amount was increased up to Rs. 1,500,000 for certain subject streams from intake 8 onwards. In addition, a stipend loan of Rs. 300,000 is also provided to support living and incidental expenses. From 2017 to 2024, over 22,000 students have benefitted from this scheme across eight

819 820

2025 0]

intakes with more than 17,000 students currently continuing their studies or having completed their degrees.

B 1. This question is with regard to the incident that

took place at the Sabaragamuwa University. The UGC has initiated an inquiry into this. There is a committee that has been appointed to investigate into the incident. That is separate to the police investigation that is ongoing. Representatives from the UGC have also been appointed to this investigation committee to investigate into the leadup and the incidents surrounding the tragic death of the student at the Sabaragamuwa University. The Vice Chancellor of the Sabaragamuwa University has instructed the Chair of the investigation committee to also include the representatives proposed by the UGC in this Committee.

2. The Centre for Gender Equity and Equality

maintains a 24/7 online complaint portal since the year 2017 and a helpline operating during working hours to receive complaints on ragging and sexual and gender-based violence. We recently had a discussion and have taken steps to make sure that this helpline is operational 24 hours of the day. All of these complaints received through e-mails, letters and in person are fed to the online complaint portal. The complaints are then referred to the Gender Focal Point in the university and referred to the Vice Chancellor within three working days for an initial investigation and the Vice Chancellor must report back to the UGC within a two-week period.

There are also preventative measures, which have been taken in the past also, that we have asked the UGC to intensify now. Introduction of workshops and awareness programmes are some of actions taken based on the findings of a research conducted in 2018 by the Centre for Gender Equity and Equality titled Prevalence of Ragging and Sexual and Gender Based Violence in Sri Lankan State Universities. So, we have asked that awareness programmes on prevention of these issues also be intensified within the university system.

3. The Ministry had a meeting last week with all the Vice Chancellors, Marshals and all others responsible for student discipline and dealing with these matters including gender focal points of all universities. It was proposed that a Task Force be established to identify short-term as well as medium and long-term steps that could be taken to deal with this issue because we understand that it is complicated. Ragging is no longer what, at least, my generation understands as ragging; it is much more complicated. It is not only ragging. There is also bullying, harassment and online violence. So, all of that need to be looked at, investigated, understood and a proper mechanism must be set up to address these issues.

4. So, there are two things that we are doing. One

is, we have instructed the Vice Chancellors and the UGC to make sure that the existing law is implemented to the letter. But, that is a punitive matter. We are also very focused on preventive measures and making sure that the university environment, in no way, supports these kinds of incidents. So, this is why this Task Force has been established to identify what measures need to be taken to address this issue. If the Task Force recommends and the Vice Chancellors and the UGC also feel that the existing legislation is insufficient, we will review it or bring in new legislation, as necessary. But, I want to emphasize again that punitive measures themselves are not going to address this problem. This is far more complicated and it is also linked to student welfare and support. So, what is required is a comprehensive approach to deal with this issue holistically.

5. The Centre for Gender Equity and Equality -

CGEE - has initiated the establishment of a Survivor Support System designed for victims of violence and harassments of ragging to come forward and to support witnesses, facilitating the reporting of these incidents and making sure that those who report such incidents or come forward with complaints are supported through this process as well.

6. Then, the Hon. Member has requested for the

names of all registered student unions operating in the universities. Since this Question reached me yesterday, I have not obtained all the information yet. So, that information is not available with me at the moment.

Thank you, Hon. Speaker.

/ PRIVILEGE: SUSPENSION OF LIVE TELECAST OF

SPEECHES BASED ON MISLEADING

ALLEGATIONS

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramanathan Archchuna) Good morning to you! Sir, I am really thankful to you for giving me this opportunity to raise this matter of Privilege in Parliament.

Sir, I have given three letters. Now, I will read the letter which was given on the 08th of April, 2025. I have given another letter on the 09th and again, I came to your office and gave a letter dated 21st of April. I will read the letter dated 08th April, as you have instructed me. Again, thank you so much, Sir, I really appreciate it. The letter states,

"Subject: Request to Restore My Parliamentary Privileges and Address the Misleading Allegations Raised Against Me.

Hon. Speaker,

I, Dr. Ramanathan Archchuna, Member of Parliament and the Leader of Independent Group 17, respectfully write to bring to your kind attention a matter of serious concern pertaining to the restriction placed on broadcasting my Parliamentary speeches through official media and live telecasts of Parliament.

It is with deep regret and dismay that I have come to understand that this restriction was imposed based on the statements made by Hon. Bimal Rathnayake, the Leader of the House, during the second week...."

I guess, it was on the 17th.

"....of March 2025, in which he alleged that I had made derogatory remarks in Parliament referring to a respected lady lawyer, Ms. Swasthika Arulingam, in an undignified and inappropriate manner,...."

825 826

He had mentioned that I have assaulted her in a sexual manner. The letter goes on to state,

".....and additionally claimed that I had made remarks offensive to the Muslim community in Sri Lanka.

I categorically deny these allegations."

Again, I say that I categorically denying these allegations.

"I am firmly committed to upholding the dignity of this House and the rights of all communities in Sri Lanka, including the Tamil and Muslim minority populations, whom I proudly represent."

I was given a mandate by the people of Jaffna, who are Tamils and Muslims. So, kindly consider that.

"The statements made by Hon. Bimal Rathnayake are not only factually incorrect but have also resulted in serious consequences for my rights as a Member of Parliament, especially, the denial of my right to freely address the House and have my voice heard by the public through official Parliamentary channels. "

You have made my voice unheard for about eight days, which is the voice of the minorities.

"Your good office has, without conducting any formal inquiry or providing me the opportunity to respond, imposed a ban on broadcasting my speeches. I view this as a violation of my Parliamentary Privileges as enshrined in the Constitution and the Standing Orders of Parliament, particularly in light of the fact that on previous occasions where similar or more severe breaches occurred."

And nobody was expelled.

"On the contrary, I have been continuously denied the opportunity to speak in this House for over 77 days, without any appropriate justification or due process. Meanwhile, other Members who have made far more serious or contentious statements have been allowed to speak uninterrupted during multiple Sittings, with no comparable punitive action being taken against them."

Please, kindly note that.

"This selective enforcement of rules is deeply concerning and undermines the principles of equity and justice within parliamentary proceedings.

As such, I humbly request the following:

1. That a formal inquiry be conducted into the allegations raised by Hon. Bimal Rathnayake to determine the truth and the accuracy of his claims.

2. That immediate steps be taken to restore my right.."

Unfortunately, I was punished.

".. to address the Parliament and to ensure my speeches are transmitted and recorded through all official Parliamentary media as per standard procedure.

3. That disciplinary or corrective measures be considered against Hon. Rathnayake if it is found that he intentionally misled Parliament.." I repeat "if it is found that he intentionally misled Parliament.."

"..and tarnished my reputation and Parliamentary Privileges."

Which is a wrong thing according to the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act. If you allow me, I will read from the Act. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member, please read what you have submitted.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramanathan Archchuna) Okay, Sir.

"4. That I be granted permission under Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act.." Sir, I changed the submitted text there.

".. to raise this matter officially at the next Sitting of Parliament,.." This Question of Privilege was given on the 08th of April, 2025.

"..in order to ensure transparency and fairness.

Hon. Speaker, as a Tamil-speaking Member of Parliament representing the historically underserved Northern Province, I view this situation not only as a personal injustice, but also as a broader issue of equitable representation and respect for minority voices in this august Chamber. I trust that your good office will take the necessary steps to address this matter promptly, justly and in keeping with the high standards of dignity and impartiality that the Office of the Hon. Speaker must uphold.

Furthermore, I am deeply concerned that this ban may be influenced by the prevailing political climate.." I repeat "the prevailing political climate".

"..and sensitivities surrounding the Northern Province.."

"..where I serve as a Representative of the people."

You cut off my voice and lost at the polls. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member, please read what you have submitted.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramanathan Archchuna)

"I sincerely hope this action is not a politically motivated measure aimed at suppressing minority representation or dissenting voices in Parliament. I respectfully urge your good office to ensure that an impartial and transparent inquiry is conducted.." Through the Committee on Ethics and Privileges

"..to ascertain that no such political influence has played a role in this decision, thereby safeguarding the integrity of the Parliamentary process.

Thank you for your kind attention. Thank you. Yours faithfully,

Dr. Ramanathan Archchuna Hon. Member of Parliament Jaffna District"

Hon. Speaker, I really appreciate you for letting me speak in this Parliament after 77 days and again, after 30 days.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I will take appropriate action.

BUSINESS OF THE PARLIAMENT

( ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake) Hon. Speaker, I move,

"That the proceedings on Item Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 appearing on the Order Paper be exempted at this days Sitting from the provisions of Standing Order No. 24(2) of the Parliament."

Sir, this is based on a decision taken at the Meeting of the Committee on Parliamentary Business held on 02nd May, 2025 and the Minutes state, I quote:

"Subsequently, it was agreed to enlist the Private Members' Motions for debate suspending Standing Order No. 24(2) of the Parliament.."

So, this is a decision of the Committee on Parliamentary Business.

() ( ) ( () - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harshana Suriyapperuma - Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning) Hon. Presiding Member, thank you very much for the opportunity given to me. In fact, it is a privilege to support the Motion put forward by the Hon. Lal Premanath relating to a very timely and important subject matter and which proposes that the structures and buildings constructed in the pretext of development, but yet abandoned, as of now, be used for the benefit of the public and put to good use. This is a timely initiative that is being proposed because the money that we had spent as a nation over the years and decades on those belongs to the people, money that people paid as taxes and money that this nation has borrowed from foreign nations and local parties. As a result, the Government has become indebted and unable to service our debts. It is very important to find out the exact amount we had spent on those structures and buildings which need to be put into good use. In that sense, it is a very timely proposal that the Hon. Member has made and we sincerely support this proposal.

The sad reality of these abandoned structures and buildings, as of now, Sir, is that they have become a menace to the society. They are currently being used for illegal activities, have become breading grounds for mosquitoes and places for dumping garbage creating challenges to the society. On top of that, in addition to the

money that the Government had spent on constructing those buildings, it continues to spend on maintaining those structures, whereas these structures and buildings were expected to generate an income for the Government and to provide services to public - the citizens, businesses and investors and to facilitate the activities of the Government. Instead, they have now become a burden to the Government with additional expenses incurred to maintain them because those were not constructed to the right standard. Also, the objective of building those at that time is very questionable, whether it was to build them to the required quality standards or whether those were used for the contractors and connected parties of politicians to make money. Therefore, it has become a necessity for us to put those buildings into right use, but, at the same time, we have to identify what had happened as well.

Sir, our intention, as the present Government, is to put those structures into right use after completing them. This year's Budget has allocated or provided for the required financial resources to complete them and to make use of them for our requirements such as to build market places, trading places, support tourism sector activities, business activities and public activities and even for educational purposes, training colleges or for whatever purposes they are useful without taking further time.

It is not only the Government that is going to invest in and do it, but we are going to do it with the participation of the private sector under a PPP - Public-Private-People - partnership. It is very important to understand the current Governments road map laid down through the input of the Ministry of Finance and Planning and the Comptroller Generals Office, under which these buildings and structures are to be identified, data to be collected, recorded and verified and the level of web structures and web-based solutions are to be developed; dashboards will be providing the necessary information. That is our wish. It is not only a wish, the work has already commenced. The particular system that we are referring to is not only to track buildings, but also motor vehicles, other assets and infrastructures of the Government as well. The part relating to vehicles has already been completed. Our ambition, Sir, is to complete the componant relating to buildings before the end of this year.

We know it is an ambitious target considering the fact that this project has been going on for a long period of time. But, we are determined, with the help of the officials who are involved, to complete this and to ensure that we are able to give the benefit back to the people who paid and who are continuing to pay for the financial resources the then Governments had spent on those structures.

Sir, I will take this opportunity to mention the relevance of that initiative to this Debate going on at the moment. Those buildings, as I mentioned earlier also, were expected to provide services to the citizens and the businesses of this nation including the SME sector and our investors. Since I mentioned about the SME sector, I would like to give some update to the House on parate execution and the subsequent relief mechanism the

present Government implemented to assist them. We had nearly Rs. 212 billion worth of loans that were in stage 3 default category. Through the relief mechanism we have introduced, borrowers of the SME sector holding nearly Rs. 81 billion worth of loans, to whom we are supposed to serve through these structures and buildings invested on, have reached out to the banking system, as of now, for negotiations and discussions to obtain necessary relief, who are about 40 per cent of the SME sector business owners struggling and facing a lot of difficulties. It is a good outcome, but not a very satisfactory outcome as well. We wish that the remaining business community of the SME sector would also reach out to the banks. So, this is an invitation for them to reach out to the banks and see whether the banks could continue to provide relief. Of the 40 per cent borrowers who have reached out to the banks, nearly Rs. 6 billion worth of loans have already been restructured and the banks have informed us that some have started repaying those loans as well. And, we are happy to note that some banks as well have offered benefits to them beyond what was originally anticipated. So, it is a successful outcome, as of now, but we want to engage more and more businesses, for them to reach out to the banks, start discussing and negotiating with the banks to see whether a successful deal could be reached despite the deadline having ended.

So, as I have mentioned, this is a timely intervention from the Government to ensure that the structures put up with the financial resources allocated in the past are identified, at least, now, completed and after completion, are put to good use. We expect to use some of the investments the investors who are awaiting and willing to bring to Sri Lanka on those buildings and structures. Some of those structures could be used to earn additional income for the Government as well as for the private sector. By contrast, they would contribute to the tax revenue of the Government as well. But, what is more important now is to focus on these structures currently under-utilized or unutilized and worse still, being used for illegal purposes. Through this engagement, we believe, we would be able to achieve a good outcome. Also, Government resources have been allocated, the political will and support are there and government servants are lined up to make sure that these projects are completed.

Thank you very much, Sir, for the time allotted.
