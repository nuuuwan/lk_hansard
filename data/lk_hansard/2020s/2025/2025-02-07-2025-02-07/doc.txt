( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) May I make an announcement. We have had a very unfortunate situation here. I would like to remind the Hon. Members of both sides of the House, whichever party they may belong to, the Government or the Opposition, that the masses wanted a change; they wanted a change in the culture of Parliament. Shall we all provide what the masses wanted? There is a mandate that the masses have given us. So, let us live up to it. I think we all should resolve to live up to that and provide a different environment in this Parliament. Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Deputy Speaker,

: , : : : : ; , : , , : : : Sir, Operative Paragraph 8 of the Geneva Resolution against Sri Lanka adopted by the Human Rights Council on the 23rd of March, 2021 states this, I quote:

"Expresses further concern that the response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had an impact on freedom of religion or belief and exacerbated the prevailing marginalization of and discrimination against the Muslim community, and that cremations for those deceased from COVID-19 have prevented Muslims and members of other religions from practising their own burial religious rites, and has disproportionately affected religious minorities and exacerbated distress and tensions;"

Hon. Minister, another matter arising from this situation was the other unscientific decision taken to bury COVID-19 victims in a faraway place in Oddamavadi. :,

Geneva Resolution Operative Paragraph 9 Human Rights Council

"Calls upon the Government of Sri Lanka to ensure the prompt, thorough and impartial investigation and, if warranted, prosecution of all alleged crimes relating to human rights violations ...."

So, the Resolution is calling upon the Government to have an inquiry and punish the people concerned.

But, what does this Government do? It appoints the then Director General of Health Services as the Secretary of the current Ministry of Health and Dr. Hasitha Tissera, who had also been part of that Expert Committee and was also responsible for the decisions, as Acting Chief Epidemiologist. No inquiry has been conducted, whereas the Human Rights Council has specifically asked the Government to conduct inquiries and punish these individuals for having violated the human rights of the

1629 1630

2025 09

religious minorities. So, will the Government take action against those individuals who were responsible for taking these unscientific decisions, religiously profiling a communitys conduct and denying them their religious freedom in such a fashion?

) ) ( () - ) (The Hon. Major General (Rtd.) Aruna Jayasekera - Deputy Minister of Defence) Hon. Member, your Supplementary Question is very clear. Your comments and inputs have been taken. Let me buy some time and refer this matter to the consultative authorities and then come back to you in due course.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Sir, my second Supplementary Question is this. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, could you please make it brief because we have the Private Members' Motions to be taken up? And, we are already running short of time. Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Yes, Hon. Deputy Speaker, I will be very brief.

This particular incident cannot be just brushed aside. I know that you all, including the Hon. Leader of the House, sometimes get annoyed when I raise these questions repeatedly over an issue like this. But, this is a matter that has gained international attention regarding human rights in this country. A particular religious community has been affected seriously, not only the Muslims but also the Catholics who believe in burial. This burial decision had also been taken in an unscientific manner, wasting public funds and taking burials to a faraway place. And also, the Government at that time wanted to take the bodies to the Maldives!

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, could you please come to the second Supplementary Question?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Also, Sir, the then President contacted the President of the Maldives wanting to send our "Janazahs" to the Maldives for burial! Such stupid decisions were made by the then administration and some stupid officials, who are now holding responsible positions in Government, have gone unpunished. At least, an administrative inquiry has to be conducted against them. That is what we are asking for and will the Government take action in that regard?

) ( () ) (The Hon. Major General (Rtd.) Aruna Jayasekera) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I have to say the same thing again: I will consult the Hon. Minister and the other responsible authorities and come back to you in due course because this question is very sensitive in nature, as you understand and you all are aware. I will certainly come back to you. Thank you.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker.

Sir, I do not normally speak out of turn. But, since the Hon. Prime Minister is present here, I wish to seek a clarification and an answer, if possible, with regard to something that is of significant public concern. Hon. Prime Minister, I am pretty sure that you are aware that Mr. Lasantha Wickrematunge's daughter has written a letter to you. I have a copy of that letter and it is quite a damning letter. It calls for the Impeachment of the Attorney-General for gross abuse of power and gross neglect of duty. It is a four-page letter and the matters she raises in it are actually quite shocking. I think your Government has repeatedly come on record saying that the Attorney-Generals Department is an independent institution and that there should be no interference with regard to decisions being made by it. But here, when a victims family is actually casting aspersions on the very Head of that institution, with regard to that individuals conduct, I think it is a very important instance where the Government must in some way intervene. Since this letter is addressed to you and also copied to the Minister of Justice and National Integration, I wish to find out whether the Hon. Prime Minister has something in mind with regard to this matter. Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Prime Minister, if you want to respond to that, you can.

) ( () () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker.

Yes, Hon. Member, I have received the letter and I am planning to respond to that letter, to Ms. Wickrematunge, personally since she has sent it to me.

Our Governments position on this case is very clear. We intend to seek justice for the murder of Lasantha Wickrematunge. That has been our position in the past and that continues to be our position currently as well. I well understand Ahimsas concerns and the agony she must be feeling right now. But, I want to assure her that we will do everything in our power to make sure that justice is delivered on this matter. As you know, we are doing our very best to follow due process to give the Attorney-Generals Department that independence. But, justice has to be served. That is also the responsibility of our Government, to ensure that justice is served.

We have had extensive discussions. The President met with those involved with the investigations to try and see what could be done. If necessary, we will initiate new inquiries and take every step possible to gather new evidence, if the question is about lack of evidence. But, this is a case which has plenty of evidence. There have been many people involved with the inquiries, who have worked hard on this case. If necessary, we will file a new case. We will do everything we can to make sure that this case receives justice and that Ahimsas concerns are addressed. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Deputy Speaker, may I intervene?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I have just one more matter. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) First, shall we finish with the Hon. Ponnambalam's matter?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Prime Minister, your comments today are quite reassuring. You know that the Wickrematunge family have been very uncompromising with regard to their pursuit of justice. But, at the same time, they have been extremely measured with their public statements with regard to the investigations into Mr. Lasantha

1637 1638

( )

2025 09

Wickrematunges death. His daughter's coming on record requesting for an Impeachment of the Attroney-General, you would agree, is quite a significant request and I think the response from the Government must be equally significant because this is an emblematic case. And the second point is, Mr. Wickrematunge is iconic. You know that a very few journalists would demand and command the amount of respect that he did across the Floor of this House and even across the ethnic lines.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Ponnambalam, could you keep that very brief? We have to manage the time.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) So, I think it is extremely encouraging what you said, Hon. Prime Minister, and I sincerely hope that you would take those steps very urgently.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Deputy Speaker, before the Prime Minister answers, let me intervene.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Rauff Hakeem., could you be very brief bcause we have to move on to the Private Members' Motions.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) I will be brief, Sir.

Hon. Prime Minister, thank you very much for your response; we are being reassured in some way. But, yet, when I see the newspapers, the response by the Attorney-Generals Department, as it has been reported, relates to a very puerile argument relating to a lapse in the identification parade of the suspects and that that prompted the proceeding with the nolle prosequi, withdrawing of indictment or charge sheet against the so-called suspects. It is a very, very funny thing.

Your own Government, in your Manifesto and in your election propaganda, made it very clear that you would establish an independent Prosecutors Office instead of the Attorney-General handling these matters directly. Therefore, with this new matter coming up, we feel that the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney-Generals Department is being used willy-nilly to free selected people for other political purposes and other extraneous reasons. I am sorry to say that. Our Attorney-Generals Department has very high-ranking, good and very conscientious officers. It is being hampered by a serious lack of personnel and you have to recruit more officers. Those issues are there, but this type of lapse regarding a high-profile case of this nature is a very serious matter. Therefore, on behalf of the Opposition, I now

give notice, provided that the Committee on Parliamentary Business - we are not a part of that Committee - agree, that we want a full-day debate on this particular issue so that this matter should be fully thrashed out and it should never recur. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Okay, Hon. Rauf Hakeem, I think you have made yourself clear.

( ) (The Hon. Kaveenthiran Kodeeswaran) . . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Kodeeswaran, I will give you one minute so that the Prime Minister can clarify. I am sure what you have to say is also something on this.

( ) (The Hon. Kaveenthiran Kodeeswaran) , 22 . Hon. Deputy Minister P. Ruwan Senarath . , . , .

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) The Hon. Prime Minister.

) ( () () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya) Hon. Deputy Speaker, once again, let me reiterate the fact that we are determined to see that justice is meted out to this family. In fact, Hon. Member, I felt that the letter Ms. Ahimsa Wickrematunge had sent to me was also extremely measured given the circumstances and what this family has had to endure for the past, I do not know how many years. So, we are very determined because at the end of the day, the purpose of having a judicial system, the Attorney-Generals office, all of these institutions is to deliver justice and if procedures come in the way of delivering justice, then we need to re-examine those procedures. We have taken several actions and are expecting the Attorney-General to take some action today as well. This is something we are closely monitoring. As I said, we are definitely looking into whether we can initiate fresh indictments on this case; we will do

1639 1640

everything within our power. Also, let us not forget that the Attorney-Generals Department and related institutions, even though there are good officers with good intentions, have got used to a particular way of working, have worked within a particular culture. That also needs to change. That takes time, but taking time does not mean that victims can wait forever for answers. So, this is something that is very sensitive, of which we are very aware, and we will do what we can. Hon. Member, we are ready to allocate a full day to debate on this issue because we also agree that this is extremely important.

I am just trying to say that the procedure in doing any sort of development in the plantations is extremely complicated. If I, as the subject Minister, want to do anything in the plantations, I need to first request the manager of that plantation. After requesting the manager, I need to go to the PMMD. After the approval of the PMMD, I need the approval of the Ministry of Finance. After their approval, I need to go back to the manager. Then, I need to get the GAs approval and by the time I complete all of this, an entire year goes by, which is why I am telling the Hon. Minister that more than talking about allocating money for these roads or about issues with regard to those roads, you need to address the root of the problem, the procedure itself.

I would just like to end by saying that as far as I am concerned, with this current situation, the people of Indian origin living in this country are not citizens of Sri Lanka, but citizens of the plantation companies because, today, for everything based on their livelihood, they need to get permission from the plantation company. It does not happen anywhere else. Government workers do not get permission from the employers with regard to their livelihood matters. Why is the rule different for us?

ABOLISHING THE PENSION SCHEME OF THE MEMBERS OF

PARLIAMENT OF SRI LANKA

[3.59 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Presiding Member, I move,

That this Parliament resolves that the Pension Scheme of the Members of Parliament of Sri Lanka should be abolished with immediate effect as it is very apparent that Sri Lankan voters are very hostile for Parliament Members to receive pensions after the completion of their term of office.

Sir, today, I stand up in Parliament to propose and discuss a matter that has been a source of great discontent and frustration among the people - the pension awarded to the Members of Parliament. The pension currently granted to the Members of Parliament is seen by many as an undue privilege granted often to those who had served in Parliament for a brief period; it is seen as deeply unjust, unfair and unreasonable from the peoples perspective. Therefore, it is time to align the benefits enjoyed by the elected Representatives with those of the citizens they serve. We must recognize that public service is a noble calling and one that should be driven by the desire to serve the people and not for personal gain. The pension awarded to the MPs has created the perception that political office is a pathway to personal enrichment rather than a platform for public service. This perception erodes the trust between the electorate and their Representatives. That trust is fundamental to the functioning of democracy. Let us work together to create a political culture where integrity and selflessness are valued above all; let us ensure that our elected Representatives are motivated by a genuine desire to improve the lives of their fellow citizens. Our pension could be better spent on essential services such as healthcare, education and infrastructure, which directly benefit the people of Sri Lanka.

Therefore, Sir, I propose the abolition of the pension scheme for the Members of Parliament. That is for eradication of inequity and as a move of fairness and justice. It is a step towards restoring the faith of the people in Parliamentarians and ensuring that the elected public office remains a commitment to serve the people and not to be served.

: : , , , , :, : : , : : ; if you pay peanuts, you get monkeys.

, let us invest in bringing professionals into Parliament. That is why I am proposing this and I also invite Parliament to give thought to ensuring that we bring in true professionals to Parliament.

Then, in order to ensure that professionals retain here, they should be duly paid in the correct manner without just looking at restricting and reducing one aspect of it only. 227: : , : Salary, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament Act of 1954 , , , : : , : :, : , ,

Hon. Prime Minister, now that you are there eagerly listening to me, I would like to say that we must invest for tomorrow. Let us ensure that the younger generation also join in and become part and parcel of this nation-building exercise. We, coming from a professional background as well as from a business environment, may be able to withstand its strain, but, certainly, it is not an easy life. And, I speak on behalf of the many who have been elected to Parliament this time, whose salaries go to a public fund and who is being paid by the party from it. I looked at it and I call upon you all to consider this. Now, you all are basically looking at restraining your expenditure. Even when the President goes to Jaffna - my belief is that the President represents the entire country - why should he waste six hours being on the road when he can go by helicopter? That is what the modern world does. Even to the Hon. Prime Minister, I suggest that. You hold the position of Prime Minister; you are not just Harini Amarasuriya anymore. So, why do you not use that? That is not a loss to the country. The money that you lose by wasting six hours being on the road is a loss to the country. So, I propose that from the Opposition because these are not extravagant expenditure. That is the way to develop countries. I mean, if you are in America and if you want to go from one state to another by road, it will take two to three days. So, use the technology.

Likewise, I say, relook at this pension. I am proposing this owing to the fact that there was such a lot of hysteria and negativity expressed against MPs getting a pension. I want to resurrect the confidence, the command and the respect that people had had for Parliament.

Sir, I would wind up, inviting the Hon. M. Nizam Kariapper to second my Motion.

I rise, Hon. Presiding Member, to second this Motion and let me raise one point. I believe the Hon. Karunanayake is proposing to do it prospectively and not retrospectively. If it is done prospectively, some of us and most of you on the Government side, the newcomers, would be the victims and not the past Members. But, be that as it may.

I appreciate what you said, Hon. Prime Minister. I guess taking that first step is the step in the right direction. I have extended my support. So, let us walk together and ensure that we achieve it. I do not think it takes generations to get that change made. If you have the commitment, I guess we can get to the Singapore model. When Lee Kuan Yew came to Sri Lanka, he looked at Sri Lanka as a role model, went back and said, This is what I thought Singapore would be in future. But, later on he said, I do not want to take my country through what Sri Lanka has gone through. So, let us change the model; let Singapore follow us before too long. We extend our support and let us work towards fiscal discipline and, more or less, a proper system. So, instead of blaming the past, let us work together towards the unborn future. Again, I appreciate the support you extended. Let us ensure that we build a new future from this moment itself.

APPOINTING A SELECT COMMITTEE OF PARLIAMENT TO

INVESTIGATE AND MAKE APPROPRIATE

RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE CREMATION, INSTEAD OF BURIAL, OF THE

BODIES OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC VICTIMS [ 4 7]

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) ,

"8. Expresses further concern that the response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had an impact on freedom of religion or belief and exacerbated the prevailing marginalization of and discrimination against the Muslim community, and that cremations for those deceased from COVID-19 have prevented Muslims and members of other religions from practising their own burial religious rites, and has disproportionately affected religious minorities and exacerbated distress and tensions;

9. Calls upon the Government of Sri Lanka to ensure the prompt, thorough and impartial investigation and, if warranted, prosecution of all alleged crimes relating to human rights violations..."

Then the Resolution dated 06th October, 2022 adopted by the Human Rights Council states, I quote:

"11. Also urges the Government of Sri Lanka to take measures to address the marginalization of and discrimination against persons from the Muslim community, and to ensure that Muslims and members of other religions are able to continue to practise their own religious rites, including burial rites;

12. Calls upon the Government of Sri Lanka to ensure the prompt, thorough and impartial investigation and, if warranted, prosecution of all alleged crimes relating to human rights violations ... with the full participation of victims and their representatives;"

With this in mind, I have posed a few questions earlier to the Hon. Minister of Health regarding some details I sought.

Be that as it may, may I now go on to point out how many directives and manuals of internationally-recognized institutions had been violated by the Sri Lankan Government at that time. I want to list these documents which are internationally-accepted manuals relating to COVID-19 deaths. Number one is, "Infection, Prevention and Control for the safe management of a dead body in the context of COVID-19: World Health Organization: 24th March, 2020". This interim guidance still stands and has not been revised.

Number two is, Interim Guidance on water, sanitation, hygiene and waste management for the COVID-19 virus dated 19th March, 2020 issued by the WHO and the UNICEF. This Interim Guidance still stands and has not been revised. Number three is, "Statement on COVID 19: Ethical Considerations from a Global Perspective", Statement of the UNESCO International Bioethics Committee and the UNESCO World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology dated 26th March, 2020. This Guidance Statement still stands and has not been revised. Number four is, Recommended Measures for the Safe Burial of Bodies of Deceased Persons with COVID-19- Professional Working Group for the safe burial of bodies of deceased persons with COVID-19 in Sri Lanka. It details the hydrogeological factors in Sri Lanka in relation to disposal of COVID dead and was prepared by a group of Sri Lankan hydrogeologists and environmental engineers who

provide details of safe options for burial in Sri Lanka. Number five is, International Committee of the Red Cross: General Guidance for the management of the dead related to COVID -19 dated 31st March, 2020. This Interim Guidance still stands and has not been revised. Number six is, practical considerations and recommendations for religious leaders and faith-based communities in the context of COVID-19. That Interim Guidance dated 7th April, 2020 was issued by the WHO and has also not been revised.

Sir, the decision taken by the so-called Expert Committee in this country is contrary to all these guidelines which have already been practised in 192 other countries. We are the only country which followed a practice other than what has been directed by these guidelines. So, that is why I am proposing a Select Committee be appointed so that we will be able to go into the facts, as to what led this particular Committee to come to this horrendous decision totally against all the medical ethics.

Then, Sir, I would like to quote from the famous medical journal The Lancet, which talks in its Editorial about "Advancing racial and ethnic equity in health".

Racism is a public health emergency of global concern.

" an acknowledgment of racism and its harms - hatred, intolerance, and discrimination kill. These issues are as pervasive in medicine, medical science, and global health as in society. Today, The Lancet publishes a special issue bringing together the strongest evidence and analysis on advancing racial and ethnic equity in science, medicine, and health

Finally, they say, I quote:

"Racism is not only about the health of particular persecuted or excluded groups - it inflicts a collective trauma on us all. The positive corollary of this fact is that lessening inequities and restoring justice can bring healing to society as a whole."

Since this sort of thing has happened, in order to set the record straight, to expose the culprits who, currently in this administration too, are enjoying responsible positions including the Secretary to the Ministry positions and other important positions and as to why they came to this decision, not a single inquiry has been conducted. So, having flouted all the internationally accepted norms, they have gone on enjoying all the perks of office without any reprimand and disciplinary action. Therefore, a Select Committee must be appointed to look into the facts relating why this decision was reached. Just an apology by the Government alone would not do, Mr. Presiding Member. Therefore, we are urging this House to appoint a Select Committee to go into the evidence and to find out who was responsible for that decision and then, that will address the concerns expressed by the United Nations Human Rights Council as well. Thank you.
