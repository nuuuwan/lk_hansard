The Department of Census and Statistics also mentioned that even though there are inclusion and exclusion errors, those numbers provided may not be credible depending on the sample sizes they have selected, the relevance of the sample to the matter under consideration et cetera. So, I would like to put that as well on record.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) The next Question is to be asked by the Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I ask the following Question from the Hon. Prime Minister:

Hon. Prime Minister, 16 years after the war ended, Sri Lanka has yet to address the root causes of conflict. Further, no genuine efforts have yet been made at seeking truth and justice, with the long list of Commissions of

199 200

[ ]

2025 0 09

Inquiry and other State entities failing to address impunity. These and other factors demonstrate the multiple challenges with regard to reconciliation in Sri Lanka.

01. What is the Government doing to address emblematic cases including massacres that occurred in my district and other areas?

02. What is the Governments stance on justice for enforced disappearances?

03. When does the Government plan to release political prisoners?

04. Why is the Government using the Prevention of Terrorism Act, the PTA? Will it be repealed?

05. Will the Government end land grabs by State actors and others?

06. What is the timeline for a new Constitution?

Thank you.

() : : ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harini Amarasuriya) Hon. Deputy Speaker,

1. We are well aware that this country has a history of violence and that atrocities had been committed by all parties who were part of that violence and who were responsible for that violence, the war and conflicts. Any specific complaints that our Government has received will be investigated. If the Hon. Member wishes to submit details of any particular emblematic cases he has in mind, we can furnish more specific details.

Sir, as you know and as the Hon. Member himself mentioned, 16 years had passed since the war ended. Many governments had been in power subsequent to that. Some tried to cover up some of the atrocities that were committed and some others actually came into power on the promise of investigating those. So, we are in a difficult situation of having to investigate cases that had been committed 16 years ago. As you know, then the investigations are complex, complicated and finding evidence is also complicated. However, we are looking at all available evidence and at ways of gathering more evidence. Currently, our Government is pursuing investigations into certain emblematic cases including the Easter Sunday attack and attacks that had been carried out against certain media personnel.

2. As stated in our Manifesto, we agree that families of the disappeared need answers, and we are in the process of strengthening mechanisms such as the Office on Missing Persons, providing them with adequate resources to enable to carry out its mandate effectively. As mentioned in page 230 of our Manifesto, we will investigate enforced disappearances that had taken place throughout the country.

Sir, many of our MPs presently in Parliament themselves are well aware of what it means to

have enforced disappearances taking place among their comrades and family members. So, that is something very sensitive to us and which we are very aware of and we have every intention of ensuring that answers are provided to the family members of victims.

But, we intend to do it according to the due process, which is why we are in the process of strengthening the mechanisms necessary to do so.

3. We acknowledge that there had been abuse of power in the past, leading to wrongful charges and even convictions against people who had held different political views to that of those in power. We do not intend to go down that path ever. If the Hon. Member could provide case numbers or any other specific details of people currently being held for their political beliefs, we will provide information regarding their current status and plans for their release.

4. We stand by our commitment to repeal the PTA - the Prevention of Terrorism Act. The Cabinet has already approved the Cabinet Paper submitted by the Ministry of Justice to appoint a committee to provide recommendations for the repeal of the PTA. Given the urgency of this issue, we have instructed the committee to proceed fast and provide a white paper as soon as possible for wider consultations on repealing the PTA as well as on new legislation for ensuring national security. In the meantime, when dealing with national security, we have no option, but to act within the existing laws. Moreover, I would like to add that there are some political parties which had been part of all governments in power specifically between 2015 and 2020, which frequently abused the Prevention of Terrorism Act when they were in power and that when they were supportive of such regimes, they did not raise these issues. However, we take this quite seriously. And, it is also in our Manifesto and once again let me repeat that we stand by what is in our Manifesto.

5. Once again, we acknowledge that in the past, there were politically motivated land grabs. As stated in page 231 of our Manifesto, we will not allocate or distribute land with the intention of altering the ethnic composition in particular areas. We also acknowledge that past governments had actually started releasing land held by the military. We are also in the process of identifying the remaining land that are with the military and which could be released. I am tabling* more detailed information about the land that have been currently identified for release by our Government.

6. Given the state of the country when our Government took office, we had two urgent priorities: stabilizing the economy and ensuring democracy, particularly in relation to elections that had been postponed or not held for several

201 202

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

years. So, those are our two urgent priorities. We are in the process of stabilizing the economy and are also in the process of establishing democracy. As you know, two elections had already been held within a period of six months and we are going into a third election in the coming month. There is another election to be held and that is the Provincial Council Election, which has been pending for several years. Once those are completed, we intend to fulfil our promise in the Manifesto and start working on the new Constitution. We do not think that it would require a lot of time since a lot of work has already been done with regard to what needs to go into a new Constitution and public consultations as well had been held with regard to constitutional reforms. So, we do not intend to reinvent the wheel, but move forward from the work that had already been done in Parliament. Therefore, our intention is to do this right, properly and consultatively so that all views could be considered when we finally present a new Constitution to the country.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Shanakiyan Rasamanickam, if you have any Supplementary Questions, you may ask now.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank my good Friend, the Hon. Prime Minister, for answering the Question even though I am not quite satisfied with some of the answers. However, I would like to thank her for answering it without acting like some

203 204

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Sir, I have asked my first Question. () : : ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harini Amarasuriya) Hon. Deputy Speaker, we cannot be held responsible for 16 years of inaction. We have only been in power for six months. Within our term, we have to build mechanisms and processes to strengthen the institutions that could carry out these investigations and inquiries and deliver justice. That is our task. We cannot personally conduct these inquiries. What is important is, as a country, we are able to address such cases, and not doing it had been the problem in the past. The institutional failure or systemic failure is what led to these issues in the first place. So, without just reacting, we need to address that, actually setting in place the institutions and the environment to ensure that these things do not happen again and also that the existing injustices are investigated and inquired into. That is precisely what we are doing. The legislation that had been passed yesterday is part of that process.

Why people do not trust the Office for Reparations and the Office on Missing Persons is precisely because of the failures in the past, where these institutions were set up in name only, but were not sufficiently strengthened. That is what happened in the past and that is what we are trying to correct, ensuring that the right people are appointed to these institutions and resources are adequately allocated to them so that they could carry out their tasks. If these institutions are insufficient, we are prepared to broaden their mandate and also put in place new mechanisms. That, we will do, but it has to be a process. We have to make sure that these institutions are sustainable, which is exactly what we are doing.

Why I ask for specific information is because, yes, there are many such cases like those that the Hon. Member himself noted. There are certain cases we are already proceeding with. If there are any particular cases that the Hon. Member is interested in, we will look into those as well and provide whatever information we have. As I mentioned in my Answer also, Sir, these are cases that have been pending for the last 16 years. It is not easy to investigate those, but we are committed to ensuring justice.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Rasamanickam, you have one more Supplementary Question to raise.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Yes, thank you, Sir.

Hon. Prime Minister, my issue is that actual funds have not been allocated to the Office on Missing Persons and the Office for Reparations. You have got the mandate from the people. As the Prime Minister, you must take charge of this Government. Do not let jokers run this Parliament.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, your question is clear.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) I am winding up, Sir.

, -

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Yes, please. Could you stick to your original second Question?

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I want to finish up my Question.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) You have already posed your second Question.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) -

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Your second Question is clear. The Hon. Prime Minister can answer that.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I have not finished the Question.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) You said that that was your second Question. You posed the Question saying, "This is my second Question."

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Let me finish up my second Question. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) But, you have already posed your Question stating, "This is my second Question."

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) I only started asking the second Question, Sir. The opportunity to ask two Questions from the Prime Minister has been given to the Members of the Opposition.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) You posed your second Question saying that it is the responsibility of the Prime Minister to provide the list of missing persons. So, you have already posed that and she can answer it now.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Let me wind up my Question, Sir. Do not be unfair. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) By the way, I am not being unfair, Hon. Member; I am being very fair by everybody in this House.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Let me finish up my Question. I will finish it up in 30 seconds.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Okay, Hon. Member.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Thank you. Hon. Deputy Speaker, the Opposition Members get this opportunity to ask Questions from the Prime Minister only once in a month, on Wednesday of the first week of the month. There are 60 odd Members in

207 208

[ ]

2025 0 09

the Opposition. If I get this opportunity today, I may not get it for the entirety of the term of this Parliament. So, let me finish up, Sir. Give me a minute.

, . , . , ! . , ? .

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) The Hon. Prime Minister.

() : : ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harini Amarasuriya) Hon. Deputy Speaker, as I already mentioned in my response, we will bring in a new Constitution. But, I also said what our priorities are this year. We have to hold the Provincial Councils Elections as well, which has been pending for several years. It is only after that that we can begin the proceedings for a new Constitution. I have already said that. Of course, in this Budget, we have not allocated funds for such a thing because we still have to hold the Provincial Councils Elections as well. We see the urgency of this matter and we have every intention of bringing in a new constitution, but we also have a responsibility of deciding what our priorities are and ensuring a democratic environment. Ensuring that people are represented even in the current context is as important as a new Constitution because that opportunity has been deprived particularly to the people in the North and the East for several years; they have had no representation. So, I would imagine that that is also a priority.

Also, Sir, I regret the language and the tone with which my Hon. Colleague has been presenting some of these matters. I think we should be able to have a civil engagement here and I would respectfully request that aspersions are not cast and that this sort of hints are not dropped on various Hon. Members of our Government. That is not necessary. I do not think that is the way in which we should do this. With any unparliamentary language used by the Hon. Members, I think the Hon. Speaker has all the right in the world to deal, as you have dealt with, Sir. And, Sir, I request you to deal with the unparliamentary words expressed on this occasion as well and not allow this type of language to be used in Parliament. Thank you very much.

. . . . , high security prison -

To the Hon. Minister of Justice and National Integration, I have a request. A feasibilty study has been proposed by the Ministry of Justice and National Integration to have a high security prison on an island in Batticaloa. Currently, the prison is situated in the centre of the Batticaloa City. At the DCC, we opposed that proposal and expressed our opinion. The prison is situated in the central part of the City and the proposed site is a beautiful island which could be developed for tourism in the future. Therefore, we will definitely bring our request to your attention through the Chairman of the DCC. Your concern regarding this matter is very important. The prison is in the middle part of the City and it will create a lot of problems for our community in the future. So, please consider our request. All the Members of the DCC have also taken a decision to request the Government regarding this matter. So, please give a proper solution to that. Also, there is no need to use that island for high security purposes.

Only a superior system is to be implemented. So, do not take the risk until you would know that it is fully functional because the exporters are having major problems. The cost of capital is about 18 per cent. So, if you try to put this also in place, it would only be an additional burden. Ensure that you have a live transaction. If you have automatic dispensations, where you have the input and the output matched, then there would be no problem at all.

We all are saying this in good spirit. It is not that we are trying to say no to this. If that is the case, then we would be doing the same thing that you all did when we ran the economy, having protests every day holding placards. That is not the intention. Take what we, professionals, say in the correct spirit. It was mentioned here by the Hon. Minister (Dr.) Anil Jayantha also that if there is no satisfactory resolution, you all will resort to that. And, you also mentioned the same. Therefore, ensure that what we say is taken in good spirit and do not create any further problems for the people who bring in dollars to this country, the exporters. And in this problem of SVAT, please consider the deemed exporters also.

The Hon. (Dr.) Harshana Suriyapperuma suggested a final review before deciding rather than immediate approval. Hon. Chathuranga Abeysinghe was of the view that FTA should be reviewed further and inquired if stakeholders have been consulted in drafting and ratifying this Agreement. He further stated that, another point is that these decisions were made by the previous Cabinet and the new Government has sought the views of industrialists before proceeding. Once that is done, the process will move forward quickly." . FTA .

[6.33 p.m.]

. : ( . ) (The Hon. M. Nizam Kariapper, PC) Hon. Presiding Member, I rise today to express my support for the Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. Ajith P. Perera, which shows serious concern over a policy decision that threatens to derail our progress towards achieving sustainable energy in Sri Lanka.

According to reports, the Government has proposed a significant cut in the per unit payment for electricity generated by newly installed rooftop solar panels from the current rate of Rs. 27 per unit to Rs. 19, Rs. 17 and Rs. 15, depending on the system capacity. This abrupt adjustment is not only alarming, but unjust. Sir, this is not just a reduction, but a disincentive. It risks pushing solar power generation into reverse at a time when we need it. We declared our ambition boldly in September, 2020 to generate 70 per cent of our electricity from renewable energy by 2030.

Sir, if you look at the brief history, the effort to incorporate renewable energy into power generation in Sri Lanka goes back to several decades with growing focus on solar power, thereby reducing the dependence on imported fossil fuel such as coal and oil to generate electricity. Notably, rooftop solar energy tariff structures were introduced as early as 2005, laying foundation for subsequent incentives. To facilitate widespread use of rooftop solar panels, the Government introduced Net Metering, Net Accounting and Net Plus schemes, allowing consumers to feed surplus solar energy into the National Grid in return for electricity bill payment.

Sir, let me now speak from my personal experience. I personally opted for Net Metering. Why? Because I want to allow my neighbour also - I think that is the matter that the Hon. Member of Parliament from the Government also raised - to have his right to solar power. Simply because I have a little more money, I do not want to install a lot of solar panels and go for net accounting, trying to get money out of it and blocking the space for my neighbour to use solar energy. So, one thing I want to urge the Government is to have some regulation over access to solar power by individual households.

They cannot monopolize it because they have money. After all, solar power belongs to all and all should have equal access to it. Let us not allow anybody to monopolize it for themselves at the exclusion of their neighbours and also the poor neighbouring village.

Sir, rooftop solar holds great promise. With solar energy, grid stability remains a pressing concern. So, let us encourage net metering with special incentives. The Government seems to have no plans for solar power. They are a little worried; they are confused. Let me tell you, Sir, the Government will have to revisit their policy. A lot of things have been spoken about the battery storage for solar power. Let me warn you, battery storage for solar power is still a technological challenge in the world. So, do not fall for it.

Now, let me point out other options, which this Government may have had, but not looked into seriously. That is, to re-pump the dam water for hydropower during the daytime, as a way forward. Using a secondary dam would have many benefits. It would help flood-control, the water could be reused for irrigation and to keep the wetness in the region. . . . 0 0 pilot project . secondary dam dam secondary dam solar power re-pump . . . we will have a continuous supply of hydropower. Please try to invest in this new concept. Do not fall for this solar power battery storage. I am dead against it. The most important thing the Government has to take into consideration is to give an absolute, special incentive for net metering. I personally believe Net Accounting and Net Plus should be curtailed so that net metering could be made available to every single household throughout the Island with a special incentive. Then, there would be no issue for the Government and the grid because Net Metering would ensure that the solar power the households generate would be used mostly for their own purposes and they could release the surplus to the grid during daytime.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .

. : ( . ) (The Hon. M. Nizam Kariapper, PC) I will just take one more minute, Sir.

And, especially in congested towns where air conditioners are used during daytime, net metering should be encouraged because the moment Net Metering takes place in towns, solar power directly goes for their air-conditioning and therefore, unnecessary wastage of fossil fuel for power generation could be stopped.

Finally, Sir, let me thank the Hon. Ajith P. Perera for bringing this Motion. As the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake said, do not take this in the spirit that this is just a Motion brought by the Opposition and therefore, the Government need not do it. Do not look at it from that point of view, please. We are also serious about it; we personally experience it. So, let us make that incentive available for solar power generated by every single household as a motto, as a policy.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 24 .
