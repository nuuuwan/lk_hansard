[1.49 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees, I am happy to be associated with the Debate that is taking place on many facets. Let me start initially with one of the areas that have been discussed here - the impact of free trade agreements. I am extremely happy that the Government has realized the importance of market access and the concomitant that is there, with the persuasion of entering into Free Trade Agreements. As a result, the Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement that has been initiated a couple of years ago has been ratified and things are moving forward. Today, there is reduction in tariffs or tariff liberalization. Whether it is para-tariffs, Customs Import Duty or para-tariffs going into CESS or PAL, the requirement is to go forward with the pure intention of opening up market access for both sides.

Now, Madam, the most important aspect is that Sri Lanka is a country with a 22 million population, where the consumer demand is insufficient to be competitive. As a result, if you are able to go into markets which give you new market opportunities, there will be a competitive edge in manufacturing with the unit price being far lower than when manufacturing it only for the Sri Lankan market. So, I hope having the Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, like what happened in countries such as India and Pakistan, is the way forward for the Sri Lankan manufacturers to be more competitive and to take their products to the world market.

While doing that, we must also look at negotiating. While we open up to the other parties who have come forward with para-tariffs being taken off, we also must have access to their markets without any non-tariff barriers. One of the biggest problems that we have is, we go into other markets and export competitiveness for our produts could be there, but they bring in non-tariff barriers, which preclude us from going into those markets.

So, these are issues that government bureaucrats and the politicians who are spearheading these as Ministers must look at in taking these forward. Accessing Japan, China, the European Union, ASEAN, BRICS and Thailand, to my belief, is the only way we could give the competitive edge to our manufacturers, who are excellent and world-class. When we look at that particular matter, we must also look at one other most important aspect. That is, a competitive edge needs to be there. Today, we are fighting against one of the biggest problems we have, the delay in cargo clearance at the Port.

9 14 9 the Sri Lanka Standards Institution, which is a Government institution, had not attended to the work for seven days, Hon. Minister. I guess these are matters that need to be taken into consideration because you cannot allow willful destruction by any Government institution. This has been referred to by Mr. Arukgoda and citing an example, he noted that during the recent four-day long weekend, the Sri Lanka Standards Institution announced that they would not report to work due to unavoidable reasons, further slowing down operations. So, these are willful, destructive actions that are being taken, which are detrimental to the operation of import, export and entrept trading.

Not only that, we also must realize the fact that we have to get ourselves out of the debt crisis only through increasing our exports; 9 9 . 9 9 9 . 9 9 9 9 9. my considered opinion is that the only way is to ensure that the Port operates 24/7. The Sri Lanka Customs have to work for 24 hours and the entire Ports Authority is geared to work for 24 hours. Also ensure that we go forward with the ASYCUDA system, the single window system that is functional.

Another measure that could be adopted, Madam, is pre-clearance before the shipment arrives. Being in the manufacturing field, Hon. Minister, you are quite well aware of the industrial situation, where when a container leaves its port of origin, you can ensure that it is ready for pre-clearance and pre-clearance permits the cargo to be cleared as soon as it arrives at the port. Then, we can have a post-clearance audit going on. There was a reference made to pre-clearance and post-clearance audit, but those have been looked at with squint eyes. But, ensure that we look into those because, today, the consumers have to pay for demurrage also, which is in the range of Rs. 200,000 to Rs. 300,000 a container. Sometimes, that Rs. 200,000 to Rs. 300,000 a container is the profit margin of that company. So, at a time when it is a very difficult situation for our citizens, having gone through a very difficult time due to the country being forced into bankruptcy and now, when we are coming out of it, we must ensure that we make their lives easier. Therefore, we must ensure that we go forward with this. When there is competitiveness, paying demurrage can be eradicated. So, all these, the Government must take into consideration. At the end of the day, you must not allow every decision to be taken by government servants; political leadership needs to come in. So, this is the time that you have to take stock of the situation and ensure that we go forward. All I want you to do is to ensure that there is smooth operation of this system.

Madam, when we have 35 vessels turning away without coming to the Port, that means we are depriving raw material needed for exports. I said that we need to get ourselves out of bankruptcy through increased exports, that debt has to be paid through increased exports. Remember, every rupee that is devalued has an impact of Rs. 56 billion on the country. 9 9 9 56 - 5 600- 9 9 . 9 1 9 160 - 16 000 - 9 99. 9 9 9 .

9 a Notification under the Strategic Development Projects Act. I am a great believer that strategic development incentives must be given out. Even though many things have been told in the past - there has been a change in the administration now - if you do not incentivize the manufacturer, which investor would come into this country? That is why I believe it is time that the Government must take a call. The IMF can say many things. But, under strategic development projects, if you can ensure job creation, if it brings in foreign exchange and if it helps the economy of the country to keep running, then ensure that you give out those benefits. After all, the IMF can have their say, but the Government must have their way. That is the approach we need to take with regard to strategic development projects.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees) 9.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Madam, please give me just two minutes.

We were discussing the Eravur Project at the Committee on Public Finance and I am happy that the BOI has also changed their stand now; what they are doing now is a complete reversal of what they did before and I think that is a step in the correct direction. If you had the then Chairman of the BoI, Mr. Dhammika Perera, you would have had the company approved in one day. So, decisions need to be taken; that is what we have got to do. I know that Mr. Dinesh Weerakkody also tried to do the same, but resistance came in. So, I think we need to get this moving. We should not only look at the IRR, but the Economic Rate of Return, the Cost- Benefit Analysis and the economic return are also necessary for the development of this country.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees) 9 9 .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, ensure that you give out those incentives. All I could basically say is that we need to increase our exports and if not, we will fail and that is the only way we have got to come out of the debt crisis. Management and financial discipline is necessary, but the Governments willingness to take decisions is also absolutely essential.

Thank you.

FINDING SOLUTIONS FOR ROHINGYA REFUGEE ISSUE BY

ADHERING TO INTERNATIONAL LAW [3.49 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Presiding Member, I rise to move the following Adjournment Motion on a matter of urgent importance:

"The recent statement made by the Minister of Public Security, Hon. Ananda Wijepala suggesting the deportation of Rohingya refugees who arrived in Mullaitivu is a matter of deep concern. The Rohingya are one of the most persecuted minorities facing systemic violence and displacement in Myanmar. The principle of non-refoulement prohibits returning individuals to a country where they risk persecution or harm.

Article 8 of the UN Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance forbids deporting individuals to States where they face substantial risk.

The UNHCR plays a vital role in protecting asylum seekers even in countries like Sri Lanka, which are not signatories to the 1951 Refugee Convention. Sri Lanka must collaborate with UNHCR to ensure the safety and resettlement of these refugees. Deporting them to Myanmar would make Sri Lanka complicit in their persecution. This House resolves that the Government,

1. halt plans to deport Rohingya refugees and uphold non-

refoulement;

2. work with UNHCR to protect and provide for refugees;

3. arrange for their basic needs including healthcare and shelter;

4. consult international partners for resettlement options; and

5. adopt a humane approach to asylum seekers, reflecting compassion

and human rights."

Sir, as widely reported by the media, these refugees and asylum seekers were found adrift on a fishing trawler in Sri Lankan waters and were rescued and brought to shore by the Sri Lanka Navy. Credit should be given to the naval forces who extended life-saving help to the

Rohingya refugees and asylum seekers in their most desperate moment. It is a commendable humanitarian gesture, especially compared to recent events involving hundreds of potential migrants and asylum seekers attempting to cross into Europe and other affluent countries. During their perilous journeys by boat, many died at sea or within the territorial waters of the countries they sought to enter, often being chased off by naval forces and coast guards. Such is the habitual behaviour of the civilized nations today, whereas our valiant Navy has done otherwise and the right thing. Let me, therefore, place on record my sincere appreciation along with that of my party for the tremendous rescue and relief mission undertaken by the Sri Lanka Navy. This is not the first time it happened. On three previous occasions when Rohingya refugees were found adrift in our territorial waters and in the high seas, our Navy intervened and brought them to safety, provided shelter and accommodation and then, handed them over to the UNHCR for them to find suitable places for the refugees to be sent as asylum seekers. The good story, however, ends there, Sir.

Now, the Foreign Ministry, the Defence Ministry and government leaders enter the scene. Instead of taking the exemplary story of a successful rescue and relief mission to its logical conclusion by showing compassion and care to the Rohingya refugees, the Foreign Ministry, the Defence Ministry and government leaders have rather turned that whole good deed on its head! We are aware that the Foreign Ministry has been foreign to many things that should have genuinely concerned the country, especially since the Gotabaya Presidency. Strikingly, the Ministry has now become not just foreign to, but far removed from the reality and facts that the foreign service of any other country would be quick to grasp and innovatively and meaningfully address.

The utterance of a single sentence by a Foreign Ministry spokesman undid the successful humanitarian mission of the Sri Lanka Navy, whereas it could have been creatively built upon to project the country as a responsible actor on the global stage. That was the image that any sensible Foreign Ministry would want to cultivate at a time when the countrys human rights record remains under international scrutiny. What a no-brainer it is to say that the matter was under consideration and that Rohingya individuals would be deported to Myanmar! Just imagine, deporting them to a country which the Rohingya refugees and asylum seekers have reportedly fled from, seeking safety for their lives! There is not even a modicum of understanding of what the customary international law principle of Non-refoulement is about, how it works in practise and what international protection, or for that matter, temporary protection means in a situation like this! So, such a horrendously ludicrous statement was made by the Foreign Ministry officials and repeated by the political leaders in charge of the Defence Ministry. And, that is why, Sir, we thought we will move this Motion.

Sir, may I say this in Sinhala. 9 9

We have seen this happen in the past, too. When you do not have a clear communication strategy or the intellectual courage to explain or reason out, you create narratives for short-term purposes. Then, the narratives you create go out of hand, and then another narrative is created to supplement or displace the original narrative. So, this goes on in circles, wasting your time and energy and in the process, wasting whatever political capital you have had as well, which could have put you in good stead, if you had been a little more thoughtful and forthcoming in the first instance. It is this cascade of invented narratives, mutually contradictory and often counterproductive, that has dented Sri Lankas image as a secure nation more than the induced spectacle of refugees and immigrants settling in Sri Lanka and capturing the Island one day! So, this is the spectacle that had been created and the kind of image that was built. That must be a fairy tale.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) 9 1 .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) I am winding up, Sir.

Inventing narratives to address specific situations is one thing, but attributing them directly to Sri Lankas intelligence agencies and exposing the agencies by such attribution is quite another. Think about the credibility of such an agency internationally, when the information attributed to it is found to be insubstantial or baseless by other agencies abroad. Why should one tend to compromise our own national security, however narrowly or broadly it is defined, by naming an intelligence agency in the manner it has been done? Sir, all this led to international and domestic outcry, entirely thanks to the Foreign Ministry and the Defence Ministry. It was avoidable criticism, but these Ministries, by their conduct, made what was avoidable come to an avalanche. The

Foreign Ministry, in particular, could have helped avert this situation, if it had given timely, sensible and diplomatically persuasive advice to the Government, the relevant Line Ministries and agencies. They should have taken note of that.

Sir, I am told that the Hon. Imran Maharoof has declined to participate in the Debate. Therefore, I will take his time, ten minutes, as well. I may not take all ten minutes, but will wind up before that.

Those refugees have come several times before, too. How that situation was handled maturely and diligently, amidst initial negative reactions, with the Foreign Ministry providing appropriate advice to the Defence Ministry and other agencies is a case in point. Where is that capacity, maturity and diplomatic prowess now? . 9 9 9 9. 9 9 9 9 9 9 9.

[4.53 p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Arun Hemachandra - Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Employment) Hon. Presiding Member, let me respond to the Adjournment Motion brought in by the Hon. Rauff Hakeem. First of all, I request the Hon. Rauff Hakeem to stay and listen, if possible, because you are the person who brought in this Motion. So, it would be better if you could stay here since I have certain points to emphasize. I do not know why you are leaving even before I start replying.

Sir, I wish to respond to the matters raised by the Hon. Rauff Hakeem in his Motion with regard to the recent arrivals from Myanmar by boat. At the outset, let me emphasize that all steps have been taken by the Government to ensure the safety and welfare of the arrivals by boat in keeping with its obligations under international humanitarian and customary international law.

As the Hon. Members of the House may be aware, a boat carrying 116 persons including crew members was detected by the Sri Lanka Navy off the north-eastern coast of Sri Lanka on 19th December, 2024. The said boat was escorted to safety by the Sri Lanka Navy and all those on board were provided with immediate humanitarian assistance. It should be noted that with the birth of a newborn, the number has now increased to 117. All facilities for the baby's delivery and aftercare were provided at the Mullaitivu Hospital. Currently, immigration investigations and health screenings are being carried out. Health screenings are vital to rule out the possible spread of communicable diseases such as leprosy, tuberculosis and malaria, which have been eradicated from Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the Ministry of Health is undertaking that task.

Of the group, 12 individuals including the crew were arrested and produced before the Trincomalee Magistrates Court on 23rd of December, 2024 and remanded for further investigations. Thereafter, by a subsequent Order by the Trincomalee Magistrate dated 07th of January, 2025, the said 12 persons were released from prison custody and are now being detained at the Immigration Detention Centre in Mullaitivu, pending investigations. Therefore, at present, following two court Orders by the Trincomalee Magistrate dated 23rd of December, 2024 and 07th of January, 2025, the entire group of boat arrivals are currently detained at the Immigration Detention Centre in Mullaitivu under the care of the Department of Immigration and Emigration with the assistance of the Sri Lanka Police.

Furthermore, as the boat is reported to have originated from Myanmar, the Government of Sri Lanka is in contact with the Embassy of Myanmar in Colombo with regard to assistance in establishing their nationality. This process will commence once the domestic investigations and health screenings are concluded.

The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka had requested access to the group and it was granted on the 09th of January, 2025. Additional requests for access are under review and it is envisaged that access will be considered once status is established.

It may be noted that Sri Lanka is not a party to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees or the 1967 Protocol. Nevertheless, Sri Lanka has continued to honour the principles contained therein, including the principle of non-refoulement. The Government continues to closely work with UNHCR, which has been present in Sri Lanka for 38 years since 1987.

According to the UNHCR, the registered number of refugees and asylum seekers in Sri Lanka as at November, 2024 are approximately 405, including 161 asylum seekers and 244 refugees. Of this group, 112 are Rohingya from Myanmar, who, as per current information, have very limited opportunities for third country resettlement. Of the 244 refugees that the UNHCR has submitted details about, 109 are for resettlement, 74 are awaiting a decision from the resettlement country and 14 are pending departure. It may also be noted that, globally, the third country resettlement option is only around 1 per cent. Furthermore, the UNHCR in Sri Lanka has also scaled down its operations to a liaison presence of one officer. I am highlighting that to bring to the attention of the Hon. Members of the House that options for third country resettlement for those recognized as refuges by the UNHCR in Sri Lanka is no longer possible, as per information shared by the UNHCR with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism, except for those currently under the resettlement process. At present, the arrivals by boat from Myanmar have been found to be in violation of the immigration laws of Sri Lanka and a case has been filed, with the next hearing date scheduled for 31st January, 2025.

Therefore, Sir, I wish to reiterate that securing Sri Lankas borders remains a top priority and illegal migrants will be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the Immigrants and Emigrants Act of Sri Lanka while maintaining a humanitarian approach to illegal migrants overall. So, ensuring national security is a key consideration.

[5.22 p.m.] () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Hon. Presiding Member, I am happy to speak a few words on the Adjournment Motion brought in by the Hon. Rauff Hakeem. This Adjournment Debate focuses on the situation of a group of Rohingya individuals who arrived in Sri Lanka by sea last month.

As widely reported in the media, these refugees were found adrift on a fishing vessel in Sri Lankan waters and were rescued by the Sri Lanka Navy. It is a commendable humanitarian gesture on the part of the Navy. Let me, therefore, appreciate the Sri Lanka Navy for the tremendous rescue and relief mission undertaken and the lifesaving help provided by them. The good story, however, ends there. Instead of taking this exemplary story to its logical conclusion by showing compassion and providing care to the Rohingya refugees and asylum seekers, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism, the Ministry of Defence and the government leaders have rather turned it on its head. Strikingly, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs now appears to have become far removed from the reality and facts.

The Ministry, in the immediate aftermath of the rescue and relief mission, went on to state that the Rohingya individuals should be deported to Myanmar. Just imagine, deporting them to a country which the Rohingya refugees have reportedly fled from, seeking safety for their lives! Sadly, there is no understanding of what the customary international law principle of non-refoulement is about and how it works in practise. The Defence Ministers assertion is even worse. He went on record saying that the Government was in consultation with Myanmar authorities with a view to deporting Rohingya persons to Myanmar. It was morally repugnant and legally indefensible to take such a stance. Sri Lanka is under an international law obligation to ensure non-refoulement. It is a customary international law principle which prevents returning, repatriating or deporting any refugee against his or her consent. I am making this point having served once as Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. To buttress what was indefensible, the Minister claimed that Sri Lankas intelligence agencies had reported that 100,000 illegal immigrants were planning to enter the country. This fearmongering comes from the absence of a clear communication strategy or the intellectual courage to explain or reason out developments as they happen. Consequently, the Government creates narratives for short-term purposes. When a narrative goes out of hand, another narrative is created in its place as a diversionary tactic. It is this cascade of invented narratives, mutually contradictory and often counterproductive, that has dented Sri Lankas image as a secure nation, more than the induced specter of refugees and immigrants settling in Sri Lanka and capturing the Island one day.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Order, please! 9 9 9 9 9 9 ?

( ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake) 9. 9 5.30 9 . 9 9 9 9. 9 9 9.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) 9 ?

( ) (Hon. Members) Aye. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Sir, all those comments have led to international and domestic outcries for several days now. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs could have helped avert this situation, if it had given timely, sensible and diplomatically persuasive advice to the Government and the relevant Line Ministries and agencies. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should have examined how maturely and diligently the situation was handled amidst initial negative reactions when Rohingya persons arrived in the country several years ago for the first time. Where is that capacity, maturity and diplomatic prowess now?

It has been quite a while since the UNHCR addressed a request to the Government of Sri Lanka, seeking access to the Rohingya refugees. As the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka has stated, Rohingya individuals have a right to access the UNHCR, which cannot be denied. It is deductible from the Commissions statement that the Rohingya refugees seeking to access the UNHCR or in other words, the UNHCR seeking to access Rohingya refugees is in keeping with Sri Lankas laws. It is true that Sri Lanka has not acceded to the International Convention relating to the status of refugees of 1951 and its Protocol of 1967. Still, there are international law principles which have a bearing on this matter and Sri Lanka cannot disregard them.

The first is the principle of non-refoulement, which means not returning, repatriating or deporting a person seeking international protection against State persecution without the persons consent. The second is the humanitarian principle extending safety adn providing essential needs including food, shelter and medical care.

1159 1160

2025 9 13

The UN Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance of 1992 clearly forbids, through Article 8, a refugee from being returned to a country where there are substantial grounds to believe that he or she would be in danger of enforced disappearances. Therefore, the Government should understand that it cannot deport these individuals to Myanmar against their consent. Instead, it should facilitate the UNHCR to fulfil its function as a neutral UN agency mandated to deal with refugee affairs. Therefore, Sir, safety, food, shelter, medical care and education are essential needs which should be provided without undue restrictions with the help of donors and as available.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 16 9.

9 9 . except for the Hon. Nizam Kariyapper, I think everybody else including the Member who moved this Adjournment Motion has left. It is okay. I am not going to be controversial. I think Comrade Bimal Rathnayake said everything he had to say. So, I will have nothing more to add. 9 . . But, it does not matter.

Anyway, we understand the problem, the Rohingya people and the crisis they face. We are not monsters; we are not ignorant people who do not understand what these people are going through. Rohingya people are a Stateless ethnic group predominantly following the Islam faith. In 2017, there was a massive crisis facing them of genocidal level and I believe that about 740,000 Rohingya people fled to Bangladesh. Their nationality had been denied by Myanmar by a law of 1992. Today, there are 2.6 million internally displaced Rohingya people in Myanmar itself. At the same time, 1.3 million of them are refugees in other countries; about 1 million are actually in Bangladesh. So, the bottom line is, are they facing a crisis? Of course, they are. It is a humanitarian crisis. Should they be treated that way? Of course, not. We fully understand that and support against any harm on the Rohingya people. So, firstly, we have accepted that they are victims; that is true.

We will work with the international community and make sure that they are looked
