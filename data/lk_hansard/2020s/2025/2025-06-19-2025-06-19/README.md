Be that as it may, on how to make Sectoral Oversight Committee more effective and how to make use of their recommendations, there are so many notes, researches, analyses and recommendations. That may be the reason why they wanted to discuss this particular Report.

Technically, I am still on my feet from 3.30 p.m. yesterday. You will be wondering what I am talking about. Sir, I do not want to make an issue out of it and I have so much of respect and regard to the Chair, especially to the Deputy Speaker. Yesterday, at 3.30 p.m., exactly two hours and 30 minutes after the Proceedings recommenced after lunch, I stood up and the Hon. Deputy Speaker recognized me. You mentioned my name and I was called upon to speak. So, I commenced my speech; in terms of the Standing Orders, I have been recognized by the Chair to make my speech. Then, there was a point Order raised by the Hon. Vijitha Herath. The point of Order was discussed continuously and the situation went out of control. Then, the Hon. Deputy Speaker stated that the situation was going out of control and without giving a ruling on that point of Order, Parliament was adjourned abruptly. Sir, I do not want to make an issue out of it and be that as it may. Now, I will continue with my speech since I do not want to waste time of this House discussing a matter that had already happened.

.

Then, I will move on to the other matter we are talking about.

. ( . ) (The Hon. M. Nizam Kariapper, PC) 40 . Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Nizam Kariapper, you just mentioned about economizing on time. I think you should proceed with your speech.

. ( . ) (The Hon. M. Nizam Kariapper, PC) Okay, I will proceed with my speech. The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake is very clever in distracting us. Anyway, I do not want to fall into his trap.

Coming back to the matter under discussion today, we are now talking about the economic impact that has come about due to malpractices; this is all about economic impact. But, there is another important matter directly connected to the Sri Lankan economy. I have to speak about it. I am referring to the conflict that may seem distant, but is rapidly becoming a global threat, the war on Iran led by Netanyahus Government of Israel. At the heart of this crisis lies the longstanding and heartbreaking situation in Gaza.

Sir, I would like to say a few words on the situation here. We call on this Government not to encourage Israeli tourists, as many of them are not really tourists, but appear to be planning long-term stays here, establishing their places of worships. Sir, by allowing that, we are inviting trouble. A number of times in this House, we in the Opposition continuously pointed out to the Government not to send our workers to Israel and not to encourage the purported Israeli tourists to come to Sri Lanka. Now, what has happened? We all are just worried now about the malpractices, the millions of rupees that had been wasted or abused, according to this Report. But, we are facing a more serious issue: we are on the verge of a world war! We must also recognize that Israel's unending attacks on Gaza, its illegal settlements and its refusal to follow international rules have caused and worsen this crisis, nothing else. The United States is the other culprit. By giving Israel full support, politically and militarily, it has allowed Israel to act without any fear or consequences. This shows a clear double standard on how international law is applied. Sir, this imbalance in global justice is what has made Gaza an issue, which concerns the entire world now. Failing to protect Palestines right has not only created more violence and extremists, but, now, it risks the causing of a larger war, one that could affect all of us, let alone this Motion that we keep on talking about. .

Our Foreign Ministry must show leadership in dealing with that issue, which they lack.

Leave alone leadership, but they are trying to raise unethical and wrong points of Order to block us from speaking. ,

2699 2700

[ . ]

2]25 19

; that is the predicament we are in. Our Minister of Foreign Affairs must speak for the fair two-State solution, which he never does. For an immediate ceasefire, he does not demand; about full humanitarian access to Gaza, he does not talk and supporting real peace talks by including all voices is not in his concern. He is only worried about moving away the 20,000 migrant workers who had been sent to Israel from the war. Sir, what I am trying to say is that at a time of such a serious conflict, we have allotted time from 11.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. for an Adjournment Debate on some irregularity that occurred and is reported in this so-called Report, which could have definitely been discussed at the Committee on Public Enterprises! Not only that, Sir, there is also a mechanism existent or available for this Report to be submitted to the relevant authorities, whether it be the FCID, the CID or the Attorney-General, for the them to take legal action. So, I was wondering what the legislative amendment that the Government was speaking about.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) The Hon. M. Nizam Kariapper, you have one more minute.

. ( . ) (The Hon. M. Nizam Kariapper, PC) One more minute!

So, what is the legislative amendment that they are talking about? Let us talk about the more important, eminent, economic challenges we are going to face very soon related to fuel prices and tourism, about having Israelis here, about the fear that that war might come to Sri Lanka as well and about how are we going to ensure that we stop that war from extending to this region. Those are the matters that we have to talk about now, and I am even sad to say that the Government is fighting shy of facing that Debate, that it is scared to talk about it. The Government is using absolutely false points of Order to block us from talking that so much so, I would like to finally say, Sir, that you, if you look at the video clips, you would see, had not even given a ruling on that Standing Order raised against my speaking on that day. So, I am supposed to be still on my feet since the Hon. Deputy Speaker had not made any ruling and abruptly adjourned the House. Therefore, let me say that that should be the first and the last occasion the Secretariat of Parliament should get involved in telling the Chair to adjourn on such an occasion; that is none of their business!

Thank you very much, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) The Hon. Susantha Kumara Nawarathna. You have 12 minutes.

, . . Secret voting is possible, but only if it is determined that the election shall be by secret voting. Who decides whether the voting is secret? That is the issue. The key part in the relevant legislation - the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 2012 - is Section 66D (8). It states, I quote:

"(8) Where it is determined under subsection (6) that the election of a Mayor shall be by secret voting, the election shall be by ballot papers."

Section 66D (6) states, I quote:

"the mode of election shall be by open voting"

Section 66D (8) contradicts this slightly by allowing secret voting, if it is determined to be so under Section 66D (6). Now, we will have to interpret the words "it is determined" in Section 66D (8). There, the question is whether the presiding officer has the discretion to do so. , , , . , , , ; . . . .

, Hon. Presiding Member, the IMF conditions include very important aspects regarding corruption vulnerabilities and the need to have a diagnosis regarding that issue. That diagnosis has given a lot of prescriptions for the Government to follow. So it is important. Therefore, let us look at these things without making it a political issue.

Then, there are much more bigger issues. What is this Government doing with regard to those? 1947 "-" , . . . , . - ? . I will read that statement. I would say that it is a very unprincipled, unwise and unimaginative statement that has been put out by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. What do they say - that is the only statement they had made - about the unprovoked attack by Israel on Iran? The Ministry of Foreign Affairs simply states, "We express deep concern on the recent developments between Israel and Iran." What nonsense is this? Just "deep concern on the recent developments"! What is the recent development? Is it an earthquake? Is it a tsunami? It is much worse; it is an unprovoked, deliberate attempt at bombarding another country, a friendly country of ours.

Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not have the backbone to name the perpetrators, to call a spade a spade. They are trying to please the western world, the imperial masters. This is a party which talks about their friendship with the downtrodden people, the Palestinian struggle. They identify themselves that way. I praise the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House for having come there on the Nakba Day. It is a very symbolic gesture by the Government to have sent such a high-powered delegation to be there. But, having done that, what does the Ministry of Foreign Affairs do? In an issue like this - all of us know what is happening there between Isreal and Iran - they do not denounce the attack, do not name the attacker or do not even mention the principles of the UN Charter, the international law or the principles of non-alignment. Everything is put aside and nothing is said in the statement. It is a very blank, sanitized version of a statement in order to please the imperial masters, the colonial masters whom we call the white supremacists who have now taken over. Everything is totally disregarded. No UN resolution applies to Israel; they can do whatever they please. They have such contempt for international law. So, that statement carries an unqualifying reference to both countries; it is simply referring to both countries. You all are equating the victim and the violator. This is what you are doing. You all cannot identify who is the victim and who is the violator. I raised this issue sometime back. Your slavish attitude towards the western masters is such that Iranian Embassy officials could not open a bank account in this country. What a shame! I do not know whether the matter has been resolved by now. I raised this a few months ago in this House, about the way in which you all have not been allowing them to open a bank account. International diplomatic protocol and conventions require you to make these facilities available to diplomatic officials in the country. And, only one countrys diplomats have been denied even the mere opening of a bank account. Such was the situation.

Recently when there was a conflict between two neighbouring countries, Sri Lanka fearlessly took the side of one country. In that case, you adopt one attitude, but when it comes to Israel, you are not even prepared to name the incident, you do not talk about what has really happened.

In fact, how does it impact on Sri Lanka? I will read out what the Director General of IAEA had stated on the day of the incident, when Israelis bombed Iran. He states, I quote:

Early this morning, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was informed of the military operation launched by Israel which includes attacks on nuclear facilities in the Islamic Republic of Iran.

That is a very serious matter. He further states, I quote:

All these developments are deeply concerning. I have repeatedly stated that nuclear facilities must never be attacked, regardless of the context or circumstances, as it could harm both people and the environment. Such attacks have serious implications for nuclear safety, security and safeguards, as well as regional and international peace and security.

That is the statement made by the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Iran has subscribed to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, but Israel has not. Why is nothing being done by that country?

If you look at the famous interview by Piers Morgan with famous journalist Mehdi Hasan, it clearly lays the background of this old conflict and the manner in which impunity is being exercised by the -

( ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake) Hon. Rauff Hakeem, he was the journalist who was involved with that Ferrari" crash.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Whether journalists have Ferraris or Lamborghinis, we do not care. The only thing you all are worried about is whether other politicians in this country have Lamborghinis and Ferraris.

( ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake) He made our Ferrari" to crash. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Ah, did you mean that? I do not know. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) So, I would rather expect the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be much more sensitive and to take more precautions before issuing a statement. Rather than issuing such a statement, which would become a laughing stock of the international community, it is better that they issue no statement at all.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , 12 .
