( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara, the other day, your matter of Privilege was referred to the Acting IGP for his opinion and he has written to the Secretary-General of Parliament, stating that your summons to make a statement was based on a statement you had made outside the House and not on something spoken inside the House. Therefore, I believe that matter of Privilege cannot be entertained and the Secretary-General of Parliament will write to you with regard to that.

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Deputy Speaker, please give me one minute. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Member.

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Deputy Speaker, if you read my whole Question of Privilege, you would see that I have raised some questions about all the other MPs as well. The Hon. (Dr.) Ramanathan Archchuna also has an issue because he had said something in Parliament and he had been summoned and questioned. This is wrong and they cannot do that. - - .

? . . ? . . . . . .

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara, I get your point. I think the Acting IGP has written to the Secretary-General of Parliament mentioning the issues of the other Hon. Members of Parliament as well. You will get a copy of it from the Secretary-General.

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara, Attorney-at-Law) So, what will happen to Hon. (Dr.) Ramanathan Archchuna?

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) His issue and the issues of the other Hon. Members are also mentioned in the letter.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramanathan Archchuna) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, shall we move on? I know that your point of Order relates to the same concern. The Secretary-General of Parliament will write to you with regard to your Privilege matter also.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramanathan Archchuna) Sir, please count the 10 seconds. Sir, you said that the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara had been summoned because he had said something outside Parliament. But, I have never spoken a single word outside Parliament. Where does this Parliament go? The Speaker has given a letter to me and nothing had been mentioned in that letter about the 323 containers. That statement was taken based on my speech in Parliament. This is a joke! Parliament has become a joke, Sir!

Madam, I would like to table* that letter in Parliament.

It is also important to ensure that there is accountability, which would lead to the trust of the Tamil youth to remain in this country to work. This letter carries the heading "The imperative of Truth-seeking, International Collaboration, and Justice in the Chemmani Mass Grave Investigation". I tabled this letter also for the perusal of the Government Members because we need to build trust in Tamil youth for them to stay in this country.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees) () . 3 .
