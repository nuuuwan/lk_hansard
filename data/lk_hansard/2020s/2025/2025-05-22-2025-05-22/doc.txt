, () . The Morning" .

It sates, I quote:

"Indian salt shipment arrives A shipment of salt imported from India was set to arrive in Sri Lanka yesterday (21) night, as part of efforts to address the current salt shortage in the country, the Minister of Trade, Commerce and Food Security Wasantha Samarasinghe said.

Samarasinghe confirmed that the consignment includes a total of 3,050 metric tonnes (MT) of salt. Of this, 250 MT have been imported by the private sector, while the remaining 2,800 MT were brought in by the State-run National Salt Company."

So, it is important, Hon. Deputy Speaker, that this shortage of salt is solved in the proper way. I feel that when a particular person in the private sector controls one sector, there is a conflict of interest. Therefore, we must make sure that there is proper regulation in place; there has to be a regulatory authority looking into it. In the past, we had price control on all items. We have moved away from that concept. But, the Governments fair trading principles must be properly monitored. So, that is why we have government institutions set up to look into it. But, unfortunately, with all that and having warned from last December onwards about an impending shortage of salt in the country, the Government was very slow in taking action and finally resulted in the salt mafia controlling the price of salt in the market. And, who is behind this salt mafia? Is the Trade Ministry aware of that? Are the Trade Ministrys officials knowingly assisting this mafia?

Particularly, when I see this news item, it is quite apparent that from Bombay a salt shipment had started and has arrived here already. But, it is only a small fraction that the private sector can import. A large fraction is imported by the State sector. We know that the State Trading (General) Corporation is used as a ploy, as a cover to cover up corruption. It had been done by past administrations also, in which we were also part of and we had been speaking up in the Cabinet. The relevant Ministers have to be careful. In Ministries like the Ministry of Trade and the Ministry of Finance, there are bureaucrats who are corrupt. That is another problem. Getting rid of corruption is not only on politicians. What about bureaucrats? Bureaucrats are also to be blamed; they, too, are involved in this type of action, which finally results in the poor general public having to suffer, paying a heavy price for a very simple item like salt.

Sir, I would also like to mention this.

() ( ) ( () - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harshana Suriyapperuma - Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning) , . . . .

Hon. Presiding Member, emphasizing the importance of this piece of legislation we are discussing today, I would like to say that the delivery of promises we gave to the people is important. One of them is to facilitate business, to make it easier to do business in Sri Lanka. Saying no to corruption and having necessary systems and processes in place, Sri Lanka would once again be recognized as a nation serious about addressing its chronic issues. One of them relates to making use of online facilities by the certification agencies.

But, before getting on to technical details, I would like to highlight a point made by an Hon. Member a short while ago, referring to conflicts of interest. It is important to recognize the requirement to disclose the conflicts of interest. But, Madam, apart from disclosure, it is more important to ensure your ethical conduct while you are on respective boards or government institutions. What was lacking in the past was mentioning their affiliations. But, when decisions were made, they were actively involved in those processes. They were passing information to outsiders who had business interest. We do not have to go far. At the Committee of Parliament inquiring into the Central Bank Bond scam, several Members seated there, while discussions were going on those sensitive matters, made phone calls and shared information with outsiders. Today, those very Members are trying to preach us about conflicts of interest. So, there is absolutely no substance in what those fake Members say with their understanding of conflicts of interest. They are trying to preach us about conflicts of interest, whereas they had breached the very essence or the fundamentals of it while taking part in those Parliamentary Committees. So, for the members of the public, it is important to recognize that; even though they are trying to portray a different conduct, their reputation in terms of doing wrong things is well known to the society.

As a nation, we need to rely on the members of the business community. There are several capable individuals in the business community who have contributed to the success of several businesses. As the Government, we are serious about getting the their input where necessary, considering their conduct, the past track record and particularly, their not engaging in wrong activities and corruption-related transactions. Then, we

1467 1468

2025 11

would also like to get business enterprises involved. From the discussions that the Government is having to take Sri Lanka forward to a better place, we cannot leave the business community out and go in a separate direction. No, we will work with the business community, get ideas from those individuals, experts of the business community out there, to take Sri Lanka to a better place. Therefore, we will work with the private sector business community to build this nation, which was ruined by those politicians and the corrupt culture they had built.

Madam, coming back to the subject matter, I would say that it is important to recognize the validity and efficiency these systems would bring about in the nation.

Madam, on the one hand, with these process improvements we are referring to, we could say no to corruption and minimize the opportunities and chances for corruption and on the other, would track and trace sources of revenue generation, which is a very important step as far as the country is concerned and the situation we are in, as of now.

Facilitation of businesses to continue their activities is very important. I will take one example to demonstrate that. We have not limited it only to talking, Madam, but have implemented some of these digitization initiatives. The agency related to todays Debate is the Comptroller General's Office. We have implemented a digitization process there, which requires no individual to go to the Comptroller General's Office to give an application. We implemented it early this year, in January or February, and upon inquiry into the success of the digitization process, the Chambers indicated to me that even though we have implemented digitization, people still have to walk into those counters. Early this week, I, in fact, went to the Comptroller General's Office to see whether it is true, whether people still have to come to the counters. There are five counters available at the office. Only one counter was operating and a few people were there at the counter. I went and spoke to a person at the counter, who was from the business community and had come to ge the support of the officers. I asked him, "Why did you have to come here today, when there are online services available?" Madam, he mentioned that he wanted to follow up on an application he had made. I, in fact, thought that the application had been pending for a long

time. I went there on a Monday morning. Then, I asked him, "When did you apply?" He said that he applied it on Friday and had come on Monday morning to check on its progress, which, in a way, is a good thing to have an efficient service delivered, even though there was no necessity with hardly a single working day passing from Friday to Monday. Then, I asked him, "Why did you come today? You made the application on Friday and you are here on Monday asking the officials about its progress." We never know why people come there; people may still be used to previous practices, which are not good practices, unfortunately. Then, that person explained the reason why he came. It was due to an emergency; they had ordered some spare parts related to aircraft engines, which they needed to get cleared urgently. That is why he had come in person. Then, I asked from the Department also, "Is there not a process to facilitate this type of outliers or exceptional situations, emergencies? So, they also explained to the person who had come there. That example is just to highlight what we have implemented so far. Within this six-month period, we hav been going ahead with the digital journey in this country. The business community is benefiting, as we speak, from this engagement. Otherwise, every day, they have to send people to those institutions, which is a cost to them and leads to bribery and corruption as well. That is one example. There are many other examples I can give, but for the time being, I will limit it to the Sri Lanka Standards Institution. There, out of seven processes, two with the highest number of traffic are already done online or digitally delivered. These are examples to show the deliveries of the present Government, what we have implemented facilitating and saving cost to the business community and making it easier to do business in Sri Lanka.

, , there is a new culture we are inculcating. People have voted in favour of that culture. It is an evolution from the manual-based transactions mentioned in the Gazette we are debating today. We are evolving into the digital space, but what is more important is that the Government is on a mission or a journey to deliver what we had promised to people who trusted this Government without knowing who we are.

What they trusted in is the expertise our Members had, the ingenuity in our approach and the governance approach we will implement in Sri Lanka. That is what we are implementing as the days pass by. Support is extended to large businesses, corporations operating here and to the SME sector as well. Our intention is to provide that support and help achieve the aspirations of the

1469 1470

businesses. Similarly, it is also our intention to ensure that the aspirations of the people, particularly of the parents, are achieved and delivered. Parents are worried that their children would not have a country to live in after they complete their education. This Government is delivering on those promises.

That is why it is important to discuss these important policies in this House. Madam, today, I was expecting that we would get some suggestions to amend the Regulations we have presented today. There have been discussions, but however, unfortunately, there were no valuable suggestions or recommendations made relating to the matter we are deliberating today. Some Hon. Members were discussing about salt. Madam, I cannot amend this legislation with salt; I need input relating to the Regulations under this legislation. They were saying that we are implementing the law without attending to previous corruptions. Recommendations are required for the Regulations brought under this piece of legislation we are deliberating today.

So, let us not make the excuse that resources are a constraint for us to deliver. Let us get it done together with your suggestions. You are able to contribute to these valued debates and discussions.

Similarly, the Government is also engaged in business through our State-owned enterprises. It is important for us to ensure that the governance framework of those businesses is improved. We have an accountable mechanism, that if the entities are not able to deliver the results, the people of the country have to finance those activities as well. Therefore, separate initiatives are underway, as we are discussing, to improve those arrangements, to revise those legislations and to implement them in a timely manner.

Similarly, when we bring in new legislations, it is not only the aspect of the Government that we consider, but we also have dialogues and discussions with the industry as well. Just to highlight an example, we wanted to repeal the SVAT given to businesses. It is also known that the Government has laid the road map even with dates being identified. The SVAT will be repealed with a suitable mechanism implemented, under which entities would be able to submit their documentation through an online platform, the Inland Revenue Department would be able to go through them and provide the applicable refund within the shortest possible time. In this discussion, we engaged with the industries, particularly with the garment segment, which is considered the most-affected. We have had multiple discussions with the industry so far to accommodate their suggestions. As of now, they have suggested to consider trading houses also in this equation. That shows the cooperation between the business community and the present Government. We are not making high-handed decisions; we are making decisions for the betterment of the country. It is Sri Lanka - the North, the South, the East and the West - that we are going to build together with the input and the support of the business community. Another example to demonstrate our engagement with the industry is the continuous discussions the the ceramic manufacturers had with the Government to explain the challenges they are going through.

I am extremely happy to announce to this House, Madam, that the National Tariff Policy the Hon. President mentioned in his Budget Speech is also going to be established.

This week, we are going to establish the National Tariff Policy Committee. Its inaugural session will be held this week. We invite the industries to coordinate with the channels that are available through the Ministry of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development, to take part in those discussions and to submit their suggestions, proposals and challenges they have. So, we have a mechanism in place in the country. For the first time in the history of Sri Lanka, instead of politicians deciding on what should be the tax, a mechanism is now put in place to decided what should be the Excise Duty on articles imported into the country. So, that is a victory and a milestone we have achieved as a country, but we need to make sure that we improve it continuously. It is not only about establishing a committee and having its first meeting, but continuation of the activities. Therefore, I invite the business community to engaged with the process. The Ministry of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development has played a tremendous role in getting this done.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Deputy Minister, your time is up.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harshana Suriyapperuma) The officials of the Ministry of Finance also have contributed to the success of these initiatives. So, as a nation, we should be able to move forward and achieve

many things that we could not achieve earlier as a country. We are are on a mission, Madam, and are hopeful that, as a country, we would achieve it together.

Thank you very much. . . Question put, and agreed to.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The Hon. M. Nizam Kariapper. You have seven minutes.

[5.09 p.m.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. M. Nizam Kariapper, PC) Hon. Presiding Member, when you spoke in Tamil, I think everybody was shocked.

Thank you, Madam, for the opportunity to speak on this Adjournment Motion aimed at empowering small and medium exporters in the Northern Province. I rise today to support this Motion, but, of course, with a vital amendment; the scope of this discussion should be extended to include the Eastern Province as well is my proposal. The economic and social realities of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces are deeply intertwined, their challenges are similar and so is their untapped potential. Both provinces are rich in culture, traditions and natural resources. But, decades of conflict, displacement and economic neglect have left them lagging behind. Today, if we are to speak seriously about inclusive national growth, we must focus on empowering small and medium enterprises in these regions, enabling them to become prospective exporters.

Madam, I wish to draw your attention to another important and critical matter that has gone unnoticed. Under the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution - Provincial Council List - matters relating to promotion of agriculture, fisheries, co-operative industries, cottage industries and local economic development fall within the jurisdiction of the Provincial Council. This clearly reflects the framers intent that economic development of each province is not a central subject alone, but one that must be driven from the ground up with the Provincial Council paying a lead role. Ignoring this structure is not only a policy failure, but also a constitutional abdication.

The Northern and Eastern Provinces have distinct sectors with export potential, which could contribute meaningfully to the national economy. Let us start one by one. Culinary heritage and agro exports, traditional food items - you know about Jaffna traditional food items - organic products and preserved seafood from these regions are of high demand, especially among the overseas community. With proper training, packaging and marketing support, these items could be developed into powerful export brands. I will take an interesting example. When I visit Jaffna Courts, I go to "Rasavin Wanam". Just in front of it, there is a small boutique, which has a sweet item called "elluppahu" , a blackball full of nutritional value. You do not get that in any part of the country. So, these have to be promoted. I always go there and have that snack.

Then, handloom and traditional textiles. Our handloom sector is a cultural treasure. It also presents a strong case for premium exports in the global sustainable

fashion and ethical trading market if only be invested in modernization, design, innovation and e-commerce integrations.

Then, Palmyra-based products. Palmyra is abandoned in both provinces and holds immense value from jaggery, vinegar to fibre products and handicrafts. But, this industry remains informal and fragmented. It needs organized support, quality certification and research-led value addition.

Also, you get seafood and marine products. Our coastal belt, particularly in the North and the East, are rich with exportable seafood like crab, cuttlefish and dried fish. But, we lack a cold chain, export licence and post-harvest processing support necessary to compete internationally.

While the initiative of the Central Government and private sector participation are vital, there is a missing partner in the conversation - the provincial council. For far too long now, the Northern and the Eastern Provincial Councils have not been functioning. Without electoral representation, the local mandate and the institutional capacity to plan and deliver, we are limiting the potential for a truly localized responsive development. Therefore, Madam, I call upon this House and the Government to immediately take steps to hold the Provincial Councils Elections. It is essential that the provincial councils become an active partner in economic development of these regions as they are best placed to understand the local needs, to mobilize rural entrepreneurs and coordinate support across the departments.

, , .

Therefore, Madam, I urge the Government to expand the focus of export development programmes to both the Northern and the Eastern Provinces, establish SME export incubation zones in key districts like Jaffna,Vavuniya, Batticaloa and Ampara, support handloom clustsers, palmyrah co-operatives, seafood collectives and provide modern tools, marketing training and credit access, facilitate diaspora engagement and overseas promotion through targeted trade fair and digital campaign and finally, to resort to full democratic governance in the provinces by holding the long overdue Provincial Councils Elections. Only then, can we build partnership with the Centre, the provinces and the people, a triangular that is essential for genuine and lasting development.

Madam, in conclusion, I would say let us not look at the North and the East merely as regions recovering, but as engines of growth. Let us also believe in the capacity of our people, their skills, their resilience and their dreams. Let us provide them the institutions, infrastructure and inspiration they need to connect to the world as confident sub-exporters.

Thank you very much.
