II ( ) :

(

) : LOCAL AUTHORITIES ELECTIONS (SPECIAL PROVISIONS)

BILL: DETERMINATION OF THE SUPREME COURT

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I wish to announce to Parliament that I have received the Determination of the Supreme Court in respect of the Bill titled "Local Authorities Elections (Special Provisions)", which was challenged in the Supreme Court in terms of Article 121(1) of the Constitution and which had been heard before a Bench of three Judges.

Accordingly, two Judges constituting the majority of the Bench had held that:

The Bill, read as a whole and in particular Clause 2 and 3, is inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution and can be only passed with the special majority required under Paragraph 2 of Article 84. The remaining Judge of the Bench had held that: The Bill, as a whole or any provision thereof, is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution and may be enacted with a simple majority of Parliament. I order that the full Determination of the Supreme Court be printed in the Official Report of today's Proceedings of the House.
