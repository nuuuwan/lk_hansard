His father was the then President and Minister of Defence. The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, who sat in the Opposition at that time and who seemed to be a champion of human rights, has gone on Al Jazeera and defended the Government he himself was opposed to. That is precisely the problem in this country: the State will always protect itself. And, now, this Government is no different; this Government is also trying to protect itself, the State. Why I say that is because of what has been reported as having been said by former President on hospitals being bombed during the war: Wickremesinghe acknowledged that aid had been blocked to war victims and that some hospitals had been bombed. However, he refuted claims that such bombings were part of a systematic strategy, stating, There had been occasions where the Air Force had bombed hospitals and action was taken against some of them. But on a large-scale, ...... I wouldn't say that. That was his response to Al Jazeeras statement on hospitals being bombed.",

A number of witnesses have come forward and given their statements about how they were tortured, how they were beaten up with plastic poles filled with sand, how they were burnt with cigarettes and about the gunsite camp in Trincomalee and the Joseph camp in Vavuniya. You know that the Udalagama Commission very clearly stated about the ACF case, the Trinco Five case and abduction of 11 Tamil youth; they stated how the State is responsible.

When the Good Governance Government co-sponsored Resolutions, there was at least some discussion about a hybrid mechanism, where the victim community could have some trust in the process. But, there is nothing from this Government. There is a lot more to be highlighted. Isaipriya's case is one great example I gave you because you could start from there. Also, in August, 2013, a woman from Pooneryn was raped and reportedly left to die by two men wearing khaki pants and green shirts. After treatment at the Kilinochchi Hospital, military personnel escorted her to the local camp and provided her with dry rations. In 2010, a 22-year old woman from Vishwamadu was gang raped by four military personnel. The reason why I point out these things is because the Hon. Minister in charge of Public Security said that an army deserter was accused of the rape in Anuradhapura. There have been so many accusations against army deserters with the sprees of violence they have been engaged in like shootings and killings. That is what the Minister said. Today, 16 years later, if an army deserter is accused of raping a doctor in broad daylight or raping a doctor in a hospital, imagine the extent of gross violations they would have committed during the last stages of the war when there was no media coverage, no international observers and outsiders! Imagine! So, our community is only asking you to investigate into those incidents. If you are not guilty, investigate into those. Why are you shying away from an inquiry? The reason why you are shying away from an inquiry is because the State always protects the State. That is your first interest. So, Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, the NPP Government has also failed to address this concern. You all are betraying the Tamil people, the trust that the people of the North and the East, except for the people of Batticaloa, placed in you. The people of Batticaloa did not trust you and they will never trust you. So, that is what I have to say regarding accountability.",

Then, with regard to debt restructuring, we clearly had a different arrangement, a beneficial arrangement, but two days before the election, an MoU was signed. As a responsible Government, we wanted to give confidence to the international community. We wanted to act in a responsible manner to create stability within the local economy and to attract investors. That is why after a lot of deliberation, a particular path was chosen. Similarly, the Official Creditor Committee's - OCC's - intense discussions are going on as we speak to finalize the debt agreements. As of now, several agreements have been signed.

On those trends, we want to invite investors to come to Sri Lanka with the level-playing field we would create for investments, the transparency we operate with and the efficiency we provide in delivering the services to the enterprises engaged in that sector. The Budget has allocated several resources for this journey and if I am to highlight a few, one allocation has increased from Rs. 16,000 million in 2023 to Rs. 21,463 million in 2025 and another from Rs. 19,000 million in 2024 to Rs. 21,463 million in the year 2025.",

It could be said that, at the moment, India is a lion roaring, not a lumbering elephant. So, on India, China, the European Union, the USA, Japan and Korea, let us not put barriers and say, This country is leftist; this one is rightist and the other one is centric. We must embrace the world as one and take Sri Lanka forward so that we could position ourselves to exploit the opportunities before us. Look at Singapore. They had nothing 30 or 40 years ago. They looked at Sri Lanka in 1977 and said, Look at what JR is doing . But, Lee Kuan Yew came to Sri Lanka in 1978 and when he saw the strikes that were on, he said, I wanted Singapore to be like Sri Lanka 20 years ago. But, for Gods sake, let us not be like what Sri Lanka is today. And now, strikes are something of the past; I hope strikes will never repeat.

It is a very serious situation. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations makes it possible for all these diplomats to have these facilities. Has Sri Lanka become a lapdog of the imperialists? Do we deny those diplomats the right to open a bank account in our country? So, it is a very serious matter, Hon. Minister. Though the diplomats have met the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, still, they are unable to open a bank account. So, what is this serious situation? It is a shame! I think the Hon. Minister would certainly look into it and get this rectified fast because Iran is a country which has stood with us at every international fora; on every issue, they stood with us. Even in the United Nations Human Rights Council, every time they voted in support of us. And, now, the diplomats of such a country in Sri Lanka are denied the basic facility of opening a bank account. So, please look into this matter and get it rectified without any delay.",

As a matter of fact, with regard to the Sainthamaruthu incident after the Easter Sunday attacks, where the suicide bombers had blasted themselves, information was given by the local people. They would cooperate with the Government, if there is any violent activity. If this particular individual, who is following his convoluted religious practices, is a threat to the society, you take legal action rather than telling that in the public media and insulting the entire region and the people of that peace-loving community. There is no evidence of him turning to violence, as yet. If he is having some extremist religious ideas in particularly following his religious precepts and practices, the community leaders will have to approach him, deal and engage with him. But, labelling him as a potential terrorist or a terrorist would only make way for unnecessary speculation and even prevent tourists from coming to this country. So, this is an unnecessary thing and I think an unnecessary bogey has been created. So, we, as Muslim leaders, are very responsibly saying in this House that if the Government wants to investigate, do it very discretely, but do not openly make statements in the public and insult the entire community. The community feels enraged and outraged on what has already been said. This group and its existence have been known for several years; we have been watching them. In every community, we have such people who have very fundamentalist ideas; every religion has these groups. You saw a pastor who was hounded. He has been insulting other religions and was hauled up for hate speech. So, if that Muslim also does that, you go and haul him up, use the local laws and then, take action against",

Yet, it remained and continues to remain extraordinarily calm amidst the barrage of stereotyping and scapegoating that Government narratives have caused. The Government should demonstrate that it has evidence to substantiate its claim by apprehending and neutralizing them, if they are violent extremists or potential terrorists. If you look at some of the interviews of this particular person, he is blaming me also. But, I am not getting unnecessarily outraged about it because these are people who have their own convoluted ideas. Then, you have a particular Member of Parliament who is also talking extremism in this House, but that is his Parliamentary Privilege. Rather than extremism, sometimes, he makes insults to other communities as well, all of which is being tolerated. Since it is Parliamentary Privilege, those could be tolerated. But, if they are made outside Parliament, you can take action. There are local laws to haul them up before courts. So, the Kalmunai community is ever more extraordinarily resilient and patient, committed to cooperate and go the whole distance with the investigators. They are also committed to investigate the alleged links to so-called violent extremism, if any, in full transparency, working with the independent, multi-ethnic civil societies and professional organizations visiting the region. Sir, interestingly, the Government talks about people-led transformation day in and day out. Hon. Minister, you have made that point in your statement at the Human Rights Council in Geneva. What is the meaning of being led by the people when the Government creates unnecessary narratives that implicate a community and make it look as if it was not a part of the people that the Government keeps in view? A serious lack of diversity and inclusion in Government and State institutions, on the one hand, and a seemingly deliberate attempt at exclusion of a community from the national mainstream by shedding negative light on it, on the other, appear to erase the concept of people-led transformation of its true meaning! There is no time for word play, Sir, but genuine action is needed to rebuild trust and credibility, both domestically and internationally.",

So, you have selected a very good individual for this job and I would like to congratulate him and also the Minister for his good selection. There are so many things that need to be done to improve tourism in this country. We see there are about 53,900 registered hotel rooms. But, in the informal sector, there are several people who are supplying unregistered rooms. So, see that they are also brought under some registered process so that there could be proper monitoring of the facilities given to the tourists. Then, there are several boutique hotels. Already, they are talking about 48 boutique hotels, but that is a very small number. It must be larger than that since there are several boutique hotels. But, whether they had been properly registered is the question. These boutique hotels bring in high-value tourists. Sometimes, some of the boutique hotels charge more than US Dollars 1,000 per night; such hotels are there in this country. So, try to promote that aspect of it.",

    "text": "As many tourists are willing to fly directly from Colombo to other destinations, we have to essentially develop domestic flight services. Particularly, the seaplane dock at Arugam Bay has been dismantled and I would like to ask you to reconstruct that seaplane dock. It is only Cinnamon Air which operates seaplanes. So, if it would be reconstructed, it would be a big boom to tourism. Various other seaplane operators would also come into play, if seaplane docks are developed in Arugam Bay and Pasikuda. The Hon. Hizbullah is here. The Batticaloa District has the largest number of lagoons in this country; there are several lagoons all over the Batticaloa District. You can always allow these seaplanes to land there. A massive acreage is covered by the lagoons. So, those could be used for seaplane landing. Of course, an Hon. Member suggested that an airport be built in Pottuvil. But, we already have an airport in Ampara. So, improve that runway and make sure that larger planes could land in Ampara.",

On the Indian end, there is a perfect terminal facility. But, here, passengers have no terminal to come to and for their arrival facilitation. So, terminal facilities at the KKS Harbour have to be improved. Also, there had been a talk about a Mannar-India ferry service. Even for that, we need to build a terminal facility. Particularly with regard to cruise tourism, I would say even the Colombo Port does not have a proper cruise terminal. Therefore, try to see that you have a well-equipped cruise terminal built there because cruise tourism has brought in so many tourists. Similarly, at the Ashraff Jetty of the Trincomalee Harbour also - Trincomalee is a deep-sea port and one of the best natural harbours in the world - make sure that you have a proper passenger terminal. It was in the name of my former leader and Minister, the late Hon. M.H.M. Ashraff, and in his honour that that jetty had been named. In that jetty, you could create a proper passenger terminal so that the tourists who arrive by cruise ships could benefit.",

When Sri Lanka received crucial weaponry support during trying times, all that was accepted. It is, perhaps, this connection that may explain Israels occasional security presence. In 2009, Sri Lanka initiated a labour migration scheme with Israel, allowing seasonal farm workers to earn substantial salaries in Israel. Attempts to involve the International Organization for Migration in legitimizing this scheme was unsuccessful. The International Organization for Migration did not want to give any certificate for that because they know these people are being taken to farms in Israel, from where the poor Palestinians have been ousted and to which they have been denied access. They are day labourers from the Occupied Palestine who have been working in Israeli farms. With the serious situation in Gaza, several things have happened. We have not even decried Israel for what has happened there, the war crimes. Brazil, South Africa and even Bangladesh have condemned Israels action and even petitioned to the International Criminal Court.

    "text": "Hon. Presiding Member, I would like to mention that we took over a country, about which the world had a bad perception. Our country was known for corruption, Ministers asking for commission and for tourists being murdered. That was the perception world tourism had about this country. Madam, I also would like to mention that within this short period, our country has again received tourist attraction. Sri Lanka has been enlisted in databases of numerous tourism-related agencies only within the last three months. I would like to mention a few. The Colombo-Badulla train journey has been ranked as one of the best in the world by Lonely Planet. That has been during the last three months. Then, Sri Lanka shines on BBC Travel's \"25 Best Places to Travel in 2025\". Travel and Tour World recognized Sri Lanka as a \"Top Destination for Families with Young Children - Generation Beta\". Then, Sigiriya has been declared \"Worlds Most Welcoming City for 2025\". \"Experience the Magic of Sri Lankas Most Scenic Train Ride\" reports the \"National Geographic\". Also, Sri Lanka has been listed in the World Travel magazine as one of the 25 best destinations in the world and the Pekoe Trail was listed yesterday by \"The Times\" magazine as one of the greatest places to visit. Those are very recent tourism acclaims we have earned. This shows that we are taking forward the country on the right track. Therefore, I think some of these claims made by our Friends in the Opposition need to be denied.",

I have been doing so since the first time I entered Parliament in 2001 and at every Budget, I have made it a point to make an intervention under this Ministry. That is because, Madam, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in the history of this country particularly since the ethnic conflict took on fairly large proportions, has been one of the key ministries that had been used by consecutive Governments against a counterinsurgency strategy. It has been, in the past, a Ministry of lies, a Ministry that has been chosen to cover up or deny major offences both in the International Human Rights Law and the International Humanitarian Law and till this Government came into power, that has been the reality. One of the key aspects of the Ministry has been to tackle the Tamil peoples claim for their rights in this Island and it has been spearheading a campaign to portray the Tamil struggle for their rights as one of mere terrorism and carrying out a campaign against the Tamil people at large.",

What is the test, Hon. Presiding Member? I have here before me and will table in this House later the Statement by the UN High Commissioner for the Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, via videolink to the Human Rights Council. This statement was made on the 30th of September, 2015. I think it is a very important statement because it is after this statement that the then Government, in 2015, cosponsored a Resolution in the Human Rights Council. This is what the High Commissioner, who is a highly respected jurist and an activist, says about the situation in Sri Lanka. I quote:",

So, there would be no judicial proceedings against any violators. He has said it repeatedly, not once, but several times; before he became President, after he became President and whilst he was campaigning for the Parliamentary Election, he has made those assurances. And it is in that context, Hon. Presiding Member, that my good Friend, the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs went to Geneva this time, and he, too, has opposed the Resolution and instead, what he calls for is a \"domestic mechanism\". If I am not mistaken, he calls for a truth and reconciliation mechanism to deal with all war-time atrocities. But, very clearly, not once has he given an assurance that there would be a criminal prosecutory process. If a criminal prosecutory process is to happen, Hon. Presiding Member, it is quite clear that it cannot be domestic; it is quite clear. If you really want to have reconciliation and if you really want to get to the bottom of this, then, that process must be credible vis-a-vis the victims and for it to be credible vis-a-vis the victims, it cannot possibly be domestic. At the very least, it must be an ad hoc hybrid mechanism, where the control of those investigative processes must be international in nature. That is the only minimum way in which you can have credibility or give credibility to victims in that process. Now, the question is, whether this Government has departed from past practices. That is the key question and it is my view that, very unfortunately, this Government has not and there are serious doubts with regard to this Government, not with regard to the NPP as such. We cannot forget and I say it with utmost sincerity that the JVP, when Mahinda Rajapaksa was President, was its most ardent supporter with regard to a military solution for the war. In fact, if I am not mistaken, the current President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, on several occasions, has taken credit for the fact that it is the JVP which managed to give a holistic argument justifying a military solution for the war, that while the Government at that time was merely talking racist-rhetoric, communal-rhetoric, it was the JVP which",

That is the policy of China. The same sort of sentiments were expressed by Gotabaya Rajapaksa, that he did not like minorities and that we all must assimilate. The Chinese Ambassador goes to Jaffna soon after the elections and makes those comments and the Chinese Minister, whose Ministry is one of the most controversial Ministries in China, visits Sri Lanka and it was a secret visit. Why on earth would the Chinese Minister handling the subject of minorities come to Sri Lanka and not meet any of the minorities, but only the Minister of Buddhasasana Religious and Cultural Affairs and those especially of the Department of Archaeology, which is extremely controversial? We have been accusing the Department of Archaeology specifically of systematically carrying out cultural genocide in the North and the East, of changing the ethnicity and the cultural nature of the North and the East. So, I would urge the Hon. Minister to come clean. If a minister of India, America or of any other country had come and visited Jaffna, my God, it could have been all over the newspapers!

If you talk about the foreign policy of a state, that is also one of the most important policies of a country since it guides the country as to how it must interact with the other states, international organizations, non-governmental organizations and private parties in achieving and managing the countrys political, economic, defense, social and cultural interests. We know of the Greek philosopher Aristotle. He described humans as political beings. Therefore, friendships and relations across the seas and the use of foreign policies have existed among the humans since the beginning of human interactions.",

That deal was done to settle the balance of payment crisis at that time. Then, we saw the US Economic Aid Agreement, which was brought in retaliation, never coming into operation. And if we take the subsequent governments, mainly, the Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaikes Foreign Policy was based on non-alignment and friendship with all countries. The Hon.

Also, we saw during President Premadasas, President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas and also during President Mahinda Rajapaksas times, based on their political ideologies, the Foreign Policy changed and that their decisions to align with different countries also changed every four to five years. So, if you look at the last 70 years, you would see, in summary, that based on the political leadership of subsequent governments, the Foreign Policy kept changing. They were either extreme leftist or right-wing and as a result, the country suffered because every four to five years, we saw certain governments align with certain countries, and then after another four years, the successive government aligning with some other countries. Developed countries like the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia can afford to change their foreign policies and align with different countries every four to five years because of their economic situations. Also, we have seen how countries such as China, Malaysia and Singapore have achieved their global development through long-term, well planned foreign policies.

For example, in New Zealand, the Minister of Foreign Affairs also handles the Ministry of Trade Affairs mainly because there is a benefit when you branch them together. For instance, through commercial diplomacy, you could bring in a lot of investments to the country. So, I would request the Hon.
