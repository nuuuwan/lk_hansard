( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Next, the Hon.Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam. You have 15 minutes.

[11.18 a.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Hon. Chairman, I think I have 18 minutes. You can check with the Office of the Leader of the Opposition; the ASG can check with that Office. Another three minutes have to be added.

Hon. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity given to speak on the Votes of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism at the Committee Stage Discussion. I rise to speak, Sir, with utter disappointment about this Governments policy on accountability. The Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism spoke just a short

while ago and in his speech, he very briefly mentioned about accountability. He was very brief and took only about a minute. All he had to say was that there would be a domestic mechanism which would look into the gross violations of human rights.

Now, this is precisely the problem, Sir. The State, whoever that is in power, always protects the State. I would like to refer to former President Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghes recent Al Jazeera interview. I do not understand why he is defending the Government previous to his. The Hon. Namal Rajapaksa is here. His father was the then President and Minister of Defence. The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, who sat in the Opposition at that time and who seemed to be a champion of human rights, has gone on Al Jazeera and defended the Government he himself was opposed to. That is precisely the problem in this country: the State will always protect itself. And, now, this Government is no different; this Government is also trying to protect itself, the State. Why I say that is because of what has been reported as having been said by former President on hospitals being bombed during the war: Wickremesinghe acknowledged that aid had been blocked to war victims and that some hospitals had been bombed. However, he refuted claims that such bombings were part of a systematic strategy, stating, There had been occasions where the Air Force had bombed hospitals and action was taken against some of them. But on a large-scale, ...... I wouldn't say that. That was his response to Al Jazeeras statement on hospitals being bombed.

Then, Sir, I have an article here with me from the Human Rights Watch titled "Sri Lanka: Repeated Shelling of Hospitals, Evidence of War Crimes", which states, I quote:

Patients, medical staff, aid workers, and other witnesses have provided Human Rights Watch with information about at least 30 attacks on permanent and makeshift hospitals in the combat area since December 2008. One of the deadliest took place on May 2, when artillery shells struck Mullaivaikal hospital in the government-declared "no-fire zone," killing 68 persons and wounding 87.

Sir, I table* this article in the interest of time.

Let me read another paragraph from it. This is the statement of an aid worker who was there at the Valayanmadam Hospital in the no-fire zone on 02nd April. I quote:

"I was in the hospital. Right after 12:30 p.m., I noticed a Sri Lanka military drone conducting reconnaissance above the hospital. The people in the hospital suspected that an attack was imminent, so they lay down on the ground. Shortly thereafter, we heard a loud explosion in the air, followed by several smaller explosions on the ground. One of the explosions took place only a couple of meters from me. One of the doctors, who was lying just next to me, was killed by a shrapnel piece that hit him in the head. Four or five people were killed and more than 30 were wounded in the attack."

2513 2514

[ ( ) ]

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

2025 15

This article goes on to state the number of hospitals that were attacked. I quote:

"A medical worker told Human Rights Watch that when the Putumattalan hospital came under heavy shelling around midnight on April 20, he immediately sought cover in a bunker. He described what he saw after he left the shelter early in the morning:"

This is what he saw.

"The roof of the building was destroyed and tiles had fallen into the room. There were eight dead bodies in Ward 5, and five dead bodies in the admission ward,

So, there is clear evidence that hospitals were bombed during the last stages of the war. There is clear evidence! I have more articles with witnesses' evidence, which I can table. So, these have been recorded; these have been published, which stated that there was a big Red Cross flag put on the hospital premises so that the Army could see that that was a hospital.

A civilian who later went into the army-controlled area had confirmed that from one kilometre away he could see the Red Cross flag, which indicated it was a hospital. But, it was bombed. However, former President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who was not even responsible for the attack, was going on Al Jazeera and defending that previous Government or the person who is accused of it. So, that is the problem in this country: the State would always defend itself.

And, the Hon. Vijitha Herath, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and his Government are no different. At least, the people of the North and the East never voted for Rajapaksas because they knew that they would never get justice under their Government, which is why they voted for you. The entire Northern Province voted for you. Is this how you repay their faith, the faith they had in the Government? Is this how you repay them? Shame on this Government! The Hon. Minister went to Geneva and only spoke about whatever mechanisms that are already in place and about a domestic mechanism. The Tamil people have rejected any domestic mechanism because 16 years later, there has not been a single case you have solved.

One day ago you all tabled the Batalanda Commission Report. I wish the Hon. Speaker was in this House while I speak so that I could see whether he would be as compassionate when I speak about the Tamil people who were killed and the atrocities against the Tamil people as he was when the Batalanda Commission Report was presented. We saw him being so compassionate, very good. We are also compassionate on that. For the Batalanda Commission Report to be tabled is good. You investigate into that and take action, but the problem is, on all these reports that are generally tabled, we never see any action being taken. The Paranagama Commission was tabled; the Udalagama Commission was tabled, but what action, not this Government but the previous Governments had taken? This Government also had enough time. The incumbent President has been in that office for six months now. If his position was to investigate and take action on these reports, he would have started it by now. Nothing! So, again, what we are

going to see is that the Tamil people would be denied justice in this country. If the former President is defending his nemesis on foreign media, what faith could we have in this particular Government? And the Hon. Minister has given nothing in his speech today for us to have even an ounce of faith that this Government would do justice to the Tamil people.

Now, let me move on to another matter, to torture, because the Batalanda Commission is also about torture. Sir, let me bring to your attention a report that JDS has published, which talks about 219 torture sites which existed in this country during the war! Now, we are speaking about the Batalanda Commission. I am all for justice being served on the accused or the perpetrators, but there had been 219 torture sites, civil torture sites, in Sri Lanka! When are we going to investigate into all the atrocities that happened in those torture sites? Those are very recent ones. The Batalanda incidents were in 1989. These had been in 2008, 2009 and even in 2010 and 2011. So, when are you going to investigate into those? Then, there was an article published in "The Hindu" titled "Sri Lankan Tamil men accuse government of torture, rape"; that was published in 2017. A number of witnesses have come forward and given their statements about how they were tortured, how they were beaten up with plastic poles filled with sand, how they were burnt with cigarettes and about the gunsite camp in Trincomalee and the Joseph camp in Vavuniya. You know that the Udalagama Commission very clearly stated about the ACF case, the Trinco Five case and abduction of 11 Tamil youth; they stated how the State is responsible. But, what action have you all taken? So, when it comes to the Tamil people, about all these Commission reports, you all do not want to talk, but only about the Batalanda Commission Report. It has been tabled and I do not see any action being taken against those responsible.

Sir, there is a lot more to be said about how people were tortured in this country, but let me now move on to

2515 2516

another important topic, which is rape. As you know, very recently a doctor was raped in Anuradhapura. We condemn that; we are opposed to violence against women. We condemn that and the accused should be punished. Now, let us talk about the Tamil women who were raped and killed; let us talk about them as well.

. . , . , ? !

. , , ; . , . . .

. , , . . . , - - , . ? ?

Let me read from an article I have here with me about Isaipriya, which states, "Isaipriya is sitting in a swamp. She is only partly clothed. She looks dazed and confused. There is no clue as to how on earth she got there and why she is all alone. Some speculate that she had been trying to escape the bloody final showdown. She is helped to her feet and looks completely uninjured. This is an important observation, because she was not to remain so for long. The soldiers think she is the Tamil rebel leaders daughter. She is not, she says. They find a length of white cloth to wrap around her. It is the same cloth that shrouds her in a photograph Channel 4 News later obtained from a Sri Lankan soldier. In his photograph, dated later that

same day, 18th May, Isaipriya is dead. Her hands are tied behind her back. There is also now a long and jagged cut across her face. That grim footage comprises part of the notorious executions video which shows the shooting dead..... You do not need much of an imagination to figure out what has happened. It is very clear that Isaipriya was well and alive. Later, her hands were bound behind her back and she was found dead. It very clearly shows that she was not playing scrabble. Clearly, the people who had her in captivity did not play scrabble with her; they had played something else with her.

Why is the Government not ready to even acknowledge these accusations? These are all accusations. If you have the courage, investigate them. When the Good Governance Government co-sponsored Resolutions, there was at least some discussion about a hybrid mechanism, where the victim community could have some trust in the process. But, there is nothing from this Government. There is a lot more to be highlighted. Isaipriya's case is one great example I gave you because you could start from there. Also, in August, 2013, a woman from Pooneryn was raped and reportedly left to die by two men wearing khaki pants and green shirts. After treatment at the Kilinochchi Hospital, military personnel escorted her to the local camp and provided her with dry rations. In 2010, a 22-year old woman from Vishwamadu was gang raped by four military personnel. The reason why I point out these things is because the Hon. Minister in charge of Public Security said that an army deserter was accused of the rape in Anuradhapura. There have been so many accusations against army deserters with the sprees of violence they have been engaged in like shootings and killings. That is what the Minister said. Today, 16 years later, if an army deserter is accused of raping a doctor in broad daylight or raping a doctor in a hospital, imagine the extent of gross violations they would have committed during the last stages of the war when there was no media coverage, no international observers and outsiders! Imagine! So, our community is only asking you to investigate into those incidents. If you are not guilty, investigate into those. Why are you shying away from an inquiry? The reason why you are shying away from an inquiry is because the State always protects the State. That is your first interest. So, Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, the NPP Government has also failed to address this concern. You all are betraying the Tamil people, the trust that the people of the North and the East, except for the people of Batticaloa, placed in you. The people of Batticaloa did not trust you and they will never trust you. So, that is what I have to say regarding accountability.

Then, on tourism as well, Hon. Minister, there are a few things I need to point out.

[12.11 p.m.]

() ( ) ( () - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harshana Suriyapperuma - Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning) Hon. Chairman, it is a privilege to speak on the Votes of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism and about the approach of the present Government to develop and take this country forward to the next level.

Our approach is based on global connectivity, connecting Sri Lanka to the global value chain. Sri Lanka is no longer in isolation. As a nation, we need to connect our citizens and businesses to the global system. In this process, Sri Lanka has become a signatory to several global conventions. Our objective or intention is to continue with those engagements and to harness more benefits from those arrangements we, as a country, have entered into.

It is important to understand and emphasize the approach the present Government has made with regard to these foreign relationships in order to attract investments to Sri Lanka. Be it local or foreign direct investments, we need a proper framework to safeguard the investors coming into Sri Lanka. That is why the Budget has, for the first time, proposed to implement investment protection Acts. Those Acts would provide certainty to investors to come to Sri Lanka and invest in Sri Lankan businesses, enterprises and new ventures. Also, our aim is to a have zero tolerance approach for corruption when investors come into Sri Lanka.

. . . "Mr. Ten Per cent Mr. Twenty Per cent - commission - . plan , . ,

deal . , , , , national plan , .

Hon. Chairman, that is why about two weeks back, I, along with the Hon. Minister of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development, visited Jaffna. We identified locations and sites where we could invite investors to come and start new ventures, taking part in this journey. In this process, the former Kankesanthurai - KKS - Cement Factory premises, which has been abandoned for several decades, the Paranthan chemical zone which could be developed into an industrial zone and the Mankulam area, which could also be developed into an industrial zone, have been identified. We were accompanied by the Chairman of the Board of Investments as well. We engaged with the politicians from the Northern Province to get their views as to what would be the best approach to develop their areas. So, it is in consultation that we conduct our processes; it is with transparency that we advocate and champion our approach.

In addition to that, let us take our approach on Foreign Policy. As far as the way we conduct business with the international community, prior to the Presidential Election itself, we clearly indicated to the global community that we will not derail from the IMF Programme. Sir, we kept our promise and within the IMF Programme, we negotiated for the best benefits, wherever possible. Then, with regard to debt restructuring, we clearly had a different arrangement, a beneficial arrangement, but two days before the election, an MoU was signed. As a responsible Government, we wanted to give confidence to the international community. We wanted to act in a responsible manner to create stability within the local economy and to attract investors. That is why after a lot of deliberation, a particular path was chosen. Similarly, the Official Creditor Committee's - OCC's - intense discussions are going on as we speak to finalize the debt agreements. As of now, several agreements have been signed. We have been blessed with the support extended by Japan and India as Co-chairs of the OCC to expedite the arrangements we have at present.

In the economic front, there are several types of diplomacies we need to use: economic diplomacy, security diplomacy, particularly considering the location we are in the global framework and the maritime significance that Sri Lanka holds, exchange of intelligence, particularly considering the way the drug menace is spreading across the globe, social, science and technological diplomacy, political diplomacy, cultural diplomacy and people's diplomacy. Hon. Chairman, I will elaborate on people's diplomacy. We need to create a positive image about Sri Lanka among the global community, among global citizens. Through that exercise, we will be able to promote tourism, to bring in more tourists to Sri Lanka. Tourism is not only to earn money,

2531 2532

but we want to educate tourists as to how this civilized country existed 2,500 years ago.

Sri Lanka was a nation developed to the extent that we had our own maritime fleet sailing across oceans taking our commodities and goods to other nations, built structures, built judicial systems and hospitals where surgeries were conducted 2,500 years before. The archaeological evidence is a testimony to the existence of those. Our irrigation system was so advanced that across a vast distance, water was allowed to flow along a canal with an inclination of an inch per mile. That is the rich history and culture we had before.

So, we welcome the global citizens and provide them the opportunity to experience the warmth and hospitality that the smiling Sri Lankan people offer along with a wide range of other offerings. As a result of our efforts, Sri Lanka has been identified as a safest place for solo travellers, a destination for families to travel to, one of the best destinations with beaches, sunlight and fresh air to breathe and a clean country. We have also collectively embarked on a journey through the Clean Sri Lanka Programme to engage people in this exercise.

In this process, our relationships with foreign nations have been helpful to strengthen our multilateral relationships and bilateral engagements during the limited time the Government has been in operation. The World Bank has extended further support and funding; the Asian Development Bank has extended further support and funding; Japan has already started reactivating the projects that were stalled before and China has committed US Dollars 3.7 billion of investments to Sri Lanka. With India, we have ongoing discussions to materialize several other investments. So, our relationships through strategic arrangements are to get the best commercial benefits while maintaining our position as a sovereign nation.

We want to focus on our investments, exports and employment creation, particularly on knowledge transfers. Foreign earnings are an important element that has been focused on in the Budget. Foreign remittances are also an important segment. Similarly, Sri Lankan businessmen have invested in businesses overseas, generating us profits. We want to support those engagements and local businessmen to go out of Sri Lanka and invest elsewhere, making use of their knowledge. There are several arrangements in the Budget to facilitate that. We are targeting to increase the earnings from exports from US Dollars 19 billion to US Dollars 40 billion within the next five years. In order to do that, we need to diversify our markets, products and the entrepreneurs engaged in exports. Currently, it is concentrated, Sir. So, we need to engage more districts in the export value addition equation. Through these arrangements, we want to develop our relations with other foreign countries by entering into mutual agreements for trade facilitation. International trade is not a one-way journey; it applies both ways with Sri Lanka exporting to other countries and other countries wanting to export to

Sri Lanka as well. That is why the National Single Window is to be created, facilitating and ensuring smoother operations at the Port, the Sri Lanka Customs and for businesses to actively engage in this process.

International relations not only facilitate trade, but we, as a country, want to strengthen the extradition treaties we have. Local criminals are habouring in different nations, conducting criminal activities. So, we need to ensure that our international relations are taken to a level that we would be able to bring those criminals back to Sri Lanka to take them through the due judicial process we have in place.

Promotion of tourism is an important element that the Budget is focusing on with the Votes of the Ministry concerned being discussed today. That is where destination promotion arrangements come in and large sums of money have been allocated to promote identified destinations across the country, making sure that development does not concentrate only on known locations, but that opportunity is given to multiple locations.

At the same time, city branding activities would go on. Particularly in the Colombo City, we have several high-end hotels and high-value-adding hotels. Unfortunately, there are limited activities for city tourism. Therefore, we want to ensure that we provide, with intervention of the Government, enough opportunities and support to promote city-based activities. So, when families from other countries visit Colombo or while they are in transit to other locations, there would be several engagements they could take part in.

There are various other areas that we need to focus on. Focusing on science and technological diplomacy that I mentioned earlier, connecting Sri Lanka to the global value chain in terms of knowledge is also important. We know that as far as climate change is concerned, our initiatives relating to climate-resilient activities and contribution by Sri Lankan scientists to those efforts need to be taken to the next level.

Sir, if we take global challenges, during the energy transformation process, we want to showcase Sri Lankas leadership in renewable energy so that we do not hurt Mother Earth. On those trends, we want to invite investors to come to Sri Lanka with the level-playing field we would create for investments, the transparency we operate with and the efficiency we provide in delivering the services to the enterprises engaged in that sector. The Budget has allocated several resources for this journey and if I am to highlight a few, one allocation has increased from Rs. 16,000 million in 2023 to Rs. 21,463 million in 2025 and another from Rs. 19,000 million in 2024 to Rs. 21,463 million in the year 2025.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harshana Suriyapperuma) Sir, I will take one more minute and finish very quickly.

Several key areas of spending we have focused on are, rehabilitation and improvement of capital assets that we have overseas, acquisition of new capital assets, capital transfers, capacity building of our staff members who are engaged in foreign missions and other capital expenditure purposes and also specific allocations have been made for the tourism sector, the National Oceanic Affairs Committee Secretariat and the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute for International Relations and Strategic Studies. There are significant improvements on those allocations as well. We are determined not to limit ourselves to allocation of funds, but also to ensure swift implementation of those in order to give the best economic opportunities and benefits to our citizens.

Thank you very much, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) The Hon. Ruwan Wijeweera. You have eight minutes. [.. 12.25]

As a result, visa-on-arrival is something which even we would like to have. Say, if we are going to Singapore, there is no visa problem. So, utilize that as a selling factor. I am sure that these are ways through which we could encourage and increase the number of tourists coming to this country.

Then, Hon. Minister, I get back to the most important subject you represent, which is foreign affairs. I think this is the bridge with which you could connect Sri Lanka to the world. I guess the talented Minister basically knows how to get the message across to the world. But, what is important is, we must have the thrust to take this country forward. Sri Lankas Foreign Policy must be dynamic, proactive, robust, forward-thinking and centered on national interests. After all, we must be friends to all and

enemies to none. By prioritizing economic diplomacy, regional leadership and global strategic partnership, Sri Lanka could enhance its position in the world. This is where our Foreign Policy is important. Our Foreign Policy should be fashioned according to our domestic policy requirements.

The most important thing, I think, Sir, is the strategic nonalignment and pragmatic approach. Let us not only talk of nonalignment, but ensure that we project and leverage our country with our geographical location. In order to ensure that we take the maximum use of our location, now we must engage with superpowers like our neighbour, which is economically galloping forward. It could be said that, at the moment, India is a lion roaring, not a lumbering elephant. So, on India, China, the European Union, the USA, Japan and Korea, let us not put barriers and say, This country is leftist; this one is rightist and the other one is centric. We must embrace the world as one and take Sri Lanka forward so that we could position ourselves to exploit the opportunities before us. Look at Singapore. They had nothing 30 or 40 years ago. They looked at Sri Lanka in 1977 and said, Look at what JR is doing . But, Lee Kuan Yew came to Sri Lanka in 1978 and when he saw the strikes that were on, he said, I wanted Singapore to be like Sri Lanka 20 years ago. But, for Gods sake, let us not be like what Sri Lanka is today. And now, strikes are something of the past; I hope strikes will never repeat. So, we must ensure that we exploit that opportunity to bring in investments.

Then, look at regional economic integration. We must look at joining the ASEAN, the BIMSTEC, the BRICS, the Indian Ocean Rim Association and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership for more market access. Today, you have the free world led by Donald Trump for the second time. The world was talking about globalization 10, 15 years ago, but, today, he is talking about deglobalizaton. Let us look at market access and export of our textiles to USA, which bring us in the biggest earning. You would not need aid. Trade with America helps us to ensure direct and indirect employment to almost 800,000 people. So, we have got to focus on what is going on. When we have tariff wars, we have to basically focus on non-tariff barriers on other areas. I heard you mentioning today that we are in a globalized world. I am happy to see that you all have embraced that thinking and that is the way we have to take. There is no point in cursing the darkness; let us light a candle to give us light to take Sri Lanka out to the world.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, you have one more minute left out of your extra four minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Chairman, I am sure, with your affinity to the Colombo District, I could get one to three minutes more so that I could get my message across, which, in turn, will help you all to get across our message to the world.

2551 2552

All I want to say is, ensure that we use Sri Lanka as a diplomatic hub. Today, we must have a close relationship with India. After all, we are at a distance from India which could be travelled by air in just one hour. There is no point in frowning upon India or having differenes of opinion with them and trying to be friends with those who are at a distace which could be travelled in 10, 15 or 20 hours. Let us ensure that we have economic friends, regional friends and we that we are friends with the world at large. As I said, we must be friends to all and enemies to none. On that policy, let us see how we could move forward.

Then, look at economic diplomacy and trade diversification. This is the best time for you to look at branding Sri Lanka so that we could come out of bankruptcy. Now, we have a wonderful opportunity to ask to the world, when Donald Trump is talking about deglobalization, to help our country, which is poor financially, but which has rich human values.

So, let us project ourselves as a country which could position itself on the world map through the trading process and export diversification. After all, we are talking of Sri Lanka. We might be having different political agendas, we might be in different political corridors, but end of the day, Sri Lankans have got to come out of economic bankruptcy as they have been suffering for too long. It has been 77 years since we got Independence from our colonial masters, but whether we have got economic freedom is the question that many people ask, Sir.

Then, free-trade agreements. Market access is the best way forward. When you all were in the Opposition, you had a different opinion. We were basically accelerating that process seeking more market access. When the unit cost comes down, we would become more competitive. More competitive means more exports, more exports mean more dollars and more dollars mean less bankruptcy and that it would be quicker for us to come out of bankruptcy. So, on that basis, we are a nation suffering from poverty in an ocean of prosperity. So, Sir, in the manner that we always speak to Sri Lankans on political platforms, we must ensure that we come out of bankruptcy. Sir, I can see that you are trying to get the message across to me that my time is up.

Let us use tourist diplomacy and financial diplomacy to their best. I know that the IMF Programme is hard to accept and is not a panacea for all ills. But, when you go into bankruptcy, it is the IMF which needs to give its endorsement that you have come out of it. So, now, let us use financial diplomacy and tourism diplomacy for economic integration like Singapore did with trade agreements and investment promotion, like South Korea did with export diversification and like Germany did with private-public partnerships.

The United Arab Emirates, which basically did not have water, but only camels and the desert, is a standing example which marketed themselves to become a vibrant

hub today and around 80 million tourists travel to the Dubai International Airport on an annual basis. Then, look at China's Belt and Road Initiative. Look at India. They are going to have US Dollars 10 billion worth of trade by 2030. If Sri Lanka could achieve even 1 to 2 per cent of that, Sir, you life and mine would so much happier, we could go on and on winning the Colombo District and ensure that Sri Lanka is on the path to progress and that all Sri Lankans would have a better tomorrow. So, let us unite to get the country out of bankruptcy. We have got to be proactive. Let us be radical and ensure that tourism is used progressively. Also, ensure that government servants are told to not live in the dead past but in the unborn future, adopting new strategies. That is how Sri Lanka could come out of this crisis. So, let us not just be rhetoric; let us walk the talk.

Sir, I thank you for giving me all that extra time. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Next, the Hon. Aboobucker Athambawa. You have eight minutes. [.. 1.47]

Particularly, the Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates brought to my attention that though the country has already announced that 35 countries would be allowed visa-free entry to the country, his countrys nationals still have to process visa or to come with on-arrival visa. So, that is a matter which the Hon. Minister must take immediate steps to rectify.

Having said that, Sir, I would like to refer to another serious matter. The diplomats of another Middle Eastern country or rather a popularly known far-Eastern country which helps our country, which helped us with the Uma Oya Project, Iran, are now unable to open bank accounts or even obtain a credit card from a bank in this country. It is a very serious situation. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations makes it possible for all these diplomats to have these facilities. Has Sri Lanka become a lapdog of the imperialists? Do we deny those diplomats the right to open a bank account in our country? So, it is a very serious matter, Hon. Minister. Though the diplomats have met the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, still, they are unable to open a bank account. So, what is this serious situation? It is a shame! I think the Hon. Minister would certainly look into it and get this rectified fast because Iran is a country which has stood with us at every international fora; on every issue, they stood with us. Even in the United Nations Human Rights Council, every time they voted in support of us. And, now, the diplomats of such a country in Sri Lanka are denied the basic facility of opening a bank account. So, please look into this matter and get it rectified without any delay.

Having said that, Sir, may I now turn to the Votes of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism. Today, I draw your attention to the critical concerns in our foreign affairs: bilateral relations with neighbours and partners, regional cooperation, peace, security, human rights and multilateralism in the Indian Ocean region. So, I want to deal with those subjects.

Sri Lanka must adopt a modern, balanced and proactive Foreign Policy to address challenges and embrace opportunities for national progress. Our Foreign Policy, however, continues to lack a clear, goal-oriented

2557 2558

2025 15

approach. We still cotton on to terms like strategic, neutral or non-aligned when it comes to our Foreign Policy. What do we mean by those? The same outdated methods, practices that were prevalent during the times of Gotabaya and Ranil Wickremesinghe as Presidents still persist. So, what specific aspects in the Foreign Policy and foreign relations stand out this Government from its immediate predecessors? That is what I am asking.

Our Foreign Policy approach concerning the Indian Ocean region remains very ambiguous. Is the Government making it overly security-focused, so much so that peaceful activities which may benefit the country would be lost over a period of time? Between development and security, where do we draw the line when it comes to the Indian Ocean and also on a number of other issues? It is a sad reality that the Government has no clear plan on advancing equitable exploration and exploitation of marine resources, identifying responsible and considerate partners for mutually beneficial cooperation. This imbalance may undermine national interests, which today put premium on economic advancement and sustainable development.

Sir, on the 25th of February, 2025, the Hon. Vijitha Herath, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism, addressed the 58th Session of the United Nations Human Rights Council. It was Sri Lankas first high-level statement made by the new Government at the UN. As I stated previously, the decision to engage with the Council and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is a very positive step - I congratulate the Hon. Minister on that - signaling a shift from the confrontational tone of previous years. Tone and tenor matters, but it is not something that would differentiate your stance from that of the previous governments in substantive terms.

Hon. Minister, your emphasis on collaboration with the Council and progress in human rights supplemented by technical assistance is welcome. This approach is crucial for a nation recovering from economic instability. Efforts towards reconciliation such as infrastructure development and recruitment of Tamil-speaking police officers as well as upgrading the Jaffna Library need to be commended, as it does the idea of holding Sri Lanka Day celebrations this year. These are all good to create a positive vibe, but will remain only symbolic steps, if you do not substantively address the bureaucratic mindset of some of the officials, who are very hostile to these concepts. So, you have to bring in a change in the mindset of the bureaucrats of this country.

Sir, questions remain. The Government must clarify its plans for strengthening domestic institutions like the Office on Missing Persons and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Practical measures and sound policy frameworks are essential to ensure meaningful progress. Delays in addressing accountability have led to international criticism and the establishment of the Sri Lanka Accountability Project. Hon. Minister, I would like to quote from the "Update on Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Sri Lanka Accountability Project". This document was out

last evening on Sri Lanka time and is now on the website. The Hon. Minister said that at next September sittings, they are getting ready to talk about the advances they have made with the Sri Lanka Accountability Project.

Hon. Minister, you talked about a domestic process, well and good; . , I have to tell you that you have to look at this particular Update, which has now been put out by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. That Update reports under different subheadings: Mandate"; "Collecting, consolidating, analysing, and preserving information and evidence, Main Achievements"; "Collecting, consolidating, analysing, and preserving information and evidence, Priorities until September, 2025"; "Supporting relevant judicial and other proceedings, including in Member States, with competent jurisdiction"; "Advocating for the agency and support of victims and survivors"; "Developing possible strategies for future accountability processes and so on and in the same breath, also talks about How to support? It will be good to note what it states under "How to support?" I quote:

OHCHR acknowledges the Government of Sri Lankas rejection of the mandate provided in Resolution in 51/1 and subsequent resolutions but has encouraged the Government of Sri Lanka to engage constructively with OSLap in its accountability-related efforts.

Other UN Member States can play a vital role in supporting OSLaps mandate by engaging with the Government of Sri Lanka to encourage its cooperation and to foster an environment conducive to accountability efforts.

Member States can also leverage OSLaps full potential by sharing data and information, submitting requests for assistance in investigating and prosecuting alleged perpetrators, and promoting opportunities for justice in national, regional, or international courts.

So, this is a very far-reaching approach to ensure that our past mistakes are corrected. Under "How to support", they talk about supporting when the Government would engage to comply with all these requirements, particularly regarding the civil society organizations. In that, the High Commissioners Office states, I quote:

CSOs can contribute by collecting and submitting reports, testimonies, and other relevant information to assist OSLaps investigations, ensuring that the broader context of human rights violations and abuses in Sri Lanka is documented. When submitting information, CSOs are encouraged to follow established protocols and use OHCHRs secure digital tools to protect sensitive data. Providing concise summaries of evidence will enable OSLap to promptly access its relevance.

So, in that, so many things have been stated. Therefore, make sure that your intelligence operatives do not make surveillance on all these civil society organizations which are going to assist the Government in its efforts to find the truth. Also, set up the truth-finding mechanism, which is important. The Muslims themselves have suffered in various conflicts; they have their grievances. The others - the Tamils and the Sinhalese - also have suffered. So, this would be a good way to get out of this mess and see that we comply with the UN Human Rights Commissions requirements.

2559 2560

Then, key issues such as the Prevention of Terrorism Act, the establishment of a Public Prosecutors Office and the implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment were notably absent from the Ministers statement at the Council. Additionally, the lack of updates on justice for the Easter Sunday attacks also a matter of concern. We saw the ham-fisted approach by former President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his Al Jazeera interview, how he, very dismissively, dealt with some of the issues. I think he messed up the whole interview for himself, but yet, there are some who praise him. Today, we saw the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa praising him. But, it was a sorry state of affairs; for all of us who watched him, it was very discomforting to see him getting pummelled like that. Sir, instead of making progress in its efforts to bring the masterminds of the Easter Sunday attacks to justice, the Government Ministers have created an avoidable national frenzy over a bogey of religious extremism in the Eastern Province.

I am very happy that the Hon. Minister in charge of law and order is here. Some print and digital media warmongers as well as anti-Muslim hawkish social media had an open season over the last ten days, creating panic and decrying the alleged existence of a so-called potentially dangerous group of Muslim youths in Kalmunai. They described these youths varyingly as fundamentalists, as violent extremists and as potential terrorists.

Sir, the people in Kalmulaini are very peace-loving. As a matter of fact, with regard to the Sainthamaruthu incident after the Easter Sunday attacks, where the suicide bombers had blasted themselves, information was given by the local people. They would cooperate with the Government, if there is any violent activity. If this particular individual, who is following his convoluted religious practices, is a threat to the society, you take legal action rather than telling that in the public media and insulting the entire region and the people of that peace-loving community. There is no evidence of him turning to violence, as yet. If he is having some extremist religious ideas in particularly following his religious precepts and practices, the community leaders will have to approach him, deal and engage with him. But, labelling him as a potential terrorist or a terrorist would only make way for unnecessary speculation and even prevent tourists from coming to this country. So, this is an unnecessary thing and I think an unnecessary bogey has been created. So, we, as Muslim leaders, are very responsibly saying in this House that if the Government wants to investigate, do it very discretely, but do not openly make statements in the public and insult the entire community. The community feels enraged and outraged on what has already been said. This group and its existence have been known for several years; we have been watching them. In every community, we have such people who have very fundamentalist ideas; every religion has these groups. You saw a pastor who was hounded. He has been insulting other religions and was hauled up for hate speech. So, if that Muslim also does that, you go and haul him up, use the local laws and then, take action against

him rather than trying to create an unnecessary bogey and an unnecessary fear psychosis. Some of the Sinhala media have carried very serious insulting stories which are virtually inciting violence and hatred against the Muslims. So, that should be prevented, Sir.

The Government is under severe strictures nowadays for its apparent failure to uphold law and order and to ensure national security. It could demonstrate that it does all it could to assure the public that law and order and national security are not compromised; it could ensure that all who committed serious offences, including the masterminds of the Easter attacks as well as all those involved in emblematic cases, are apprehended without further delay and justice is meted out to them expeditiously. Going by what is happening, I dare ask, is it to divert public and international focus away from this cardinal failure of the Government that the bogey of an extremist group in the East has been made the talk of the town today?

Sir, the community felt a deep sense of panic and are deeply concerned and hapless. Yet, it remained and continues to remain extraordinarily calm amidst the barrage of stereotyping and scapegoating that Government narratives have caused. The Government should demonstrate that it has evidence to substantiate its claim by apprehending and neutralizing them, if they are violent extremists or potential terrorists. If you look at some of the interviews of this particular person, he is blaming me also. But, I am not getting unnecessarily outraged about it because these are people who have their own convoluted ideas. Then, you have a particular Member of Parliament who is also talking extremism in this House, but that is his Parliamentary Privilege. Rather than extremism, sometimes, he makes insults to other communities as well, all of which is being tolerated. Since it is Parliamentary Privilege, those could be tolerated. But, if they are made outside Parliament, you can take action. There are local laws to haul them up before courts. So, the Kalmunai community is ever more extraordinarily resilient and patient, committed to cooperate and go the whole distance with the investigators. They are also committed to investigate the alleged links to so-called violent extremism, if any, in full transparency, working with the independent, multi-ethnic civil societies and professional organizations visiting the region. Sir, interestingly, the Government talks about people-led transformation day in and day out. Hon. Minister, you have made that point in your statement at the Human Rights Council in Geneva. What is the meaning of being led by the people when the Government creates unnecessary narratives that implicate a community and make it look as if it was not a part of the people that the Government keeps in view? A serious lack of diversity and inclusion in Government and State institutions, on the one hand, and a seemingly deliberate attempt at exclusion of a community from the national mainstream by shedding negative light on it, on the other, appear to erase the concept of people-led transformation of its true meaning! There is no time for word play, Sir, but genuine action is needed to rebuild trust and credibility, both domestically and internationally.

The challenges faced by the fisher folk in the Northern Province due to unsustainable fishing practices such as bottom trawling in the Palk Strait are deeply concerning. These practices deplete marine resources and damage their livelihoods, threatening the future of our fishing communities who have already endured decades of hardship. Sri Lanka and India remain engaged in discussions to address this issue with a joint working group and an arrangement for dialogue between Northern and Tamil Nadu fisher folk. However, these mechanisms have yielded limited results and the genuine concerns of our fisher folk remain unresolved.

() (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Rauff Hakeem, you have only two more minutes.

() (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Sir, I will take the time of the Hon. Nizam Kariapper as well because he is not coming.

Sri Lankas laws prohibit illegal fishing and ban bottom trawling altogether. Therefore, we must seek Indias cooperation to enforce these laws effectively. A constructive step could be empowering the Governor of the Northern Province to engage with Tamil Nadu authorities to emphasize the urgency of finding a solution to this issue. Sir, additionally, it is imperative to convene the India-Sri Lanka Joint Commission as a priority with fisheries cooperation as a key item on the agenda . Failures of the joint working group must be escalated to a higher political level for timely resolution. Sir, this is not just a political issue; it is a humanitarian challenge. Livelihoods are at stake, and SDG 14 compels us to act responsibly to conserve marine resources. Therefore, we propose exploring innovative solutions to this problem. They range from cooperative fishing or a joint management mechanism involving Sri Lanka, India and Tamil Nadu. Such initiatives could ensure sustainable fishing practices and equitable benefit-sharing.

Then, Sir, I would like to cite a news item which appeared in an Indian newspaper this morning and which states, I quote:

What a nice cooperative exercise this is for a religious festival! If you can do that for a religious festival, why can you not do it for your own fishermen who are violating laws? Well, both countries, in cooperation, do it perfectly. So, I would like you to take an example from this St. Anthonys Church festival in Kachchativu, where facilities had been provided by both Governments and for which 3,000 people have come from India to participate. A lot of facilities had been provided by both Governments to make sure that it happens without any problem. So, in a similar way, you can approach this issue of the fishermen and resolve it by having very friendly discussions.

Having said that, Sir - there are a lot of items I needed to take up - I would now like to deal with another important matter relating to the tourism sector. In the tourism sector, Sir, there are several issues. Particularly, I must congratulate the Minister for having appointed Mr. Buddhika Hewawasam as Chairman of both the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority and the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau. Your Chairman is a very experienced expert in the field. Earlier, he was Country Manager of IATA. So, you have selected a very good individual for this job and I would like to congratulate him and also the Minister for his good selection. There are so many things that need to be done to improve tourism in this country. We see there are about 53,900 registered hotel rooms. But, in the informal sector, there are several people who are supplying unregistered rooms. So, see that they are also brought under some registered process so that there could be proper monitoring of the facilities given to the tourists. Then, there are several boutique hotels. Already, they are talking about 48 boutique hotels, but that is a very small number. It must be larger than that since there are several boutique hotels. But, whether they had been properly registered is the question. These boutique hotels bring in high-value tourists. Sometimes, some of the boutique hotels charge more than US Dollars 1,000 per night; such hotels are there in this country. So, try to promote that aspect of it.

Then, I would like to ask the Hon. Minister to make sure that the United Nations World Tourism Organization holds its next annual tourism conference in Sri Lanka. Try to approach them and see whether you could get the UNWTO Annual Conference to be held here. An international surfing competition should also be organized by the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau. Earlier, the SriLankan Airlines used to support it, but, now, the SriLankan Airlines is in a very difficult situation. But, yet, in promoting tourism, I am sure, they would come forward to assist and have the surfing competition again in Arugam Bay. It has not happened for a few years. So, try to revive it.

2563 2564

As many tourists are willing to fly directly from Colombo to other destinations, we have to essentially develop domestic flight services. Particularly, the seaplane dock at Arugam Bay has been dismantled and I would like to ask you to reconstruct that seaplane dock. It is only Cinnamon Air which operates seaplanes. So, if it would be reconstructed, it would be a big boom to tourism. Various other seaplane operators would also come into play, if seaplane docks are developed in Arugam Bay and Pasikuda. The Hon. Hizbullah is here. The Batticaloa District has the largest number of lagoons in this country; there are several lagoons all over the Batticaloa District. You can always allow these seaplanes to land there. A massive acreage is covered by the lagoons. So, those could be used for seaplane landing. Of course, an Hon. Member suggested that an airport be built in Pottuvil. But, we already have an airport in Ampara. So, improve that runway and make sure that larger planes could land in Ampara.

Then, Batticaloa has been declared an international airport already.

() .... ( () .... ) (The Hon. (Dr.) M.L.A.M. Hizbullah) But, it has been stopped.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Yes, it has been stopped. With a lot of pomp and fanfare, the earlier Minister announced that Batticaloa had been declared as an international airport. But, if you look at the runway, you would see that with all those potholes, it is very difficult for any international plane to land there.

Then, I would like to refer to the India-Sri Lanka ferry service. At the KKS Harbour, there are no terminal facilities. But, look at the other end. On the Indian end, there is a perfect terminal facility. But, here, passengers have no terminal to come to and for their arrival facilitation. So, terminal facilities at the KKS Harbour have to be improved. Also, there had been a talk about a Mannar-India ferry service. Even for that, we need to build a terminal facility. Particularly with regard to cruise tourism, I would say even the Colombo Port does not have a proper cruise terminal. Therefore, try to see that you have a well-equipped cruise terminal built there because cruise tourism has brought in so many tourists. Similarly, at the Ashraff Jetty of the Trincomalee Harbour also - Trincomalee is a deep-sea port and one of the best natural harbours in the world - make sure that you have a proper passenger terminal. It was in the name of my former leader and Minister, the late Hon. M.H.M. Ashraff, and in his honour that that jetty had been named. In that jetty, you could create a proper passenger terminal so that the tourists who arrive by cruise ships could benefit.

() .... ( () .... ) (The Hon. (Dr.) M.L.A.M. Hizbullah) Ships come, but there is no terminal.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Yes, several ships come, but there is no terminal. This is the problem.

It is also suggested that all tourist service providers operating in the informal sector - tourist drivers, tuk-tuk drivers, tourist vendors, tourism shopkeepers, tourist facilitators et cetera who are providing services to tourists - be trained and issued with an identity card by the Tourism Development Authority or some other authority. Identification of such relevant informal sector tourist service providers could be done by the Tourist Police until relevant arrangements are made. So, those are some of the ideas I would like to share with the Hon. Minister on tourism development.

Having said that, Hon. Minister, I would also like to deal with the issue of Israels cultural and military presence in Sri Lanka. It needs our attention. When the Hon. Prime Minister has stated that no permission has been granted or will be granted for the establishment of Jewish religious centres - We have no problem with synagogues being set up, but they have to be set up according to the law of the land - how has this happened? The Prime Minister has said that no permission had been granted for the establishment of Jewish religious centres. The accuracy of the assertion remains to be demonstrated. There are STF personnel assigned to protect those centres. How does the State give STF protection to some religious premises unless there is permission?

Sir, improved ties between our defence sector and Israel dates back to the post-conflict period. That is perfect. When Sri Lanka received crucial weaponry support during trying times, all that was accepted. It is, perhaps, this connection that may explain Israels occasional security presence. In 2009, Sri Lanka initiated a labour migration scheme with Israel, allowing seasonal farm workers to earn substantial salaries in Israel. Attempts to involve the International Organization for Migration in legitimizing this scheme was unsuccessful. The International Organization for Migration did not want to give any certificate for that because they know these people are being taken to farms in Israel, from where the poor Palestinians have been ousted and to which they have been denied access. They are day labourers from the Occupied Palestine who have been working in Israeli farms. With the serious situation in Gaza, several things have happened. We have not even decried Israel for what has happened there, the war crimes. Brazil, South Africa and even Bangladesh have condemned Israels action and even petitioned to the International Criminal Court. They said that Israel Prime Minister Netanyahu and his cohorts must be hauled up for war crimes.

But, we are keeping mum. This Government has more responsibility and a duty because they have been in the forefront - I know that my Friend, the Leader of the House, was President of the Sri Lanka-Palestine Parliamentary Friendship Association - to stand up

2565 2566

2025 15

against these atrocities and talk about them openly. There is nothing wrong in doing that because we are not going to unnecessarily offend people, but we have to speak the truth. If the South African President can say it, if the Brazilian President can say it and Bangladesh - our neighbouring country - can say it, why not Sri Lanka? Why do you not openly criticize them?

Then, regional leadership is also important. Actively participating in Indian Ocean and Indo-Pacific norm building to secure shared prosperity is imperative. The Hon. Minister said today that we are going to get ASEAN membership. That is a pipe dream, Sir. During our economic troubles, we wanted to become a sectoral partner and we were allowed in. So, we are now enjoying the status of a sectoral partner. If we are admitted to that position alone, it would suffice for us. But, what is happening now is, the Hon. Minister is claiming that we are going to get its membership. That is a pipe dream, Sir. All who know the process, know that.

( ) (The Hon. Vijitha Herath) A sectoral partner.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Yes, that is right. The Hon. Minister accepts that.

Hon. Minister, last year, the BIMSTEC established an Eminent Persons Group. As a result of a recommendation made by the Foreign Ministers at the BIMSTEC Summit held in Colombo in 2022, the governments were asked to nominate an Independent Eminent Expert to the group in order to help charter a new vision and a strategy for the BIMSTEC. All member states, except Sri Lanka, nominated independent experts who are knowledgeable and experienced as well as well-accomplished in their chosen fields. Sri Lanka, however, nominated three different persons to the three meetings of the Group. Consequently, there was no serious input from Sri Lanka at the first session of the Group held in Dhaka. Hon. Foreign Minister, it is possible that you have already decided to attend the BIMSTEC Summit in Bangkok from 01st to 03rd of April, 2025; I am sure the Hon. Vijitha Herath is going to attend that Summit. You must avail yourself of the opportunity to demonstrate that Sri Lanka takes BIMSTEC seriously. You must put the house in order to be able to initiate, follow up and coordinate effectively all BIMSTEC activities. It is time to make our Foreign Service think innovatively and come up with practical and meaningful proposals in consultation with relevant ministries, agencies and experts, which could enrich BIMSTEC's output and its quality of service.

Sir, economic integration is an important priority, if the country would like to increase and strengthen trade and investment ties globally and regionally while advocating and avoiding the overlaps and inefficiencies currently taking place on a possible China-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement. What is happening to that? It is a matter that requires participation of all business and other stakeholders. Also, what is the status of progress with regard to the already signed Singapore-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement? Are we still seeking revision to that Agreement and if so, to what extent have we advanced in

that direction? Not implementing it or renegotiating it continues to send out negative signals to the world and the region, especially to ASEAN that Sri Lanka remains unworthy of economic trade and investment cooperation. Therefore, the issues with regard to the Singapore-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement as well as the China-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement have to be concluded as fast as possible so that we could benefit from the concessions derived from those agreements as well.

Having stated that, I would congratulate the Minister for having conducted our countrys foreign affairs up to now. In his statement to the UN Human Rights Council, our position is very clear, but do not go back on your promises engaged with the UN Human Rights Council. And, make sure that we come out of this mess as fast as possible. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Vijitha Herath) Hon. Member, as far as the issue of free visa is concerned, the Government has already taken a decision to offer free visas for 39 countries. There is another new proposal to add Pakistan also to that list. The Gazette Notification will be submitted to Parliament. Then, you can vote for that.

Then, the other issue with regard to opening bank accounts here by Iranian diplomats has already been sorted out. There was such an issue a year ago and now it has been sorted out. I think they do not know about that

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Yesterday, at the Iftar, I heard that.

( ) (The Hon. Vijitha Herath) We will check on that.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Please, do.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Next, the Hon. (Prof.) Ruwan Ranasinghe. You have 14 minutes.

Order, please! The Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Kaushalya Ariyarathne will now take the Chair.

() ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Ruwan Ranasinghe - Deputy Minister of Tourism) ? . . .

Hon. Presiding Member, I would like to mention that we took over a country, about which the world had a bad perception. Our country was known for corruption, Ministers asking for commission and for tourists being murdered. That was the perception world tourism had about this country. Madam, I also would like to mention that within this short period, our country has again received tourist attraction. Sri Lanka has been enlisted in databases of numerous tourism-related agencies only within the last three months. I would like to mention a few. The Colombo-Badulla train journey has been ranked as one of the best in the world by Lonely Planet. That has been during the last three months. Then, Sri Lanka shines on BBC Travel's "25 Best Places to Travel in 2025". Travel and Tour World recognized Sri Lanka as a "Top Destination for Families with Young Children - Generation Beta". Then, Sigiriya has been declared "Worlds Most Welcoming City for 2025". "Experience the Magic of Sri Lankas Most Scenic Train Ride" reports the "National Geographic". Also, Sri Lanka has been listed in the World Travel magazine as one of the 25 best destinations in the world and the Pekoe Trail was listed yesterday by "The Times" magazine as one of the greatest places to visit. Those are very recent tourism acclaims we have earned. This shows that we are taking forward the country on the right track. Therefore, I think some of these claims made by our Friends in the Opposition need to be denied.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam. You have 20 minutes.

[3.18 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, I am quite happy to speak today on the Votes of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism. I have been doing so since the first time I entered Parliament in 2001 and at every Budget, I have made it a point to make an intervention under this Ministry. That is because, Madam, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in the history of this country particularly since the ethnic conflict took on fairly large proportions, has been one of the key ministries that had been used by consecutive Governments against a counterinsurgency strategy. It has been, in the past, a Ministry of lies, a Ministry that has been chosen to cover up or deny major offences both in the International Human Rights Law and the International Humanitarian Law and till this Government came into power, that has been the reality. One of the key aspects of the Ministry has been to tackle the Tamil peoples claim for their rights in this Island and it has been spearheading a campaign to portray the Tamil struggle for their rights as one of mere terrorism and carrying out a campaign against the Tamil people at large.

Now, the question, Madam, is whether this Government, since it came into power, has changed any of that. And, its approach towards the ethnic conflict and particularly the way in which it handles the Foreign Policy with regard to countries which have shown interest in voicing the concerns of the Tamil people in this country is another key aspect. What is the test, Hon. Presiding Member? I have here before me and will table in this House later the Statement by the UN High Commissioner for the Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, via videolink to the Human Rights Council. This statement was made on the 30th of September, 2015. I think it is a very important statement because it is after this statement that the then Government, in 2015, cosponsored a Resolution in the Human Rights Council. This is what the High Commissioner, who is a highly respected jurist and an activist, says about the situation in Sri Lanka. I quote:

"I welcome the Governments commitments, made before this Council, to investigate these violations and ensure accountability, despite the opposition of some political parties and sections of the military and society. The unfortunate reality is, however, that Sri Lankas criminal justice system is not currently equipped to conduct an independent and credible investigation into allegations of this breadth and magnitude, or to hold accountable those responsible for such violations, ...."

He goes on to say, I quote:

First, Sri Lanka lacks a reliable system for victim and witness protection,

And then, he mentions a few matters there and says, I quote:

Secondly, the domestic legal framework is inadequate to deal with international crimes of this magnitude.

Specifically, Madam, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights refers to the fact that Sri Lanka does not have, in its laws, international humanitarian law violations and mass crimes as offences and therefore, states a very valid point that Sri Lanka is not "equipped" to deal with the nature of crimes that it is being accused of. Then, he goes on to state - this is the most important part that I wish to bring to the attention of the Hon. Minister, who is thankfully present here - I quote:

Thirdly, the States security sector and justice system have been distorted and corrupted by decades of impunity. The independence and integrity of key institutions such as the Attorney-Generals Office and the Human Rights Commission remain compromised. The security forces, police and intelligence services have enjoyed near total impunity and have not undergone any significant reform since the armed conflict.

That remains a fact even today, even whilst the Hon. Minister presents his case under the Votes of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He further goes on to say, I quote:

This is why I have recommended the establishment of an ad hoc hybrid special court, integrating international judges, prosecutors, lawyers and investigators, mandated to try notably war crimes and crimes against humanity, with its own independent investigative and prosecuting organ, defence office and witness and victims protections programme. In a highly polarized environment,..', which is what Sri Lanka is even today.

"...such a mechanism is essential to give all Sri Lankans, especially victims, confidence in the independence and impartiality of this process."

Hon. Minister, as regards judicial accountability, he says, I quote:

"Judicial accountability should be accompanied by broader transitional justice measures, including truth-seeking and reparations, to ensure that the right of victims to redress is realized.

Sir, I table* this entire Statement by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to the Human Rights Council before this House.

I spent some time marking this because it is after this Statement that the Good Governance Government - that is what they call themselves, but I do not agree with it - of 2015 agreed to cosponsor a Resolution. But, despite that, when Ranil Wickremesinghe became President, he went back on that; he went back on that Resolution he himself, as Prime Minister, was supposed to have cosponsored. He got his Foreign Minister, the Hon. Ali Sabry, to oppose it quite vehemently.

Then, on the 27th of July, 2023, when the then Foreign Minister, the Hon. Ali Sabry, met with the foreign correspondents in Sri Lanka, he very clearly justified going back on the Resolution and the mere creation of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission - a TRC - to ward off international intervention or inernational interference. That is the most important part. Madam, I have two articles here, which I would like to table*.

2581 2582

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

2025 15

One is titled Truth and Reconciliation Commission could help Sri Lanka stave off foreign intervention: FM and the other is titled Sri Lankas truth commission is to ward off international interference and will have no prosecuting powers. So, on the 27th of July, 2023, he assures the foreign correspondents of that and on the 04th of September, 2024, he comes and assures this House about recommending the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as that Commission would never have prosecuting powers.

That was the previous Governments position. We all know that the Government before that with Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Mahinda Rajapaksa, who are suspected war criminals, was not going to prosecute themselves. Any fool would know that. So, we do not expect that from them. But, it was Ranil Wickremesinghe, who co-sponsored that Resolution High Commissioner Zeid had presented, who goes back on it and gets his Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry, who was Adviser to the then Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and President Mahinda Rajapaksa, to make that statement regarding more prosecutions.

Again, the current President, when he was campaigning for presidency, made repeated assurances that not a single person would be brought before court. So, there would be no judicial proceedings against any violators. He has said it repeatedly, not once, but several times; before he became President, after he became President and whilst he was campaigning for the Parliamentary Election, he has made those assurances. And it is in that context, Hon. Presiding Member, that my good Friend, the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs went to Geneva this time, and he, too, has opposed the Resolution and instead, what he calls for is a "domestic mechanism". If I am not mistaken, he calls for a truth and reconciliation mechanism to deal with all war-time atrocities. But, very clearly, not once has he given an assurance that there would be a criminal prosecutory process. If a criminal prosecutory process is to happen, Hon. Presiding Member, it is quite clear that it cannot be domestic; it is quite clear. If you really want to have reconciliation and if you really want to get to the bottom of this, then, that process must be credible vis-a-vis the victims and for it to be credible vis-a-vis the victims, it cannot possibly be domestic. At the very least, it must be an ad hoc hybrid mechanism, where the control of those investigative processes must be international in nature. That is the only minimum way in which you can have credibility or give credibility to victims in that process. Now, the question is, whether this Government has departed from past practices. That is the key question and it is my view that, very unfortunately, this Government has not and there are serious doubts with regard to this Government, not with regard to the NPP as such. We cannot forget and I say it with utmost sincerity that the JVP, when Mahinda Rajapaksa was President, was its most ardent supporter with regard to a military solution for the war. In fact, if I am not mistaken, the current President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, on several occasions, has taken credit for the fact that it is the JVP which managed to give a holistic argument justifying a military solution for the war, that while the Government at that time was merely talking racist-rhetoric, communal-rhetoric, it was the JVP which

very technocratically created the justification to mobilize the public in favour of the war. "In favour of a total war were the words he used. So, in that context, the question is whether, genuinely, this Government could spearhead an accountability process. You all supported that process so heavily, knowing that there were very grave offences taking place. Despite that, you all showed complete support to go ahead with the war, because in your own logic you felt that it was more important to destroy the LTTE, regardless of what the side effects would be. And, today, when we, as victims, say that we faced genocide and when the then High Commissioner for Human Rights, who is probably the most respected jurist when it comes to human rights and international humanitarian law, says that Sri Lanka is not "equipped" because of the nature of the conflict, the polarization that is within and that a domestic mechanism just would not do, then the question is, what is the answer that the Government has?

I repeatedly said and I say again that the last 77 years have been an utter disaster for the Tamil people; the last 77 years have been an utter disaster because it has been a racist regime that came in time and again. They may say something a bit soothing at a particular time, but in reality, their practice has been against the Tamil people, against accepting the rights of the Tamil people. The only time that a government has genuinely come into power - that is, a departure from those two parties which have governed from time to time over the last 77 years - is this Government. But, this Government also has a huge spot, a huge mark on its back because it is this Government or the JVP which supported the most heinous times faced by the Tamil people, which was the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime. Therefore, it is your Government that must come clean.

Now, I am asking the Minister of Foreign Affairs, why on earth are we frightened of an international mechanism? If we actually did not commit any offences - the Tamils are not running away from it - why are we running away? Then, you know for a fact that the nature of the conflict that took place is so polarizing that an internal mechanism just would not do. So, why do you not submit to an international mechanism and actually come to the truth? Should the Tamil people not deserve at least that? It does not mean that just because we go through a prosecutory process, there cannot be reconciliation. But, if you do not have criminal justice at the heart of this process, then everything else is a cover-up, which is exactly what the previous governments had been trying to do.

Madam, I also want to bring up something that has come up recently. Normally, I do not make these comments; I try to avoid making such comments, even though I repeatedly spoke on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with regard to other Governments. When the NPP Government won the elections, the Ambassador to China visited Jaffna and made comments, which I thought were very unbecoming of an ambassador. I do not think the Chinese Government follows those processes, but certainly, that Ambassador, in my view, broke tradition and made completely unacceptable statements in support of the NPP. He interpreted those election results and

2583 2584

welcomed the support for the NPP in the North, particularly in Jaffna. The NPP got only 24 per cent of the votes in Jaffna. They might have got three seats out of six, but they only got 24 per cent of votes. On what calculation the Chinese Ambassador thought the Tamil people of Jaffna voted overwhelmingly for the NPP, I do not know. But, he should never have been allowed to make those comments. If the Government is so sincere with regard to changing the culture, then the Minister of Foreign Affairs must actually question the Ambassador because it is completely unfair for an ambassador to make such comments. I do not think any ambassador in any other country has made such comments. Why I am saying this, Madam, is from the 19th to the 23rd February, 2025, the Minister for National Ethnic Affairs Commission, Mr. Pan Yue, visited Sri Lanka with a delegation, met the Minister of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs and, I am told, had stated that China wants to open a Sri Lanka-China cultural affairs centre in Jaffna. This particular Ministry, the NEAC, Madam, is the Ministry in charge of ethnic minorities in China.

The Hon. Minister knows fully well that there are serious allegations against the policies of that Ministry: the Amnesty International has accused that Ministry of suppression of cultural and religious practices; there are allegations of genocide against the Uyghur Muslim minority practised by that Ministry; the Human Rights Watch has accused the Ministry of mass surveillance and data collection and there are also accusations of the Ministry being the epicentre of assimilatory policies and Chinas Head of ethnic affairs is keen to end the minority culture. That is the policy of China. The same sort of sentiments were expressed by Gotabaya Rajapaksa, that he did not like minorities and that we all must assimilate. The Chinese Ambassador goes to Jaffna soon after the elections and makes those comments and the Chinese Minister, whose Ministry is one of the most controversial Ministries in China, visits Sri Lanka and it was a secret visit. Why on earth would the Chinese Minister handling the subject of minorities come to Sri Lanka and not meet any of the minorities, but only the Minister of Buddhasasana Religious and Cultural Affairs and those especially of the Department of Archaeology, which is extremely controversial? We have been accusing the Department of Archaeology specifically of systematically carrying out cultural genocide in the North and the East, of changing the ethnicity and the cultural nature of the North and the East. So, I would urge the Hon. Minister to come clean. If a minister of India, America or of any other country had come and visited Jaffna, my God, it could have been all over the newspapers! People would have been criticizing every single word that that minister says. But, this Minister and his delegation had come and gone, but we do not know anything about it. We have to do research to find out what has happened. Therefore, especially in the backdrop of the way in which the Chinese Ambassador had made comments and this particular Ministry has been accused of in China, I think the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs must come clean.

Thank you very much.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Kavinda Heshan Jayawardhana) Hon. Presiding Member, today we are having a very important Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism.

Madam, we have to work with the rest of the world; we cannot be isolated. As we continue with our economic recovery while strategically positioning ourselves in the changing landscape of world politics, it is essential to acknowledge the support we have received from the global community. When Sri Lanka faced with an unprecedented economic crisis, we declared bankruptcy. We witnessed demonstration of extraordinary international solidarity in our darkest hour. When our foreign exchange reserves depleted and our 22 million citizens were faced with shortages of essentials, several nations extended their support.

The Government of India, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, provided us with a crucial credit line of US Dollars 4 billion, enabling us to secure the vital medicines, food and other essentials. That timely intervention helped us stabilize our immediate humanitarian situation. For that, we are eternally grateful to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the people of India and for being a great friend to Sri Lanka. Similarly, we acknowledge the Chinese Government, who significantly contributed through a currency swap, the Japanese Government as well as the Bangladesh Government.

Madam, we must recognize the geopolitical landscape that evolves continuously. After President Donald Trump returned to office in the United States, global political dynamics have shifted once again, which is good. As a responsible member of the international community, Sri Lanka must navigate through these changes thoughtfully. We observe the interests of President Donald Trump in his approach to complex global challenges including the efforts towards peace in Gaza and Ukraine.

Madam, as a country which exports garments and textiles worth US Dollars 2 billion to 2.5 billion annually to the US, we must continue to have a good relationship

with them. The foreign exchange earned through those exports does not just add numbers to our countrys balance sheet, but those exports also provide livelihood for hundreds of thousands of Sri Lankans. So, I think the Government of Sri Lanka must continue to have a dialogue with the United States to keep the current concessions on our exports because they bring an immense strength to our country's economy and the foreign exchange reserves.

. . . Hon. Minister, you have taken up a very challenging task because the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism is a crucial Ministry which has to be handled very carefully.

[4.21 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Arun Hemachandra - Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Employment) Hon. Presiding Member, thanks a lot for the opportunity to speak. I was expecting this Discussion to be very constructive, but it is so disappointing since I do not see anything constructive as such in it. There are no arguments being built up and the Opposition is just wasting time.

Whatever it is, Sir, let me start my speech with this statement: "Those who squandered the nation's wealth yesterday, preach wisdom today. Credibility is not reclaimed through words, but with accountability". . constructive argument . . . . .

. . . . if we take the allegations against Jaliya Wickramasuriya, Sri Lanka's former Ambassador to the United States and a relative of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, he was accused of financial misconduct. He was arrested in 2016 on charges of accepting a commission of US Dollars 322,000 during his tenure. In April, 2022, he pleaded guilty to diverting funds which were intended for purchasing a new embassy site. . . . In December, 2024, the US State Department imposed sanctions on several individuals including Udayanga Weeratunga, Sri Lanka's former Ambassador to Russia. He was accused of benefitting from a corrupt procurement scheme of MiG aircraft for the Sri Lanka Air Force.

[4.36 p.m.] ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Chamindranee Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Presiding Member, first of all, I would like to thank you for giving me time to speak on this very important Ministry, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism. I think a lot of views have been expressed regarding tourism and foreign employment. So, I would like to predominantly base my speech on foreign affairs.

Sir, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is one of the most valuable and important ministries as it is the main institution which drives the foreign policy of a country. If you talk about the foreign policy of a state, that is also one of the most important policies of a country since it guides the country as to how it must interact with the other states, international organizations, non-governmental organizations and private parties in achieving and managing the countrys political, economic, defense, social and cultural interests. We know of the Greek philosopher Aristotle. He described humans as political beings. Therefore, friendships and relations across the seas and the use of foreign policies have existed among the humans since the beginning of human interactions.

When we analyse the history of Sri Lankas Foreign Policy since Independence, we could see the various foreign policy stances and directions the successive

governments had taken during the Cold War era and post-Cold War era. It has been very difficult for Sri Lanka, as a country, to maintain a neutral and a friendly Foreign Policy. All the time with all the countries, we have maintained a friendly Foreign Policy, mainly due to the different internal political policies of subsequent governments.

If we briefly go down the memory lane of Sri Lankas Foreign Policy, for example, from 1948 to 1956, Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake had a relationship with the Western Bloc. He thought that was the only solution for economic growth in Sri Lanka. Then, his successor, the Hon. Dudley Senanayake, signed the Rubber-Rice Pact with the communist China in 1952. That deal was done to settle the balance of payment crisis at that time. Then, we saw the US Economic Aid Agreement, which was brought in retaliation, never coming into operation. And if we take the subsequent governments, mainly, the Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaikes Foreign Policy was based on non-alignment and friendship with all countries. The Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaikes Foreign Policy was anti-capitalist and therefore, anti-western.

Then, President J.R. Jayewardene continued to receive assistance from both capitalist and communist countries as well as from international organizations. So, we saw countries such as the UK, the United States, Norway and Japan becoming the biggest doners of grants to Sri Lanka. Also, we saw during President Premadasas, President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas and also during President Mahinda Rajapaksas times, based on their political ideologies, the Foreign Policy changed and that their decisions to align with different countries also changed every four to five years. So, if you look at the last 70 years, you would see, in summary, that based on the political leadership of subsequent governments, the Foreign Policy kept changing. They were either extreme leftist or right-wing and as a result, the country suffered because every four to five years, we saw certain governments align with certain countries, and then after another four years, the successive government aligning with some other countries. Developed countries like the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia can afford to change their foreign policies and align with different countries every four to five years because of their economic situations. Also, we have seen how countries such as China, Malaysia and Singapore have achieved their global development through long-term, well planned foreign policies. So, if you look at the examples I mentioned earlier, China, Malaysia and Singapore, they have had one long-standing foreign policy.

So, irrespective of which government came into power, 75 per cent of their foreign policy did not change; they left about 25 per cent of it for the subsequent government to be flexible on, taking forward the favoured partys policies. But, predominantly, they have had a long-term, fixed foreign policy. So, developing nations like Sri Lanka also, I think, would definitely benefit, if we have a long-term foreign policy. The Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism is in the Chamber today. Hon. Minister, I would

2603 2604

request you to make that change because, like I said before, for 70 years, we have seen subsequent governments changing their foreign policy based on their political ideology. But, now, you all have come to make a change in our country. So, I would humbly request you to consider having a long-term Foreign Policy, maybe, one which spans 10 to 15 years and which does not change based on the political ideologies of subsequent governments. If you look at the benefits of having such a long-term foreign policy, developing countries could avoid short-sighed policies which may not benefit them. Also, many of the challenges faced by developing countries such as climate change, poverty and inequality are complex and require long-term coordinated efforts. Therefore, again, I would request the Hon. Minister to consider having a long-term Foreign Policy.

Another topic I would like to touch upon is commercial diplomacy, which is an integral part of the foreign policy of a country. I know that in the Foreign Ministry, we have an Economic Affairs Division, but we need to be more proactive because if you look at a lot of the developed countries, we see that the Minister of Foreign Affairs is also the Minister of Trade. For example, in New Zealand, the Minister of Foreign Affairs also handles the Ministry of Trade Affairs mainly because there is a benefit when you branch them together. For instance, through commercial diplomacy, you could bring in a lot of investments to the country. So, I would request the Hon. Minister to relook at it and to introduce a system, maybe, of performance-based incentives to the staff in those divisions so that more investments could be brought into the country.

I would also like to briefly touch upon depoliticizing the Foreign Service.

We know that the NPP, throughout their campaign, mainly talked about not having any political appointments made to the Foreign Service. We expected that with the whole Clean Sri Lanka campaign, steps would be taken to clean the Foreign Service also. However, there are indications emerging that political appointments to the Foreign Service is continuing today as well. So, I would request the Hon. Minister, who is here today in the Chamber, to relook at it because that is not what was mandated.

Also if I refer very briefly to foreign employment, as we know, there is a large number of female domestic workers who bring in a lot of revenue to our country working in the Middle East and some of them have worked overseas for decades. But, when they come back, they find that most of the money they have sent has been either squandered by their husbands or used up by their families. So, when they come back even after working overseas for 20, 30 years, they have to start earning from scratch. Therefore, I would like to propose today to introduce a pension scheme for them. I think the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism could work together with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment and see if these women could be given a

pension so that when they come back after a long service in the Middle East, they could have some pension. Therefore, introduce a system through which a deduction could be made from their monthly salary so that they could use it when they come back to Sri Lanka to retire. I hope the Hon. Minister would look at this suggestion favourably.

Sir, I would like to thank you again for giving me time. And, Hon. Minister, I wish you all the best in your functions at the Ministry and in all your future endeavours! Thank you.
