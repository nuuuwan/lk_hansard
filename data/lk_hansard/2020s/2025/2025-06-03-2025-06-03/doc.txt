02. Initially, when this Institute was set up, the intention was to have it as a separate autonomous institute, but it was set up under the existing Act, No. 15 of 2017, under which the CGTTI was also established. At the time when the SLGTI in Kilinochchi was set up, there was advice from the Attorney-Generals Department that the Act needs to be amended, if it is to be established as a separate autonomous institute. So, it required an amendment to the Act. But, that has not happened. It was in 2020 that the Institute was initiated and subsequently in 2022, the then Cabinet took a decision that it should be set up as a separate institute, but the necessary legal amendments were not made and the revisions had not happened. So, that is the current status and we are looking into whether that is feasible and whether amendment to the Act has to be made.

03. Sir, I went and paid a site visit to this SLGTI in Kilinochchi along with the Ministry officials. I, too, observed that there are several issues there, especially with regard to student welfare. There is equipment and possibility for expanding this Institute. However, student welfare facilities are not up to the standard, hostel facilities are not enough and there are many problems that the

students are facing. So, consequent to that site visit, we have allocated funds from the Budget, 2025 to upgrade hostel facilities and student welfare facilities. Those are really a difficult issues because the site is relatively isolated.

So, there are no services around for students to access either. Therefore, we are looking into that.

We are also planning to allocate funds from the Budget, 2026 to complete the construction of the hostel in 2026. Also, there is a long-standing problem about recruitment to this Institute in Kilinochchi. That also, we are addressing, and we have, currently, submitted the required cadre to the committee that looks into recruitment. We hope to get a favorable response from it soon and to recruit the cadre that is necessary to keep this institution going and to ensure that the services offered are appropriate.

04. So, as mentioned, we are fully aware that this Institute has the capacity to do much more than it is currently doing. There are problems with regard to physical infrastructure as well the human resources and we are taking several steps right now to address those. Hopefully, by next year, we would be able to get the Institute upgraded to the required standard. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Sivagnanam Shritharan) , - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member, you can ask a small clarification, not a detailed one.

( ) (The Hon. Sivagnanam Shritharan) Sir, one minute, please.

, ?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harini Amarasuriya) Hon. Speaker, we need to get clearance from the Department of Management Services also about new recruitments. We have made that request and that discussion is under way.

With regard to making it a separate, autonomous institution, I would like to say that the original plan was not only to set up an institute in Kilinochchi, but in other parts of the country as well. So, we need to look at whether each of these institutions are going to be made autonomous or whether they are going to be affiliated to the Ceylon German Technical Training Institute. And, there is an advantage as well as a disadvantage to this. Because the GTZ certification and the GTZ name are well recognized, there is an advantage of it being affiliated to the CGTTI. But, at the same time, if there are going to be other institutions also set up, then, it might be easier to run them as autonomous institutions. But, we do not want to just take an ad hoc decision on this because though this

was set up in Kilinochchi, there are lots of inadequacies, as the Hon. Member also pointed out. So, we want to make sure that whatever decision we take serves the interests of the students and also of that area adequately.

So, I cannot give an exact timeline on this because if we are to make them autonomous institutions, then, there is an amendment to the Act that has to be made. We are seeking the opinion of the Attorney-General on this. We are also having discussions and looking at both the advantages and the disadvantages, we will take the best decision and that decision has to be presented to the Cabinet also.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I am seeking a clarification under Standing Order No. 26(1), (2) and (3). Today, the Hon. Prime Minister presented a Note on Supplementary Allocations under Head No. 240 into relevant areas, which is permissible. But, there is something that has not been done here. Normally, under Head 240, the Suspense Account of the Ministry of Finance is used to move allocations around. But, you must give the total available for Capital Expenditure and the Recurrent Expenditure, the deduction and the final available total. Here, it is not given. You cannot move allocations from Capital Expenditure to Recurrent Expenditure, but from Recurrent Expenditure to Capital Expenditure, you can. But, the total is missing here. [ [ . [ [ . [ [ .

PRIVILEGE: STATEMENT MADE BY MINISTER OF

INDUSTRY AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP

DEVELOPMENT ON 22.05.2025

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramanathan Archchuna) Good morning! Thank you very much, Hon. Speaker, for granting me this opportunity to raise a matter of Privilege.

Sir, I raise this matter of Privilege calling for an impartial inquiry regarding statements made by the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti, Minister of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development. I submitted it to you, Sir, formally requesting to raise this matter of Parliamentary Privilege and for initiating an impartial inquiry into a serious incident that occurred during the Parliamentary Sitting held on 22nd May, 2025.

During his speech, the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti, Member of Parliament and Minister of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development made false, baseless and defamatory allegations against me. He claimed that I had requested that salt produced in the Northern Province, particularly from the Elephant Pass Saltern, be not transported to the Sinhala community. Furthermore, he alleged that I was promoting racism in connection with this issue of salt production.

1743 1744

I categorically and unequivocally deny those statements. I have never made such a request or propagated any from of racial sentiment regarding the matter. These allegations are entirely fabricated and malicious, intended to damage my reputation as a Representative of the Tamil minority and to incite communal disharmony.

The Hon. Sunil Handunnetti's actions constitute a clear breach of the Code of Conduct for Members of Parliament as well as a violation of the Standing Orders of Parliament. Moreover, by spreading false and defamatory statements under the protection of Parliamentary Privilege, he has violated the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act, misusing the platform of Parliament to tarnish the image of a fellow Member of Parliament.

Sir, I respectfully urge your office to: 1. Raise this issue as a matter of Privilege in the House at the earliest opportunity. 2. Institute an impartial inquiry into the conduct and statements made by the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti. 3. Take appropriate disciplinary action in accordance with the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act and the Standing Orders to uphold the dignity and integrity of Parliament.

This is not only an issue of personal defamation, but also a matter concerning the credibility of Parliamentary Proceedings and the trust the public places in our democratic institution. Such unfounded allegations cannot be allowed to set a precedent in the hallowed chambers of Parliament. I am available to provide further clarification or submit any required documentation, if necessary.

Thank you, Sir, for giving attention to this serious matter. I trust in your impartiality and commitment to uphold integrity of Parliament.

The second thing I wish to mention, Sir, is that I have raised another Privilege issue earlier. You told me that it will be forwarded to the Committee on Ethics and Privileges. That was regarding the Hon. Bimal Rathnayake, but that has not yet been forwarded to the Committee. Please forward that Privilege matter along with this to the Committee on Ethics and Privileges, Sir.

[2.48 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees, the Personal Data Protection (Amendment) Bill is of national importance. It was an Act that was passed with the intention of modernizing the legal framework for privacy and data governance, aligning Sri Lanka with global best practices, particularly with the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation. It was a forward-looking step. This was brought in 2022. But, for three years, this Act has been dormant and the core enforcement mechanism, which is the Data Protection Authority, is yet to be established.

If you look at it, basically, personal data protection is crucial for individual privacy, as it safeguards against unauthorized access, misuse and disclosure of personal information. Currently, the question that we have to raise is whether that safeguard is available in Sri Lanka under the prevailing Act, whether the Amendment Bill that the NPP Government has brought in deals with these issues and whether individual privacy is being safeguarded. That is the crucial thing.

The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Privacy, in a 2024 report said, I quote:

Data subjects find themselves in a position of defencelessness owing to their limited knowledge of the use that third parties make of information concerning them, since in practice they are unable to follow up on or monitor this use. This has repercussions for their ability to control their data - the essence of the fundamental right to personal data protection.

[ [[ [ . Now, the issue is whether your Amendment deals with that part.

This year, in April, 2025, there was a data breach in Sri Lanka; there was a cyber-security breach reported in the Cargills Bank in Sri Lanka. Hackers got through to the system, there was a cyber-security breach and the hackers posted thousands of files - accounts of the Bank, personal data of accountholders, directors, the staff et cetera. That happened once in India also and the Indian High Court took action to ensure that data the was protected. But, in Sri Lanka, what happened? Cargills Bank reportedly informed about the unauthorized entry to their system through the Colombo Stock Exchange because they are listed in the stock market; they went through the Stock Exchange and reported it to them. But, no action was taken to inform the data subjects, that is, their customers, whose accounts were breached and their data became public knowledge and has been shared. The accountholders, the public, whose personal information was released were not informed of what had happened, what security arrangements they should take and what were the losses that would have been caused to them. So, does this Act take consideration of breaches like that? That is the key thing because it is our data, it will be mine, yours and that of all of us. It is our data that will be

used there and in the future, there will be other governments, other people who will be looking at our data.

In 2022, when this statute was brought in to Parliament, I think under the Gotabaya Rajapaksa Government, there was a little attention paid because there was chaos in the country: there was the COVID-19 pandemic, there was bankruptcy and people were more worried about inflation, food and petroleum. So, they did not really look at this. Though there was a petition filed by the Young Journalists Association, the Supreme Court, on a mere technical fault, did not take it up. This tension or confrontation between the States right to information - we believe that the State has a right to information - and individual data privacy must be handled with sensitivity and care because we need to preserve the democratic individual civic rights of the people. Otherwise, there would be a dictator regime, which would come and misuse this data. Therefore, this Act has to address these things. That is why when this Act was brought in during the Gotabaya Rajapaksa Government, we got up and said that there had to be amendments. And, we believed that the NPP, which is supposed to be a peoples Government, would be sensitive to the peoples rights. But, I do not see that in the Amendment. That is the issue.

The shortcomings of the Personal Data Protection Act were described very well by a young researcher, Nida Admani, in the "DailyFT" yesterday. She says, I quote:

"A critical shortcoming of the PDPA therefore is the lack of clarity and resultant inaccessibility by the average citizen to fully comprehend the rights and remedies available under the Act. The power imbalance heavily favours data controllers and processors; citizens are largely unaware of how their data is being used,...."

So, that leaves people vulnerable. Data usage can infringe on ethnicity, religion, race and on a lot of things and data can also be misused. In the European Union and in the United Kingdom, they classify special categories of data which could cause significant risk to individuals fundamental rights. Madam, this Bill is of a national importance, but there are glaring deficiencies in the framework and the Governments Amendment does not get close to even addressing them. This is shocking to come from the JVP because when you all - when the Hon. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the Hon. Vijitha Herath and the Hon. (Dr.) Harini Amarasuriya - were seated in the Opposition, you vehemently condemned the original Bill saying that there should be certain amendments. Here is the opportunity now to bring those amendments, but you all have not incorporated those in it.

If you take the Personal Data Protection Act, to the Data Protection Authority, you would appoint technocrats, business leaders and industry representatives because they all deal with data and have to be special and ingenious with that knowledge. But, what about the appointment of a human rights lawyer, an independent person and a civil society specialist to this Authority? All those appointments would be political appointments. At that time, when we were in the Opposition, we made an

1799 1800

appeal, a request and a demand - we still take up that position - that the Data Protection Authority must be appointed through the Constitutional Council because that will ensure its independence. Otherwise, if you just make these political appointments, if the President is going to appoint this Authority, then, where is the safeguard for privacy of the citizens of this country? I cannot see how the JVP can change that position because that is not something we can understand.

Secondly, Madam, this Act grants broad exemptions to the public sector. The public sector or the public entities, in the name of national security, could use, misuse, collect or abuse data. For example, if it is the national health sector, if there is some very sensitive private information they have collected about people and if there is a breach and that data gets out, it could harm the dignity of a lot of people and affect their private lives, which is not fair. But, public entities can go without answering any of those questions. For example, the Ministry of Defence. Even in the Ministry of Defence, if there is a breach, then it must be subject to certain rules and regulations. If they make a breach, they should disclose that to the public so that the public is aware that something like that had happened. But, the Act does not address that.

So, if we are committed to protecting privacy, then the Government must be subject to the same standards that the private sector is subject to or if not, to a higher standard.

Next, the Act falls short in empowering certain categories. It does not grant a right to erasure, data portability or the right to challenge decisions made by algorithms. In todays AI-driven world, these omissions could be more than technical; they could become political. But, the Act that you have brought in does not address those issues.

On the other side, in this Act, there is no tribunal or a civil appeal system to enforce or have a mechanism to make sure that the citizens are safeguarded. The citizens must rely solely on the Data Protection Authority. The Data Protection Authority is not appointed by the Constitutional Council; it is not independent and it was appointed by the Government at that time. This Government might be in power this year; next year, there might be another government. Then, the other government that would come, which I think will happen, might use it in a different way. But, if you have an independent Authority, there would not be an issue whichever government comes into power. On a day the JVP sits in the Opposition, you all will talk another language. But, we believe in talking the same language whether we sit on the Opposition benches or Government benches because what is right is right; you cannot change that.

Therefore, Madam, we think that this Amendment has to encompass certain changes. We propose that there must

be Parliamentary oversight. We believe that there must be an amendment to the exemption clause to include judicial or Parliamentary oversight on government access to personal data, to establish a Data Protection Tribunal to handle complaints and appeals, for the Data Protection Authority to be appointed through the Constitutional Council to ensure its independence and to include in its representation, legal and civil rights specialists.
