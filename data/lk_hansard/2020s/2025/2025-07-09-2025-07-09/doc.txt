( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Shanakiyan Rasamanickam, you move your Adjournment Motion now. Then, you can speak.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Sir, before I move the Adjournment Motion, I want a clarification. Now, we are going to debate a very controversial matter, which is the Easter Sunday attack.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) So, shall we start the Debate, Hon. Member?

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Sir, please hear me out. Before I move this Motion, I need an assurance from you that we would be protected under the Parliament (Powers and Privilege) Act because this is a very controversial Debate. If you all are unable even to let a Member raise a matter of Privilege on what he had to undergo over something he had mentioned in Parliament, within this House, you are setting a wrong precedent. In some way, we are being threatened saying, Look, whatever you raise will be questioned. So, could you give us the assurance that we would be protected under the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act after speaking on this matter? Will you give us that assurance as the Deputy Speaker? I want an assurance because in what I say, there might be a lot of controversial things.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Shanakiyan Rasamanickam, I have taken note of that and it will also be recorded in Hansard. Shall we start the Debate now?

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Sir, first, will you give an assurance that our Parliamentary Privileges would be protected? That is all I am asking.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Parliamentary Privileges themselves assure your concern.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) So, my Privileges would be protected and I would not be summoned to the CID to question on this, is it?

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) According to the Standing Orders of the House, it is assured.

Hon. Shanakiyan Rasamanickam, would you move your Adjournment Motion now?

EASTER SUNDAY ATTACK ON 21.04.2019

[12.05 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I move the following Adjournment Motion:

It has been 6 years, 2 months, and 18 days since the Easter Sunday terrorist attack had taken place as of today, July 9, 2025, when this Debate is taking place. The current Government received the peoples mandate not merely to investigate corruption and fraud.

Among the main promises given to the people in the Election Manifesto A Thriving Nation, a Beautiful Life of the National Peoples Power was the commitment to ensure justice for human rights violations, including immediately revealing the truth about the Easter attack.

The Government has failed to ensure justice for the massive human rights violations that occurred from the Easter attack to the recent mass murders revealed through the Chemmani mass grave. The Government has also avoided its responsibility as a government in this regard. By now, several reports have been submitted, including the Presidential Commission Report on the Easter Attack, the Malalgoda Report and the investigation report on the programme broadcast on "Channel 4". None of these reports have been presented to Parliament so far. Additionally, although the Government promised to implement the recommendations of the Presidential Commission Report on the Easter attack, this promise has not been fulfilled to date.

The National People's Power must clarify to this august Assembly why it has failed to fulfil the pledges and promises given to the international community, His Eminence Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith and the victims of the Easter attack. Therefore, I expect answers from the Government to the following questions that have arisen and remain unanswered regarding the Easter attack:

1. According to a statement made by His Excellency the President

Anura Kumara Dissanayake, which appeared in an article published in 'Economy Next' magazine on February 12, 2021, the Presidential Commission Report on the Easter Attacks should be immediately presented to Parliament. "

That was stated in his statement, as reported in the "Economy Next" article of 12th of February, 2021.

"Although four years have passed since this proposal of His Excellency the President, why has this report not been presented to this House yet?

2. Did the Attorney-General's Department intervene to grant bail

to Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pillayan, who was identified by the Minister of Public Security as the mastermind of the Easter Sunday attack in this august Assembly? Was this prevented due to the objections of the Criminal Investigation Department?

3. How many DNA reports of Sara Jasmine were submitted? Will

you specify the dates on which these reports were submitted, separately? Do institutions in our country possess the necessary facilities to conduct such DNA testing again?

251 252

4. Is there a confirmed report regarding the disappearance of a

firearm revealed during investigations related to this attack, its recovery and whether the recovered firearm was the same firearm that disappeared previously? Will you inform this House about who made this confirmation?

5. Through this Motion, I propose to this House that a special

prosecutor's office with international assistance be established to conduct these investigations independently, in order to ensure justice for all parties who were victims of the Easter attack, which remains an unresolved issue, and to provide necessary measures to ensure national security."

Sir, this Motion is moved two days after the President had gone on record to say that it is difficult for the Government to investigate the Government. At His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith's 50th Anniversary of being in service to the Catholic Church, the President himself had gone on record to say that the Government finds it difficult to investigate the Government. So, it is in that background that I am moving this Motion.

I would like to start with some historical evidence on this matter, Sir.

. Not just with regard to this case - the Easter Sunday attack is only one incident - but there are many other crimes on which we are pursuing for justice and accountability. For justice and reconciliation to take place, accountability and finding out the truth are absolutely important. But, why is the Government not moving on with certain cases when it could? As you know, Asad Moulana has given a full statement to the UN. When the UN High Commissioner visited, why were you not able to speak to him and obtain that full statement? Now that the law had been amended by the Hon. Minister of Justice and National Integration, where statements given by witnesses on a case overseas could be taken up here, why are we not trying to record his statement from wherever he is at the moment? . amend UN High Commissioner . ?

Winding up, I would like to say that these are concerns that have come up in the past as well. The Easter Sunday attack is a six-year-old matter. But, we are also still struggling to find justice for crimes that were committed, maybe, in the '90s. The matter of the Chemmani mass graves is another example. By moving on that matter, you can prove to the people of this country that your Government is serious on accountability and reconciliation. Human skeletons have been unearthed at the Chemmani mass graves based on a statement made by a convict of the murder of Krishanthi Kumaraswamy; based on that convicts statement is how those mass graves are now being exhumed. Sir, in 1998 or 1999, 15 skeletons were exhumed. What we heard last about those skeletons was that they are kept in Glasgow in Scotland; that is what we heard last, that those exhumed skeletons were taken to Glasgow. So, it is very clear that this Government does not have the technical expertise to pursue investigations on the skeletons that are being exhumed in Jaffna at the moment. The case that was filed on the skeletons of those 15 people in 1998/1999 is still pending in Colombo! That case was initially started in Jaffna. Then, it was cited that there was no safety in travelling to Jaffna and it was later moved to Anuradhapura. That case, Hon. Minister of Justice, is still pending in the Colombo Court. So, why do we not restart that case? Those skeletons that were identified in 1998/1999 were found in a place adjacent to where the excavations are happening right now. The 15 skeletons are now in Glasgow. I saw a statement by the -

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, could you please wind up? Your time is up.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) I am winding up, Sir. Please give me one more minute.

Sir, I would like to read a statement made by Uma Kumaran, MP in the British Parliament, which she has also published on her "X" account. There, she has tagged the Foreign Secretary of the British Parliament. In her statement, she states, I quote:

"In today's @CommonsForeign , I asked the Foreign Secretary what steps the UK is taking to ensure accountability and about referral to the ICC.

I very much welcome his confirmation that hes happy to look at what further technical expertise the UK can provide."

That is about the mass graves in Chemmani and she has said that in the British Parliament. I also table* the letter she has sent to the Foreign Secretary as well.

So, what I say, Sir, is that to have meaningful reconciliation in this country, accountability is the key. Let it be the Easter Sunday attack, the Chemmani mass graves or the other mass graves that were found in Kokkuthoduvai and even in Matale or let it be the murders of Krishanthi, Premini, Vijitha in Batticaloa or the murder of Rifaya in Batticaloa, but accountability is the key. So, Sir, this is a good opportunity. The President has also said that it is difficult for the Government to investigate the government. We all know that. The deep state's involvement, any government would struggle to investigate.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you have far exceeded your time. Please wind up.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) I am winding up, Sir.

Therefore, what I am suggesting to this House is that we must start a special prosecutors office with international involvement so that people would come forward to give evidence.

Then, there will be trust in it. I am sure this is what the Catholic Church would also tell you, if you would really ask them because unless there is an international investigation on this matter, we would never find justice. Justice would not be served, if we do not have an international mechanism. Therefore, the Government

must immediately take action to start an international investigation, not only on the Easter Sunday attack, but also on all the atrocities committed against the people of Sri Lanka.

. The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam in his Motion states, I quote:

"5. I propose to this House that a special prosecutors office with international assistance be established to conduct these investigations independently, in order to ensure justice for all parties..."

. ? ? . ?

Without the political will to catch the crooks or those who did wrong, no commission or investigation is going to work. That is why, under the NPP Government, this is going to work. We will catch the culprits; we will bring closure to this case and bring justice to the victims of the Easter Sunday attack. It will be done. In fact, Hon. Minister Ananda Wijepala explained very well, step by step, all the things we have done.

Sir, this proposal in the Motion of the Hon. Member has some legal obstacles because he is suggesting a special prosecutors office with international assistance and that prosecutor is supposed to do the investigations independently. That is what the Motion states. Sir, we live in an adversarial system. In an inquisitorial system like in France and Germany, the investigator prosecutes. But, in an adversarial system, it is different - I am sure the Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam would recognize that - where, basically, the judge is a neutral referee. The prosecution would produce the case; the defence would put forward their version and the final determination would be given. Therefore, the proposal in No. 5 of the Motion itself is highly flawed because you cannot do it, not in Sri Lanka, anyway.

. because there is a perceived conflict of interest with regard to the Attorney-Generals Department, as it serves as the adviser to the Government. But, it is only a perceived conflict; we are not saying there is a conflict. However, . prosecutions . " . ; . .

Once and for all, we need closure to these cases. I know that not a single person would ever be able to forget their victimed loved ones. I know that, but peace is important. Sir, let me quote from Matthew 5:9.

Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.

Peace is what we want and if there is racist politics or politics with religious hatred taking place, we will never have peace. And, we are children of God, Sir.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I want to clarify something.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Rasamanickam, you can clarify.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) . . - [ ] Of course.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Since you moved this Motion, Hon. Member, I believe your name would be mentioned. I will give you 30 seconds. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, I will give you 30 seconds. Would you please say what you want to say?

277 278

[ ]

2025 09

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Sir, you cannot give me just 30 seconds when the Minister mentioned my name three times and questioned the basis of the Motion I have moved. You have to give me more time. Otherwise, he would be misleading the public. So, you cannot give me just 30 seconds!

Sir, let me clarify this. Hon. Minister of Justice, within the law of Sri Lanka, there are ways to form a system for an international investigation to take place. If you read the OMP Act which was passed, you would see that it does not prohibit that and there is space to do that. At the same time, when the Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe was in the Opposition, he brought in a Private Members' Bill, which was never passed. But, it went before the Supreme Court. That Bill states that when a judge is removed, foreign observers or foreign judges must get involved to investigate, whether the judge who had been removed is correct or not. And, the Supreme Court had given a clear judgment, saying that it was not unconstitutional, that they could go ahead with it. So, maybe, your knowledge about the law, your field, is not enough. I think you should speak to a few Presidents Counsels and get some advice before you make such statements in this House. So, you are questioning the basis of my Motion without having correct information. There is enough room within the legal framework of Sri Lanka to have international participation. So, if you do not know facts, do not say that. Then, I have not confused myself over having an independent Public Prosecutor's Office.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Let us have the next speaker, please. ( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) I am talking about a Special Prosecutors Office on human rights violations. You yourself have said that the Attorney-Generals Department is overworked and that it is highly criticized.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Okay, Hon. Member, you made your point clear.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) So, how can the State investigate the State when it is the State who has committed the crimes? Both of you, either the Minister of Public Security or the Minister of Justice, did not say anything about the Chemmani mass graves that I have mentioned in my Motion. So, both of you have run away from some parts of the Motion.

Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees, the Motion that has been brought in by the Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam at the time of the Adjournment states that the Government has failed to ensure justice for human rights violations, including by not revealing the truth about the Easter Sunday attack immediately. But, our Government is committed to revealing the truth and I must also mention here that, as a

283 284

responsible Government, we always want to ensure justice for human rights violations, especially to immediately reveal the truth about the Easter Sunday attack. Also, I must tell this august House that our Government has never avoided responding to such issues although this has been brought in as an Adjournment Motion, because it is the responsibility of the Government. Therefore, we have taken the fullest responsibility to reveal the truth and to ensure justice for the people who had been victimized.

The Report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry, which was appointed by the previous Government, had been handed over to the CID to expedite the process of an independent investigation. So, there is no influence or any interference, which had been a bad practice of the politicians of the previous regimes or governments, from the side of the current Government or the political authority. I must very clearly mention here that we have not failed in such matters or deliberately avoided such things. Now, see how the law is dealing with the previously responsible corrupt politicians and government officials and the mass scale corruptions that had taken place in the past, which led the country to collapse economically. So, the Government will definitely ensure that an independent legal process is brought about in this country for the people.

Madam, if we take all the points I mentioned earlier, they are very strategic and nationally valued points. With a keen, independent and efficient investigation process reintroduced by the Government involving State investigation units and legal processes, there is no need to have a special prosecuting office established with international assistance to conduct these investigations independently. We have the fullest potential to handle this; our legal system has the fullest potential. Our intelligence community, services and contingent units have the fullest potential, capability, knowledge, intellectuality and capacity to handle this; we have all that. Therefore, there is no need to bring in or integrate international assistance into our legal system since all that is needed has been arranged by the Minister of Justice and National Integration.

[4.23 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, there is a very important maxim in the legal jurisprudence which says that justice must not only be done, but it must be seen to be done. That maxim, I wish to start my speech with because when

331 332

the Hon. Leader of the House Bimal Rathnayake was speaking, he explained the backdrop to the Easter Sunday attacks, the political motivations behind the Easter Sunday attacks, as quite simply a setup, an incident orchestrated by the Rajapaksas, who had had lost the elections, through their agents within the Government, using the influence they had in order to create a fear psychosis within the country and to show that there is a huge vacuum when it comes to security and that it is only the Rajapaksas and in particular, someone like Gotabaya Rajapaksa who can, in fact, ensure that security and that that was the plan which was orchestrated and culminated in the Easter Sunday attacks. That is correct; I agree. So, he inadvertently accepts that the political influence of a Government that had been defeated in 2015 was still sufficiently influential within the State structure even four years after their defeat to create an incident such as this to come back to power.

Now, I am asking, Hon. Presiding Member, whether any reasonable person who genuinely wants justice not only be done, but wants it seen to be done could think that a State structure which has been so influenced by the power of 20 years - not just for the 10 years that the Rajapaksas were in power starting from 2006, but they were in very high office even for another ten years before that since 1994 - could be got rid of within just six or seven months since your coming to power? Is that possible? Who are you fooling? So, the reality, Sir, is this. Under these circumstances, when the State itself is the accused party to a particular crime and when segments of the State were so corrupted and so influenced politically, the accusation that you all are making with regard to the Easter Sunday attacks is that the Rajapaksas are the accused party. But for 76 years since 1948, we all know that there has been political influence in this country. The institutions of governance have never been independent; there has always been political influence. The politicians controlled the State. That is why we are a failed State today; that is why we are looked upon as a pariah State. Even the people have begun to realize that and they wanted a change because they hit rock bottom with the economic crisis. So, that is the reality that we are dealing with, Sir. If that is the reality and if this Government thinks that by keeping the same basic State structure, they could find justice, they are in a dreaming world. That State structure would never allow the actual culprits behind this heinous crime to be brought to justice. So, justice would not be done, Sir; forget about justice being seen to be done, it would not be done. You all would ultimately, if at all, catch the small fries, the guinea pigs.

Sir, this, I am saying because I agree that on a crime where the State structure is an accused party, where the State is seen as an accomplice or its complicity is the biggest accusation that is being made, the State cannot investigate itself through an internal investigation. It goes against the very nature, the very core principle of natural justice. How can an accused party investigate itself?

That is why, Sir, whilst the fifth point of the Motion talks of an independent Prosecutors Office that has

international assistance, I have disagreed with that. My view is that on a crime such as the Easter Sunday attack, where the State is an accused party, the investigation must be international in character. You do not have power over that State structure. The Minister of Justice and National Integration, because his name was registered in Parliament as "Dr.", that he had got a PhD, had to go to the CID to make a complaint because he suspected that there was sabotage. That is how deep the political influence has been. We all know that. So, under those circumstances, Sir, mark my words, if you all want genuine justice, you would never get it. You would never get it because you do not have the control of the State in an independent manner. That is the truth.

Then, look at the circumstances of the Chemmani mass graves; look at the position of the Tamils. You all supported the war being party to the Chandrika Kumaratunga Government, which is the accused party to the Chemmani mass graves. The Chemmani mass graves came out for the first time sometime in 1996 or 1997. Then, the investigations brought out only 15 bodies. Despite the fact that an accused person in the Krishanthi Kumaraswamy case - I know this because my father was the lawyer who looked after the interests of the Kumaraswamy family - saying in his dock statement that there were over 500 to 600 bodies buried in mass graves in the Chemmani area, only 15 were discovered! And, the Chemmani mass graves that are being currently discovered are just a few metres from the original site. But, the then Government or the State, the accused party, did not even bother, despite the fact that there is an accused person who gave details of those sites, to look at just about 100 yards away from the origianal site, which is where the present mass graves have been discovered. So, that is what happens when the State itself is the accused party. This is not a Tamil, Sinhala or a Muslim matter. The question is whether you want legitimacy to crimes that had happened and legitimacy with regard investigations to ensure that the victims feel that they have got justice.

So, Sir, an international investigation would be needed into crimes where the accused party is the State itself that even you all have no control over, even if you are genuine like in the case of the Easter Sunday attacks. I can tell you definitely or most certainly that you all are not genuine with regard to the Chemmani mass graves because you all were accomplices; you all wanted the war and supported the war. Your President has said that there would never be a prosecution with regard to those war crimes, only merely a Truth Commission. So, if you want to put right this State, which is broken, then you must do it in a proper way that the victims feel certain that they, at least, have a Government which is listening to them for once and is on their side.

Sir, I just want to say one more thing since the Hon. Minister is here.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I will take only one minute, Sir.

On the 23rd of October, 2024, one Mohamed Suhail Mohamed Rifai was arrested - now it has been nine months - and he is still in detention under the PTA. This Mohamed Suhail Mohamed Rifai is from Mawanella and he was a student who was undergoing an airline cabin crew course in Colombo. He was arrested by the Dehiwala Police when he had gone to rent a room, where they had asked for his NIC and he did not have it with him. He was produced in court on the 25th of October, 2024. Then, his father produced his National Identity Card and he was released. When he was released, he immediately went to Mawanella. Then, in the night, the Dehiwala Police had gone to Mawanella and arrested him again.

This time, they have made charges saying that in his phone, there was some post supportive of the Palestinians and against the Israelis. That post, Sir, is now before court; it is in the B Report. And, what is it? It is an emoji; it is an emoji of an Israeli flag and a person with a sword pointing at the flag or let us say, pricking the flag. How can that be a reason to be arrested under the PTA and being kept for nine months, Hon. Minister? Nine months! Is that reasonable? It is ridiculous!

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Okay, Sir.

Number one, that is free speech. How can that be an offence under the PTA, for Gods sake? I am telling you, these are the things that make people, the ordinary, innocent people, express so distastefully and be so prejudiced against the State structure when it comes to their civic rights because this is how they are treated. Sir, I totally agree that the Ministry should not get involved in cases, but this is absurd! Your reason for allowing the police to continue to use the PTA is that they would use it properly. On what grounds can you say that the PTA is used properly? For Gods sake, intervene and get these people released! It is completely unacceptable!

Thank you.
