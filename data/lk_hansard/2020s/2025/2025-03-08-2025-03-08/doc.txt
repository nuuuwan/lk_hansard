( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, - ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I appreciate your encouraging the particular Standing Orders to butt in when irrelevant points are raised. But, the matter raised just now is important, as the Hon. Prime Minister mentioned. I hope the same sense of leniency would be maintained because that is the sense of vibrancy required in Parliament.

Sir, is it okay if I raise my Question under Standing Order No. 27(2)? I had to attend to a medical matter and got late just a few minutes. So, Sir, could I raise the Question? If I am allowed to raise it, I would greatly appreciate it.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Okay. The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake.

QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE

PROPOSED ABOLITION OF SIMPLIFIED VALUE ADDED TAX

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Sir. Again, I am sorry for being late since it was due to a medical matter that I had to attend to.

I would like to ask the following Question from the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development under Standing Order No. 27(2).

I wish to draw the attention of the Government to a matter of urgent public importance concerning the proposed abolition of the Simplified Value Added Tax -SVAT- system in September, 2025 without ensuring a guaranteed and efficient refund mechanism for exporters.

The Government has projected an export revenue target of US Dollars 19 billion. However, the removal of SVAT without a proper refund system could severely impact on cash flows, discourage exports and create financial uncertainty among exporters, including SMEs. The lack of a swift and transparent refund mechanism may lead to delays, increasing the cost of doing business and affecting the competitiveness of Sri Lankan exports in global markets.

Sri Lankan exporters have to compete in a region where all benefits are being given to the competing peer country companies with a very low cost of capital and no administrative hassles. Sir, I raise this is in light of President Trump adopting an anti-globalization approach. So, that is the reason why we have to look at it and help our companies to reach international state.

In light of all this, I seek a response from the Hon. Minister of Finance on the following:

1. What measures are being taken to ensure a timely and a guaranteed VAT refund system before abolishing SVAT?

2. Evasion of taxes must be eradicated at all cost. However, in order to achieve that, a feeling of equity and reasonableness must be demonstrated. When tax refunds have become a major "nightmare", do you think adopting this measure at this stage would be practical? This has been tried for the last seven years.

3. Has the Government consulted key stakeholders, including exporters, the chambers of commerce and the SME chambers on the practical challenges arising from this decision?

4. Given the Governments expectation of earning US Dollars 19 billion from exports, which is excellent and has to be done, how does it plan to mitigate the adverse effects of this policy change on exporters liquidity and competitiveness?

5. Will the Government consider postponing the abolishing of SVAT until an efficient refund mechanism is fully implemented and tested?

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) All right. Hon. Member, we will not make this a precedent in the future.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, let us move forward. And, the sense of vibrancy and openness you mentioned, we appreciate and must be maintained in the future as well. That is the Parliamentary spirit which should be there, whether it be the UK Parliament or the Indian Parliament.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) The Hon. (Dr.) Anil Jayantha to anwer the Question.

) ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Anil Jayantha - Minister of Labour and Deputy Minister of Economic Development) , .

. But, before answering it, we need to understand what SVAT and VAT are. First of all, I would like to mention that it is not a hasty decision to remove the SVAT system simply disregarding other things. In the meantime, before answering the Question, I would also like to draw your attention to the Budget Speech of 2017. In page page 85, the Finance Minister states, I quote:

"460. I propose to remove the SVAT scheme as it could hardly be called simple. It has become redundant with an efficient and smoothly operational technology driven VAT administration process brought about by the IRD...."

That is, the Inland Revenue Department.

".......automation system.

461. A refund mechanism at ports and airports will be introduced for foreigners..."

So, just pay attention to paragraph 460. paragraph , , smooth refund system IRD introduce . propose ... . . refund system . , , . . . , page number 135 Technical Note Value Added Tax Act , The SVAT system will be terminated" .

But, on the other hand, as you just highlighted, Hon. Member, the abolition of it could lead to cash flow and liquidity problems for exporters. So, we have taken all those things into consideration.

, capacity building. So, we have taken technical assistance from the IMF and other experts and training is being done. Also, we need technology. As of now, there are certain things to be fixed and incorporated into the technological platform. As a result, we have developed a plan. The detailed plan will be introduced by the end of June with a simulation. introduce simulation , refund system . . , .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I appreciate what you said because I was the prime Mover.

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Anil Jayantha) First, may I finish, Hon. Member? So, that is regarding the basic idea about the refund system.

Now, I move on to the interest rates raised in question number 6.

, 9 SVAT , about the estimated tax evasion that the Government is worried would be lost out per year. , inefficiencies . So, there can be leakages.

But, as of now, we are not planning the SVAT system or the refunding system by anticipating that this much of tax would be evaded because if we plan for the evasion first, what happens automatically is that the system would also drive to evade that. Then, that would be an implication. Therefore, our plan is to have zero avoidance, but we know that due to practical reasons, we may not be able to go for that. But, our planning is different.

Under a very efficient tax system and in a responsible society, it is the responsibility of everyone to pay the due taxes and if we just create an environment where everyone tries to evade or avoid taxation and the authorities have to try hard with the tools they have to catch those who evade, it would be a struggle and always, there would be leakages. We are not planning for such a situation, but for a vibrant, democratic and a transparent tax system. We know and understand that it would take time, Hon. Member. So, that is how we are planning to do it and, again, I would like to say that we are not going to abruptly do away with the SVAT system unless and until we ensure that the refund system works smoothly. For that, we are planning with the technology being brought up, without which we cannot do this. You know that the value-added tax system is more efficient compared to the turnover tax system, in which there is a cascading impact. So, to avoid that cascading impact and in order to implement the SVAT system vibrantly, we need to connect all the players into the system, but, as of now, they are not; only selected and registered players are there. But, gradually, we will move towards that until we implement a very extensive system. That is our idea and plan, and we are working with all the agencies.

I will highlight another point - stakeholder consultation. Not only the exporters and taxpayers, but we are having consultations with other stakeholders as well. , . , .

1585 1586

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, -

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Ravi Karunanayake?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Minister, I appreciate your very practical answer. That is what I am getting at. You quoted earlier what I had mentioned. We were all thinking that the prospective approach ASYCUDA would be introduced and that it would link up the 34 government institutions. But, Hon. Minister, the situation is that the officials do not work in the speed that you and I would like them to. That is the reason why I said that at that particular moment. That has been an attempt made for about seven or eight years. Tax evasion is there. I know that what you stated is a laudable step, but the point of sale approach that the President addressed in the Budget Speech is what you have got to take forward.

The other matter is, when you are competing in a region where there is an interest rate of 3 to 4 per cent, our competition basically has a 10 to 11 per cent cost of capital disadvantage.

Imposing an additional bureaucratic process would only deprive our exporters from competing under already difficult circumstances. So, it was a more proactive approach because being in the industry, I know for a fact that this is a herculean task. You set about providing answers correctly. And, let us get together and ensure that we put this system in place. But, if you adopt the point of sale approach tomorrow, you would have a quick refund system in place. I appreciate it. So, let us work together. As you quite rightly said, the SVAT would not be implemented until a firm, refund mechanism is in place. That is the answer required. But, to say September and IMF-mandated is not the answer. With all authority, I say that IMF is a way forward, but they cannot dictate terms. So, you decide on a policy and take it forward. That is the correct step, I would say without any hesitation. So, please ensure that it is done.

Sir, the other matter is, the Central Bank makes Monetary Policy, but they must follow Government policy as well. You expect Rs. 5 trillion to be your revenue. With an interest rate of 17 to 18 per cent, you would never be able to achieve the expected 5 per cent growth in the economy in the next ten months or by the end of the financial year.

So, it is in that spirit I raised this Question, being an exporter. Therefore, please ensure that you take a practical approach with regard to this issue, like the Answer you gave. So, I appreciate if the SVAT would be done away with, with only a guaranteed refund system in place.

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Anil Jayantha) Thank you very much, Hon. Member.

( ) (The Hon. Arjuna Sujeewa Senasinghe, Attorney-at-Law) Sir, I just want a clarification regarding a small point. So, may I be permitted -

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Could you please wait till the Hon. (Dr.) Anil Jayantha reply?

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Anil Jayantha) Shall I first finish this clarification? Otherwise, my point would be lost.

In fact, Hon. Karunanayake, I would like to mention that it is not a dictation from the IMF; we work in a collaborative way on a programme. When the programme is in place, actions are taken and benchmarks are set. So, September is a new structural benchmark and it does not mean that it is something that we have to do compulsorily. Regarding that particular benchmark also, they have very clearly stated that we have to establish a very good refund system and then only we can move forward. In any case, there may be situations, due to unforeseen or unavoidable reasons, where we would not are able to implement that. If that is the case, we have room to discuss and negotiate.

Just to point out one thing, yesterday, the Hon. President had a discussion on Zoom with the Managing Director of the IMF, Ms. Kristalina Georgieva. She also reaffirmed IMF's continued support to the efforts to revive Sri Lanka's economy, going beyond the IMF programme. So, that is that.

Then, regarding ASYCUDA, which you raised about, the point of sale approach and e-invoicing, I would like to say that we have to bring in technology to have a very good system for VAT refund and of course, to go for point of sale machines and e-invoicing. Initial discussions and work has already been done in this regard with consultation of all the stakeholders.

So, thank you very for your constructive ideas. We will work accordingly.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Arjuna Sujeewa Senasinghe, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Minister, I would like have a small clarification.

1587 1588

2025 08

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Deputy Minister, are you willing to respond to that?

( ) (The Hon. Arjuna Sujeewa Senasinghe, Attorney-at-Law) This is just a small clarification on the same matter. Hon. Deputy Minister, you said that a directive cannot be given by the Central Bank on interest rates and other decisions made by the banks. The Governor of the Central Bank also said that they cannot -

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Anil Jayantha) A directive cannot be given, but there are lacunas in the monitoring system. Of course, the Central Bank is authorized to direct the banks and the financial institutions. They are doing it. We know that this is not something that happens all of a sudden. This has been observed in the past or during the previous times as well. So, it is being monitored gradually, Hon. Member. You know that there is a time lag involved. When these statutory rates and the policy rates are announced, the banks may not adjust accordingly. Of course, the State banks may adjust, but other banks may not. So, to some extent, the Central Bank can do that. On the other hand, we strongly believe that a proper market mechanism, demand for money, supply and the revival of economic activities would do the rest. So, it has to go parallelly or hand in hand, I believe.

( ) (The Hon. Arjuna Sujeewa Senasinghe, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Deputy Minister, the Central Bank Governor stated that they cannot give directives to the private or any other banks and that they can only guide them. So, what is the actual status of it? We would like to have a clarification whether you have the authority to direct the Central Bank, whether the Central Bank has independent powers to make its decisions and whether they can manoeuvre the other banks.

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Anil Jayantha) Actually, we need to get details from the Central Bank as to what measures they could take and tools they could use. Basically, they are supposed to monitor. But, if it is needed, sometimes, some directives may also be given to financial institutions like not to engage in certain activities. Specially, when it comes to interest rates, what the Central Bank does is, it closely monitors the specified policy rates. But, of course, we admit that there is a gap between the policy rates and the current interest rates. As

I just highlighted, parallel actions - the Central Bank's monitoring actions and the economic revival efforts - would resolve the problems. As of now, things are going very well. As I told you, the now normal yield curve is a very good indicator for investors to see how the economy is being driven. So, we need to maintain this particular price level and ensure stability of the financial system, in the long run. So, that is one of our objectives in economic revival.

Thank you.

, , . There is a view in the society that when a boy does something, people say, "Oh, boys are like that. Boys will always be boys. So, they are allowed to do things that girls are normally not allowed to do. Then, what happens is, boys grow up to

become men, and when they do, their naughty, childish behaviour becomes the norm. , .

, we have to be very focused on a gatekeeping mechanism for orphanages. The probation officer must have an opportunity to check into the reasons, as to why children are entered into orphanages because, now, due to poverty, without any supervision, parents admit them to orphanages. Remember, we consider institutionalization as the last option available because there is no family environment there. Therefore, I am requesting the Hon. Minister to focus on that.

We have to have a zero-tolerance policy on violence against children. We must establish resources for capacity-building and professional supervision. . Also, Hon. Minister, you might want to consider additional costs for transport of probation officers and for some victim support because without probation officers checking, supervising and working with those children, we would have difficulties in delivering justice to those children who are separated from their families.

Also, at every stage of institutionalization, there should be a process of gatekeeping and for gatekeeping, allocate some money if you can. Then, focus on reunification and consider alternative care policies because, I know, at the NCPA, there was a discussion to establish separate alternative care programmes.

Also, family-based care options must be looked into. Let us look into transforming some institutions into family care options, if possible. We have to spend money. . , , . Therefore, we have to have some allocation for mental health of adolescents, drug rehabilitation, for vocational training for convicted persons, to support those who are in these institutions and to get them out.

Also, we are going to amend the Children and Young Persons Ordinance, 1939. It is way outdated and I think the reform process has also been way too long. It is under my Ministry. So, I will make sure that it is expedited. .

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha. You have 17 minutes. [1.09 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha, PC) Hon. Chairman, I am thankful to you for giving me the opportunity to speak at the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs. Today is also the International Womens Day.

Sir, Sri Lanka has achieved a lot in relation to women. We had the first woman Head of State in the world. At present, our Prime Minister is a woman, our Chief Justice is a woman and we have the highest number of women representing Parliament compared to any other era. So, as regards to women, we have them in high offices. We also have a woman DIG. So, women are holding high offices all over. Even at the local government level, Sir, we have over 23 per cent women. The Provincial Councils Elections Act also provides for a 25 per cent quota for women. So, overall, Sri Lankan women are progressive; we have achieved a lot.

But, unfortunately, Hon. Minister, we have a male-chauvinistic society. We have a 52 per cent women population, but how many of our women are part of our workforce is a question. There is an issue which I would like to raise with regard to Muslim women in this country. As you are aware, the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act was brought about in 1951. The community has been agitating with regard to certain reforms. There have been various committees, various meetings. We, as Muslim politicians, also should be held responsible for not bringing in certain amendments that should have been brought in. Hon. Minister, you are aware of it. Also as you are aware, in terms of the general Marriage Registration Ordinance, the age of marriage is 18. The Muslims, as a community, are at a consensus that it should be 18. So, Hon. Minister, I do not think there is any impediment for you to bring in that reform and for exceptional circumstances, there should be a proviso. In addition, if you take the Muslim womens right to sign the marriage certificate or give consent, we should bring in

reform to provide for a Muslim woman, at the time of marriage, to sign the marriage certificate. That is an urgent reform needed and I do not think you need to wait any longer because there is a consensus among the community to do that.

Then, if you take our Quazi Court system, that is where our divorces are adjudicated while other divorces are adjudicated in the District Court. We need the Quazi Court system because it deals with a personal law to us, but it needs to be strengthened. We need to bring in an amendment under which women are entitled to be members or judges of the Quazi Court. That is also an urgent reform. Further, District Court lawyers, who are adjudicating, become judges. We also need to have persons of competence to be appointed to Quazi Courts. So, consider appointing judges to the Quazi Court also. Their salaries and the facilities should be attractive, if you are to bring about that change. So, as regards the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act, urgent reforms are needed and I hope you would consider bringing them in as soon as possible.

In addition, if you take maintenance, it is adjudicated in the Magistrates Court. But, if a Muslim woman wants to get maintenance, she first has to go to the Quazi Court, get an order and then get it enforced by the Magistrates Court. So, I would suggest that you make provision for a direct mechanism, through which a Muslim woman also can go direct to the Magistrates Court and seek maintenance.

Hon. Minister, with regard to the Judiciary, I have to bring up an issue, which does not come under your Ministerial Consultative Committee, but is a matter of national importance.

At present, in relation to the appointment of Judges from the High Court to the Court of Appeal, there are three institutions involved. That is, the President, the Chief Justice and the Constitutional Council. Even though there is no constitutional process for recommending judges' names to the Constitutional Council, the President, by convention, consults the Chief Justice on the basis that the Chief Justice is the Head of the Judiciary. Unfortunately, in Sri Lanka, when a person's appointment or a promotion is due, we have a petition culture, not only in the Judiciary, but everywhere. If anybody is to get a promotion, there would always be a petition trying to prevent his promotion, which results in the person who is entitled to the promotion by virtue of seniority being overlooked on the basis that an inquiry has been initiated on a petition. So, that results in, on certain occasions, the persons who are entitled to promotions being overlooked on the basis of an inquiry. Some frivolous petitions have been lodged purely to deprive the promotions. Consequent to the names being sent to the Constitutional Council, deliberations are being held only with regard to the suitability of the names that have been sent and they do not touch upon the names of the seniormost judges who have been overlooked. The deliberations do not provide for a mechanism where a judge entitled to a promotion by way of seniority and against whom a purported complaint has been made is granted an

1629 1630

opportunity to provide a repudiation or an explanation as regards to the complaint. As you know, there are legitimate expectations with regard to everybody, but when it comes to judges, we do not have that. And also, when a seniormost judge is overlooked - they also have families - the society looks at them in a different way. So, there needs to be a collective process where a seniormost judge, who feels that his name has unjustly not been recommended, could place his grievance before the Chief Justice and the Constitutional Council and the merits and demerits of his grievance would be considered before depriving that seniormost judge the promotion. Sir, I wanted myself to be clear in this because this deals with the Judiciary.

Now, I come to what is under discussion today. Hon. Minister, something which I believe is important are day-care centres. If we are to get more women into our workforce, we need to improve the quality of the day-care centres for their children and also have more day-care centres within organizations. Even the private sector should be compelled to have such day-care centres. That is the only way of attracting more women to join the workforce. Also, when women work overseas, as housemaids or otherwise, there should be a mechanism to look after the welfare of their children by having day-care centres and by assuring that they are not deprived of preschool education.

Another important matter, Hon. Minister, is the estate wages. Today, an estate worker gets a daily wage of Rs. 1,350. Socially and economically, the most deprived in Sri Lanka are the estate workers. I think at the Wages Board, the last regime tried to increase it to Rs. 2,000. Members of your party also were mebers of the Wages Board. I would urge you to speak to the Minister of Plantation and Community Infrastructure and the Minister of Labour and see that a wage of Rs. 2,000 is given to them because, always, you have estate owners milking profits and not giving the estate employee that Rs. 2,000 wage.

That is justly due. And, I believe that the estate women are the most affected. I started my politics from the Ceylon Workers Congress. Therefore, the estate worker is always a subject which I would touch upon.

Then, Hon. Minister, I would like to read from a report with regard to rape and domestic violence in this country. It states, "One of the greatest problems in the country is the gender-based violence against women, especially in the public transport system." So, that has also been raised in it. As per a UN survey conducted in 2013, the "Daily Mirror" Editorial of 05th of March 2025 reports, three out of five women are victims of domestic violence and a woman is raped every 90 minutes in our country! However, less than five per cent of the culprits are brought to book. We have a mechanism with regard to domestic violence; it is a very powerful tool. So, you could work with the police and have awareness programmes to bring the provisions of the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act into public domain. In terms of

the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act, if a woman is abused or threatened, she can go to the Magistrates Court and get a restraining order. But, unfortunately, women are not aware of it. It is a very simple mechanism, but a very powerful tool. You can get a restraining order to prevent the man who purports violence against his wife from even coming home. Therefore, please look at it because that is a very important aspect.

Then, let us look at women who go overseas for employment. Unfortunately, the majority of the women go as housemaids and they are unskilled workers or skilled at a lower level. We need to promote more skilled women leaving the country for employment overseas. When women go as housemaids, there is a grave social cost and that also should be looked into. We should try to discourage women who have young children from going overseas as housemaids by giving them income-earning opportunities in Sri Lanka and empowering them. I believe a lot of self-employment programmes have been initiated and thereby, a lot of women who thought they need to go abroad have opted otherwise, not to leave the country.

Another important issue that women in this country face is sexual harassment at workplace. We have a society where women are shy to go and complain that they are being sexually harassed by their bosses. So, sexual harassment takes place in Sri Lanka. You have a lot of people in power against whom there are cases of sexual harassments filed by employees. So, you should have a 24-hour call centre which deals with issue of sexual harassment. You must encourage women who are raped, sexually harassed or subject to domestic violence to bring the culprits to book. Unfortunately, they feel that there is a social stigma. A woman who is raped is scared to go and make a complaint to the police thinking that if she goes and makes a complaint, the society would look at her in a different way. Unfortunately, she is the victim. So, we need to educate the society also that these people should not be looked at in a different way. Unfortunately, when a woman is raped, she - the victim - has difficulty in finding a partner. So, this is a serious issue, which we really need to look at.

In addition, if you take children in this country, child abuse takes place at a greater rate, against which we need to bring in a mechanism. Generally, if you take schools, there are instances where teachers have sexually harassed children.

But, a child is not aware what sexually harassed means. So, they should include it in the school curriculum and every school should conduct programmes to explain children that if anybody sexually harasses them, the law would take care of them. In addition, in schools, there should be a mechanism where there is a special, dedicated person - either the principal or a special person assigned - to whom any child, who is sexually harassed by their school teacher or by any other teacher, could go and complain because sexual harassment of children is on the rise. So, that also has to be looked at very seriously.

In addition, if you look at opportunities given, the children in the North have suffered a great deal. They are victims of war. So, we need a special programme to empower them. You need to give more focus on widows and orphans, especially in the Northern Province. We need to address their problems because they have really suffered during that period. So, how do we empower them? I am sure we could get a lot of foreign aid for that and that Sri Lankan expats living abroad would also contribute immensely towards such a programme. So, if you could initiate a specific programme to empower those widows and children who have suffered in the North and accelerate that programme, it would be a great help socially because they really need upliftment.

Hon. Minister, you have been given a Ministry and a task - 52 per cent of women in this country look up to you - to change their economic and social standard. I believe you could give leadership to them and hope you would take cognizance of certain issues I raised with regard to children and empowering women.

Thank you, Hon. Chairman. ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Saroja Savithri Paulraj) , .
