what is most important for a country is the rule of law. The absence of the rule of law will make people go wild; they do not feel it. Look at 2022, the Aragalaya time. Yes, there were problems with power cuts and issues relating to gas and petrol. All that is true. But, what the people felt most was a deep sense of injustice, which is being caused to them.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, why are we obeying the law? It is not just because we fear the law, but because there is a morality behind the law. That is why we obey the law. People must obey the law. Sir, let me quote from Romans 2:13.

"For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified."

That is what God commands us. So, it is not those who hear the law, talk or rattle about the law, but the doers of the law who will be justified. Sir, we, the National Peoples Power are the doers. We are justified in the eyes of God and we will uphold the law in this country.

I thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Next, the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa. You have nine minutes.

Case files involving sensitive subjects were routinely delayed or buried. We were asked not to proceed on files unless approved through unofficial channels. There were clear political interests in suppressing some investigations, especially those linked to the 2022 protest events. The chain of command was frequently bypassed or manipulated.

0 0 ASP Waruni Bogahawatta statement 0 Internal pressure and suppression 0 I was specifically instructed through verbal communications from senior officers to refrain from pursuing legal action against politically affiliated individuals. When I questioned the legality of such instructions, I was warned about potential transfers. I stood my ground. I witnessed how certain investigations were stopped halfway or redirected under unofficial orders. It was a culture of fear 0

band after stripping him naked and ordering him to rub Siddhalepa on his genitalia. That is the allegation against this IGP. That is what is being ridiculed here, among all of us.

Therefore, I find the 5th Respondent to have tortured the Petitioner - 0 that while findings of fundamental rights violations are ample, the wrongdoers -especially the big fish in the pond - are seldom held duly accountable.
