( ) (The Hon. Chairman) The Hon. Rauff Hakeem. You have 14 minutes.

[12.04 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Chairman, today happens to be the final day of the Committee Stage Discussion of the Appropriation Bill and I am deeply conscious of the fact that we need to finally make our comments relating to the Budget perfor-mance of the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Econom-ic Development. But yet, since the horrible incidents that had taken place in Gaza over the last few days, I rise to-day wearing this shawl to invite the conscience of this House to look at the terrible incidents that are now un-folding in Gaza once again.

Sir, Israel has resumed military operations in Gaza after refusing to renew or renegotiate the ceasefire and that has led to significant humanitarian, social, political and legal concerns in the region. Already, over 500 Pales-tinians, including women and children, had died and it is

3453 3454

[ (] ]

2025 21

reported that casualties are rising day by day. The Pales-tinians in Gaza are in the midst of Ramadan like every Muslim around the world is. It is the month of patience, resilience, caring and sacrifice and deep spiritual reflec-tion for Muslims all over the world. Unconscionably, the hapless Palestinians are attacked even at a time when they are engaged in taking their pre-dawn meal to start the fast. However, the reality is that the area they are cramped in is under military siege, where food supplies and access to medical care and life-saving emergency health services have been completely cut off. Almost all the medical fa-cilities in Gaza are non-operational, worsening their health conditions. It was a result of continued bombings on hospitals and the killing of doctors and nurses, both now and earlier, before the ceasefire and over the last 15 months. Children and women are apparently clear targets of these highly abominable attacks and mass displace-ments of families are reported, exacerbated by genocidal conditions imposed on the Gazan population. Destruction of homes, hospitals, schools, universities and UN facili-ties continues to escalate. It adds further to the debris that the civilian infrastructures have been reduced to for the past 15 months, leaving civilians without basic necessi-ties.

Sir, the United Nations has condemned the airstrikes as violations of international law and demanded civilian protection. A few western countries and Saudi Arabia have urged for a ceasefire and have affirmed their com-mitment to jointly leading efforts to ensure that a two-State solution is vigorously pursued. Even the Arab League and the OIC have done the same. But, there is a catch here, Sir. For a two-State solution to be of any rele-vance at all, first and foremost, Israel should be denied legitimacy for its relentless campaign aimed to create facts on the ground. Sadly, it is on this point that some otherwise influential Arab countries, unfortunately, in-cluding the UAE and Turkey, need to do more beyond mere exhortations. Countries including Jordan, Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran have condemned Israeli attacks, labelling them as war crimes and urging an immediate ceasefire. Sir, it is absolutely shocking, how-ever, that the United States continues to back Israel de-spite global calls for restraint. President Trump got finan-cial and military assistance worth US Dollars 18 billion approved in an effort to enable Israel to finish its unfinished job. In a comment that outraged the con-science of humanity, he stated publicly that the United States would take over and develop Gaza as a Riviera of the Middle East. This drew in widest possible protest from the Arab and Islamic world and from other quarters as well.

Arab countries led by Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Qatar met in Egypt immediately following this statement to offer an alternative plan for reconstruction of Gaza and restoration of political authority, demonstrating their com-mitment to taking responsibility into their hands without the US involvement.

( ) (The Hon. Mano Ganesan) Anyway, Gaza is not for sale.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Exactly! Thank you for saying that. But, that is what they think. It is not up for sale. It is for grabbing land; not even to pay and take it, but they want to grab the land for themselves. Although in a subsequent remark President Trump was reported to have said, Nobody was asking the people of Gaza to leave, all signals coming from the US as well as Netanyahus brutal military onslaught indi-cate beyond any shadow of doubt that the US is making the people of Gaza hear a completely opposite message through the language of the US-empowered barrels, the Israeli genocidal guns and the airstrikes.

Sir, despite the US-Israeli thrust on a manipulative campaign to avoid developing countries from joining and condemning the outrageous violations of international law and laws of warfare, several countries have stood up to expose their genocidal war crimes. Bangladesh urged the UN to act immediately and protect the civilians. Bolivia and Belize severed diplomatic ties with Israel, citing hu-man rights violations. Chile and Columbia recalled am-bassadors, condemning the violence as disproportionate and illegal. Honduras condemned what it describes as genocide against Palestinians. Many Asian and African countries have taken similar or more courageous stands. South Africa, for instance, condemned Israeli military campaign and gross violations of human rights and hu-manitarian law, in no uncertain terms. It filed an applica-tion, argued seeking provisional measures and obtained orders from the International Court of Justice on the grounds that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza. The ICJ ordered Israel to take steps to prevent acts of genocide and facilitate humanitarian aid. Our biggest neighbour, India, seems, however, to have lost its moral voice, with allegations mounting that some citizens of that country are fighting alongside Israeli defence forces. Very unfortunate! The Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs of Singapore Vivian Balakrishnan, the counterpart of our Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs Vijitha Herath, stated recently in Parliament, Singapore supports the right of Palestinian people to a homeland of their own. We be-lieve that the only viable path for achieving a comprehen-sive, just and a durable solution to this long-standing con-flict is a negotiated two-State solution consistent with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.

Sir, the Israeli war on Gaza and its oppressive, inhu-man occupation of the Palestinian Territory including the West Bank and East Jerusalem have caused horrendous violations of human rights and humanitarian law. The failure to distinguish between civilians and combatants violates the Geneva Conventions. Civilian casualties and infrastructure destruction contravene proportionality prin-ciples. The blockade on essential supplies amounts to collective punishment, which is prohibited under interna-tional law. Strikes on hospitals, schools, and UN facilities breach legal protections for civilian infrastructure.

When we stood accused relating to the final phase of the war in Puthumathalan and Mullivaikkal, the entire international community was urged by western countries and many others, even our diaspora, to take action against us. Now, we also have to conscientiously stand up against

3455 3456

these attacks on Gaza. While the ICJ has determined that Israeli actions leading to most of these concerns are a direct violation of human rights and humanitarian law, the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant against Netanyahu on potential charges of war crimes.

Sir, these most abominable and most horrendous at-tacks on Gaza and the hapless Palestinians should stop immediately. It is important that Sri Lanka should join growing international call for an immediate ceasefire, to stop hostilities and to prioritize humanitarian aid. Sir, our country should also support the demand for accountability for violations of international humanitarian and human rights law by the Israelies. We are a nation that has given moral leadership to the cause of Palestine over decades. We should now cast off the recent months strategic stu-por, make our presence felt in the anti-colonial, anti-occupation camp of independent nations and demonstrate leadership to the international community, especially smaller nations, to amplify their voices and push for jus-tice and peace. There are increasing calls globally for arms embargoes and sanctions against Israel. Sri Lanka needs to watch developments carefully and should study what it could do to help achieve peace in the wider region through restoring our one-time globally acclaimed dis-armament and non-proliferation leadership.

So, as a responsible nation, it is prudent without fur-ther delay to do all that is possible to keep Palestine and its people from falling victim to Israeli strategic designs. We cannot be so gullible as to be made enemy of each other and to cause mayhem and chaos in this country just because there is love for Israeli money and their invest-ments in our land and on infrastructure.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should refocus its attention on the Israeli-Palestinian question and show initiative and leadership in addressing concerns with a view to warding off any future challenges to the country. The Ministry of Defence should dispassionately do an assessment of its national and international security inter-ests and concerns and get its priorities right. National rec-onciliation and unity can never be advanced by facilitat-ing or turning a blind eye to undue and coercive Israeli influence on Sri Lanka. It is all the more urgent that the Government issues a statement, clearly expressing its stand in relation to the brutally oppressive Israeli occupa-tion and the horrendous Israeli war on Gaza and the Pal-estine people as a whole.

Therefore, Sir, I urge that the Ministry of Foreign Af-fairs take note of this, come out of its slumber and issue a statement condemning what has happened in the Gaza Territory during the last few days, at least call for imme-diate restraint. We are keeping mum. What is the meaning of this? Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs must now speak up as many other countries have spoken up. This is why I thought I should make use of this opportunity to bring some pressure on the Government to take a bold stand now, decrying the actions of the Israelis in the Occupied Territories.

Thank you, Sir.
