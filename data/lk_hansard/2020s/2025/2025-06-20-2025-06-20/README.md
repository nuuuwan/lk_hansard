ADMINISTRATIVE FRAMEWORK AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF

INDEPENDENT COMMISSIONS

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Speaker, I wish to ask this Question under Standing Order No. 27(2) from the Hon. Prime Minister.

In terms of Article 41B of the Constitution of Sri Lanka, amended by the Twenty First and Twenty Second Amendments to the Constitution, the Constitutional Council is entrusted with the task of recommending of members to several independent Commissions. These Commissions play a vital role in safeguarding the integrity, transparency and accountability of public administration.

Based on publicly available information, the following 10 Commissions are currently considered independent or semi-independent.

1. Election Commission

2. Public Service Commission

3. National Police Commission

2849 2850

[ () ]

2025 20

4. Audit Service Commission

5. Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka

6. Commission to Investigate Allegations of

Bribery or Corruption - CIABOC

7. Finance Commission

8. Delimitation Commission

9. National Procurement Commission

10. Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka -

PUCSL- which is semi-independent.

While these Commissions derive their authority from the Constitution or enabling statutes, it appears that many of them function without publicly available or standardized Standard Operating Procedures - SOPs - governing internal operations such as recruitment, disciplinary processes, complaint management and public engagement. This has led to inconsistencies and an ad hoc policy framework in their administration.

In view of the above, I seek clarification from the Hon. Prime Minister as Minister in charge of Constitutional Affairs by raising the following questions:

1. Is the list of Commissions stated above accurate? If not, how many independent Commissions have been established under the Constitution of Sri Lanka, including those under Article 41B?

2. Have all these independent Commissions adopted Standard Operating Procedures - SOPs - or internal administrative guidelines to govern? Has it got approval from Parliament or is it only an internal policy?

3. If such Standard Operating Procedures have been adopted,

which Commissions have made them publicly

available?

what oversight mechanisms are in place to

ensure uniform implementation and transparency?

4. If Standard Operating Procedures - SOPs - have not been adopted,

what steps have been taken by the Government

or the Constitutional Council to develop and implement them?

What is the expected timeline for formalizing

such SOPs in each Commission?

5. Will the Government consider tabling the Standard Operating Procedures of each Commission in Parliament to ensure transparency, consistency in governance and public accountability?

At this particular moment, we wish to know the procedure for accountability, especially to whom these

Commissions are accountable in relation to the discharge of functions and the assignment of various persons to these Commissions. Is it to Parliament or to the President? How fair play takes place is yet to be known.

So, Sir, I expect the Hon. Prime Minister to give us an Answer as to how fair play and accountability is going to be upheld in these independent Commissions.

( ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake) 27(2) . .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Speaker, it does not matter since the Hon. Prime Minister is not present in the House. Is it okay, Sir, if I add one additional question to that since time would be taken to answer that Question? Then, that question could also be answered through that process?

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) No, that cannot be accommodated. ( ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake) To answer your Question, we have to consult all these ten Commissions. If you want to revise the Question, you have to submit it again.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Then, I will leave the Question as it is. Let the Hon. Prime Minister give the answer. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) 91() . [ .

that it is not only doing the right thing, but that the hope and the growth of the country have been restored. The numbers speak for itself. A 4.8 per cent growth has been reported for the first quarter. Sir, confidence among the business community has been restored; trust in the system has been restored. With the way the Government conducts its affairs, it has demonstrated to the public, the business community and the international community that there is consistency in the system, within the governance framework and in how the Government is implementing these activities. .

" [ - [" ; this is testimony of the delivery of some of the promises we gave under "A Thriving Nation - A Beautiful Life", Sir. There is not only policy consistency, but also - in 2022, three years back, we saw several protests going on in several places - in

2025, under the present Government, because we have restored confidence, we now have conferences in Sri Lanka discussing about cross-border listing. Sir, that is the level of confidence the international investors have in the Sri Lankan market after the Government has restored the system. I recently attended a South Asian conference organized by the Actuarial Association. It was attended by foreign participants as well. What does it mean? The Government has restored the confidence that the business community, the private sector wanted. It has been achieved not only through the mandate for zero tolerance for corruption, the digitization and efficiency improvement, which we are driving at, but also through collective effort of everyone.

Sir, we will dedicate more resources, engage more and more by the day to ensure that this mechanism is strengthened further to deliver what was promised and to create the system that everyone hope for. The Sri Lanka that we all dream of will be created.

Thank you very much, Sir, for the extra time granted as well.

EFFECTIVENESS, ACCOUNTABILITY AND LEGAL CLARITY

OF DECISIONS OF DISTRICT COORDINATING COMMITTEES

[5.00 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rajeevan Jeyachandramoorthy) Hon. Presiding Member, I move the following Adjournment Motion:

"I rise today to draw the attention of this House to a matter of significant concern regarding the effectiveness, accountability and legal clarity surrounding the decisions made by District Coordinating Committees (DCCs).

These committees serve as crucial forums where Members of Parliament, Provincial Governors and heads of relevant State institutions convene to deliberate on and decide matters critical to district-level development. Despite the importance of these committees, I have observed and received consistent complaints regarding several shortcomings that hinder their intended impact."

, . , . , , . , , . .

Sir, I brought in this Adjournment Motion before this House for a purpose. These DCC meetings have been held over a long period of time. As we are a peoples Government, we would like to expedite the development of our country district-wise and region-wise.

Sir, I would like to mention the key issues pertaining to the implementation of the decisions of these DCCs. The Motion goes on to state, I quote:

"The key issues are as follows:

1. Lack of a Monitoring Mechanism

There is currently no formal or standardized system in place to monitor or evaluate implementation of DCC decisions."

, . .

"2. Failure of Implementation

Many decisions taken during DCC meetings are either inadequately implemented or, in some instances, entirely disregarded by relevant institutions, thereby undermining the very purpose of the committees."

DCC . , DCC meeting . .

The Motion goes on to state, I quote:

"3. Legal Ambiguity

There is ongoing concern among stakeholders about the legal authority of DCC decisions. This ambiguity limits accountability and the responsiveness of State agencies.

4. Stakeholder Complaints

I have received numerous complaints from public officials, local authorities and members of civil society regarding the lack of enforcement of DCC resolutions.

In light of these issues, I respectfully propose that this House consider the following recommendations:

Establish a National Monitoring Framework to systematically track the implementation of DCC decisions, with progress reports submitted periodically to Parliament.

Review the Legal Framework governing DCCs, and where necessary, introduce legislative amendments to clarify and strengthen the binding nature of DCC decisions.

Assign responsibility for oversight to the District Secretary or an independent oversight body, to ensure regular reporting and follow-up at the district level.

Empower Members of Parliament to request and receive quarterly reports on the implementation status of DCC decisions within their constituencies.

These steps are essential to enhance the operational effectiveness of DCCs and to ensure that development decisions made at the district level are implemented in a transparent and an accountable manner."

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . [ .
