5. What urgent reforms will be introduced to ensure fair market access for Sri Lankan solar providers and to prevent foreign-dominated procurement for capacities that local entrepreneurs can easily meet?

6. Why can the CEB and Government not lay down policy, whereby they involve international competitors for NCRE - that is, solar, wind, mini-hydro and bio gas - for projects bigger than 100 megawatts. This will help prevent dividends going out of Sri Lanka unnecessarily for smaller NCREs, if it is placed on foreign investors.

7. What is the situation on LNG? When will LNG be imported to Sri Lanka? Has tenders been called? If not, when will it start? New generation plants are being approved and constructed without LNG delivery being planned and there is no delivery for the next two years.

8. Is the CEB going to increase electricity prices owing to the IMF cost-reflective policy that was ratified by the Government of Sri Lanka and also owing to the fact that CEB rates were reduced two months ago? Would it be increased? If so, when and by how much?

[10.39 a.m.]

() ( ) ( () - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harshana Suriyapperuma - Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning) Hon. Speaker, the Items taken up for debate today had been published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 2421/30 dated 31st of December, 2025 and Gazette Extraordinary No. 2421/41 dated 31st January, 2025. There are several important things envisaged through these Gazettes. That is, in one angle, to ensure that the due process is followed and another is to provide the necessary support to carry on the development activities in line with the mandate we had been provided with. People have given their blessings for us to implement these development activities.

The first Item published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 2421/30 relates to the international airports that are currently operating in the country: the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport, the Bandaranaike International Airport, the Colombo International Airport, Ratmalana and the Jaffna International Airport. According to the technical clarification relating to the Gazette, Sir, all these international airports have been enjoying certain facilities until recently and those have got expired. If we take the details relating to those expirations, the facility relating to embarkation fee charged from the passengers through the

tickets expired in the month of December, 2024. The privileges and benefits provided to the passengers coming through the Bandaranaike International Airport and the Colombo International Airport, Ratmalana expired in the month of March, 2025, two months back. So, the benefit given through the embarkation fee expired. The same applies to the passengers who come all the way to the Jaffna International Airport, to the people flying to the Northern Province; that benefit also expired in the month of February this year.

It is considering the situation the country was going through and based on the request from the tourism sector to provide it with necessary support and impetus that we took this measure. As we all are aware, we have kept a major weightage on the tourism sector.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Minister, with your permission, I just want to make some clarifications. You mentioned the Bandarnaike International Airport.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harshana Suriyapperuma) Yes, that is Item No. (ii) of this Gazette Notification, Person leaving Sri Lanka by aircraft from Colombo.......

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) But, that is the Colombo International Airport, Ratmalana.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harshana Suriyapperuma) Sorry, it was my mistake. I will correct that.

1201 1202

2025 21

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, why do you not ensure that you extend the time after that? It will certainly bring in more passengers through, - [Interruption.]

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harshana Suriyapperuma) Hon. Member, your point is well taken. Thank you very much for your suggestion.

As I was explaining, the reason to extend these benefits already provided to the tourists and passengers who are using these airports is that the tourism sector, which has been battered in the past, requires uplifting. The implementation of construction projects of these airports were famous in the past, not with the upliftment of the tourism industry, but for other nefarious activities. This country was driven to bankruptcy as a result of these activities of politicians.

The country, as of now, does not have provision to collect the necessary fees in the event an airline does not pay the due fees. I will explain it further. The fee collected in this manner is charged through the airlines because that amount is added to the cost of the airline ticket. So, once passengers go through the process, the airlines are supposed to collect that fee and transfer to the relevant authorities. Accordingly, the Treasury should get the contribution. So, currently, there is a way to collect that fee, but, unfortunately, in the event an airline does not provide that money, there is no recourse or adequate provision to collect it. So, the present Governments intention is to make sure that those legal provisions are strengthened, allowing the Government to collect the due revenue.

Sir, the tourism sector goes beyond the fees collected at the airports or the amounts we collect from tourists. The level of employment that is, -

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Order, please!

Whereupon THE HON. SPEAKER left the Chair, and DEPUTY SPEAKER [THE HON. (DR.) RIZVIE SALIH] took the Chair.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harshana Suriyapperuma) Hon. Deputy Speaker, even though that fee is charged, it is not charged from children below five years of age. Also, for the airline crew and passengers who are on transit for less than 24 hours, this fee is not applicable.

The reason for this facilitation is to ensure that the tourism industry thrives, would be able to bring in revenue to the country and also to ensure that it would be able contribute, not only in terms of revenue, but also in terms of the wider economic activities. The impact of the tourism sector extends far beyond the airports. It impacts on hotels and other establishments right across the country where tourists spend time. The Budget for this year provides for the promotion of not only the traditional tourism destinations, but also several other destinations to ensure that all the districts in the country get a fair attention with tourists visiting all the different places and as a result, the benefits of development flowing down to the other areas as well.

In the past, tourists , , tourism , airport online visa system , tourists , tourists , - region - destinations , tour operators, hotels, airlines , online visa application , , , ; It is a lawless - - State that we had, Sir, whereas the present Government, within 24 hours after the President being elected, made arrangements to restore the online visa facility. The number of hours would have been more or less here and there, but the essence of the matter is that we made it possible. We set the example of efficiency, ability to deliver and respect for the laws and rules of the country, Sir.

, , cost escalation, , , projects , start , ? cost of corruption

The cost of corruption is not necessarily the amount related to the project, but also the cost of the lost opportunity and the damge caused to the reputation of the country. So, it relates to multiple areas. That is where the present Government is determined to put in place a proper system with projects being expedited, the due process being followed and transparency brought in. That is in relation to the Gazette on tourism sector.

Sir, we have taken up another Gazette Notification for deliberation today. That is, Gazette Notification No. 2421/41 in relation to the Luxury Tax on vehicles. Under the previous taxation, the limit or the starting point for charging the Luxury Tax on petrol and diesel vehicles was Rs. 3.5 million. Due to the calamity that prevailed in the country and the depreciation of the rupee, the cost of vehicles escalated suddenly after five years when we started opening the market for vehicle imports. So, after five years, when vehicles are imported into the country, their value has risen up significantly, requiring adjustments to make sure that vehicles are affordable to the people. Previously, as the starting point, a Luxury Tax was charged on petrol and diesel vehicles when their value exceeded Rs. 3.5 million; for two other categories, the Luxury Tax was charged when the value exceeded Rs. 4 million and Rs. 6 million.

However, considering the depreciation of rupee, the escalation of the cost and to make vehicles affordable to the people, the present Government has made a decision, even though it has a negative impact and is detrimental to its revenue, to support the people who are willing to and could afford to import a vehicle at this stage by increasing the Luxury Tax limit so as to provide a benefit to the society. Accordingly, the limit for charging the Luxury Tax is now revised from Rs. 3.5 million to Rs. 5 million with relief provided for another Rs. 1.5 million. So, the Luxury Tax is charged when the value of the vehicle exceeds Rs. 5 million. For the second category, which was charged the tax at Rs. 4 million, another relief slab of Rs. 1.5 million was added and the starting point for the Luxury Tax would be increased to Rs. 5.5 million and for the next category, the earlier limit of Rs. 6 million will continue to remain as it is because, already, it is a higher slab.

Once again, the reason why we are doing this is because, while facilitating this, we need revenue for the

Government. There are several details provided in the Gazette relating to the types of vehicles and percentages applicable for these vehicles. The importance of this step is, it is to support the economic activities the country is engaged in. In one angle, this is to support the export sector, the tourism sector and the manufacturing sector and in another, Sir, to support the investment activities of the country, to invite investors because we have the facilities and infrastructure and the revenue is channelled for the investment activities. It is also in terms of creation of employment because it is a necessity. As I said, some of these areas have a very high economic impact, Sir. So, these activities will help increase the income generated with the capital expansion project and the Budget allocation of nearly Rs. 1.3 trillion for the current year, supporting infrastructure development to achieve those ambitious goals we have as a Government. These investments would provide employment and the types of benefits we are looking for.

I will refer to the types of investments we are expecting as a country and the progress of those investments.

According to the brief data I have received from the BoI, currently, we are moving ahead with the investments envisaged for the year 2025. For the first quarter, the actual amount of foreign direct investment - FDI - Sri Lanka has received is US Dollar 197 million, I am being informed. We believe that these numbers would improve as we move forward. So, that is the amount for the first quarter. It will encourage the businesses and give them hope that the plans are working and the entities assigned to handle these tasks are working to deliver the results as well. The Government is keeping a keen eye on the situation, regularly engaging and monitoring to ensure that facilities are provided with and the environment is conducive to continue these activities. Not only that, based on the information I obtained regarding the projections for the tourism sector for the year 2025, we are expecting the arrival of approximately three million tourists this year, of which the number is nearing one million, as of now. I noted that that has been reported in the public media and at several forums. It indicates a positive outcome in terms of the confidence that tourists and the international community have in us and the reputation we hold as a country, validating the activities that are being carried out by the present Government.

Similarly, in terms of revenue projections, Sir, we are expecting nearly US Dollar 4 billion from this segment. As of now, nearly, US Dollar 900 million has been recorded and the numbers are increasing. So, this indicates that we are on track with the plans. A lot of facilitation and additional engagement would be provided to support the industries, Ministries and government departments to ensure that we are able to achieve what the people are expecting within the current year.

Sir, these Gazettes have been issued and the due process has been followed to present them to Parliament in a timely manner, demonstrating to the people and the world that Sri Lanka is following the due process.
