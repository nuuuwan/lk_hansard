Hon. Presiding Member, I would like to highlight the importance of having non-State universities in the country in terms of providing a quality and international standard education, as there is a growing public acceptance of private universities, and to build the higher education system accessible for all Sri Lankans. Please consider these statistics I am going to present now. In the year 2024, 269,613 students sat for the GCE Advanced Level Examination, of which 173,444 students were qualified for university admission, but only 43,568 students were admitted to State universities. That means, 140,000 deserving students, almost 75 per cent of the qualified students, were left out. In the year 2022, 16,254 students were enrolled to non-State university programmes. Another 9,935 students registered in affiliated foreign universities recognized by the Ministry of Education. A total of 26,189 students got the opportunity to enrol into non-State universities to pursue higher education. Annually, around 12,000 Sri Lankan students are estimated to go overseas for higher education opportunities. The drain of foreign exchange is estimated at US Dollars 50 million per annum. Those who cannot afford overseas education have been increasingly looking at the domestic market for alternative options.

Sir, considering the non-State universities role in the country, in July, 2023, the Select Committee to Make Suitable Recommendations for the Expansion of Higher Education Opportunities in Sri Lanka chaired by then Hon. Minister (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC had recommended the following: the Select Committee recommended the Higher Education Commission instead of the University Grants Commission and to bring the non-State universities under that Commission, to introduce a legal framework for the private sector higher education recognizing universities and institutes with sufficient incentives and guidelines, the Higher Education Commission to encourage private sector higher education institutes and provide incentives, subject to the condition that they fulfil socio-economic obligations. Those obligations may include granting free educational opportunities to the poorest sector of the population by allocating a certain percentage of admissions for such students in those institutes. Then, to encourage such universities or institutes through public-private partnerships, to encourage non-profit organizations to establish universities in the 25 districts, preferably through public-private-partnership programmes, to encourage private sector investors to invest in higher education by providing the necessary infrastructure facilities, such as land, transportation, water, electricity and other required amenities. The BOI assured the Select Committee that it has the will and the capacity to provide the necessary lands with infrastructure facilities to establish higher education institutes, both local and foreign. The Select Committee also recommended to permit private sector higher education institutes to use the term "University" on the condition that they maintain the required standards, as described in the regulations formulated under the Act. So, Sir, those are the recommendations made by the Select Committee to develop higher education and this Government must take those recommendations seriously for implementation. Considering the fact that the non-State education sector has already taken in 26,000 students with no Government incentives but with right policies, the Government should be able to increase that number fivefold in a couple of years, effectively providing higher education opportunities for the vast majority of deserving children.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . () .... ( () .... ) (The Hon. (Dr.) M.L.A.M. Hizbullah) Sir, please give me one more minute.

Sri Lanka is still importing education and not exporting education. Private and non-State, non-profit universities including medical schools are operating in parallel with State universities and medical schools in our neighbouring countries like India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . .

() .... ( () .... ) (The Hon. (Dr.) M.L.A.M. Hizbullah) Our students go to these countries in addition to East European countries, China, Malaysia, Cuba for their undergraduate studies in all the fields including medicine. Countries like India, Bangladesh and Malaysia have successfully integrated non-State universities into their education systems, providing valuable lessons for Sri Lanka. It must be realized that the State sector and non-State sector education institutes can co-exist and compete without harming State policies, as it happens now in education, health and many other sectors. These institutions should be strictly guided by the already established SCAQA - Standing Committee on Accreditation and Quality Assurance. Under the guidance of SCAQA, non-State and non-profit universities in this country could provide high quality university education to local students and also attract foreign students, bringing in the much needed foreign exchange to the country.

The non-State universities play a crucial role in addressing the challenges and gaps in Sri Lankas higher education system. They accommodate 26,000 students per annum who are denied the opportunity even though qualified to enter a university. So, non-state universities provide an avenue for these students to pursue higher education locally, reducing the need to seek opportunities abroad, reducing the brain drain and foreign exchange loss of US Dollars 50 million annually.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . () .... ( () .... ) (The Hon. (Dr.) M.L.A.M. Hizbullah) Sir, please give me one minute.

The non-State universities are not just an alternative, but also a necessity for Sri Lanka to achieve its educational and economic goals. Non-State universities are essential for addressing the gaps in Sri Lankas higher education system. They provide a viable solution to the challenges of limited capacity, to brain drain and outdated curricula. By embracing private partnerships and leveraging the potential of non-State institutions, Sri Lanka could create a more inclusive, innovative and globally competitive education system.

Sir, as I strongly believe that higher education is one of the best investments for Sri Lanka and its people, I am fully committed to supporting the Government in its efforts to make Sri Lanka an education hub, providing

1835 1836

high quality education. And, without the contributions of the non- State universities, we would not be able to achieve that vision. So, Hon. Prime Minister, we would urge you to consider this.

Thank you.

[4.06 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, I take great pleasure in speaking on the Votes of this Ministry because I have the utmost respect for educators. I have said this once before at the Committee Stage Discussion of a Budget on the Votes of the Ministry of Education. I think this is the only field I can point to, where the entire aspiration in life of these teachers and principals is to see the children they educate reach the highest levels in society. That is the greatest gift you could give those teachers and principals. If you put it in another way, their whole aim is to see the children they teach reach higher levels than they have. Such is the sort of magnanimity behind those individuals. Certainly, my experience with regard to teachers I have had is - I might have not been a very obedient student; I might have been a terrible student - their aspiration was always well meaning.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harini Amarasuriya) Results can be seen.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Results can be seen? I do not know. I think we had better not go into that.

So, it is in that respect I would like the Hon. Prime Minister, who is also the Minister of Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education, to take my intervention today because I, for one, believe that if there are any Heads that deserve the most amount of support in a Budget, they have to be, one, education and two, health. If we get those two Heads wrong, I can assure you, nobody would want to remain in this country. I ask the Hon. Members opposite as well as those who are here in the Opposition, be honest, do you not believe that if you had an opportunity to send your children abroad, you would not have taken it? Would you not take it? Those are the depths to which we have fallen. So, my comments today, Hon. Presiding Member and Hon. Prime Minister, is on the basis that we must give the maximum support we could to educators. The salaries these educators get is

1851 1852

nothing compared to the amount of effort they make and the goodwill they repose in those students. It is actually nothing! And, it is in that respect I would ask the Hon. Prime Minister to see my comments.

One other matter I want to raise is with regard to the increase in salary scales. The Government has made an increment. But, I remember that some time ago when the teachers and principals were protesting, the Hon. Prime Minister and other NPP members were very supportive of that protest. I also remember speaking in Parliament in support of that protest and I completely agreed with the comments made by the Hon. Prime Minister then. That was, if I am not mistaken, with regard to the Subodhini Salary Commission recommendations. And, because of those protests, eventually, if I am not mistaken, in 2022, the protestors - teachers and principals - managed to secure the first stage of the Subodhini Salary Commission recommendations. It was divided into three years. So, they managed to secure the first stage and the assurance given at that time was that the second and third stages would follow in the two consecutive years. But, that never happened.

So, if we take the increments that are being offered under this Budget for the next three years and the whole of what was recommended by the Subodhini Salary Commission for three years, had it been fully implemented - it was implemented only in the first year - an SLTS 2-II teacher would get, under this Budget, a salary of Rs. 66,880 whereas under the Subodhini Salary Commission Recommendations, she would have got Rs. 82,150, a difference of Rs. 15,270. That difference for the grade SLTS 2-I, after the full implementation of the salary increment under this Budget at the end of the next three years and the Subodhini Committee Recommendations at the end of the three years it recommended, would have been Rs. 27,310. So, like that, it goes on. That difference in salary for SLTS 1 would have been Rs. 34,990, for the Sri Lanka Principals' Service - SLPS 3 - Rs. 9,870, for SLPS 2, Rs. 25,120 and for SLPS 1, Rs. 32,230. So, what I am saying is, if the Hon. Prime Minister - if the economy improves in some way - goes to these Subodhini Commission's Recommendations at least in the next Budget, I would be its strongest supporter and can assure the Hon. Prime Minister that not a single Member in this House would oppose her implementing them. There are so many Ministries, totally unnecessary ones, from the Votes of which cuts can be made. One such ministry is the Defence Ministry. But, education is one field, I think, to which we all owe. We all owe those people who work so hard and are so magnanimous in the way they approach this field.

The second matter I wish to raise - I raised this in my speech on the Second Reading Debate of the Budget also - is with regard to the Civil Security Department running preschools in the Northern Province. That must stop. They run preschools where their preschool teachers are given an allowance amounting to over Rs. 30,000 and if I am not mistaken, it is around Rs. 40,000 now, whereas the Ministry of Education gives their preschool teachers

an allowance of only Rs. 6,000 and that is the only intervention that the Ministry of Education has with regard to those preschool teachers. That must stop immediately and the entire scheme of preschool teachers must come under the Ministry of Education and the recommendations for salaries must be, at the bare minimum, the amount that the Defence Ministry is paying. Surely, is that not a militarization of education? What does education have to do with the Ministry of Defence and why is it happening only in the Northern Province? So, that is the legacy you have inherited, which you must change. And, those would be individual instances of a litmus test, Hon. Prime Minister, and at least, on your watch, let us have this put right.

The Northern Province is in dire need of funds to complete the buildings which have already been started. I have been informed by the Northern Provincial Council that a minimum of Rs. 2 billion is required in order to ensure that the projects that have been started - the construction of those buildings - could, to some extent, be completed. So, that, too, I would ask the Hon. Prime Minister to look into.

Then, with regard to the severe situation of teacher vacancies, todays Kalai Murasu Newspaper gives a full page detail. In the Northern Province, the total cadre of teachers is 18,983. At the moment, there is a current recruitment of 15,426. But, there are 3,557 more vacancies, Hon. Prime Minister. If you look at the SLEAS vacancies, there are 111 and also 397 minor staff vacancies. All these are important; in a school, nothing, in our view, could be omitted and these vacancies must be filled. If you take the vacancies, in Jaffna, there are 261, Valikamam, 498, Vadamarachchi, 333, Thenmarachchi, 189, the Islands of Jaffna, 222, Kilinochchi North, 97, Kilinochchi South, 281, Mannar, 452, Madhu, 216, Vavuniya North, 236, Vavuniya South, 283, Mullaitivu, 318 and Thunukkai, 171. So, Hon. Prime Minister, I would urge you to look into this matter, too.

Sir, I wish to raise one other matter. I brought this matter to your notice earlier also. The UGC has called for examinations for the promotion of Management Assistant Grade III to Grade II and the examination is supposed to be held on the 21st of March. There are 61 applicants from Jaffna. I have been in touch with the Jaffna University. They have written to the UGC and asked - in the previous years when those examinations were held, they were held in Jaffna - that if in case the UGC does not want to hold it on Jaffna, whether it could, at least, be held in Vavuniya because out of the 61 applicants, 40 applicants are females who are either pregnant, feeding mothers or are going through fertility treatment. So, they have asked for special treatment and I do not think it is unreasonable considering the number who are actually willing to sit for this exam. Also, the outside district applicants are also willing to travel to Jaffna; they prefer coming to Jaffna because it is much cheaper and the University says that they will make accommodation possible for them. So, I think the University Grants Commission must consider this request also favourably.

I reiterate to the Hon. Prime Minister that the Ministry of Education has to be the heart and soul of a country. If we get that wrong, everything else would go wrong. The fact that you have people who are so capable leaving this country is, fundamentally, because we are getting it wrong. People who struggle here go through a life-threatening trip abroad. They seek asylum or do something and manage to stay in those countries and do brilliantly well. They do brilliantly well! In Europe, certainly the Tamils do brilliantly well, but also the Sinhalese. Every single ambassador or Foreign Ministry I have visited in the Western world tells us that the Tamil community, I would add the Sinhalese as well, who have gone abroad are the best and the most productive citizens. That means we are losing all of that and we are losing it for reasons that could easily be avoided. We are losing it because of racism and because we are not giving adequate resources to the areas which those should actually be given. And, I think the Ministry of Education is probably the most important in that regard.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , ( .

Hon. Member, thank you for raising this issue. I think you yourself are a credit to your educators. And, certainly, we agree that education should be the heart and soul of any country.

I just want to say that the request you made with regard to the examinations held by the UGC has been referred to the UGC and they have promised me that they would look into it. They are meeting tomorrow to see if there could be some resolution. I will keep you posted.

Thank you.
