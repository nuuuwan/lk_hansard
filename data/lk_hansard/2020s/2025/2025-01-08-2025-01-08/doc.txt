2023 ; . . ; there is no Casino Regulator. In fact, the Committee on Public Finance,

since 2022, has been pushing the Government to establish a Casino Regulator. They had been given multiple deadlines and all those deadlines had passed. So, the Committee was very stern with the Ministry of Finance. But, we will approve this Regulation because it has already been done. However, a Casino Regulator has to be established and implemented as soon as possible. So, they are supposed to give us a timeframe for that, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) Hon. Deputy Minister, may I intervene?

( ) (The Hon. Chathuranga Abeysinghe) Yes, please. ( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) Hon. Deputy Minister, at the Committee on Public Finance, you all had asked for the Singapore Free Trade Agreement, which was in process, to be held up because you all wanted some clarification on that. That is what you were just saying. I would like to say that the Singapore Free Trade Agreement has gone through a lot of study and it is something that is advantageous to the country. At the same time, the Government has taken a position to work on the ETCA. So, while you have agreed there, why is there a delay with regard to the Singapore Free Trade Agreement, which is much more simpler and straight forward? It is very important that it gets passed. So, I would like to know the position of the Government regarding the Singapore Free Trade Agreement and also the ETCA.

( ) (The Hon. Chathuranga Abeysinghe) Thank you for the question raised, Hon. Kabir Hashim.

The position of the Government is, we are in favour of free trade agreements. - [Interruption.] Yes, it is our policy. I think you do not have to applaud by tapping on the Table because, globally, every country has gone ahead with free trade agreements. But, our experience with free trade agreements has not been so good. The reason is not because the agreement is bad, but whether we have an industrialization strategy or a product development strategy to make benefit out of it. Since you asked about the Singapore Free Trade Agreement, I must say that the concern raised by the industrial sector is that, basically, Singapore is not a producing country but more of a trading country. So, the concern was, how do you identify

the country of origin of a product? How many products does Singapore add value to? Also, how do you figure out whether it is 30 per cent or 40 per cent was another concerns of the industrial sector. That is one reason why we want to really review that Agreement. So, it is not that we are avoiding it, but we need a little bit of time.

Then, with regard to the ETCA, earlier, there were concerns about the ETCA originally proposed in 2018. Now, we have to negotiate with the Indian Government on how to rectify those things. I will give you one example. I worked in India for two years and the Indian Government wanted my company to prove that my skill does not exist in India. I had to show that I was drawing a salary of US Dollars 25,000 to get permission to work in India for two years. So, that is the level of restriction that was there. Therefore, with regard to the ETCA also, an agreement has not been reached, but negotiations will start. So, what I am trying to say is that we are not against free trade agreements, but will negotiate and the agreements which have already been signed will be reviewed. That is the Government policy.

Sir, I bring this matter to the attention of the Hon. Minister of Health and Mass Media. This is an issue regarding the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital. The resources there are inadequate and we need MRI and CT scanners, a cath lab and facilities for brachytherapy. During the past years, we felt a lot of disappointment at not getting the proposed cath lab and the MRI scanner. But, this time, we got news that the Asian Development Bank has agreed to supply those through the Ministry of Health. But, it should be made sure that those instruments are provided to the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital in 2025. As a hospital providing tertiary care, it provides a massive service to the Eastern Province. So, I kindly request the Hon. Minister of Health to consider that and make sure that action is taken regarding this issue.

, - . . , . .

Sir, I bring this matter to the concern of the Hon. Minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Land and Irrigation. There is this Kithul-Rugam Reservoir Project which has been implemented, replaced, renewed and restarted. It is to improve the irrigation system, water supply to the public and would also help flood mitigation. So, regarding this issue, I hope the Hon. Minister of

233 234

Agriculture, Livestock, Land and Irrigation would take necessary action as soon as possible.

. . , . , , . , . , , .

, . . , - drainage system - .

Sir, I would like to bring another matter to the attention of the Hon. Minister of Health and Mass Media. There is limited land for the Teaching Hospital, Batticaloa. Therefore, in the future, if there is possibility to relocate the Batticaloa Prison to another place, there would be adequate land for the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital. A lot of old buildings of the Hospital have to be removed according to the Master Plan and for new constructions, there is very limited land. So, your concern is directed to that issue.

And, there is another issue, Sir. There is no "Osusala" in the Batticaloa District. We got a news that there is possibility to establish an "Osusala". But, up to now, the public in the Batticaloa District have not had the chance to benefit from an "Osusala." Therefore, we expect, as soon as possible, a suitable solution from the Hon. Minister.

Also, in the Eastern University, Batticaloa, there is no Faculty of Law. There is no such faculty in the entire Eastern Region. So, I request the Hon. Minister of Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education to consider establishing a new Faculty of Law for the Eastern University.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, your time is up. Could you please conclude?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Elayathamby Srinath) Sir, give me one more minute, please.

Another issue is regarding establishing a prawn farm in the Vakarai Divisional Secretary's Division. We have discussed this matter in the DCC meeting also. A suitable feasibility study on the prawn farm and prawn culture in the Vakarai area had been done and thousands of acres of land have been allocated for that purpose. But, I request that you re-do a feasibility study, considering the public in the Vakarai area. I kindly request the Hon. Minister of Environment also to involve in this matter.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, could you please conclude?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Elayathamby Srinath) Okay.

Thank you for your concern, relevant Hon. Ministers. These are very important issues in the Batticaloa District and please consider them.

Thank you.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramanathan Archchuna) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) We have to manage time, Hon. Member. Yes, what is your point of Order?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramanathan Archchuna) Yesterday, Sir, I spoke to the higher officials about time not being allocated to me. I am representing a minority community from Jaffna.

Yesterday, the Hon. Speaker said that he will appoint a committee for this. Otherwise, everyday, I just come here, sit looking up and then go back to Jaffna. Therefore, this should be taken up as an urgent issue because I have no way of speaking in Parliament. So, please, kindly give me a quick answer. We cannot appoint committees and have round-up discussions on these things because, everyday, I am losing my Privilege to speak in this august Assembly.

235 236

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, the Hon. Speaker will give his opinion on that. That matter has been taken up, I was told, and would certainly be addressed.

[1.13 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees, I wish to bring a few matters to the notice of the House, as we have very little time allocated to us. Even though it might not be the topic that is being discussed right now, I wish to raise those matters.

Firstly, Madam, I wish to raise the matter with regard to the Dispenser Service under the Ministry of Health. On the 22nd of March, 2024, Gazette No. 2377 was issued by the Ministry of Health, calling for new recruitments and people applied. Then, interviews were called for and held in June, 2024. A list of those who were selected for the interviews was released as well. Madam, once the interviews were held, thereafter no appointments were made and there are severe shortages in the Dispenser category. The last appointments were made in 2016 and since then, there have been a lot of outside provincial

247 248

2025 08

members appointed in the Northern Province and Jaffna, in particular. They have, over the years, asked for transfers and returned to their home provinces. As a result, even more vacancies have been created. In the Northern Province, almost 40 vacancies exist for now and in Jaffna District alone, there are 20 vacancies. I would, therefore, urge the Government to look into this matter and appoint the members who had faced the interviews, as early as possible and until such appointments are confirmed, at the very least, to prevent transfers taking place because when transfers take place and those Dispensers leave the Northern Province, a huge shortage is created and it is a bit of a crisis in the health sector in Jaffna, in particularly.

Again, the second matter is also with regard to the Dispenser Service. There were Service Minutes that were released on the 11th of October, 2016 which insisted that Grade-I Dispensers have to sit for the Third Efficiency Bar Examination. These examinations, according to the Gazette, were supposed to be held every year or at least twice a year. But, these examinations have never been held and to my understanding, Madam - I am quite happy to be corrected - this situation is limited not only to the Jaffna District, but applies islandwide. As a result, those who are in Grade-I have not been entitled to any increments. Therefore, I think it is grossly unfair, when they are ready to face the examinations to get those increments because the examinations have been gazetted to be held twice a year, that those examinations have not been held since 2016. I think it is very regrettable. So, that matter also must be urgently looked into and those appointments related to increments must be dealt with in a just way.

The third matter that I wish to raise is with regard to the railway service between Colombo and Jaffna. Madam, you would recall that once the track was laid with the funding of the Indian Government, four services were scheduled per day; daily, there were four services running between Colombo and Jaffna. On the 05th of January, 2023, all services came to a halt because the track between Anuradhapura and Vavuniya, Omanthai, was supposed to be repaired. So, now, from Maho to Anuradhapura, it is being repaired. When the services were completely halted because of this repair work, two out of the four train services were redirected to the Eastern Province, to Trincomalee and Batticaloa, and since the services to Jaffna recommenced, those two services that were diverted have not been brought back to the Jaffna service. Instead, of the original four services which ran daily to Jaffna, we have only one today; "Yal Devi" is the only service that runs to Jaffna. On weekends, on Saturdays and Sundays, only the fully air-conditioned Intercity Service runs and during the high-intensity seasons, that Intercity Service is increased to Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday. But, that is grossly inadequate, Madam. The train service from Colombo to Jaffna was most profitable and even today, it is a service that runs at full capacity. Even when it ran four services, it was running at full capacity. Therefore, to suddenly reduce it to one, I think, is grossly unfair and the Sri Lanka Railways and the Hon. Minister, who is also the Leader of the House, must look into this matter

urgently and rectify it as immediatly as possible. Madam, once the railway service to Jaffna commenced after the track was relaid, it now runs only from Colombo, whereas, originally, the service used to start from Mount Lavinia.

As you are aware, mostly Tamil families live in the area between Mount Lavinia and Bambalapitiya. So, the train used to stop at Mount Lavinia, Wellawatte and at Bambalapitiya. And now, it does not; it starts from Colombo Fort. So, that has caused inconvenience to travelers. Furthermore, you have already reduced the service to one and there is a high intensity of travelers who wish to catch that service. If you are going to start the service only from Colombo Fort, that would inconvenience them even more. Therefore, I urge the Hon. Minister to look into that matter as well.

Finally, Madam, I wish to bring up a matter that has gained a little bit of publicity. It is with regard to some citizens of this country who had gone to Russia and who had found themselves forcibly being recruited into the Russian Army, and some of them have got injured as well.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees) .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I am winding up, Madam.

Their aggrieved families were protesting outside the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism yesterday. Now, those families want their members to be repatriated. I urge the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism to look into that matter as a matter of urgency. They must be brought back. If they have, in some way, made some mistake, that is a different matter. But, they cannot be forced to serve in an army and put their lives at risk. If at all, they must be brought back to Sri Lanka immediately.

Thank you.

. . Prof. Deepika Udagama "Prof. Udagama condemns Peradeniya Uni ban on IMF austerity programme lecture" . IMF programme . ? . ? . . .

Hon. Minister, you must understand that academic freedom in universities is an important aspect in a free country. This Government has come promising many things, particularly about freedom. If academic freedom in universities is going to be curtailed in this fashion, then it is a very serious matter, Hon. Minister. That has to be looked into. Such happenings should not take place, be it in universities or otherwise. People must have the right to conduct lectures and explain things to citizens, particularly about the IMF and its austerity programmes. Suddenly, the IMF has become the darling of this Government. We appreciate that; we do appreciate that your Government, quite contrary to what you all had said during the election period, has agreed to every single

condition of the IMF. It is a good thing. Then, why prevent open discussions about the IMF programme in universities, particularly in Peradeniya University? That is a very serious matter.

Madam, the Human Rights Commission has a right to go and inspect any place about which there is a report with regard to maltreatment or ill-treatment of individuals. These Rohingya refugees recently arrived in Mullaitivu. This is not the first time that Rohingya refugees from Myanmar had arrived in Sri Lanka. Way back in 2008, 2017 and 2018, such people came by boat. Now, look at the attitude of this Government. The Human Rights Commission sends their officials to the Sri Lanka Air Force camp to look into the welfare of those refugees, but the Air Force personalities refuse entry to the officials of Human Rights Commission. It is a total violation of the Human Rights Commission Act. They can be held in contempt for not allowing inspection when required. So, the officials had meekly turned away and come back. That is not the issue. A leading Presidents Counsel has written a scathing letter about the need to follow strict procedures. Now, what has happened? See the attitude of your Minister in charge of law and order. He is saying that he is going to consult and be in touch with Myanmar authorities in this regard. , ; , . It is a well-known fact and it is well documented that Myanmar Government is not simply ill-treating the Rohingya minority, but also they are being persecuted vehemently. Hundreds of thousands have left the country. There are almost a million such refugees in Bangladesh. There are close to about 500,000 in Malaysia, I am told. Indonesia has a few; the UAE has a few; Saudi Arabia has thousands and other western countries have given them refuge. Then, you say that these people are human traffickers. How dare you say that! Do you forget that when your own members were persecuted way back in the 70s and 80s, you took refuge in Italy, the UK, France, Lebanon and all over. How many former JVP activists are there as refugees? And now, you treat these Myanmarese, these poor people this way. . . . ? .

The UNHCR must be told to provide the necessary security. The Government is bound to act under the humanitarian law and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, of which specific Sections have been highlighted. Several issues have been highlighted in this case.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) The way the Government is conducting this issue seriously harms our reputation as a country, as an important international citizen in the world. Therefore, please safeguard our reputation as a country and do not forcefully repatriate those poor people. There are several young people - young children, young women and young boys - among the 100 people who have come. Please provide them better security and stop talking about human trafficking at a time when there is persecution in Myanmar, which is a well-known fact. And, your own people had been persecuted and you all had taken refuge in various countries. While that had happened, you all are now treating the Myanmarese refugees in this fashion and it is a very serious matter. Therefore, I would like the Government to deal with this issue with a much more humane approach.

Thank you. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees) . ( ) (The Hon. Harshana Nanayakkara, Attorney-at-Law) Thank you, Hon. Rauff Hakeem, for raising some issues. At the earlier part of your speech, you mentioned about the crimes that had been committed, about Mr. Lasantha Wickrematunges death and that justice must be done. I thank you very much for raising it. Yes, justice will be done; yes, investigations are moving forward.

We, as a Government, respect the independence of the Judiciary, the Attorney-General and the prosecuting authorities. What we do is, facilitate the process. As you are aware, most of these cases were blocked by the previous political regimes, but now, there is no such block. So, I can assure you that matters are being attended to in a very diligent fashion and with expediency. You know that I am prevented from speaking any further on matters of that nature even in Parliament because it might defeat the purpose of catching the culprits and punishing them accordingly. So, investigations are taking place and soon, you will hear what we have been doing.

Then, you raised about the Rohingya refugees. The Hon. Minister of Public Security and Parliamentary Affairs is here. We are treating them in the most humane fashion according to the law of the land and about the rest, I am sure, the Hon. Minister will reply. Anyway, thank you for raising it.

As for the rest of of your speech, about the IMF being the darling of the Government and all that is your politics. So, you continue with that. - [Interruption.]
