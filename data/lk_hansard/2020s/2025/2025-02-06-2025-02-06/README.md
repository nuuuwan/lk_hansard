MINISTERIAL CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE

REPORTS

( ) (The Hon. Wasantha Samarasinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I present the Report of the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Trade, Commerce, Food Security and Co-operative Development on -

(i) Regulations made by the then Minister of Trade, Commerce, Food Security, Co-operative Development, Industry and Entrepreneurship Development under Section 204 read with Sections 160A, 161B, 161C, 161D, 161E, 161F, 161G, 161I, 161K and 161L of the Intellectual Property Act, No. 36 of 2003 and published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 2407/04 of 22nd October, 2024; and

(ii) Performance Report and Annual Accounts of the Measurement Units, Standards and Services Department for the year 2023,

which were referred to the Committee. . . Ordered to lie upon the Table.

PUBLIC FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT ) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I present the Report of the Committee on Public Finance on the Regulations under Section 204 read with Sections 160A, 161B, 161C, 161D, 161E, 161F, 161G, 161I, 161K and 161L of the Intellectual Property Act, No. 36 of 2003, which were referred to the said Committee.

. . Ordered to lie upon the Table. ) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Sir, the reason why the two Committees have reported on the same Regulations and are jointly presenting the Reports is, when there is a levy or some fee attached to a Regulation application, it also has to come to the Committee on Public Finance.

1415 1416

Those were on the Intellectual Property Rights for Geographical Identification, which is a good thing and will benefit the country immensely.

Sir, let me also make a point here. Why we did this jointly for the first time today is because of what happened in the last Parliament in outsourcing of visa to GBS Technology Services and IVS Global-FZCO. The matter went only before the Ministerial Consultative Committee and did not come to the Committee on Public Finance. It is only subsequently that we found out that there was a big controversial tender underneath that whole transaction. But, unfortunately, nothing seems to be happening in that regard. Sir, I want to remind you that we had presented a 665-page Report, which was taken by three Members of our Committee to the Supreme Court and an injunction was taken. But, since then, nothing seems to be happening. So, I just want to remind you, Sir, that we need to start looking into that.

Thank you very much.

. ( . ) (The Hon. M. Nizam Kariapper, PC) Thank you very much, Sir.

When I mentioned about a Law Faculty in the Eastern University, I wanted to say that the Government policy should be - I am not talking in terms of the region - to give easy access to the students from the Eastern Province, especially for the girls from the Muslim community who are taking a lot of interest in law. They will be encouraged, if there is a faculty. That is the first point I wanted to make. Once again, I hope the Hon. Minister of Justice and National Integration would also be able to help us.

In fact, subject to correction, I think, Hon. Prime Minister, what you said is perfectly correct. The General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University does not fall directly under the UGC, but they also have got the same privilege of getting admission for the Law College Entrance Examination like any other State University does. So, I hope you will be able to look into that.

Thank you very much. ) ( () () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya) Hon. Member, the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University is a State university, according to categorization. Once again, what I have to say is that the

Eastern University has to initiate that process. They have to make that request and there is a process that has to be followed before any degree programme could be approved.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Question No. 3 - 80/2024 - (1), the Hon. Rohana Bandara. - [Not in the Chamber.]

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramanathan Archchuna) Sir, you referred to yesterdays incident and said that I mentioned the word shame.

If you take the UK Parliament and every other Parliament, they have the right to use the word shame. If a wrong thing has been done, then I have the right to say, "You have done a wrong thing". Firsly, I was not allowed to speak in my language and secondly, it is a violation of a basic fundamental right in the Constitution. I was not allowed to speak in my language.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, on that occasion, you were requested to speak in the language in which you had submitted your Question of Privilege.

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramanathan Archchuna) The second thing is, the Chair asked me to stop my speech and I was not allowed to speak and complete my Question of Privilege. You have the responsibility to allow me to speak as a Party Leader in this highest Sabha.

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) .

Sir, earlier you spoke about the Chair, that what was stated was a disgrace, not to you personally, but to the Chair. I want to raise a question. We were here on the 15th of November, 2018 when this Chair was desecrated. There were Members climbing on that Chair; there were Members throwing various objects at other Members. The Hon. Karu Jayasuriya was protected by about fifty policemen. I just want to know, Sir, what happened to that investigation? Where is that report? I am aware that the CID was investigating into that matter. There was a statement made by a certain Minister at the time that they could not take action against those MPs for destruction of public property in this House. That is not correct. So, all what I want to know is, what the status of that investigation is, has anybody been found guilty and if so, what action has been taken.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) I will inform the Hon. Speaker, too, about that and we will definitely look into that matter.

[2.59 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees, please do not reduce my time for the exchanges that took place just now.

Madam, I have been someone who has been repeatedly saying that the military is still working on a counterinsurgency mode. They have not come out of that mindset they had during the war and in the process of fighting the war, they had transformed, unfortunately - I am saying this with utmost responsibility- into an institution that is against the Tamil people, against Tamil interests.

A classic example of that phenomenon is how the military has been involved in building this illegal Thissa Viharaya in Thyiddi. When we heard that the Army Commander at that time had come and laid the foundation stone and that it was being built on a private land, at the DCC meeting, within a few days of that foundation stone being laid, the matter had been discussed with the GA, the

Tellippallai Divisional Secretary and the Chairman and Secretary of the relevant local government authority, the Valikamam North Pradeshiya Sabha, present and it was confirmed that it was on a private land it was being built and that the land did not belong to any viharaya. Despite the fact that a ruling was made at the District Co-ordinating Committee meeting that any building process must stop immediately, the military went ahead and built the illegal viharaya. This matter was again brought up on the 13th of December, 2024 at the DCC meeting when the Hon. Ramalingam Chandrasekar, Minister of Fisheries, Aquatic and Ocean Resources chaired the session and it was brought up on the 31st of January, 2025, too, when His Excellency President Anura Kumara Dissanayake chaired the DCC meeting. On both those occasions - the military was also present - everyone agreed that it was a private land and that, in fact, it was being built illegally without any formal legal process and that a decision had to be made.

On the 18th of December, 2024 when I first brought this up under this new Parliament, Madam, the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress had written a letter and its President or Chairman, Chandra Nimal Wakishta, has purportedly signed it. Madam, I table* that letter today.

This whole story is carried in todays Udayan newspaper. In the letter, they had claimed and insisted that that entire land of six acres, which is actually a privately deed land or privately-owned land, cannot be taken back and handed over to the people, that from King Devanampiyathissa's time, that land has belonged to the Thissa Viharaya and that, in fact, there should be, in total, 14 acres. So, an additional several acres have to be confiscated and given for the purposes of this viharaya. Madam, this is exactly what I meant by the military being a racist institution and that it has not changed its mindset. Even if we are to assume that there is some truth to these claims, there is a legal process by which you must go.

Just because you are the military, you cannot decide that you can breach any law; the days of the law of the jungle is over. But, still, they are operating on that basis.

When I searched for who this present President of the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress is, I found that he was the former Director of the NIB and a Deputy Inspector General of Police. So, you can see the nexus in this illegality that is being orchestrated here. That is why it is important for this Government, if it is true to its pledges that it is not going to pursue racist policies and that it is going to uphold the rule of law, to ensure that the law would be fair, whoever who breaches it. That law cannot be allowed to be breached in this way and this Governments litmus test on whether it is racist or not like the previous governments is going to depend on how it deals with this illegal viharaya that has been built whilst the land of the Thissa Viharaya is there adjoining

it. When they could have easily built it on that land, which is rightfully owned by the viharaya, their choosing to confiscate privately owned land for this illegal act is something that cannot be allowed.

The second matter that I wish to raise - again, it is a headline news in the Thinakkural newspaper of today - Madam, is that the Government is apparently going to confiscate further land to extend the runway of the Palaly Airport. At the moment, the Palaly Airport's runway is 1,300 metres, the Katunayake Airport's runway is 3,400 metres and that of the Ratmalana Airport is 1,700 metres. The Palaly Airport's runway can be extended within its current High Security Zone area itself upto a maximum of 2,400 metres. That would considerably be longer than even the Ratmalana Airport's runway. So, the people of Palaly, who have been waiting to resettle in those areas, are up in arms because the Government is thinking in terms of confiscating more land. The President goes and says that all the land must be released, but, here, he or his Government is thinking in terms of confiscating more land, when already there is ample land within this so-called High Security Zone in Palaly for the use of the extension of the runway. These matters should have been brought up at the DCC meeting.

These matters should be discussed with Tamil Parliamentarians from Jaffna; we also have opinions. I mean, if you are actually going to build a much more capable international airport, actually Jaffna is the wrong place; it is in a corner. You can build it somewhere in the Vanni or Vavuniya, where you can serve Anuradhapura and the East since it is a much more central area. You do not go and build it in some corner. So, these are matters that have to be discussed and the Government must not take unilateral action, as reported in the newspapers.

Madam, there is one other matter. The Land Reform Commission has an office in every district, outside the North and the East. In every district, outside the North and the East, there are 17 offices. In the North, there are five districts, but there is only one office in Jaffna and for Batticaloa and Trincomalee in the East, there is only one office in Batticaloa. But, in Ampara District, which has just less than 500 acres of land that comes within the LRC, has an office. Why is that? Should there not be an office in every district in the North and the East? Why is it that there are only two offices in areas that are predominantly Tamil-speaking? Is there not something wrong with that? We are complaining that lands are being stolen from us, that lands are being illegally taken away from us and it is the LRC which is the primary culprit. Why is it that, deliberately, an office is not being operated in each district in the North and the East?

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees) . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I am winding up, Madan.

The people who work in those two offices of the LRC and who belong to the districts in the North and the East have to, when they transfer, travel, because there are no other offices in the North and the East, about 450 kilometres! Is that fair? So, in every way possible, theses practices of previous governments must be stopped. These are all fundamentally racist ideological problems that have evolved. This Government must change this practice immediately in order to establish its credibility.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees) () . 9 .
