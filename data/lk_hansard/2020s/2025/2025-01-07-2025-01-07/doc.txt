() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Sir, get it from somewhere else; get it from your side. I did not disturb the House earlier. Thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. Deputy Speaker, could we have your consent to take the half an hour allotted for lunch also for the Debate because a large portion of time was expended on Questions and other matters? With the consent of the Hon. Prime Minister, we can take that half an hour allotted for lunch also for the Debate because so much of time was expended.

() ( () () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, we try not to cut off the half an hour allotted for lunch because it is difficult for the staff.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) I am asking just for today because it is such an important Debate.

() ( () () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya) It is an important Debate, no doubt, but I think it is very difficult for the staff when we do away with that half an hour. Let us try to accommodate the speakers as much as possible. Within our ranks, we will accommodate our speakers. So, we kindly request you all also to try and do the same because we need to think of the staff also.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Just for this occasion, only for today, could we have your consent? You can be amenable only for today.

() ( () () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya) Let us come to a decision. At the Committee on Parliamentary Business also, I think you all agreed not to do away with the half an hour for lunch. - [Interruption] Why, just for today? Then, how do we make any decision based on this? May I ask the Hon. Deputy Speaker also, was there not agreement or a discussion on not doing away with the half an hour for lunch?

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Yes.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Sorry for disturbing you, Hon. Prime Minister. Sir, it was all on the understanding that within the first hour, that is from 9.30 a.m. to 10.30 a.m., we would conclude all the scheduled matters. But, I noticed today that for the Announcements alone, it took more than 15 minutes. So, that is why we are requesting for an exception today, to have the half an hour allotted for lunch.

() ( () () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya) Sir, what was the decision taken at the Committee on Parliamentary Business?

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) If the Government party also agrees, we could do away with the lunch break and otherwise, we would stick to the half an hour break for lunch.

() ( () () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya) Okay, just for today - because there was a long list of Announcements to be made - we have no objection. But, we should really not make this a practice because it is really difficult on the staff when we do away with the half an hour for lunch.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) You may start your speech now, Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Sir, does it mean that I have 18 minutes, until 12.15 p.m?

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Now, the time is 11.49 a.m. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) At what time do I have to stop? ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) You can have 16 minutes, please.

65 66

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) But, now that the half an hour for lunch is also taken for the Debate, I can have my 18 minutes, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Okay. [.. 11.50] () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Thank you very much, Sir.

Sir, there has to be a certain decorum here. I am on my feet; I am speaking. - [Interruption.] No, Hon. Prime Minister, I am not yielding. I can mention his name. You have to have a certain decorum and the Hon. Minister can wait till I finish.

() ( () () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya) Of course, we must follow a certain decorum, but that has to be on both sides. When the Hon. Ministers name is mentioned, he can raise a point of Order. There is no need to be so aggressive about it, Hon. Member. If you are talking about decorum, then, let us apply that to both sides.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) There is a certain decorum that we follow; we have been doing that in Parliament from the inception. It is not a point of Order that he raised. He was trying to explain his position.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva, you may continue with your speech.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha. You have ten minutes. [1.15 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha, PC) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I thought I have 12 minutes.

Sir, I am thankful for giving me this opportunity to speak on this Adjournment Motion. Firstly, I would like to say that I am speaking in Parliament after a period of five years and I have been a practising lawyer during that period. So, I am back after a period of five years. I thank

89 90

the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the National Democratic Front, through which I was elected, for nominating me. I also thank all the constituent parties of the Front for their support in nominating me through the National List.

Sir, whilst I had been out of Parliament, I had been able to look at Parliament from a different perspective. Unfortunately, what do we debate in Parliament? Recently, we started to debate the qualifications of the Hon. Members. Sir, it costs Rs. 32 million a day for us to hold Parliament. So, I would like to tell the Hon. Members of this House that we should act with more restraint and responsibility in making deliberations in Parliament because raising issues about an Hon. Member's qualifications is not what the masses are interested in. We are here to debate important matters of the country with the Government and the Opposition placing their different perspectives. And, I appeal to the Government to take constructive criticism from the Opposition in good spirit. That is the spirit with which we all have to work.

I would like to remind this House that countries which claim to have left-wing governments have embraced the open economy based on demand and supply. I would also like to point out to the Government that governments are incapable of doing business. A good example I would like to place before this House is the SriLankan Airlines. Every successive government thought that they could run the SriLankan Airlines. The SriLankan Airlines is a white elephant; it has always burdened our State coffers. India took a very bold and a wise decision with regard to their airline. They ran Air India for a very long period of time and then took a decision to privatize it. I beg this Government also to look at that model and privatize the SriLankan Airlines because governments cannot do business and governments doing business have always failed.

, . , the reason being the BoI, other than giving duty waivers, is a toothless tiger. . , Colombo Port City Economic Commission Act Strategic Development Projects Act. However, the IMF has dictated to the Government not to give approval under the Strategic Development Projects Act until there is a transparent mechanism. Let us look at the Port City. Port City .

Port City . But, we should understand, Sir, that there are regional sensitivities in relation to investing in the Port City. I will stop at that. I am sure the Hon. Members of this House understand what I mean. So, we need regional mechanisms through which investments could be enticed and that is something the Government should do. As you can see, Sri Lanka does not have a competitive environment for investments. . . . ; .

, . , , 43.7; 4.7; 4.5. So, there is a great disparity. , .

With regard to the economy, I would also like to highlight the plight of the construction industry, which is

91 92

[ ]

2025 07

vital to stimulating economic growth. The construction industry was 12 per cent of GDP. Today, it has shrunk to 6 per cent. When there was the economic crisis, we had an embargo and there were taxes with regard to building materials. That resulted in cost being prohibitive and thereby, today, a common man is unable even to put up a house. However, if you look at the balance sheets of the companies which produce materials locally, you would notice that during the embargo, they had had excessive profits. Therefore, I appeal to this Government to reconsider that tax structure because those companies had made unconscionable profits and the common man has not had benefits because of this unconscionable tax structure. , . .

Sir, by opening the Palali-Achchuveli Main Road, which was closed apparently for national security reasons, this Government received the confidence of the people in the North. Such confidence-building exercises must be extended to all communities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Muslim community and others faced grave hurt when cremation of bodies of deceased persons was made mandatory. When more than 190 countries permitted burial, Sri Lanka was one of the few which did not. So, there is great sensitivity and the community demands accountability. This Government appointed Dr. Anil Jasinghe as Secretary to the Ministry of Health and Mass Media. We have no problem, but he was part of that decision-making process. So, I would like to tell this Government - you all can appoint whoever you all want - that there is a need for him to express some remorse or regret, as he was part of that process and that is a requirement with regard to the Muslim community.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, your time is up.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha, PC) Sir, give me one more minute.

Also, I would like to draw the attention of the House to a very important issue, the issue of Rohingya refugees. For many years, Sri Lanka has had a State policy of not arbitrarily turning away any refugees arriving in this country. As a general rule, the Government has had an arrangement with the UNHCR, where persons seeking refugee status would be allowed safe passage within this country until their status is processed by the UNHCR together with the country granting them refugee status. I must also draw the attention of this House to the fact that the Rohingya community has been subjected to torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment in their home country, which is an accepted fact. Sri Lanka is a signatory to the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and have acceded that, which had been made part of our law by Act, No. 22 of 1994. That Convention

does not permit the expulsion of a person who is under threat of being tortured in a particular state. Thus, our international legal obligations as well as norms as a country respecting human rights mandate that these refugees be granted safe passage in Sri Lanka until such time their refugee status is processed. Therefore, I hope this Government would consider the plight of those refugees in Sri Lanka and make a just and fair decision. Thank you, Sir.

Madam, I would like to point out six key areas of focus for the North. The northern region, with its five districts, has significant potential for development. Its prosperity could be achieved through sustainable growth, reconciliation and strengthening the communities which had endured decades of conflict. Therefore, I urge the Government to focus on the following six key areas: infrastructure development, economic empowerment, youth unemployment, environmental sustainability, safe tourism and national reconciliation.

The northern region of Sri Lanka is home to over 26 tourism sites, each rich in history and culture. The region should prepare to welcome at least 1 million tourists by 2025, expanding tourism infrastructure with 5,000 new local rooms and flights and ferry services to its destinations.

After decades of conflict, national reconciliation in the North is essential. Strengthening co-existence between communities, rehabilitating war-affected communities and addressing the needs of those impacted by the conflict are all critical.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees) , . ( ) (The Hon. Rajeevan Jeyachandramoorthy) Okay.

Madam, this is not merely a call to support the northern region of Sri Lanka, but to invest in the future of our entire nation. A united, equitable and a prosperous Sri Lanka will only emerge if every region and community is uplifted.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees) , . ( ) (The Hon. Rajeevan Jeyachandramoorthy) Let us work together across party lines to ensure that the northern region of Sri Lanka achieves its rightful place in our shared future. Thank you.

[3.49 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. M. Nizam Kariapper, PC) Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees, I rise to contribute to this Adjournment Debate on the Mid-Year Fiscal Position Report - 2024. The Report outlines significant developments in our economy and fiscal performance, but it also raises critical concerns that must be addressed for sustainable growth.

The economy recorded a growth of 5 per cent in the first half of 2024, reversing the contraction which was at minus 7.3 per cent in 2023. While that is a positive development, it is of concern that the agriculture sector grew only by 1.4 per cent, which is very marginal, despite its critical role in food security and rural livelihoods.

Exports increased by 6.1 per cent reaching US Dollars 8.5 billion, driven by growth in industrial and agricultural products. However, imports rose by 10 per cent, widening the trade deficit to US Dollars 3.57 billion up from US Dollars 2.96 billion in 2023.

Tourism earnings surged by 66.1 per cent to US Dollars 2.17 billion, with a 50.7 per cent rise in arrivals. Similarly, workers remittances grew by 11 per cent to US Dollars 4.29 billion, thanks to higher foreign employment and formal remittance channels. While these sectors have shown promise, they remain vulnerable to global conflicts and epidemics. Madam, let us remember the past, draw lessons from the recent crises and prepare for such events.

Government revenue increased by 41.5 per cent, reaching Rs. 1.86 trillion. However, this growth comes with significant burden on the people.

Tax revenue rose by 42.6 per cent to Rs. 1.71 trillion, primarily driven by VAT and Excise Duty. The VAT rate

135 136

[ ]

hiked to 18 per cent and removal of exemptions, even on essential items, contradicts promises made to the electorate by this Government. Let us not forget that.

The Excise Duty on petroleum products grew by an astonishing 200.8 per cent. But, the Government failed to pass on the benefits of reduced global oil prices to the public.

Then, Madam, this Government has continued with the policies it once criticized, such as imposing a tax of Rs. 65 per kilogram on rice imports. This is far from the affordable prices it promised to the people before the harvesting season.

The Mid-Year Fiscal Report highlights critical challenges. One is, the trade deficit. The widening trade deficit reflects increased imports, which outweigh export growth. The second is, debt sustainability. Rising public debt and external borrowing remain a significant risk. The third is, inflation and growth. While inflation appears under control - actually, it was not under control, but has reached the peak and remained there - sustaining growth amidst global uncertainties is a major challenge.

With regard to roads and bridges, let me make certain important observations. The Government has spent Rs. 95.1 billion on roads and bridges, which was slightly less than the Rs. 99.9 billion spent in 2023. Madam, on expressways, Rs. 20.6 billion was allocated with Rs. 14.4 billion directed towards the Central Expressway. However, the critical Kadawatha-Mirigama section of it remains incomplete. That segment is vital for seamless connectivity between Colombo, the Central Region, the North, the North-Central and the East, from where I come. Madam, I urge the Government to use the Presidents upcoming visit to China to request a special grant for this project. Such funding would expedite its completion and unlock the full benefits of that infrastructure. Then, for road maintenance, the spending increased significant by Rs. 7.2 billion, but yet, rural road development saw a reduction of allocation. Madam, one of the bridges in the Eastern Province just close to the South-Eastern University was washed off by the floods due to weak bridge infrastructure. Nothing has been spent for the maintenance of those weak bridges. Now, we see that a significant portion of the budget of Rs. 43.1 billion on road development has been used for loan repayment. This underscores the heavy reliance on borrowing for infrastructure, which increases fiscal vulnerabilities.

Madam, it is ironic that this Government presents the fiscal achievements of the previous regime as its own, despite having criticized every sentence in that policy. Let me remind this House of the Presidents own words from the past. This is what he told once: " IMF ? , IMF ? part ? , ? " I am sure, Madam, this is a very important matter that this House has to take into consideration. On top of it, I remember that one of the important Ministers of the present Government once said, " IMF

60 . , 350 250 ."

And, he went on to state, That is what we want. We want without any condition. But, nothing has been sent.

Finally, let me say one more thing about international rankings of human rights. It is a very important factor which contributes to the economic strength of this country. Madam, the Rohingya people are internationally recognized as one of the most persecuted minorities in the world facing systematic violence, forced disappearance and gross human rights violations in Myanmar. The principle of non-refoulement, about which the Hon. Leader of the Opposition also spoke, is the cornerstone of international refugee law which prohibits the return of individuals to the country where they face a real risk of persecution and torture.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees) , . . ( . ) (The Hon. M. Nizam Kariapper, PC) I am winding up, Madam.

I would also like to refer to Article 8 of the UN Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. Take that also into consideration and do not treat these refugees under the category of human trafficking.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees) . 15 .

(a) (i) The proposed internal airport in Digana

area to be established in a 46-acre land was the initial proposal of the Government, but the land acquisition did not work as planned. There is no information that a feasibility report or a Cabinet Paper had been made by this Ministry and even now, the ownership of the land has not been transferred regularly. In this area, the Sri Lanka Air Force was working to acquire 20 acres of land for the implementation of the two project proposals.

(ii) The proposed land belongs to the National Livestock Development Board (NLDB) and no private land has been identified in the area.

(iii) Within the 20 acres to be acquired, the Sri Lanka Air Force will set up a Disaster Management Training School - DTMS - and a heliport. There is no information of any other institution existing in this 20-acre land.

(iv) As this 20-acre land belongs to the National Livestock Development Board (NLDB), there has been no loss of private housing.

(v) Not relevant.

(b) Not relevant.
