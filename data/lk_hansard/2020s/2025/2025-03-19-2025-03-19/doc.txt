Whereupon THE HON. DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and THE HON. KITNAN SELVARAJ took the Chair.

[3.55 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha, PC) Hon. Presiding Member, I am thankful that I have been given the opportunity to speak at the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Trade, Commerce, Food Security and Co-operative Development.

Sir, I would say that we cannot resolve the issues in our country and take the country forward unless we move away from debt and bring in FDIs into the country. Hon. Minister, your Ministry is the backbone of the economy. We have to bring in FDIs and to develop industries. Our closest neighbour, India, has the largest population in the world. We have a Free Trade Agreement with India. We must start industrial zones and give investors incentives. Unfortunately, every successive government felt that investors are waiting to come and start industries in Sri Lanka. But, our energy and labour costs are so high that we need to create a mechanism through which we give incentives to investors for industries to be set up in Sri Lanka.

Then, Hon. Minister, I will be focusing on a very important aspect in bringing in investments and dealing with trade. Unless we have a vibrant Judiciary, we cannot entice investors to come into Sri Lanka. The first concern an investor who wishes to come and invest in Sri Lanka has is, if he would have an issue with the Regulator or with his local partners, how he could resolve it. Unfortunately, if you file a case in the District Court, you will have to wait for 20 years to bear fruits of victory. We have set up a Commercial High Court in Sri Lanka and from the Commercial High Court, there is right to appeal only once. Earlier, from the District Court, you could go to the Court of Appeal and then, to the Supreme Court. Even with this mechanism, for someone to bear fruits of victory of a decree, it will take 10 years. So, we have to revamp our Judiciary with regard to commercial matters, especially when foreigners come to invest in Sri Lanka. We could give investor confidence by ensuring that through a vibrant Judiciary, we would be able to protect their rights.

Also, Hon. Minister, a lot of investors have come to Sri Lanka because there is a dispute recognition mechanism of arbitration. But, there are issues with regard to arbitration. If you take the Arbitration Act, there is no provision to get interim relief and certain arbitrations take a long duration of time. Also, arbitration has become a very costly process. So, I think there needs to be a centre set up by the State by which the cost of

3125 3126

[ ]

2025 19

arbitration could be dealt with. When you take leases in Sri Lanka, the leasing agreements have an arbitration clause. When an agreement has an arbitration clause, a small-timer cannot go to court and therefore, the leasing companies do what they want because one could only go to court on a question of law. Normally, an average citizen does not have the resources to go for arbitration because he has to pay for the arbitrator and also the centre. And, invariably, a small-timer does not understand the process of arbitration. But, when you take the legal mechanism of court, a small-timer is protected. So, I would ask you to have discussions with the Ministry of Justice and National Integration with regard to the Arbitration Act and bring in a ceiling, where we could have provision for transactions of lease holders and hire purchase agreements which are less than a certain value to not be referred for arbitration. Therefore, Hon. Minister, I would like you to consider the aspect of revamping our Judiciary for investments and especially the amendments I suggested for the Arbitration Act. We need to bring in changes to entice investors because otherwise, whatever you do, Hon. Minister, with regard to promoting investments and starting new industries, we would not be able to succeed. Unfortunately, you see a great number of foreign investors who have got played out; You must be having various foreign nationals coming and saying that they got played out by their local partner. So, unless the Judiciary is vibrant, they would never have recourse.

Also, if we look at our Judiciary, we have the District Court, the Magistrate's Court and the High Court. There are over 15 vacancies which have not been filled in the High Court from April last year. So, if we do not have a strong Judiciary, we cannot -

( ) (The Hon. Wasantha Samarasinghe) Is it relevant to this Ministry?

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha, PC) It is relevant because unless these judicial appointments are made, there would be law's delays and it would also be relevant to an investor who comes into Sri Lanka in this sense.

( ) (The Hon. Wasantha Samarasinghe) Bring it to the notice of the Minister of Justice and National Integration.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha, PC) I am bringing it to your attention as the Minister of Trade, Commerce, Food Security and Co-operative Development because no investor or person would start a business, if there are law's delays. Therefore, I am bringing it to your attention so that you could tell the Hon. Minister of Justice that there are 15 vacancies in the High Court. The Judicial Service Commission should

recommend the names to the President so that they could be appointed. - [Interruption.] So, mention it to the Hon. Minister of Justice, if you can. The judges also like to be promoted from the Magistrate's Court to the District Court, from the District Court to the High Court and from the High Court to the Court of Appeal and from the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court. We need a vibrant Judiciary and these judicial appointments must be made. From April last year, appointments to the High Court have not been made. I am not blaming anybody. The Judicial Service Commission should recommend names to the President so that those appointments could be made. Otherwise, there would be law's delays and if there are law's delays and the court process is not working properly, investors would have problems investing in Sri Lanka. Therefore, I respectfully urge you to look at the suggestions I made with regard to the Judiciary. Also, Hon. Minister, every Magistrate and every District Court Judge likes to be appointed to the High Court. There is an age limit of 60 years for them to serve in the High Court. It is in the interest of the country that I am saying this. You need a vibrant Judiciary to entice investment. So, in that scenario, I beg you to look into the aspect that these 15 judicial appointments to the High Court are made as soon as possible.

Thank you, Hon. Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Wasantha Samarasinghe) Hon. Member, I will convey your message to the Minister of Justice and National Integration.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha, PC) I am very grateful to you for that, Hon. Minister. Thank you.

.19/2022 IMPACT OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION CIRCULAR NO. 19/2022

ON THE PUBLIC SERVICE

[6.00 p.m.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. M. Nizam Kariapper, PC) Hon. Presiding Member, my Adjournment Motion is on a very important matter.

The unexpected and forced retirement of senior executive-level officers was mandated by Public Administration Circular No. 19/2022 dated 14.09.2022, reducing the retirement age of public officers to 60 years with effect from 01.01.2023. This decision has had serious consequences, particularly in specialized services such as the Sri Lanka Foreign Service. As a result, there is now a shortage of professionally qualified diplomats to represent Sri Lanka in missions abroad and serve in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism and the Department of Commerce.

3177 3178

2025 19

Recognizing this critical shortage of senior officers in the Public Service, the then Government had previously issued Public Administration Circular No. 02/2022 dated 06.01.2022, extending their retirement age to 65 years with effect from 01.01.2022. This extension was formalized through Government Gazette Extraordinary No. 2263/5 dated 19.01.2022. The extension was necessary, Sir, because many branches of the Public Service had not conducted regular recruitments due to the budgetary constraints caused by the economic difficulties the country was facing at that time. However, the former Government of President Ranil Wickremesinghe reversed that policy through Public Administration Circular No. 19/2022, reducing the retirement age again to 60 years. That decision is similar to throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

Sir, the negative impact of this policy was immediately felt, particularly in professional, management and technical services. For instance, the Sri Lanka Railways, already suffering from a severe shortage of engine drivers, was forced to re-employ retired drivers on contract basis while continuing to pay them full pensions, an outcome that increased government expenditure and proved counterproductive; they have to be paid both the pension as well as a contract-basis salary.

While it is undeniable that the Public Service is overstaffed, the real issue lies at the subordinate, clerical, non-executive and minor grade levels. However, at the senior executive level, the situation is entirely different.

The Attorney-Generals Department, where I cut my teeth in the legal profession as a State Counsel, has also been severely affected. Media reports indicate that over 29,000 pending files have further exacerbated the backlog of court cases due to the shortage of prosecuting officers. The specialist medical doctors, one of the affected groups, successfully challenged this decision in the Court of Appeal, which ruled that their services should be retained until the age of 63. A similar approach should be adopted for other critical services which face shortages.

I am aware that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism, of all the Ministries, is struggling due to lack of experienced senior executive-level officers and is finding it difficult to identify skilled personnel for foreign missions. As a result, the Government is now reverting to the past practice of appointing individuals from outside the Sri Lanka Foreign Service, a practice that was previously criticized by Members of your party, which is now in Government. I have a copy of Hansard, in which this practice was questioned some time ago. A viable solution, as demonstrated by the Ministry of Health, would be to re-employ experienced senior officers who were forced to premature retirement due to Public Administration Circular No. 19/2022 rather than resorting to external appointments. Sir, by doing so, the retired Sri Lanka Foreign Service officers affected by this policy could be re-employed while retaining their seniority at the time of their enforced retirement. That would allow the Sri Lanka Foreign Service to benefit from their expertise, while also reducing Government expenditure by suspending pension payments for those re-employed on contract basis.
