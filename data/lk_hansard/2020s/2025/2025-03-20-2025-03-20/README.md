Hon. Presiding Member, as I mentioned, the Budget is prepared to manage the revenue, the expenditure, investments and to ensure transparency and accountability in its implementation. In this Budget, we are focusing on Rs. 4,200 plus billion of primary expenditure with a Recurrent Expenditure of Rs. 2,970 billion, a Capital Expenditure of Rs. 1,315 billion and Rs. 4,550 billion for public debt servicing, which comprises of interest payments of Rs. 2,950 billion and debt repayments of Rs. 1,600 billion. This leads to a total expenditure of Rs. 8,835 billion for the Government, as estimated for the year 2025.

Madam, in order to facilitate this expenditure and investments, the revenue generation is expected to be to the tune of Rs. 5 trillion or Rs. 5,042 billion, to be prcise, and out of the remaining amount of Rs. 3,800 billion, Rs. 3,100 billion is expected to be financed through domestic financing and Rs. 700 billion through external financing, which is a total of Rs. 4,000 billion. breakdown ; , , .

, . , , about the implementation of the Budget. Under the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, predominantly, there are 23 departments engaged in implementation and facilitation activities of the Budget along with the other relevant ministries and departments. Just to mention a few of those departments, the Department of National Planning, the Department of Fiscal Policy, the Department of External Resources, the Department of National Budget, the Department of Public Enterprises, the Department of Management Services, the Department of Development Finance, the Department of Trade and Investment Policies et cetera and the list goes on.

At todays Committee Stage Discussion, we expect our team to cover the respective angles, the observations and the implementation of the Budget, as to how we are going to achieve the targets in this Budget during the year. I will take time to speak on Public Debt Management because, as I mentioned earlier, a significant component of our Budget comes through borrowings, to be precise, nearly Rs. 4,000 billion, of which Rs. 3,100

3237 3238

billion would be through domestic financing and the remainder would be from external sources. To ensure that we do it in a transparent manner, a Public Debt Management Office has been established for regulation and the Office has been resourced. It is important to note that a Public Debt Coordinating Committee and a Debt and Cash Management Committee have also been established to facilitate this service. Similarly, domestic borrowing operations and issuance of loan guarantees are already in motion. The external borrowing operations currently conducted by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka are to be taken over by the Public Debt Management Office. Similarly, several other arrangements are being made to ensure that public debt management is done in a transparent manner.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Next, the Hon. Chathuranga Abeysinghe. You have 12 minutes.

[1.28 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Chathuranga Abeysinghe - Deputy Minister of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development) Hon. Chairman, this particular Ministry is the heart of the economy, taking the country towards growth. Now, we are at a juncture where we need to shift from failed neoliberal economics to development economics, and this Government is taking steps to make those critical changes.

Whilst we discuss and debate about these economic transformations, it is very important for us to understand the context of our economy. The Members on the other side, who try to advise the Government and find fault with the proposals we have made, brought about a country with a Rs. 2 trillion deficit, with which they continued and for which they had no solution. They also created a country with a trade deficit of US Dollars 8 billion, which continued to increase and now, we are in trouble because currency issues came up through that trade deficit. Then, we went into borrowing ISBs from the market. Especially, ISBs worth US Dollars 12 billion were borrowed by the regime from 2015 to 2019, which is

now talking about economics, bringing this country to this bankrupt position. Also, mismanagement and corruption brought us to where we are today.

Now, it is time for us to present a Budget, a financial plan, which would allow Sri Lanka to recover. We all understand the limitations and the constraints that have been forced upon us by the framework of the IMF Agreement, which this Government has agreed to move along with for the next three years in enabling us to repay our debts by 2029. We know it is difficult and that our hands are tied, but with the limited amount of manoeuvring we could do, we know how to transform this country. What we need to understand is that these kinds of constraints on the fiscal policy were there even when the corrupt rulers were ruling this country for the past 70 years.

So, at this point, how do we handle these constraints on the fiscal policy differently? One way is to look at it from a perspective of optimization and the other is to look at it from a perspective of prioritization. From an optimization perspective, now, we are trying hard to collect the revenue which has been lost. Tax collection has never been efficient in this country. Those who now talk here, making various suggestions and giving ideas had been unable to improve our tax efficiency and to widen the tax net. But, now, we are trying to use certain taxes which have the least bearing on the public and investments. We have to impose certain taxes in order for us to achieve a revenue target of 15.1 per cent of GDP.

At the same time, ours is the only Government that has a focus on reducing wasteful expenditure, which has been continued with over the years unnecessarily wasting the tax money collected. To give a very simple example, in our Ministry, on the line item of the Minister, we have spent only Rs. 11 million for the last four months, whereas in the previous year, there had been an expenditure of Rs. 28 million. So, from a perspective of prioritization, now, we need to prioritize on our Recurrent Expenditure, with regard to which we cannot do much. But, we can do it in terms of the 4 per cent Capital Expenditure.

So, how do we really prioritize it in terms of bringing about the economic growth that we target? We all, as people who read about economics, know that there are contractionary policies as well as expansionary policies.

Now, we are in a position to run expansionary policies in this country. But, we can run them only from an expenditure perspective because we have no control over the tax perspective. When you give tax benefits, tax reductions, all that would induce the economy to grow. Unfortunately, we are not in a position to use tax as a tool, but only to use expenditure as a tool. A lot of expenditure that is purposefully made, especially the salary increase that is proposed for public servants, which would amount to Rs. 110 billion, is going to impact directly on the economy as a consumption. And, it would also reduce the disruptions which could be expected from the Government Services as people would be happy to work for this change. At the same time, the expenditure

3267 3268

2025 20

we are making on welfare, giving packages to the suffering people is also going to directly impact on the economy. That is again going to improve the aggregate demand of Rs. 749 billion, which has been planned for. If we go back to 1936 and look at the economic theory of Keynes, he has stated in his book The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money that if you ask your employees to dig a hole, fill it back and dig it again and you still pay them money, that would boost the economy. So, that is the nature of Government expenditure; that is where growth is going to come in this year, especially on the Capital Expenditure of Rs. 1.3 trillion and also on money we are paying directly to the people.

Now, we are also investing in the digital transformation which the previous governments failed to do. It is mainly to ensure that transparency takes place and it is also going to bring us a huge tax collection. So, we are banking on expanding the tax net through this digital transformation. Therefore, Rs. 21 billion has been allocated for this purpose, which the previous governments failed to do. It is also going to increase the efficiency of doing business; the ease of doing business would increase with this digital transformation carried out by the Government. At the same time, the investment that has been made on the road network and transportation is about Rs. 433 billion and they are going to boost the economy in multiple ways because, when you spend on construction, that has a trickle-down effect, improving circulation of money and providing access to industrialization across the country, which we did not have earlier. Then, if we take investments in the energy sector, especially by the private sector, the main intention is to bring down the energy cost by one-third in the next few years.

The investment that has been planned in this Budget to reboost or support the SME sector is about Rs. 39 billion. These are huge investments, which the previous governments did not prioritize on. Then, the investments on health and education are going to give us the next phase of growth with the creation of the skills required. Especially on technical skills, Rs. 15.1 billion is going to be spent. The expenditure on health is going to give us a strong, healthier workforce to drive this economy forward. Also, enough attention has been given to R & D - research and development - as well. So, you can see the differences between the economic theories that had been adopted previously and which have been adopted in this Budget? Now, if we look at the Rs. 4.3 trillion this Government is going to spend both on CapEx and OpEx, there would not be a single rupee to be wasted. We know the amount of wasteful expenditure made by previous regimes, which were never directly related to economic growth. But, we can assure that the Rs. 4.3 trillion that is going to be spent through this Budget would be directly connected to economic growth.

Then, the previous governments or regimes always wanted to sell off all the SOEs under them without a strategic view on SOEs and without thinking about the additional income to the Treasury. We are not going to sell off our SOEs, but to strengthen them through public-private partnerships and through strategic investments and

strengthening these businesses to greater heights, we are also trying to improve the revenue brought to the Treasury.

Also, the economic theory that the market could solve all the problems has been proven false, not only in Sri Lanka, but even in the US. They have realized how they should protect their country by moving away completely from that free market thinking. So, this Budget is designed in a way where the State, the co-operatives and the private sector would play a significant role in making a competitive environment for business and also giving the best to the consumer through competition. All these three institutions or structures, along with regulations, would continue to ensure that there would be a competitive environment for the goods and services catered to the people.

At the same time, we are opening the economy for FDIs for technology, capital and market needs. There is a huge amount of potential for Sri Lanka, especially in the energy sector, which needs to grow. Then, we expect maritime investments across our seas under "The Blue Economy." Then, with regard to industrial parks, there is an opportunity for the private sector to come in and play a vital role. So, there are many sectors that have been opened up for foreign as well as local investors to be part of.

Sir, this is a historic moment for Sri Lanka. After 1997, we are shifting the economic model of this country to achieve the greater heights that have been achieved by India, Vietnam and South Korea. The economic theories of the experts who had ruled this country have brought us to our knees, losing a certain amount of sovereignty in terms of our economic capabilities. We are leaving behind the neoliberal economics plus the corrupt political culture we have had in the previous decades and are moving towards a development economic process where the Government would play a pivotal role. So, this particular Government would be structured and made efficient with the political will to make changes, especially in creating a strong base for production, agriculture, exports and trade through strengthening our co-operative system and going forward. Therefore, I urge the public to become aware how this Budget is designed. It is an integrated approach.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Chathuranga Abeysinghe, your time is up.

( ) (The Hon. Chathuranga Abeysinghe) Sir, give me 30 seconds, please.

Not only the Ministry of Finance, but also all the Ministries are integrated in this process. There is a cohesive, integrated strategy and we would invite industrialists to be part of this strategization that would

3269 3270

take place within the next six months in order to achieve the Rs. 45 billion targeted revenue through exports by 2030, to make the economy to continue to grow at a 6 per cent rate and to create a better life for everyone in a prosperous country.

a cheap commodity that gives a quality service to investors. As a result, they have been able to match the two and export labour to other countries.

() ( , ) ( () - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harini Amarasuriya - Prime Minister and Minister of Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education) Say that in English.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I will say that in English as well. Hon. Prime Minister, I am talking about the practicability of the situation. Tell the IMF that a 36 per cent tax is ill-affordable. It is not permissible in a country like this to tax people beyond their expectations. So, ensure that we pay nothing more than 20 per cent. Why do they not tell the same thing to OECD - we are not a signatory to that - countries? So, on that basis, ensure that we pay no more than 20 per cent. The PAYE Tax also should be subjected to a maximum of 20 per cent. Your loss of revenue may be around Rs. 100 billion, but that Rs. 100 billion could be caught up through much more motivational aspects. Now, since I communicated that in English, I hope it would be communicated in the same manner, that the IMF would get this message. If the Government cannot do it, we, as the Opposition, would help you to force them. After all, it is the Sri Lankans who have got to live in this country, not the IMF. There are only one or two countries which have come up as success stories through IMF programmes. Korea is one of them and the other countries are still trying to. Sri Lanka is a close second because we had the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe rendering a gigantic service to bring back Sri Lanka from a debt-ridden country to what it is today, but he had to pay the price. The operation was successful, but the

3289 3290

patient died and today, you all are in Government. That is the issue. So, what I am basically saying is, if you do not do the same thing, the same operation will have to be rerun for the second time.

Today, there is some flirtation going on between two of the biggest world leaders, Donald Trump from the United States and Vladimir Putin from Russia. So, when the world talks of sanctions on Russia, we, Sri Lankans, get scared and say, We cannot use Rubles even though it is not a prohibited currency. Why do you not ensure that we get Russians to come and spend in Rubles here? Ensure that we collect that, buy the fertilizer, oil and coal that we require. Then, you are basically utilizing what they bring. They are unable to spend their currency. They like to come and spend it here. But, they do not have the capacity to do that and they have to buy dollars from the black market. So, ensure that you adopt it as a policy to allow Russians to bring Rubles into the country and have it as foreign exchange. It is not a prohibited currency. You only have to ask the Central Bank to get up from its sleep because their job is to ensure that we take the path with least resistance. So, why create a problem when there is no problem? It is the country that is facing a problem with the innocent younger generation waiting to see how they could get integrated into the economy. So, these are opportunities that you get. Therefore, ensure that you dictate to them that this is our necessity and ensure that you get it done.

Sir, businesses are profit-driven; economies are policy-driven. If business confidence is lost, then that would be the biggest problem we would have. So, ensure that we create business confidence. Today, investments do not get tax relief. It is a lagging area. So, why would anyone come and invest here when there is no reciprocal benefit

3293 3294

for them? Today, our business ventures, whether it is MAS or Brandix, have gone and invested in India simply because, there, they are getting everything for nothing while Sri Lanka is charging 36 per cent on their global earnings. Remember, when it comes to tax on global earnings, it is zero in Singapore; it is also zero in Bahrain and Dubai. So, ensure that we emulate them to some degree and also that we get back to the correct track.

Then, US President Donald Trump is pursuing deglobalization. We have got market access to the US. So, ensure that we protect that without any commitments, that we discuss with them and open up our market.

Hon. Presiding Member, at the outset, I think I have a duty to convey my wishes and congratulations to the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva. So, I am taking this opportunity to extend my sincere congratulations to the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva on his insightful and well-articulated speech. His contribution was not just a critique, but an educational discourse delivered in a civilized and gentlemanly manner, laying out the realities of our economic situation with clarity and depth. At a time when the nation faces immense economic challenges, the Hon. (Dr.) de Silvas approach was refreshing; his speech was fact-based, constructive and solution-oriented. He did not merely point out the shortcomings of the Governments financial policies, but also proposed a practical pathway for economic stability and growth. That, we have to appreciate.

It is this kind of discourse that elevates the quality of debate in this House, Sir. Rather than engaging in political rhetoric - sometimes, I am even shocked and surprised to see Government Members of Parliament doing it - the Hon. (Dr.) de Silva upheld the true spirit of Parliamentary democracy by putting forward rational and well-researched arguments which would benefit not only the Members of this House, but also the public at large.

In fact, , . -

Now, I will get back to the economy of this country. Actually, after I was inspired by the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silvas speech, I did a little bit of research. I was watching it on live telecast since we were involved in handing over the nomination papers, which ended at 12 o clock. We were tensed as to which nomination papers would get rejected; it was another tension, but be that as it may. If we look at the Japanese economic model, it is one of the success stories in the region and we all talk about that. So, let us talk about something else for a change. One of the first things they looked at is a skilled workforce and human capital. Then, technological infrastructure and innovation, the business environment and the regulatory framework, an advanced financial and banking system and tourism and hospitality development. Those are the benchmarks that they looked at. They also look at their cultural and soft power influence, focus on high-value services, sustainable urban development and smart cities, cultural adaptability and global outlook. Sometimes, one may wonder why, when we are almost at the bottom of the list, we are looking at number two. We have to look at number two. When Singapore was at the

3327 3328

[ ( ] ]

2025 20

bottom, they looked at us. They did not, at that time, say, We cannot aspire to be another Sri Lanka since so much of resources are found in that country and we are a small nation. Actually, it was a small island used by ships which went across to dump things. It was virtually thrown to the dustbin by Malaysia. But, Lee Kuan Yew took the challenge and brought it up. So, there is no reason why we should not look at Japan as a model because a service-oriented economy seems to be the way forward.

Sir, whatever we say goes with the new culture that we all are aspiring to achieve.

, system change 90 . , NPP - National Peoples Power - system change . . , , . , , change . . , .

Sir, I was just looking at the challenges we would have to face when we try to follow the economic model of Japan and the high standards they have set. We lack a skilled workforce and there are also educational gaps. But, are we not geared to achieve those skills? . , . ; we are one of the countries with a highly skilled people.

But, they are not the problem; the problem is the educational gap. I think the Hon. Prime Minister is looking into it. We have to gear ourselves to a level where the education is changed to have a more skilled workforce. Once that is done, we also can aspire to become another economy like Japan. Why not?

The next challenge is, weak digital and technological infrastructure. Leave alone the Presidents new initiative of digitalization. I said this earlier also. Whether there is a Ministry for digitalization, whether there is a policy by the Government for digitalization or whether we like it or not, people are going towards digitalization. Today, I was able to get all this information at the click of a button. My son and daughter are more skilled than us and their children will be far better than them. We are also looking at the artificial intelligence. So, in those scenarios, we have to and we can reach that target. The Sri Lankans are the best when it comes to technology. The only thing is, they use it for the wrong purposes. So, digital and technological infrastructure is the second challenge we face and which, I believe, we can definitely get over.

Then, there are regulatory and business environmental challenges. That is what we are now talking about. When the Hon. Presiding Member looks at the clock, I get worried.

Then, we also have limited foreign direct investment and funding.

I think a lot was spoken about that. I am not an expert in that subject. I think the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva spoke about it; many Members of the Government spoke about it. Now, with the new development in the Port City and the harbor in Mattala -

Whereupon THE HON. KITNAN SELVARAJ left the Chair, and THE HON. SPEAKER took the Chair.

. ( . ) (The Hon. M. Nizam Kariapper, PC) Hon. Chairman, it is a privilege for me to speak when you are in the Chair.

The fifth challenge we have to look at is, the underdeveloped financial and banking services. I think it is something that I am also a bit worried about. I also spoke about the absence of a fully-equipped development bank which should work beyond profit-oriented policies. We have to look at it very seriously.

Then, the next challenge is, infrastructure and connectivity issues. Yes, that is where the capital expenditure comes in. We have a lot of challenges, but we have a railway network. We have a lovely railway network. But, what have we done with that? - railway tracks - . region infiltrated railway tracks . . , ? , , . , , high toll ? , they must be encouraged to use the railway. We have the railways, but we are not making the best use of it.

Then, dependence on a low-value system. That is another challenge we face. In traditional sectors, most service jobs belong to low-value sectors. So, that has to be changed.

Then, political and economic instability. Now, we have come to a point where there is a big change. The recent economic crisis should be a thing in the past, not something which should take place again in the future. With political instability, our people decided to go for a

3329 3330

system change and selected you all and us. Remember that and do not try to have this system change exclusively for yourself. It was not only for you that people voted; they voted for us as well. About 95 per cent of the people voted for us as well. That is why, today, except for the Samagi Jana Sandhanaya, all other political parties have become minorities. That is the reality, accept it. By the outlook of the people, the Samagi Jana Sandhanaya is the alternative. So, look at that reality. That is what I am saying. From a political point of view, political stability has set in. Then, we must get over the economic crisis as well.

You also have weak global integration and trade policies. That is where I think we have to concentrate on more. We have limited trade agreements with other countries and we have to interact with global superpowers to have trade transactions. So, I would say that if Sri Lanka wants to achieve a developed service-based economy like Japan has, we must invest in education and vocational training, improve digital infrastructure to boost IT services and e-commerce, simplify business regulations to attract FDIs and startups, strengthen financial and banking services, modernize transport, diversify high-value services like tech and ensure political and economic stability.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Member, you have two more minutes. . ( . ) (The Hon. M. Nizam Kariapper, PC) Thank you, Sir.

I think if I wind up today without talking about Gaza, I would be failing in my duty. Sir, I stand before this esteemed Assembly to express my profound condemnation of the Israeli regime's recent and egregious violations of international law through its renewed military operations in Gaza. The abrupt resumption of hostilities marked by relentless airstrikes and ground offensive has resulted in the tragic loss of lives of over 400 Palestinians, predominantly women and children, during this sacred month of Ramadan.

This blatant breach of the ceasefire not only undermines the prospects for lasting peace, but also constitutes a direct assault on our shared humanity.

The aggression extends beyond Gaza's borders. Recent reports indicate that Israeli forces have conducted operations in Yemen, Syria and Lebanon, targeting civilian populations including women, children and humanitarian aid workers. Such actions exacerbate the humanitarian crisis and represent flagrant violations of international law, Sir. The international community cannot remain silent in the face of these atrocities.

Sir, it is deeply concerning that the United States continues to provide their unwavering support to Israel,

thereby emboldening its unlawful actions and perpetuating a cycle of violence. So, that has to be condemned.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Member, your time is over. . ( . ) (The Hon. M. Nizam Kariapper, PC) Sir, just give me half a minute and I will finish up.

This endorsement not only fuels further conflict, but also undermines the foundations of peace in the region. I call upon the Arab leaders and the broader international community to unite in resisting these policies. Finally, I urge the Government to take a clear stand on this matter.

Thank you very much, Sir, for giving me this opportunity.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) The next speaker is the Hon. (Dr.) Rizvie Salih. You have 11 minutes.

[4.57 p.m.] () ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rizvie Salih - Deputy Speaker and Chair of Committees) Hon. Chairman, thank you very much for the time allotted for me to speak on the Votes of the Ministry Finance, Planning and Economic Development during the Committee Stage Discussion.

As you know, Sir, in order to bring this country out of bankruptcy and for us to come out of this pathetic situation we are in, we have earmarked tourism as one of the main avenues that generate income and foreign exchange for this country. Our economic stabilization depends on the tourism industry, for which we have ambitious plans and projects, portraying our country as a preferred tourist destination to the world.

However, Sir, the article in the Daily Mirror of 18th March, 2025 titled The bane of over tourism and Israel occupation in Sri Lanka is indeed very disturbing. It gives details as to how Israeli tourists who come here on tourist visas operate businesses outside our legal system and framework. They operate illegally on tourist visas and engage in physical encounters with locals and other foreigners. They have opened shops, restaurants and hotels, for which bookings are made in their own country. That does not benefit the Sri Lankans or our economy to any significant extent or bring in foreign exchange. News

of their actions and violent behaviour is spreading the world over.

Sir, you know that Sri Lanka is a very sought-after surfing destination. We have beautiful beaches in places such as Hikkaduwa and Ahangama in the South, while in Arugam Bay and other places in the East also, we have beautiful beaches and seas ideal for surfing. In fact, Sri Lanka is a surfing paradise during the whole 365 days of the year. We have encountered those Israeli tourists and received many complaints about how they dominate the surf, how unfriendly they are and about their violent predisposition towards other surfers.

When it comes to surfing, Sir, there are etiquettes in sharing the waves. We have also heard about how these tourists from Israel dominate the surf without allowing other surfers to be there, so much so that a lot of surfers, as I was told and as this article also goes on to state, might overlook Sri Lanka as a surfing destination in the future. Sri Lanka is also known the world over as a land of smiling people and a haven of peace and tranquillity. I would like to mention, Sir, that this article even goes on to state that the influx of Israeli tourists started after October, 2024 because there are many countries in the world which have prohibited them from coming. So, that is one reason why they have chosen Sri Lanka. This article further goes onto state, I quote:

They are patronizing their own places; they dine at Israeli restaurants, they go for Israeli parties, stay at hotels run by Israelis and since some of this money is siphoned off straight to Israel, Sri Lanka is not benefiting from it.

Again, I would like to say that this article carries the headline, I quote:

The bane of over tourism and Israeli occupation in Sri Lanka.

Sir, now, I would like to mention about the events that have been unfolding in Gaza in recent times. One of the most catastrophic humanitarian crises of our time is unfolding there right now. I stand before this august Assembly today to bring to your urgent attention the renewed Israeli aggression against the Palestinian people in Gaza, which began on 09th March, following the breakdown of ceasefire negotiations. Sir, we are witnessing not merely a military conflict, but an unprecedented assault on innocent civilian lives. According to the latest reports, since the escalation of violence in the recent days, 436 Palestinians have been killed, a significant portion of whom had been innocent civilians. The breakdown includes at least 183 children, 94 elderly individuals and 125 men with an additional 678 individuals sustaining severe injuries.

The coordinated strikes executed by Israeli forces have targeted 23 specific sites that had previously been designated as humanitarian safe zones.

Sir, the Palestinian Ministry of Health reports that since October, 2023, at least, 49,547 Palestinians had been confirmed dead and 112,719 wounded, meaning that one in every 50 individuals had been killed and one in every 20 had been wounded in Gaza. The humanitarian

situation in Gaza has deteriorated beyond imagination. Medical infrastructure remains severely compromised with only 12 hospitals supported by UNFPA delivering services in Gaza. We must acknowledge the gravity of this situation: there is pure genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. According to Amnesty International, Israel has unleashed hell and destruction on Palestinians, brazenly continuing with total impunity.

Sir, the rhetoric from Israeli officials is deeply disturbing. The Israeli National Security Minister has openly admitted that conditions in Israeli prisons have indeed worsened. He has dismissed the basic rights as perks for Palestinian detainees.

Sir, Sri Lanka has historically been supportive of Palestine. Governments and leaders of the past had always maintained a friendly attitude towards the people and the cause of the nation of Palestine; they have stood up for the rights of the Palestinian people. Today, we have the Leader of the House, the Hon. Bimal Rathnayake, as the President of the Sri Lanka Committee for Solidarity with Palestine. Similarly, past leaders of political parties which held governments in Sri Lanka had always been sympathetic towards and upheld the cause of the Palestinian people. When former Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas visited Sri Lanka in 2008 and 2012, he expressed gratitude for our support throughout Palestine's struggle for international recognition. Our nation supported the historic UN Resolution that enhanced Palestine's status and continues to support its application for full UN membership.

Sir, as I conclude, I urge this House to reaffirm Sri Lankas commitment to international humanitarian law and human rights. We must condemn the genocidal actions taking place in Gaza, call for an immediate ceasefire and demand accountability for war crimes.

Today, in Sri Lanka, we see synagogues mushrooming in all parts of the Island, which has angered the local population. These are people who have opened businesses, cafes and hotels in our country after coming on tourist visas. So, if this is left unchecked, we may again face a disastrous situation in our own land.

Our nations moral authority stems from its historical support for just causes. So, let us stand united in solidarity with the Palestinian people and work towards a peaceful resolution that respects the dignity and the rights of all. Let us take meaningful steps and actions which would, in the long term, benefit our nation, not just economically, but also in its image as a compassionate, multi-cultural and multi-ethnic land which stands up for those who are unable to do so themselves.

Sir, once again, I would like to thank you for the time afforded to me to speak on this very important topic, which is significant not only to us, Sri Lankans, but to the world as a whole.

Thank you, very much.

() ( ) ( () - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harshana Suriyapperuma - Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning) Hon. Chairman, in the morning also I indicated how the Budget has been structured for its benefits to go down to the citizens of this country. The Hon. Members of the Opposition spoke about how they look at the so-called challenges and I would like to address some of them.

Firstly, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake made suggestions with regard to the SriLankan Airlines and spoke about how it is currently being managed and the way the Government has allocated billions to settle its debt, which, in his opinion, may not be the right thing to do. Sir, we need to understand that those legacy debts have been incurred over several decades through mismanagement, politicization and without allowing competent people to contribute to the development of those institutions, whereas the present Government has segregated it. The President has very clearly mentioned even during the Budget Speech that there would not be any more funding from the Government for its operational purposes. We can see light or kind of sparks coming up at the end of the tunnel because of the way the present management is handling that entity, trying to restructure its operations and engaging capable people to ensure that we get the best out of it. And, its debt has to be serviced. That creates confidence that the Government is not abandoning any of its obligations and is clearing any debts the country has incurred.

Sir, another matter that was raised was parate execution. Since the current Government took over, we extended the relief package that was introduced through the banking mechanism for another 12 months period.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, before I start, may I seek a clarification? Will the Meeting of the Committee of Selection be held after this Debate?

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) I am informed that they are going to start in a little while.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Then, there would be no representation from the Opposition. That Meeting earlier scheduled at 5.00 p.m. has been postponed to 6.00 p.m. If it could be postponed till 6.15 p.m., it would be appreciated because you all changed the time three times.

3355 3356

2025 20

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) I understand. However, the Hon. Speaker has already left for the Committee.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) But, there would not be any representation from the Opposition.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) I will bring that to his notice. [6.04 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I also rose to add on to the suggestions that had been made earlier. I do not think we need to labour the points all over again as they have already been discussed. However, all I could say is that it is a suicidal tax that has been brought in. Nice words do not make much of a change, if the ultimate objective is to earn revenue.

If I may refer to what the Hon. Deputy Minister mentioned, previously, had you been an accountant, a logistics service provider giving consultancy to those overseas or a doctor or an engineer contracted by those outside the country for your knowledge and you were charged under Section 15(c)(c) of the Act, you were granted an exemption. And why was the exemption granted? Because your knowledge had been imparted or services had been rendered outside the country and not within the country. So, there was a fillip given to bring the monies into the country. But, now, what would this suicidal attempt do? You have said that you are going to do very much more, but you have not done anything. The moral obligation of walking the talk is far greater than simply introducing something and then claiming, "Now, it is justified across the board." In that case, you may charge 45 per cent across the board for everyone, rather than applying 15 per cent to one group and 45 per cent to another. It does not stand to justification when you say, "I am only looking at it from the country's perspective. I am pointing out what is beneficial and relevant for the country. You should not allow the IMF to come here and tell you, "You have got to do this." They have rendered us a good service. As I said, when a country is in bankruptcy and in order to get out of that situation, you need the IMF. But, that does not mean it is a panacea for all ills.

Let them be the guiding force, not the ruling force. You have been elected to govern based on the mandate given by the Sri Lankans.

So, why do I differ here? Here is a situation where you are trying to achieve a target of Rs. 10.2 billion or 0.04 per cent, which is going to be detrimental to you. You

should do it in a way that would benefit us because it is highly contested and I am saying this for the sake of the national economy. If you are an accountant providing services to the Maldives, Dubai and Singapore, why should you bring that money back to Colombo and pay 15 per cent, where, peviously,you were paying zero per cent tax? We require foreign exchange, not a meager Rs. 10 billion in order to get to that equation process. The Hon. Minister and the two Hon. Deputy Ministers, I am sure, would be looking at this from a different perspective. Hon. Deputy Minister(Dr.) Anil Jayantha, you could simply add 25 cents to the petrol price and earn Rs. 12 billion to Rs. 15 billion, rather than wasting time on this. Discouraging the smaller players is one thing, but what about the bigger ones? They will simply ensure that invoicing takes place in a country with zero taxes, as I mentioned this morning.

I would now like to table* this document which gives countries where global income is tax-free, countries which have territorial tax systems, countries which have no personal taxes and some others which offer a Special Residency Tax System.

If I may mention the countries with no personal income tax, they include the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Monaco, Vanuatu and Brunei, where one could register. So, it would be like what the textile industry did when they were imposed on unreasonable taxes despite requests not to do that. What they did was, they floated a company in that country and had their parent company here. Their sales invoices are sent to that country while only their labour requirements are sent from here. Then, what is your earning? Your earning will be Rs. 100, minus Rs. 99, leaving a profit of one rupee. But previously, your turnover, the foreign exchange which came into this country, was US dollars 1 billion. These are the areas where the impractical use of this suicidal tax, as I would call it, is going to be done. So, both the theoretical and practical aspects need to be addressed.

The next one is the Territorial Tax System. Singapore has worldwide earnings, profits made outside Singapore, 100 per cent tax-free.

Then, you are telling this House that you do not charge any tax within the Colombo Port City, but outside the Colombo Port City, you charge 15 per cent. Now, tell me the rationale behind this particular decision. Under the same tax system that you brought in to Parliament, you say that a 40-year tax holiday would be granted to investors in the Colombo Port City. I like that. Do not say that we are opposing this. I am opposing the imposition of the tax, but I am supporting the zero per cent tax provided to the Colombo Port City because that is what would attract all professionals to come here. We would love to see Indians coming to Sri Lanka utilizing that pay no taxes policy and bringing in foreign exchange to

3357 3358

this country. Why is Dubai what it is today? It is because a lot of people visit that country and Dubai earns more dollars through that than they do from oil and today, that country is a success story. That is what we also must do here. So, do not listen to some white clerks from the IMF who come here and tell us to charge 15 per cent as tax when you could earn billions of dollars by imposing different taxes as the revenue you want.

Peter Brewer, the former IMF Mission Chief for Sri Lanka, who had finished his term, did a very good job under difficult circumstances, no question about it. But, it is not individualistic egos that are required here. The IMF is an institution which must do what is good for the country and what is good for the institution. When it comes to our country, we must negotiate and not do what is imposed by them. What they basically say is, Do what I say, but do not do what I do. The Hon. Prime Minister and some Cabinet Ministers are here. I once again tell you, this is something injurious to the country. So, please ensure that you rectify this. If a lawyer renders his service to India, why should you tax him for that service rendered outside our country? He has the entrepreneurship to go out and bring foreign exchange from outside to Sri Lanka as dollars. On that particular basis, you say that there would not be an imposition of taxes when it comes to banks. Well and good. In any case, it is a system where you register your self-declaration of income by November and you have to pay tax from there onwards. So, Hon. Minister, these are things that are going on.

Now, I quote what SLASSCOM Chairman, Mr. Nishan Mendis, whom we laud for doing a fantastic service, said to the Sunday Observer of 16th March, 2025: "SLASSCOM targets US Dollars 5 billion revenue and plans to set up 1,000 start-ups by 2030. I am sure the Hon. Deputy Minister is one of the prime movers of that. I am not an expert on IT, Hon. Deputy Minister, but what I have heard is that you are moving things in the right direction. But, why do you not tell your Colleagues that this is a suicidal tax that they are bringing forth? You are trying to earn only Rs. 10 billion from that and I gave you an example how you could collect US Dollars 20 billion. All what you have to do is, add 25 cents more on the price of petrol. As the oil prices have come down, in any case, if you add 25 cents more, then, you would get at least US Dollars 17 billion. That is the way to collect revenue.

So, the younger generation who went astray in 1972, 1983 and 1989 due to the fact that there had been no jobs created because of the economic impact, looked at other alternatives. When they find that they cannot enjoy here the benefits of what they legally earn, they may adopt three different approaches. The first one is, they would keep the monies outside the country. The second one is, they would have a dummy company set up somewhere else and get the money to come in. The third approach is, they seek overseas jobs, go abroad and bring the money in. Then, you lose the foreign exchange you made on the travel out of the country. So, what are we doing? We are trying to save pennies and lose billions of rupees on the

other side. Are we saying this just to oppose the Government? No, Hon. Deputy Minister. I am sure you have more practical knowledge than that. So, ensure you look into this issue and address it.

Now, I would like to quote what SLASSCOM has stated. But, I cannot quote the exact date they mentioned that. They say that this is an inimical tax on the industry. So, they are calling upon the Government to relook at it. Once again, they have two options. They will move from the John Keells building. Earlier, they decided to take 20 floors, but they had taken only 10 floors and now, they are going into the Colombo Port City. Then, that 15 per cent charge you have been targeting would not be obtained. So, what is the fun? That is why I said in the morning that we should be radical in our thinking, we should emulate ourselves and export ourselves out of the debt crisis we are in. We have a debt of US Dollars 100 billion with 53 per cent local debts and the balance being foreign debts. Of those, some have been rescheduled.

If we do not gear ourselves to ensure that we earn foreign exchange to the tune of US Dollars 3 billion from today till 1928, US Dollars 6 billion and US Dollars 9 billion from then onwards, we would run into a debt crisis again. I am warning you all now, because otherwise, you would say that as knowledgeable people, we did not advise. So, let us work together to solve this problem. I am telling you, think about this in a different way.

I would like to say that in 2016, when we were discussing about the 16th tranche of the IMF, they came up with the same impositions. We told them, "Sorry, we cannot do that and there must be some rationality. You can give your ideas, but sovereignty should be in our hands." And, we asked them, What is the revenue required? They mentioned that it was an "X" amount. The current Secretary, Mr. Siriwardana, Dr. Samaratunga, who was the then Secretary and Mr. Seneviratne, who is the DST now could bear testimony to that. People like them got involved in that process. We told them, "You give us the ideas and we will earn the revenue", and they got what they wanted and we got what we wanted. They proposed the imposition of this tax and we said we cannot do it. Then, in 2018, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera was the Minister of Finance. They imposed that and in six months, he withdrew it because of the inimicalness of this tax. I would not saying anything else since I have labored enough on that.

Then, when it comes to the 45 per cent tax on betting and gaming, my belief is that you must have a regulatory authority first and with that regulatory authority in place, you can get this types of things coming in. You are adding 40 to 45 per cent just because it is a low-hanging fruit. But yet, 45 per cent is not the answer. If that is the case, then, you can make it 75 per cent. You are detracting from the real sources of getting it into superior sources. So, once again, when we tax, there must be an equitableness as well as sustainability. When, it comes to taxes on gaming and betting, these are sin taxes, I would say. It is well and good, if we ensure that we get the optimum benefit out of collecting revenue. But, if you are

3359 3360

[ ]

2025 20

only imposing that 45 per cent just for the sake of imposing it, then you could have imposed 80 per cent and be morally happy that you have put a figure.

It is also the same with the Ceylon Tobacco Company. This company basically has 85 per cent of taxes on its production. On the basis of this, the more prices you increase, it goes into the substitute that is there. Out of the Rs. 9 billion worth sticks, - you cannot call those cigarettes, but sticks - Rs. 1.9 billion is the actual revenue of the cigarettes sold by the Ceylon Tobacco Company. Rs. 7 billion is the revenue from beedi. I am sure there are Hon. Members representing the Kegalle District and the beedi industry is a thriving small industry there. What do they do? There is a legally registered beedi suppliers/manufacturers association led by Mr. Lakshman, as I can remember, and the other lot is spurious, who basically import this without paying any taxes anywhere. They themselves have told them, "Legalize us so that we could afford to pay legally and ensure that we come into the formal system." But, that is not being listened to by the Excise Department. If you impose 2 to 3 per cent tax on this Rs. 7 billion worth beedi industry, the beedi manufacturers say they could guarantee a Rs. 15 billion revenue. Now, instead of collecting Rs. 10 billion by imposing that tax on services exported, you could have imposed Rs. 2 tax on those people who are doing this freelancing operation and other things, collect revenue and tell the IMF that we could give you Rs. 15 billion while you wanted Rs. 10 billion from us. So, these are the areas that you need to have corrections, rectifications and practical attainments made in doing collecting revenue. So, I would like to mention once again that the imposition of the figure is yours, but the practical attainment in trying to get what we think of putting in through that tax is what we are recommending to you.

So, the next matter I want to mention is with regard to the interest rates on the savings of the senior citizens. The interest rates given to senior citizens could be compared to what we did in 2015. When we came to power, we gave the senior citizens a 15 per cent interest and if was given when we tried to drive down the interest rates for lending purposes. Because the lending rate should be single digit - we were trying to achieve a rate in the range of 8 to 10 per cent - we had a dichotomy in order to reduce the rate and increase the saving rate for the senior citizens.

So, we did two things. We had an imposition from the Ministry of Finance. We gave in to the banks, whoever who had an interest rate of 15 per cent for a deposit and capped at Rs. 1.5 million, and I still remember the difference was about Rs. 20 billion. Here, you have increased it to 3 per cent when the promise given was 15 per cent in total. When a senior citizen goes to these 1,000 branches that the Hon. Minister mentioned, he has to basically give his own affidavit. If that is accepted, well and good. But, why do you not go for Point of Sale - POS - machines? Your President spoke of that. I think, it is a good and the right thing. So, eEnsure that you invest money through these particular POS machines. Then, it would be done online. When you have that online facility, you have no problem of needing an affidavit or the actual implementation of it.

How do you know whether a Rs. 1.5 million is from one particular senior citizen, whether he is the sixty-year-old husband or the fifty-eight-year-old wife? You would not get that difference. How is that issue addressed? I think you should attend to these matters much more practically. You should look at the materialness across the board. When you impose a figure, the administration cost would be far greater than the actual receipt of the revenue. This does not seem to be followed at this particular moment.

So, all I could basically say is that ensure we have a system where collecting revenue is a must. We have targeted 15 per cent of GDP, well and good. Without running after pennies, run after dollars and millions of rupees. You have to ensure that the economy is expanding instead of contracting. Expansion of economy means, you have to develop the economy from all areas. But, if you have things happening at the moment, you would see a downward trend instead of the upward swing required. Once again, I would request you to please relook at the export services and ensure you take those up to the correct level.

Generate enthusiasm among the younger generation. IT is a thrust industry that could be shaken up. I think the President mentioned here that we need to create two million jobs in the IT sector. So, ensure that that is done by giving the younger generation freedom to operate in that area. Why do I ask you to not tax them? By imposing that, you will not be able to get the revenue targeted. That is the difference. So, instead of discouraging them, encourage them, driving them onto a motivational path and ensure that we take them to a better tomorrow.

Sir, all I could basically say is that let us bring some sense of rationality in, let us bring some logic in and let us bring some sanity at this particular moment, where there is no cash flow into the country today. You all are talking about this anti-inflationary approach while sucking out all the monies that are there. That does not help you to get the economy moving. I am saying this because we need to earn Rs. 5 trillion at the end of this year. Already three months have gone by out of this year. If you are to get Rs. 5 trillion coming in, we should have at least a 4 to 5 per cent growth expansion. In order to have growth expansion, you have to have more investments. In order to have more investments, you must have low-lending rates. That is how the small and the medium enterprises would get moving. That is why I am so conscious about these matters because we cannot afford to have anymore insurrections or civil disturbances owing to not guiding the economy in a professionally attributed manner for all of us to deliver what is required at this moment.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Next, the Hon. Anura Karunathilaka. You have ten minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Yes, Hon. Ravi Karunanayake?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, we would like to express our disapproval on Clause 3(2)(c)(a) and (b). With regard to the tax on tobacco and gaming, there is no problem. It is only to the 15 per cent tax that we are opposing. So, very clearly the taxes on tobacco and gaming are not an issue. But, Clause 3(2)(c)(a) and (b) are the Subclauses to which we are voicing our opposition. But, there is no need of taking a Vote; we only want to express our opposition.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Okay, Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, we shall note down your objection.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Yes, Hon. Member?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Again, Sir, very clearly, to the tax on tobacco and gaming, we are not opposing at all, but only to the other two subject matters under Clause 3(2)(c)(a) and (b). So, let it be very clear and do not allow it be misinterpreted anywhere that we opposed that, too.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) We shall note it down as you proclaimed. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Anil Jayantha) Sir, I move,

"That the Bill be now read the Third time."

Sir, I also request for permission to correct the language, the typographical errors, the grammatical errors, the numerical errors and the consequential amendments to the Bill.
