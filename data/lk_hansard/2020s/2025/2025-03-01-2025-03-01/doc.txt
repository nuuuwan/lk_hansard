( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Harshana Nanayakkara, Attorney-at-Law - Minister of Justice and National Integration) Hon. Chairman, I will use up 15 minutes at the beginning and keep the rest to be used later .

First of all, I would like to thank the Hon. Mano Ganesan for reminding me of the bond we had then and that bond, we will tend to continue. When it comes to national integration and reconciliation, peace between races and the chance for all of us to live in a dignified manner is my vision and my dream and that was what my

451 452

late father also wanted. That is what you also want and it will be done. So, thank you very much for mentioning that.

I must also say that when it comes to the law-making process, we do not consider all of you who are sitting in the Opposition benches as our opponents, but as our partners who work together in progress. At election times, we may be opponents, but right now, we all work for the betterment of the country.

National unity and reconciliation, peacebuilding, friendship-making are inherent in our programme. So, thank you very much, Hon. Mano Ganesan. Your observations are taken very positively.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) The Hon. M. Nizam Kariapper. You have 15 minutes.

[12.17 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. M. Nizam Kariapper, PC) Hon. Chairman, I am starting at 12.18 p.m. and will take the whole 15 minutes allotted to me.

Sir, before I proceed, I must take this opportunity to extend my congratulations to the Hon. Leader of the Opposition on two remarkable achievements of his. Firstly, after a long time, he has managed to unite the entire Opposition to oppose the Budget, an accomplishment that no other Leader of the Opposition in the recent history has been able to achieve. Perhaps with just one exception, he has orchestrated a rare moment of consensus across all the Opposition Parties. Secondly, I must commend him on his eloquent and meticulously timed 45-minute speech, which compellingly outlined why this Budget is a failure. Perhaps, his speech was so impressive that the Hon. Leader of the House wished to make him the permanent Leader of the Opposition through constitutional means! Or is it, rather, that the Hon. Leader of the House desires to make his own party the permanent governing party through constitutional means and that is why he made these remarks, I wonder? But, Sir, this is not the first time in the history that a Government in power has dreamt of keeping the particular Opposition Leader in that role indefinitely, perhaps out of a desire to maintain their own grip on power permanently.

457 458

[ ]

2025 01

This political manoeuvring is not new. History reminds us that similar tactics were first deployed by President J.R. Jayewardene, who, despite commanding an overwhelming five-sixth majority, which was 83 per cent unlike the 71 per cent majority in Parliament you have, to neutralize the Opposition. He enacted the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution, effectively forcing the main Opposition out of Parliament. Not stopping at that, he went on to strip the main Opposition Leader of her civic rights so that he could remain in power and contest the next election. Then, decades later, we saw the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa attempting a similar strategy, floating the idea of making the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe the constitutionally guaranteed, lifelong Leader of the Opposition. I distinctly remember an article in The Sunday Times at that time, its very popular "5th Column", discussing this very idea. And, now, Sir, we see the echoes of the same political ambition in the present Government. In a winding up speech of the Hon. Leader of the House, we heard similar sentiments. Perhaps, he is revealing the desire for perpetual power. But, let me caution the Hon. Leader of the House that hiHHistory does not favour those who take the people for granted.

Sir, let me list some of the failures of this Government in the administration of justice since it took control of the State machinery. First, bringing the conspirators of the Easter Sunday attack before court. The Minister in charge of public security stated that a large amount of witnesses' evidence including the testimonies from the Batticaloa Prison authorities were recorded and forwarded to the Colombo Magistrate as far back as 24th November, 2024. It has now been nearly three months since then, Hon. Minister of Justice. One needs no further hint to understand where the investigation is pointing. As the Hon. President stated last evening, the culprits know that the investigation is closing in on them. They are not going to just sit idly by. By now, the forces must be engaged in diversionary tactic. I think you all are well aware of that. So, should the authorities not act swiftly? Whether we like it or not, the Prevention of Terrorism Act is being used in this investigation. It has been used to detain thousands of Muslims for years and the vast majority of them were released, admitting that there is no evidence against them. I am sure the authorities will apply the same law to investigate and prosecute the conspirators of the Easter attack. So, why hesitate to name the accused when the evidence is more compelling? Now, it is three months since the last "B" Report has been produced in the Magistrates Court of Colombo.

Let me now say a few words about the daylight murder of Mr. Lasantha Wickrematunge. I appreciate that the Hon. President has finally acknowledged the bona fide of the Attorney-Generals role in this case when the truth has been distorted on social media through misinformation and unprofessional speculations. However, I must also acknowledge that there are some highly knowledgeable and professional YouTubers - I do not want to mention the names as they will say I am trying to advertise them - who provide insight and credible analysis.

Next, the long-forgotten murder of Dinesh Schaffter - we all have forgotten that - a crime shrouded in mystery

but clearly falling into the category of organized crime. We have forgotten the murder of Dinesh Schaffter. Sir, yet, to date, no suspects have been identified.

Then, the infamous Central Bank Bond scam. I addressed that yesterday, but let me reiterate it. The authorities must proceed with the trial in absentia - I know the Minister of Justice knows about it - under the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. We cannot wait till Arjuna Mahendran is sent here; it must start off in absentia. Extraditing a suspect is an unachievable task in the current state of the justice system because we are in a hell of a mess today. This has been deliberately undermined. However, I am confident that once the suspect is convicted, the Singaporean authorities would find it difficult to refuse his extradition.

And then, the recent series of killings clearly point to organized crimes. It seems that the people behind these murders are deciding who should be arrested and who should not be. In the murder of "Ganemulle Sanjeewa", look at how easily the shooter was arrested. Yet, the woman who coordinated the attack, who is in the centre of all the key players in that Hollywood-style shooting, remains untouched. Is she, perhaps, the Sarah Jasmin of this killing? And, we know what happened to Sarah Jasmin. Sir, I am wondering whether the same thing would happen to this lady also.

The President spoke last evening in this august Assembly, stating that these were five well-coordinated killings, hinting that they were orchestrated by an invisible hand. Does that not remind us of the meticulously planned Easter Sunday attack, Hon.Minister of Justice? I know, we all are facing a serious challenge in upholding peoples confidence in our judicial system. In fact, I was shocked - I was shocked, Sir - at what the President said while delivering his speech in Parliament last evening. Unfortunately, I went and sat where our leader, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem sits. While delivering his speech, looking straight at my eyes, this is what the Hon. President said: " . . . . . That is what he said. " , . - [ ] , . . - [ ] Not to me, but to my profession and your profession, Hon. Minister. In fact, the President was looking straight at me twice when he questioned the role of a lawyer. Then, he continued to say, Hon. Minister of Justice, " ... - , - .... . I was shocked, Sir! That was what he said yesterday. He further asked, " ? Then, he ended up saying, " . Sir, for a moment, I was shocked and speechless as a senior member of the legal profession with my exposure to the official and unofficial bars and having taken a special oath as a President's Counsel - we take a special oath, Sir - to make my services available to the State! But, I do not

459 460

think this Government is going to take my service. I am not even called upon to serve as a member of the Panel of Chairs, leave alone taking my service for the State. That does not matter. But, when I am called upon to defend the country and its integrity, I wondered how I should respond to the Presidents statement. So, leave alone the public, Hon. Minister of Justice, the President himself has lost confidence in the system of administration of justice! Please take a note of that fact. He did not spare anybody; police officers, officers of the forces, judicial officers and lawyers are being accused of creating a . That is a very serious matter. My only consolation is that the Hon. Minister of Justice, being a senior lawyer - though you are not a Presidents Counsel, I feel you are entitled it to be conferred on with your experience, both in the official and unofficial bar - would be able to put things into proper perspective and dispel any misconceptions about our profession.

Sir, I want to conclude because I have a very limited time, following the new trend set by the Hon. Wasantha Samarasinghe. He wound up his speech with the words of a song.

[3.00 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Deputy Chairperson, I wish to start by taking up the Governments thinking of an Independent Prosecutors Office. In the North and the East, there had been several cases of habeas corpus filed in the Provincial High Court in Vavuniya and those had been sent to the Mullaitivu Magistrate for inquiry and after inquiry, the High Court had given an Order in favour of the petitioners, that is, holding the military, the Army, responsible for the enforced disappearance of certain individuals. Now, the Attorney-Generals Department which appeared on behalf of the Army has decided to appeal the case. So, at the moment, it is before the Court of Appeal. But my point here, Madam, is - I am glad that the Hon. Minister is present - that if the Court of Appeal holds with the petitioners, then again it falls on the

Attorney-Generals Department to prosecute those officials, and it is the view of all those professional lawyers, counsels who have been appearing for similar cases, that there is a major conflict of interest, where the Attorney-Generals Department, that is the primary lawyer for the State, for the armed forces, is asked to go against the State in cases such as this. So, very obviously, there is a conflict of interest and in that case, the whole credibility of these proceedings comes into question.

So, if the Government is thinking in terms of rectifying this by creating an Independent Prosecutors Office, then that would be welcomed. But, very clearly, such an office has to be equipped with adequate infrastructure and resources, and the officials should have the power to directly get involved in investigations, give directions to the police, supervise the police and other investigatory bodies and also the power to directly institute proceedings against the offenders. I think those are the basic qualities that will have to be considered and it must be completely independent as well. I think the key test would be to ensure that such an office does not go down the way of the Attorney-Generals Department with regard to this conflict of interest. I, by no means, wish to cast any aspersions on the Department. Since I personally also have been in the profession - I am qualified as a lawyer although I do not practise - I know that the Department has some tremendous talent. But, nonetheless, when you are asked to do a particular job in defending the State or take the side of the State on a vast majority of cases and then to be asked to suddenly turn round and prosecute State officials, I think there is a genuine issue. So, certainly in the the North and the East, with regard to the habeas corpus cases and such, there is, definitely, a problem of credibility.

The second point I wish to raise, Madam, is the question of mass graves. In the North and the East, there had been instances where mass graves had been found. One was found in the Sathosa Building in Kokkuthoduvai and another in Mannar, just beyond the bridge, the causeway. Then, as of two weeks ago, in the cemetery in Chemmani, Jaffna, there had been skeletal remains found.

In fact, I personally went and had a look. At that time when I went and had a look, the police had not taken any action; the Magistrate had not been informed. It was one of our party members, who also happens to be in the committee of the cemetery, whom I asked to make a formal complaint to the police. Thereafter, the Magistrate got involved and the matter is now being looked into. But, with the question of mass graves, Hon. Minister, there is no protocol. To my knowledge, there is no clear protocol to handle mass graves. As a result, there is a severe shortage of funds and it is almost always the case where the Government Agent is asked to get involved. The OMP, I think, has a little bit of funds, but nowhere close to the sort of resources required for the work that has to be done by the Department of Government Analyst and the courts to have this matter looked into as a matter of urgency. As a result, because of things getting dragged on, both in Kokkuthoduvai in Mannar and now, in Chemmani, Jaffna, evidence can get destroyed or tampered with. These are questions of mass graves and

501 502

[ ]

2025 01

you know that the major accusation with regard to the Chemmani case is that over 600 people - civilians - were killed and buried in that vicinity. Then, there were accusations during the Chandrika Bandaranaike's Government that overnight, there were excavations being done. So, the suspicion is that the bodies from the Chemmani mass graves had been removed and dumped in this cemetery. So, that is a suspicion. If you do not have the sort of resources primarily to protect that area and to ensure that the evidence is not lost, a grave injustice is likely to happen. So, that is another area that the Hon. Minister has to look into.

Our Party's position is that because of the system that we have here and because of the nature of the ethnic conflict that had taken place and the way in which the conflict took place with Tamil people fighting against the State, asking for justice from the State - there is a polarization and the system has been pitted against a particular ethnic group - the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights - I think if I am not mistaken it was High Commissioner Prince Zeid who made the comment - is of the view that an internal inquiry is not feasible in Sri Lanka for the simple reason that the system has, unfortunately, been prejudiced and is no longer in a position to carry out an impartial intervention in this matter.

So, it is in that context I am raising these issues and as far as I am concerned, the evidence must be protected. You must, at least, try and protect that evidence. With regard to how these issues are to be looked at, you all have been suggesting an internal mechanism. My view is that that is just a non-starter. So, at the very least, if you could ensure that this evidence is protected and is recorded in a credible manner, I think that is the best you could do under these circumstances. I, for one, am not going to ask you to actually investigate it. I wish Sri Lanka was different; I wish we, as victims, could have said that we have credibility, that we look upon the system with credibility, but we do not. Nothing has happened so far to suggest that that situation will change. So, my request to you is that you intervene and ensure that adequate funds, adequate resources are given to protect the evidence in the mass graves so that at one point, when there is some agreement with regard to how to proceed on the question of accountability with the victims, then, this evidence could properly be used.

Madam, the other matter is with regard to another conflict of interest. If you take the current matters that are sensitive, there have been ancient worship sites that are contested in the North and the East. One is Kurunthur Malai; the other one is Vedukkunaari Malai and then, there is the matter of the ThaiyiddyTemple, which is not an ancient one. In the first two, that is, in Kurunthur Malai and Vedukkunaari Malai, the Department of Archaeology gets involved. And when the Department of Archaeology gets involved - the police are with the Department of Archaeology - it goes before the magistrate and the magistrate gives certain orders according to law. According to law, he had said that it is an archaeological site, it must be preserved and no new

buildings must come up without the permission of the court. But, despite those orders being given, there are construction works that have taken place with the police's and the military's help and the Department of Archaeology fully sanctions that; it is on the instructions of the Department of Archaeology that it is happening. The Attorney-Generals Department takes the side of these government departments. Despite the Magistrate giving Orders, this has been happening. And when Mullaitivu Magistrate T. Saravanaraja had been informed that in violation of his own Orders, there had been various things happening at those sites and he had gone to visit the sites, he was threatened. The information that came public from that Judge was that the Attorney-General himself called him and effectively threatened him to a point where he had to leave the country. He had fled the country. So, there is something here that you need to look at. The Department is asked to appear for the military, the police, for government departments and when there are sensitive cases and there is a clash, the whole system collapses. Certainly, that is our experience and that should not happen. So, for that matter also, you must have a look at this.

Hon. Minister, it is in this backdrop that several senior officials from the Attorney-Generals Department are preferred to be appointed to the apex courts. Currently - correct me if I am wrong - in the Supreme Court, out of the 17 judges, except for four, all the others are from the Attorney-Generals Department.

Then, if you take the Court of Appeal, out of the 15, eight are from the Attorney-Generals Department. The nature of their work - they are heavily tilting towards the State - is to defend the State interests. So, for them to be appointed in these numbers to those apex courts calls into question the credibility of the structure of the courts. Therefore, Hon. Minister, my advice is that you must resort to the earlier practice, where, except for the Attorney-General and the Solicitor General, I do not think anybody else should be considered to the apex court, which is the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal. The other members of the Department can be considered to the High Court and let them come up after that, but, certainly, not in the numbers and the way in which they are being appointed right now to the apex court because it is terribly prejudicial to career judges. The career judges work so hard and after 20 years of work, they can only aspire, in realistic terms, to come up to the Court of Appeal and that also, maybe, for one year or two years, maximum; that is the practice today. If you take Tamil judges, I think Justice C. V. Vigneswaran was probably the last Supreme Court Judge - or whether there is someone else now, I do not know - who came up as a career judge. I have personal knowledge of that. That is why I am mentioning it. I am certain the case is the same with regard to the Sinhalese judges. So, it is terribly unfair for a career judge to work so hard, to be transferred all over the country to the detriment of his family, to the detriment of his children and sometimes, to their education and then to find that they cannot get the reward, despite being true to their work, to reach the highest positions in their field.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I am winding up, Madam.

Criminal justice, as far as the North and the East is concerned, is the most fundamental issue today. It is because of mass atrocities and the need for justice and accountability for the crimes that were committed during the war. Hon. Minister, your Government says that an internal inquiry is what you would consider in that regard. But, your Government has not said one word as to whether mass crimes like the crime of genocide, the war crimes and crimes against humanity would be brought into law. Without the Rome Statute being agreed upon and being made into law in this country, you cannot even think in terms of having an internal inquiry. That is just the beginning. You do not have the legal will to prosecute mass crimes because you do not have the infrastructure to do it and quite honestly, you will never do it. And, your Government has said on numerous occasions, including the President himself, that he is not prepared to have one case brought before a court of law, which means there is no will. In that backdrop, if what you saying is that you are going to have an internal mechanism, it can only mean that you are going to try and ensure that the victims agree to something that does not involve criminal justice, and that is a cover up. That certainly tantamount to a cover up and you must not do that. If you going to do that, it is going down the same way as the previous governments did for the last 16 and 17 years and it makes no difference at all to the Tamils.

( ) (The Hon. Harshana Nanayakkara, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Ponnambalam, I will reply to you more in my winding up speech. But, for the time being, regarding the mass graves you referred to, I must say that we have allocated funds for the Kokkuthoduvai grave in two stages, Rs. 5.6 million and Rs. 9.6 million, and for the one in Mannar, we have allocated Rs. 2.88 lakhs only. In Colombo also, as you know, there was a mass grave, for which we have allocated Rs. 8.1 lakhs and Rs. 19 lakhs. The grave in Chemmani is a fairly recent one. So, we will definitely look into it and attend to the matter. We are going to protect all the evidence because we believe justice is for everyone, not just for the South or the North. On how we are going to approach it, we may have differences of opinion, but justice will be done to everybody, to all Sri Lankan citizens. I will reply more at the end.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson) , . 8 .

[3.28 p.m.]

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Chamindranee Kiriella, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Deputy Chairperson, first of all, I would like to thank you for giving me time to express my views on the Votes of the Ministry of Justice and National Integration, which has approximately 24 institutions under its purview, at this very important Discussion. The Ministry of Justice and National Integration also plays a crucial role in the country in ensuring fair and impartial administration of justice and upholding the rule of law.

Madam Chairperson, William E Gladstone, a former British Prime Minister, in the late 1800s famously said, Justice delayed is justice denied. I think the Hon. Minister of Justice also mentioned that in his speech. That legal maxim means, if legal redress or equitable relief available to a litigant is not forthcoming, then it is same as there not being a remedy at all. If you look at the position in Sri Lanka, I think we all would agree that there are so many delays in our legal system, which has a

507 508

huge social impact, on the lives and livelihoods of our people. Sometimes, people have to wait for generations to get some sort of redress from the judicial system.

At a research done by the Judicial Service Commission, it has been revealed that approximately 1.1 million cases are in a state of delay: in the Supreme Court, 5,600 cases, in the Court of Appeal, 6, 100 cases, in the Civil Appellate Court, 28,000 cases, in the High Court, 254,000 cases and in the Magistrates Court, 791,000 cases.

The Hon. Minister of Justice and National Integration also mentioned in his opening speech about the delays in our legal system and as I mentioned before, this definitely has a huge social impact on the accused, the defendant and all the parties concerned. A person, until proven guilty, is deemed innocent. Most people accused of serious crimes often lose their jobs and would have to face hardships in their personal relationships. Also, the cost incurred by both the accused and the aggrieved party is immense. Therefore, like I said before, we have to take steps to hasten the process.

Successive governments discussed about law's delays, but there has been no affirmative action taken in that regard. It not only has a social impact, but also an impact on foreign investments coming into the country. Again, the Hon. Minister of Justice and National Integration mentioned it in his speech. Usually, any foreign investor, before he invests in a country, conducts due diligence and a market research and often looks at the World Banks Ease of Doing Business Index. So, when you look at that Index, you will see that Sri Lanka ranks very low mainly because the time taken for contract enforcement is very long. Just to give you an example, Sri Lanka takes approximately three-and-a-half years to enforce a contract. Sri Lanka stands at 164, out of 190 countries in that Index. When you compare this time span with that of New Zealand, which tops the list, they take only six months to enforce a contract. So, if we want more investors to come into our country, we definitely need to speed up our judicial process so that it would be an incentive for foreign investors to come into Sri Lanka and invest.

So, how can we speed up the process? I would like to make a few suggestions since the Hon. Minister of Justice and National Integration has just come back to the House. One suggestion is to create an administrative tribunal because, as we know, in the Supreme Court, there are a lot of fundamental right cases with regard to teacher transfers and school admissions, by which a significant amount of court time is consumed. Therefore, I would like to suggest an administrative tribunal be established so that these courts can be staffed by retired judges since we know that, in Sri Lanka, the retirement age for judges is 65 years. Then, definitely there would be another ten to fifteen years' time during which they could provide a service to our judicial system. Also, the cases can be taken up on a regional basis so that the number which come up to the Supreme Court could somewhat be minimized.

Another suggestion is the digitization of the judicial system. The digitization of the judicial system was spoken of by the Hon. Minister of Justice and National Integration as well as the Hon. Ajith P. Perera, Member of Parliament. I know that in 2017, the ICTA together with the Ministry of Justice embarked on a court automation project and subsequently, several steps were taken to digitize the judicial process. But, I do not think it has been successfully done. For example, in High Court No. 01 in Kandy, there is just a TV and that is all. There is no system in place for virtual courtrooms. Therefore, I would request the Hon. Minister to look into that. When I talk of digitization, it is not only to have virtual court hearings, but we must also consider the digitization of the registration process. For example, for submission of documents and payment of court fees. We know that in Sri Lanka, usually, if you submit a 100-page document to a five-judge bench, you need to provide five copies of it. Depending on the number of accused-petitioners, more copies may need to be printed. So, digitization will also reduce the cost of litigation and at the same time, help speed up the process. I think, earlier, the Hon. Minister mentioned this matter as well.

Another suggestion I would like to make is, empowering judges to impose realistic costs. As you know, at the moment, judges in our legal system do not seem to award high costs and as a result, we see a lot of frivolous actions being instituted against people. Therefore, if we have some sort of guidelines in place by updating the relevant gazettes, the judges could award higher costs, which would also help speed up the process.

As a Member of Parliament representing the Kandy District, I would now like to talk about a few matters pertaining to the Kandy Bar. The Kandy Court Complex was built in the early 2000s at the request of my father, who was a Member of Parliament at that time together with the Hon. (Prof.) G. L. Peiris. Actually, it has been close to 25 years since it was built and lot of repairs are now needed to upkeep that courthouse. Therefore, I would request the Hon. Minister to visit the Kandy Court Complex in the near future and then, maybe, we can look at how we can improve that complex. The Kandy Bar is the second largest Bar Association in Sri Lanka. We have about approximately 1,000 lawyers in the Kandy Bar. However, there are only 129 offices for the lawyers and during the previous Government, Cabinet approval was given to construct a new office for the lawyers. Actually, at the very last stage, a UDA property was allocated to build a further 129 offices.

I would request the Hon. Minister to help us in this process as the lawyers are willing to use their own funds and contribute towards the building. However, the only problem is that the cost per lawyer is Rs. 3.5 million and they would like to be given a period of five to ten years to pay that amount. As you know, these contributions will be made mostly by new, young lawyers and Rs. 3.5 million is a large sum of money, especially for those in the outstation Bars. So, I would request you to consider giving at least a period of five to ten years for those lawyers to pay that amount back to the Government.

Madam, let me raise just one more matter. Usually, commercial matters exceeding Rs. 50 million are referred to the Commercial High Court, Colombo. Once again, I would request the Hon. Minister - I think you would definitely agree with me, as we are both members of the Honourable Society of Lincolns Inn - that a part-time Commercial High Court be instituted to hear commercial matters exceeding Rs. 50 million. Then, it would be easier for the lawyers in Kandy since, otherwise, they would have to travel all the way to Colombo for the hearings of those cases.

Finally, I would like to wish the Hon. Harshana Nanayakkara all the best! We would also like to extend our assistance to solve any legal issues which we may have to face in Sri Lanka.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Harshana Nanayakkara, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. (Mrs.) Kiriella, the Kandy lawyers matter, I have attended to. Two groups of lawyers came to meet me. It is a UDA land and I assisted them. However, if things are not yet solved, please lead them to me and I will attend to the matter. I fully understand.

Also, you will be happy to note that we have started a rapid court digitalization programme. As I said, Justice Arjuna Obeysekeras Committee is considering it and one of the model courts we are going to use for that purpose will be the Kandy Court. Therefore, you should be getting digitalization a little earlier than the rest of the country. So, we will be attending to that.

[4.49 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha, PC) Hon. Presiding Member, as much as I am a Parliamentarian, I am a practising lawyer and a Presidents Counsel. So, I will be able look at things in different perspectives. Madam, I rose to bring to the attention of this House certain critical matters concerning the system of justice in Sri Lanka, issues that demand urgent and meaningful reforms.

One of the most pressing concerns is the process of promoting career judges, particularly their appointments to the Court of Appeal and to the Supreme Court. While it is customary for promotions to follow the principle of seniority, it is not uncommon, Hon. Minister, for senior judges to be overlooked. Yet, in many instances, the

533 534

[ ... ]

2025 01

reasons remain unknown. Other Public Service employees enjoy strong legal protections when it comes to promotions. Every public officer, if he is not promoted or there is disciplinary action against him, is aware of it. But, unfortunately, judicial officers are a muted lot, especially when it comes to promotions to the Court of Appeal or to the Supreme Court. If their legitimate expectations are infringed, they have a right to be given reasons. If their seniority is denied as a punitive measure, it must be after a proper hearing, where they are informed of the charges against them and afforded due process. Unfortunately, due process applies to all, except to judges. So, for judges, there are no such protections. When they are overlooked, they are left in the dark with no opportunity to address any allegations against them. This is an unfortunate and unacceptable state of affairs. The legitimate aspirations of judges must be safeguarded, Hon. Minister, and a transparent system must be established to ensure fair and accountable promotions.

Furthermore, judges must be protected from unwarranted attacks in Parliament. In the recent past, we have seen Privileges being utilized in the House to attack various persons including judges. So, if any Member wants to attack another, not only judges, using Privileges, he has to be cautious. If you use Privileges to attack somebody, you are a coward because you are taking protection of your Privileges in Parliament.

The independence of the Judiciary is a cornerstone of our democracy and it must remain untarnished and free from undue attack. In todays era of social media, attacks on judges made on the Floor of the House can have far-reaching consequences, eroding public confidence in the Judiciary. So, it is not only against a person, but also against the system. Judges, by virtue of their role, cannot respond to the allegations; you make statements against a person who is muted. I say that it is a cowardly act. I am not suggesting that Parliament should avoid addressing concerns regarding judges, they should. But, our Standing Orders should be amended to ensure that such matters are first examined through a structured process. Hon. Minister of justice, if you would look at the Standing Orders, you would notice that especially with regard to judges, there is a process to be followed before a Member comes to Parliament and makes various statements attacking them.

You are a young and dynamic Minister and I am sure you will take these concerns very seriously. We have a mechanism with regard to the lower judiciary - the Judicial Service Commission - and with regard to the apex court, we have the process of impeaching a judge. So, there is a mechanism in place. But, unfortunately, without resorting to that mechanism, you see them being tarnished in this House, where they have no defence. Therefore, I believe that such cowardly acts of attacking judges in this House should not be tolerated by the House itself.

Another critical procedural issue that requires immediate attention is the lack of recorded reasons when leave or notice is not granted. Hon. Minister, you had been a practising lawyer before you took this high office.

You go to court, argue a case in the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court and there is no obligation to grant reasons for refusing leave or notice. This creates a perception that the lower courts order has the approval of the Supreme Court. When you argue a case in the Supreme Court, due to some procedural fault, leave is refused. But, the perception is that the lower courts judgment has been approved. So, it is a very dangerous road. But, I think, if amendments could be brought in for reasons to be given when notice or leave is refused, that would help the lawyers and the litigants. The current practice leaves litigants frustrated and more than the litigants, the lawyers have to answer the clients without knowing what the reasons are. I think the lawyers are more frustrated than the litigants. As practising lawyers, both the Hon. Minister and the Hon. Deputy Minister go to court and when the client asks you, ", ?, , . So, it is a very serious issue. Therefore, there should be legislation introduced to mandate that the court provides reasons when refusing leave or notice. That is something which should be taken seriously.

Madam, another issue that requires urgent attention is the Supreme Court. It is overburdened with work. Several factors have contributed to that, the Supreme Court being the sole forum for hearing fundamental rights jurisdiction. That also has to be reconsidered, whether the Court of Appeal should be given that jurisdiction. Then, direct civil appeals from the provincial courts - earlier, those appeals go from the District Court to the Court of Appeal and then, to the Supreme Court - has further burdened the Supreme Court. Also, appeals from the Commercial High Court go directly to the Supreme Court. Then, there is transfer of writ jurisdiction to the Supreme Court under various laws. When the 1978 Constitution was introduced, the fundamental rights jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was limited and the Court focused on cases of public importance. However, today, on matters relating to the National Police Commission, the Public Service Commission and even the Monetary Board, if you want to file a writ, you have to file it in the Supreme Court. It has burdened the Supreme Court further. Sometimes, in relation to the Public Service Commission and the other commissions, the Supreme Court acts as a glorified labour tribunal because it adjudicates transfers, promotions and dismissals. So, the Court is burdened. Therefore, this heavy caseload results in severe delays and prevents the Supreme Court from dedicating its full attention to matters of significant legal and public interest.

Given the expansion of fundamental rights jurisdiction, it is time to consider allocating the fundamental rights jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal, and that would allow a second appeal. Today, the Supreme Court is the final appeal court and if you give the litigant the opportunity or the right for two appeals, that would further strengthen the judicial process. Some might argue saying that there would be law's delays, but, Hon. Minister of Justice, you take consideration of this fact.

Moreover, the bypassing of the Court of Appeal diminishes its jurisprudence. As you know, in the Civil

535 536

Appellate Court, jurisprudence is created, but when it is the Court of Appeal, it is taken more seriously. One Civil Appellate Court would give one judgment and another would give some other judgment, but if it is the Court of Appeal, it would be taken more seriously. All SLRs are based on the judgments of the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court. With regard to civil jurisdiction, because the right is straightaway to the Supreme Court, judgments of Provincial High Courts are not reported. Therefore, in exceptional circumstances, the Supreme Court should serve primarily as an appellate court rather than a court of first instance. The Government must introduce legal reforms to distribute the caseload more equitably between the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal, ensuring a more efficient justice system which protects litigants right of appeal.

The Supreme Court Judges with relevant expertise should be assigned to hear cases relating to fields they are specialized in. You could create benches such as civil benches, criminal benches and benches related to public law. Today, if you take our Supreme Court Judges, they have expertise and great experience; they are jurists and they have great knowledge in various fields. Today, in the legal profession, you cannot excel in all fields. That is why, Hon. Minister of Justice, you opted to do criminal law and I opted to do civil law, because you cannot know everything. The same applies to judges. So, if we could create separate benches, their knowledge could be utilized better. So, I humbly beg the Minister of Justice to consider this aspect as well, the creation of separate benches in the Supreme Court with regard to specialized areas. Complex cases of commercial nature, are sometimes heard by judges who have no civil experiences at all. And also, judges who have, in their entire career, done only civil matters are called upon to adjudicate criminal matters. That is a very serious issue. While judges are capable of applying the law, the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, should not be a place for learning by trial and error. Therefore, It is time to establish special benches with subject matter expertise and experience to ensure informed and consistent legal precedents.

Madam, if you take the recent laws which were brought in with regard to remand prisoners, there was an Amendment brought in 2024, under which the period they were in remand was considered a part of their sentence and they could be released consequent to that; if they served a particular period in remand, that is also taken into consideration.

However, before May, 2024, there was an issue. I think you brought in a Cabinet Paper to invoke Article 34 by an Advisory Panel. Hon. Minister, I saw the Cabinet Paper and please expedite that because there are so many prisoners who are in their 70s languishing in prison. Obviously any law applies to the future. So, if this could be considered and a pardon process be invoked under Article 34, then, I am sure that would help them. And also, there is a law with regard to doing community service, where in lieu of being sent to a jail, you can ask

to be sent to do community service. There is a law, I believe, brought in the 90s. So, if those provisions can be invoked, I am sure it will ease the congestion in prisons.

Then, I saw that over 30 per cent of the Budget has been allocated for prison and prison reforms.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is up. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha, PC) Please give me one minute, Madam.

If you could shift the Magazine Prison, those resources could be used. You do not have to have prisons in urban areas. If you could create more prisons in other areas, the facilities could be given. If you take the conditions of the prisoners today, they do not have even the basic needs such as water and sanitation. Some prisoners, when they are locked up, keep a bottle in the cell in night because they cannot go to the toilet.

I respectfully urge you, Hon. Minister of Justice, to look at the suggestions I made, which, I am sure, would strengthen the legal process in this country. You are trying to create a better society and prisoners are sent to prisons so that they would reform. But, unfortunately, what is happening today is the converse. So, if you could give priority to continuous legal education and training them in various skills, we could make a great change with regard to how the prisoners are dealt with.

Madam, I thank you once again for giving me the opportunity of speaking a few words.

Anyway, let me get to the topic at hand today. The Hon. Minister of Justice is present here. I believe some of the questions I have to raised seem to be above your pay grade. I do not think you will be able to respond to that as even the President was unable to respond. So, maybe, you might have to get your politburo together and agree on something for them to come up with answers. I have repeatedly asked you all about the new Constitution. There is no response. I have repeatedly asked about the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the statement made by the Hon. Vijitha Herath, but there is no response. So, I believe these things are above your pay grade. . , . . , . , JVP politburo . . ; . . , . . , . . , . , . , . . , . , , , ,- [ ] . . .

ESTABLISHMENT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON

ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE

[6.19 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. M. Nizam Kariapper, PC) Hon. Deputy Speaker, with regard to the constitution of a Select Committee on the Administration of Justice, I would like to move the following Adjournment Motion:

"There is growing public concern regarding the administration of justice, leading to a loss of confidence in key institutions responsible for upholding the rule of law. The primary institutions involved in this process include, (1) the Police, as the main investigative authority, (2) the Attorney-Generals Department, as the State prosecuting office, (3) the Judiciary, which ensures the implementation of justice."

Additionally, there are other essential institutions such as the Government Analyst's Department, the Bar Association of Sri Lanka and the Department of Prisons. They all play a crucial role in this framework.

"At present, there is a lack of understanding regarding the respective functions of these institutions - not only among the public but also among parliamentarians - resulting in misunderstandings and misgivings. Many of these institutions suffer from severe resource constraints, including a shortage of officers, particularly within the Attorney Generals Department. Furthermore, there is a significant lack of seniors, experienced professionals in the field, as many leave in search of better career prospects."

Recently, I happened to meet some of my former officers at the Attorney-Generals Department. They were all talking about going out for better careers.

That is going to be a bit of a problem for us.

"Compounding these challenges, public trust in these institutions has been undermined by delays in the justice process."

That is the biggest problem. We say, justice delayed is justice denied. And, you know very well that there are the number of cases filed and the number of cases disposed of in a particular year. I think the Minister of Justice knows about it. The numbers must match. When they do not match, we will end up having a big backlog of cases. For example, in Singapore, they always match. Sometimes, their system is more efficient that there are more cases disposed of than the cases filed in a particular year.

"Members of Parliament often make pronouncements targeting these institutions, possibly to appease their electorate."

We cannot help it, that happens.

"This is a dangerous trend that further erodes credibility and weakens the justice system.

Therefore, I propose the establishment of a Select Committee on the Administration of Justice with the objective of preparing a report for implementation on the following matters, among others that may be included later:

1. Expediting Pending Criminal Cases -......."

There is a huge backlog.

"..... Exploring ways to accelerate the resolution of pending criminal cases within the framework of the Law."

That should be done within the existing Code of Criminal Procedure.

" 2. Fast-Tracking Investigations and Indictments - Ensuring prompt investigation and filing of indictments in major crimes that have shocked the public, such as the murder of Dinesh Shafter, the masterminds behind the Easter Sunday attacks and the recent underworld-related shootings."

Sir, I mentioned this earlier also, that it has been ten years since the Central Bank Bond scam happened; the murder of Dinesh Shafter was in 2022 and the Easter Sunday attacks was in 2019.

"3. Enhancing Trial Efficiency - Developing more effective mechanisms for filing indictments and charge sheets is essential to ensuring timely trial conclusions. For instance, under the amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure in 2013 and 2022, the Attorney-General has the authority to file a direct indictment and request a special jury. These provisions help eliminate delays by dispensing with the non-summary procedure. Additionally, it is a well-established principle that jury trials should proceed without interruption-even on Saturdays and late into the afternoon - allowing trials to conclude within a maximum of 10 days from commencement."

So, you dispense with non-summary procedure and request for a special jury. Hon. Minister of Justice, there was a provision brought in 2022. For the first time, the Attorney-General can ask for a jury. Sir, it was only the accused who had the right to generally say "I should be tried by my peer", asking for a jury, but, now, the Attorney-General can ask for one. I will tell you why it is important for the Attorney-General to ask for a jury. Say for an example, there was a murder that took place, shocking the public. He will never be able to get out of a jury trial when it is tried by a jury of seven ordinary people. He has no chance of getting out of that conviction. So, that will also bring people into the judicial system. I have a good example. When I was in the Department, I have prosecuted in the Badulla High Court before the Justice Vigneswaran, who subsequently came to Parliament. I concluded that within five days. When we concluded it, it was 8 oclock in the evening. Within five days, the trial was over. Then as the defence, I have done one jury trial in Jaffna before Justice Ilanchelian, who recently retired. Hon. Minister of Justice, we started it on Monday and every day, we worked until 8 o'clock in the night. You know that when you are in a jury, you cannot get out of it. By 10 o'clock on Saturday night, the matter was over. Within eight to nine days maximum, the matter would be over. This is what people are expecting. So, there is a provision like that. Again, I will come back to the Motion.

" 4. Engaging Specialists - Facilitating the engagement of specialists, either through hiring or obtaining the honorary services, to assist in investigations and the preparation of charge sheets and indictments. "

I think there are so many people who are willing to give their services on honorary basis to this Government, especially to assist investigations and the preparation of charge sheets and indictments. We have to have it.

573 574

2025 01

Otherwise, the Attorney-General would not be able to cope up with the backlog they are having.

"5. Establishing Provincial-Level Prosecuting Offices - Integrating the Police Legal Division and the officer of the Attorney-General's Department at the provincial level."

Additionally, you can provide ad-hoc financial provisions to recruit temporary State Counsels at the senior level in the provinces. You can retain retired High Court Judges and some retired State Counsels who will work at the provincial level so that they need not send the documents - advice files - to the Attorney-General. There is a huge number of advice files pending in the Attorney-General's Department.

So, what I am saying is, let us have a Select Committee crucially to restore public confidence in the justice system, ensuring its efficiency and effective function. I urge this House to consider this Motion seriously and appoint a Select Committee.

Sir, when a Select Committee is appointed, it could call in the Attorney-General, officers from the Judiciary and the Government Analyst's Department and ask them why this has happened and why they have not been able to file indictments. I am sure even the Attorney-General can be summoned. Then, there would be an official, transparent method of asking these questions. We have to resort to this method one day. Also, I must mention that there are so many Members within the Government who could serve in this expert Committee. I can mention one name, the Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Kaushalya Ariyarathne. She is a very renowned and accepted person in the legal profession. Then, there are so many backbenchers who want to do some work. We will work day and night. There is nothing political in it. We are worried about this situation and we have to restore public confidence in the administration of justice. So, I urge this House to consider appointing a special Select Committee to go into this matter. Thank you very much.

What you and I both know is that if you opt for a jury trial, even today it will be finished in five days. But nobody opts for jury trials. - [Interruption.] Yes, true. . . , . Because when an animal is starving, it is not going to pull the cart.

. 100, 200 . But they are overloaded with work. , 606 . 250 . Criminal side prosecute ,- You know the amount of work they do. I will read out just a little list of things. I mean, you and I both did these things. - [Interruption.] Of course! Now, if you take the challenges, the Attorney Generals Department functions with half cadre vacancies despite all difficulties. So, we must respect them.

, , . , . , . . . ? , , , .

So, Hon. Deputy Speaker, it is the duty of the National People's Power to bring back credibility to the Hon. Attorney-General, the system of justice and all actors involved. We, as a Government, are aware of the massive challenges ahead of the Attorney-General. There are 97 officers assigned to the Criminal Division. However, there are only 93 officers in active service. Accordingly, 66 officers are engaged in criminal prosecutions in High Courts and only 27 senior officers are allocated with duties of supervisors. These officers are attending to the advice sought by the investigative agencies while making appearances in court on a daily basis. Supervising officers are required to attend daily court appearances, do supervision of junior officers and give instructions to various investigation agencies. Similarly, the junior officers are engaged in prolonged and complicated trials in High Courts on a daily basis. Similarly, they are required to submit reports recommending charges or discharges with regard to investigative materials.

The Attorney-Generals Department perform a professional duty, which is not a mechanical process - you and I both know that - and such process warrants dedicating

579 580

time and resources. Almost every officer attends to their duties even during weekends and public holidays. Even I did it; I am sure you, too, did. - [Interruption.] The State Counsels assigned to outstation High Courts do not have staff except for their office assistants. , . That is, to fill all cadre vacancies in all levels of the Department, consider granting special allowances for officers and staff who attend to work during weekends and public holidays and consider having joint training sessions with foreign prosecutors to gain knowledge and expertise required to prosecute different offences. Therefore, , , . . ; . . , . Then, those officers who work at the Attorney-Generals Department, too, have family lives, but they are hardly getting time to spend with families; there is no quality time for them. - [Interruption] Thank you. Therefore, , , . , . . , , .

As I was telling earlier, we are taking all the steps necessary.To prevent Government Analyst's Departments delays, we are recruiting more. They are also struggling without staff. , recruitment . , salary structure - - to be honest, we cannot retain talent with this level of salaries. So, we have to consider the judicial service as well as the Attorney-Generals Department as a special category. ? , . .

Now, I am a Minister in charge of two departments which I have no control of; they are independent. One of them is the Judicial Service Commission and the other one is the Attorney-Generals Department. And, they should be independent and I will continue to fight for their independence and will not let any politician intervene in it, whether they be in the Opposition or the Government, because that is our Holy Grail, so to speak; that is our temple of justice. , . , , .

, . Specially, we have to be in touch with the Judicial

Service Commission and get their guidance because they have plans. Judicial Service Commission , , . , . , , . . , , . . . . But, we are not going to criticize any judicial officer, any officer in the Attorney-Generals Department or in government service without giving our full support because we are in one team, .

, you know that we are bringing in an Amendment for the Criminal Procedure Code. ? , . , 1] . - audio visual links - , . , . , , fast-tracking of investigating indictments, ensuring prompt investigation without an undue delay so that available evidence would not be erased. This is entirely the duty of investigators and observations should be called from the Department of Police.

. . . But, as my Colleague, the Hon. (Ms.) Lakmali Hemachandra, said, this maybe a little premature at the moment. So, let us feed the system because we have identified the shortages. Believe me, the professionals who are involved in this work - the judges, the Attorney-General and other court staff - know their job. They just need help. No Government has helped them genuinely. Therefore, we are going to give them that material and resource help first. Thereafter, after about a year or two, if you still feel that things are not moving, we can resort to further measures. Everybody is talking about, I am not blaming anybody, the Judiciary in the UK, how it happens in Australia and Singapore. Please give us a Treasury like Singapore; please give us a Treasury like England and I promise you a Judiciary like England. ,- [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Nizam Kariapper?

581 582

[ ]

2025 01

. ( . ) (The Hon. M. Nizam Kariapper, PC) I have also proposed establishing provincial-level prosecuting offices.

( ) (The Hon. Harshana Nanayakkara, Attorney-at-Law) Yes, thank you. I will address that.

We had the first discussion with His Lordship Justice Yasantha Kodagoda attending and guiding us very well. We are now putting a Cabinet Paper to appoint a committee for the establishment of an independent Prosecutors Office. It is a serious business, departing from the traditional system, although we had it earlier. I am not going to sit here and tell you exactly how it is going to happen. Then, what that committee is for, if the Minister has decided everything? That committee will attend to it. So, there will be new recruitments, changes of laws, but one thing I told the committee at the beginning was that in our policy document, we had a vision. Our vision is to decentralize prosecution to provinces.

Not only that, what about the Government Analysts Department, decentralizing the Department to the provinces? Basically, some certain administrative delays may have to be attended to. So, we, on a policy basis, have proposed that, but I am going to leave it ultimately in the hands of the experts. The only reason why the Judiciary is malfunctioning, if at all, is when politicians without the subject knowledge are trying to be heroes and to make decisions. That is where the problem is. So, let the professionals handle it.

. ( . ) (The Hon. M. Nizam Kariapper, PC) And some YouTubers. ( ) (The Hon. Harshana Nanayakkara, Attorney-at-Law) Yes, some YouTubers.

I present some papers to the Cabinet. When I go through those files, I look at where the committee recommendation is and who had said so. When I inquire my staff first, it is shameful.

Therefore, we - this Government - are hell-bent on protecting the independence of the Judiciary, the Attorney-General and the JSC and we want to establish the rule of law. Therefore, we will definitely look into all those matters.

Sir, I will finish off by saying this. I think the best thing would be to talk about the matter further at our Ministerial Consultative Committee and if there is any issue, then will take it up from there. Okay?

. ( . ) (The Hon. M. Nizam Kariapper, PC) Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Harshana Nanayakkara, Attorney-at-Law) Thank you, Sir.
