Whereupon THE HON. SPEAKER left the Chair, and DEPUTY SPEAKER [THE HON. (DR.) RIZVIE SALIH] took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Chairman, though I sounded a little too angry, I hope the Hon. Leader of the House would not take it very personal. In fact, this has affected me because I am a Member of Parliament who have been in this House for 30 years without a break and I have five Members of Parliament under my purview. Last time, the JVP had just three Members, but I, as a Party Leader with so many years of experience, have been denied my place in the Parliamentary Business Committee because of this rule the Hon. Leader of the House is insisting on. I am only asking the Hon. Prime Minister and the Hon. Leader of the House, because you are the leader of this Chamber, to reconsider that. We all are there to critique you in a very responsible manner and the space in the Parliamentary Business Committee for Party Leaders should not be denied in this fashion; this is not a good example. I hope the Hon. Leader of the House would not take it very personal and would resolve this issue without much difficulty and causing unnecessary harassment to us, Party Leaders in this House.

Having said that, may I now come to a very important statement made by the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs because it is the first time that this Government has placed its policies and programmes before the international community. Particularly, I refer to the Statement made by the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs before the Human Rights Commission. I would like to say that the decision of the Government to dispatch a Ministerial delegation to Geneva to engage with the Human Rights Council, its membership and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights must be welcomed. What is more positive is, unlike the abrasive and ill-considered statements made by the previous Governments in 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2024, the statement made by the Hon. Minister Vijitha Herath has refrained from directly reiterating Sri Lankas withdrawal from HRC processes and in particular, its Resolutions. Rather, it spoke about engaging with the Council and taking actions to make progress in the human rights arena supplemented by technical assistance, upon request, from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. So, that, I am praising; it is a good thing to engage with the Human Rights Council unlike the previous Government, which disengaged and refused to abide by the Human Rights Councils directives or requirements. It is not a very strict procedure. There is a way in which the Human Rights Council functions: there are periodic peer reviews by other nations interested in maintaining human rights standards in this country.

When your party was being seriously impacted by actions of State terror, of course, you all took up arms to achieve your political objectives. But, what happened then? There were serious actions taken and several thousands were killed. Those days, when the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara were going to the UN Human Rights Commission - you know that history - to appear against the murderous actions by the then UNP administration, they were detained; their documents were confiscated. There were human rights cases filed in the Supreme Court. So, engaging with the UN Human Rights Council is very important, and this Government is doing the right thing.

45 46

I would like to critique some of the areas as well. It does not need to be overstated that dedication to constructive dialogue and cooperation with the international community is a must for any government, certainly a must for a country still reeling from the aftermath of economic instability. To impress the human rights community with the recent efforts towards reconciliation, including infrastructure development in the Northern Province, consideration of recruitment of Tamil-speaking youth to join the police service and the Budgetary Proposal to make significant financial allocations for upgrading libraries, including the historical Jaffna Library are all symbolic actions, Hon. Prime Minister. You have to go beyond symbolism. These are things that previous governments, too, talked about, but, in action, you have to prove that you are not going to be partial in your attitude and that you would try to be inclusive in your approach. That has to be proven by your conduct, not just by these symbolic actions.

The Government has often declared that efforts would continue towards a people-led and people-centric national transformation under the Presidents stewardship. There are significant deviations from promises made in the Manifesto as well as in the speeches of Government leaders during and after the elections. It would do well not to play the words people-led and people-centred in the context of envisaged national transformation too much in the international arena since in the absence of definitive and well-meaning action, they may risk falling into the category of much-discredited home-grown solution. That was the term used by the previous administrations. They used to say, "We will solve the human right issues with our own home-grown solutions." I can see this Government, too, is slowly moving towards certain attitudes. Some elements in the bureaucracy and the establishment are trying to misdirect you, give you wrong advice to use nationalistic, high-sounding words and be very patriotic. In the name of patriotism, sometimes, genuine reconciliation is denied. Please do not go down that path. You have taken the right decision to abide by the UN Human Rights Council's recommendations and to engage with them. But, in engaging with them, you have to be more realistic.

The Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, in his Geneva Statement, has mentioned the importance of strengthening domestic institutions such as the Office on Missing Persons, Office for Reparations, Office for National Unity and Reconciliation as well as establishing a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. But, it is important to clarify to the victim community and other stakeholders, most importantly to this august Assembly, what practical and meaningful measures are being envisaged or initiated to establish sound policy and legal frameworks that could lead to strengthening these institutions. Much more has to be shared about the truth and reconciliation mechanism the Government has showed renewed interest in.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Rauff Hakeem, you have one more minute.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Chairman, most of my time has been taken by unnecessary cross talks.

Since, time is limited, let me move onto this other matter. Hon. Prime Minister, I read somewhere that the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs had said a few days ago that they are discussing the drafting of a new Constitution and putting it to a Referendum. You all have given an election promise about a new Constitution. Yesterday, we were at a discussion summoned by Mr. Karu Jayasuriya on behalf of the National Movement for Social Justice. The late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thero initiated the National Movement for Social Justice. At that discussion, there were several legal luminaries and even former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga participated.

There, Dr. Nihal Jayawickrama pointed out that if the entire Constitution is to be overhauled, there is no need to submit it to a Referendum. That may be a moot point when it comes to the entrenched provisions of the Constitution. But, still, Dr. Nihal Jayawickrama has repeatedly held that position. Prof. Savitri Goonesekere was also there. She was also talking about the salient features, particularly about the immunity of the President and various other provisions being removed. Particularly, the Executive Presidency is a moot point. There have been several promises made regarding that. Well, I hold a different point of view.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Rauff Hakeem, can you please wind up? Your time is over.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Okay, Hon. Chairman.

Therefore, some clarity has to be given to the Constitution-making process. That has to be an inclusive process; that cannot be done unilaterally by the Government. You have to engage with the Opposition; you have to engage with the public; there has to be public sittings. There had been several attempts earlier. Therefore, Constitution-making has to be an inclusive process. The Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs has said about it in Geneva and has talked about the inclusiveness of the Government. But, inclusivity has to start from this House, giving due place to the Party Leaders in the Committee on Parliamentary Business. I hope the Hon. Prime Minister would bring saner counsel to prevail and see that our due place is assured to us in important Committees. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) The next Speaker is the Hon. Prime Minsiter. You have 18 minutes.

[11.46 a.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Hon. Chairman, actually, it is a very important Committee Stage Discussion that we have today because a lot of the institutions under discussion cover governance issues in this country. Parliament also comes under the institutions discussed today.

Parliament's main role, I believe, is legislation. And, this Government had a mandate to bring in a new Constitution. If I am not mistaken, that was an election promise, that a new Constitution would be enacted and the Government would abolish Executive Presidency. But, however, we are yet to hear anything in that regard from the Government. When we met the President, we

55 56

[ ]

2025 27

were told that a new Constitutional process would be started. I do not know, but there is so much ambiguity behind that as well. Whether it would happen within three years or start after three years, we still do not know. But, I saw that the Cabinet Spokesperson had mentioned that the priority for the Government is to, first, work on the economy and that the constitutional changes could happen later. Very recently, after the Foreign Ministers speech in Geneva, there was an engagement with some international groups. When they asked me about the Constitution, all I had to say was that the Leader of the House had said that the Hon. Sajith Premadasas name will be included as the Leader of the Opposition permanently in the Constitution. That is the only thing that this Government has said about the new Constitution. But, the mandate given to you and the promise made was to come up with a new Constitution.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Harshana Nanayakkara, Attorney-at-Law - Minister of Justice and National Integration) . . rose.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Hon. Minister, please respond after my speech. I also saw another statement which said that the Hon. Minister has received Cabinet approval to amend, change or replace the PTA. The Minister in charge of justice and national integration, the Hon. Prime Minister and most Members of the NPP or the JVP, whichever that may be

now, were of the view that the PTA must be repealed, not replaced. I was told by my most senior Members that, at one point, some of them were even willing to discuss what an alternative - the CTA or the ATA - may look like, but the JVP/ NPP was of the view that the PTA must go, that there should be no replacement of the law. But today, the Hon. Minister is saying that they have received Cabinet approval to repeal the PTA or to replace it.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) They refused to take part in the meeting.

( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) The Hon. Ponnambalam says that you all even refused to take part in a meeting to discuss the replacement of this law; Hon. Prime Minister, you all have refused to take part in a meeting to discuss the replacement of this law. But, now, how can you be a part of a Cabinet that discusses something to replace this? Not only that, the PTA had been repeatedly used on three occasions since President Anura Kumara Dissanayake came to power, if I am not mistaken. The first occasion was, when there was an incident in Arugam Bay. That whole incident is also a big problem. In the interest of time, I cannot mention that here today. I think the second occasion was around the Maarveerar Naal over a social media post and the third one, I think, was when the people involved in the incident of "Ganemulle Sanjeewa" had been detained. You spoke about a moratorium for the PTA, rather the previous Government did. So, what is the difference between you all and them? Are you all succumbing to the pressure that is exerted on you by the forces, the deep state? Are you all falling into the trap of the deep state to continue with this law?

When the Hon. Vijitha Herath went to Geneva, I was expecting him to say something about the repeal of the PTA. Nothing! I thought he would speak about accountability and setting up the Public Prosecutors Office. Nothing! Hon. Minister, is there a difference of opinion between you all? You can respond to that also after my speech because I only have a few minutes.

Then, as the Minister of Justice and National Integration, tell us about the new Constitution. Are you all going to bring in a new Constitution now or are you all going to just stick to putting the Hon. Sajith Premadasas name as the Leader of the Opposition? Is that the only concern you have right now regarding the Constitution?

Even with regard to accountability issues, there is nothing about the people who had been subjected to enforced disappearances. You all have said about the OMP, the ONUR and all those mechanisms are rejected by the victim community. At least, on the accountability side, have you even considered a domestic judicial mechanism? Have you even discussed that in your Cabinet? I do not think so because if you did, Geneva would be the forum where the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism would have mentioned that.

. . , efficiency - because there is a perception. There is a perception of conflict of interest because the Attorney-General plays a couple of roles. On the one hand, he is the adviser to the State and attends to constitutional matters and on the other, he is the prosecutor. So, even civil organizations working in these areas have suggested to us that it is democratically suitable to establish a separate institution for public prosecution. Therefore, it is for that purpose, Hon. Chairman, that, keeping in line with our promise - if anyone looks at our Manifesto, he would see that we have promised an independent Prosecutors Office; we have promised it - we hope to establish it. The Opposition kept on saying that we are not doing what is in the Manifesto, but the truth is anything but. So, it is in our Manifesto and we are establishing it, not because we are angry with the Attorney-General or we do not trust him, but it is a matter of policy for efficient prosecution and to do justice to people.

Sir, those two things, I touched upon simply because those are the misinformation they raised in Parliament with their high voices. There are many other allegations, which I will not go into because I need to save my time to participate in this Committee Stage Discussion.

[4.18 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, I wish to make a few comments on the Human Rights Commission as its Head - Head 13 - is taken up for debate under today's Committee Stage Discussion.

You might be aware, Sir, that during the last Parliament, I took part in the Committee Stage Discussion on this very same Head and raised certain issues with regard to the functioning and the credibility of the Human Rights Commission because the Chairperson of the Commission along with some members had visited the Northern Province and met with members of the families of the disappeared, who had been protesting for years. Subsequently, when she and the rest of the members came to Colombo, they issued a statement that after the members of the Commission spoke to those victim communities, they had apparently agreed to compensation, which was completely untrue. I condemned that statement and very clearly stated on record that it was a falsehood. I made this point even in

135 136

2023, during the previous Budget. When we have doubts with regard to the police and how they work, we expect the Human Rights Commission's intervention. We believe that the police, especially in the North and the East, is heavily militarized, works on a counter-insurgency mode and therefore, is very hostile to the local population. And, the truth of the matter, Sir, is that most of the senior police officers and even juniors in the North and the East are on punishment transfers. So, their attitude towards the other people is very hostile. They do not speak the language and are heavily influenced by political forces. So, we rely entirely on the Human Rights Commission to put things right, to inquire into the misdeeds of the police; we expect them to intervene. That is the only hope we have in a domestic scenario. So, when the Human Rights Commission behaved in that manner during the previous Government, we raised those issues.

During the previous Government, when our party members and a few people were protesting in a place called Thaiyiddy, the police tried to get a ban against that protest. They went to the Magistrates Court and the Magistrate refused to give a ban. But, the Magistrate laid down certain conditions with regard to how protests must be done and we were very strictly observing those conditions. Despite that, the Palaly Police, under the directions of the OIC, went ahead and arrested members of our party, the public, journalists and lawyers who, when they heard that despite the Magistrate not giving a ban on the protest, the police were arresting people, came there. The lawyer who represented us in court came to that spot and he was arrested. Sir, eight complaints had been made to the Human Rights Commission. I will give you the numbers: HRC/ JA/ 165 to 172 in the year 2023.

On the day of this incident, we called the Human Rights Commission Representative in Jaffna and he came to the site, but the police refused him to interview the victims who were in sight. The police were literally sieging those protestors. When the Human Rights Commissions official in Jaffna wanted to meet the victims and find out information for himself, the police refused and threatened to arrest him also. Then, subsequently, after some of these protesters were produced in court and bailed out, they made complaints to the Human Rights Commission, but to date, there has been no inquiry. When we searched as to what was going on, we were informed by the Office in Jaffna that there were complaints made by the Palaly Police to the Human Rights Commission at that time saying that the Representative of the Commission in Jaffna was being influenced by us and therefore, the file was sent to Colombo. Fine, let the file go to Colombo. But, still, no inquiry at all! This Commission is very important, Hon. Presiding Member, because that is the only avenue we have. If we are questioning the legitimacy and the genuinity of the police or any government institution and we feel that we have been wronged by them, the only place we have to go to is the Commission. If the Commission is not behaving in that independent way, where they must intervene regardless of who it is, it is a problem. You must have that inquiry and if you are not having that inquiry, then it becomes a problem. That happened under the previous Government. Therefore, I

urge that this Government must emphasize to the Commission that they have the freedom and, in fact, the legitimacy to make those investigations and that seeing through those investigations is very important. If that does not happen, Sir, then we will have to question every single thing that the Government does with regard to accountability.

The Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism had gone to Geneva and made statements. He had spoken seemingly quite progressively saying that they are very serious about transitional justice, they are going to strengthen the Office on Missing Persons, the Office for Reparations and the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation, that they are also going to create legally a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which would look into wartime incidents, and will take things forward. Not a word, Sir, not one word about criminal justice! You know that in transitional justice, in criminal justice, criminal investigations and prosecutions are probably the most important part. If that is not there, everything else that the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke about in Geneva amounts to a coverup; you are trying to cover up. Without having prosecutions, without prosecuting people who committed genocide, you are trying to cover it up. That is where it is going to end up. I am saying this with utmost responsibility because on the 27th of August in 2024, the current President had publicly said that there will not be one prosecution against wartime atrocities. He had said it in public several times. Then, what are these comments that the Minister of Foreign Affairs is making? What he is saying in reality is that there will never be accountability, that it will be covered up. There will be some Commission, to which people will go, where they will be asked to cry and people will cry and then, they are supposed to hug and kiss and that is it; that is the end of it. So, this is worrisome because this is the same thing that the previous Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Ali Sabry said. He said that all of these offices, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the Office on Missing Persons, ONUR, are to cover up, to make sure that prosecutions never happen, and he bragged about it. He bragged about it! So, surely when you come into power saying there will be a system change, you cannot be saying the same thing. You cannot have the same intentions. Then, what is the system change? The President, whose Vote is being debated today, must intervene, if he is to remain credible.

If the people in the North and the East are to genuinely believe that this Government is going to, in fact, bring that system change, then you have to make sure that you act differently. Surely, you cannot say system change and then do the same thing that the previous Government did! There is something wrong there. So, that has to change.

I also want to mention a few things on the Budget itself, Sir, certain matters I wanted to bring up on the 25th, but could not because I ran out of time. There is a mention of the Government wanting to set up a development bank. I do not know whether that is an actual requirement because there are development banks

137 138

in Sri Lanka and also a lot of wastage and mismanagement. And, the answer to that is not the setting up of a new bank; I do not think that is the way to go about it. Instead, I think the Government must intervene and must ensure that that wastage is prevented and through preventing such wastage, I think there can be low-interest loan schemes facilitated. Certainly, for the North and the East, that is very important because we have very weak collaterals we can offer. So, I think that would be a recommendation I would like to make.

The second matter, Sir, is the question of microfinance. You know that soon after the war was completed, a previous Central Bank Governor, the respected Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, came public and said that it was daylight crime to allow these microfinance facilities to go into the war-affected areas because it literally got those people who were trying to recover after the war into a debt trap, and he actually recommended that the Government must, in some way, intervene. I strongly urge that this Government looks into that matter. I would certainly suggest that those microfinance loans that were taken be cancelled or at the very least, a 50 per cent waiver be ensured by the Government. I think that is very important, particularly in the North and the East. I think Anuradhapura, outside the North and the East, was also very badly hit by microfinance and it is something you all must get involved in.

The next matter is with regard to IT services. For IT services, in the past, there were a lot of incentives given and the Western Province, especially Colombo, benefitted tremendously from those. IT business outsourcing is an important economic activity which turns in huge foreign exchange. The Western Province, because it was started early, as I said, benefitted the most, but in the North and the East, it is picking up only now. Primarily because of diaspora investments, there is a considerable amount of activity in this sector in the North and the East, but, unfortunately, come this April, all the incentives that were offered come to an end. Therefore, I would like to urge this Government to ensure that those incentives, in fact, continue. If you do not want to give it to the entire country, at least, give it to the North and the East because - I said this at the Second Reading Debate also - you have to look at the North and the East in a separate way since it is a war-affected area and lags about 30 to 40 years behind the rest of the country. So, if you think that certain incentives being given to the entire country is a waste and cannot be afforded, then, at least, the North and the East must be looked at differently. That is one sector which is very actively being looked at by the youth and must certainly be strengthened. Then, one other matter I wish to state, Sir, is with regard to the Withholding Tax.

The Withholding Tax, to my understanding, has increased from 5 per cent to 10 per cent. I do not know how that is going to benefit anyone because the tendency will be not to save. The people who are going to be most affected are the elders, the senior citizens. As you know, they depend entirely on their savings and if the Withholding Tax is increased in this way, with todays

cost of living, they will have to struggle, certainly in the North and the East. If their families do not remit money from the foreign countries they are in, I think they will have a difficult time.

( ) (The Hon. Wasantha Samarasinghe) Hon. Member, can I make some clarification on that? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Yes, but do not my time. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .

( ) (The Hon. Wasantha Samarasinghe) Withholding Tax , 150,000 tax release . , 5 10 Withholding Tax . , Withholding Tax . , 150,000 . 150,000 .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I am quite happy to hear that, but I am just asking you to think, at the very least for senior citizens, in terms of waiving it off. I am raising it with genuine concern and if you think that your answer would satisfy that, I am not convinced. But my view is, at least for senior citizens, you must waive it.

Then, the other matter is with regard toAnnexure IV of the Presidents Budget Speech.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I will wind up, Sir.

Paragraph 6.4 of Annexure IV of the Budget Speech under "Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011" states, I quote:

An appeal to the TAC....."

That is, the Tax Appeals Commission.

139 140

[ .. ]

2025 27

"....... will not be permitted unless, a cash deposit of a sum equivalent to 25% of the disputed amount of assessment of tax, penalty and interest, is deposited in a special account opened by the CGIR.

That is, the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue. That sounds quite frightening. It effectively prevents anybody from making an appeal. That means, whatever that is assessed cannot effectively be called into question at all. Once again, I do not know whether this is the correct way to go about it. I do realize that in the past, people, at the slightest thing, tended to go and appeal, but to make it almost impossible for a person to appeal is unfair in a scenario where you really want investors to come into this country. They will have to pay taxes, but, if they think that something unfair has happened and if you give the impression that it is going to be difficult or impossible for them to query that, then I think it is going to have the complete opposite effect. So, that, I think, is something you should also look at.

I also want to refer to paragraph 6.8 of the same Annexure. I think these are all amendments that you all are thinking in terms of bringing in. It states, I quote:

Submission of any evidence that was not previously submitted to the CGIR during the assessment or the administrative review process and taking up new issues which were not taken/disputed during the assessment or the administrative review process, during hearing of Appeal, will not be allowed.

That sounds ridiculous, that you cannot, from the initial stage or at any stage, think in terms of introducing new evidence. I think it is in breach of our own Constitution. When a determination has already been made and new evidence, which was not previously available, becomes available, that new evidence has to be taken into account and the whole determination has to be reversed. So, if you are just trying to say that you cannot do it, then I think there is something wrong. That is definitely against the notions of natural justice. Therefore, I think that is also something you have to look at because these are all things which will actually make investors go away. Actually, if this paragrpah 6.8 of Annexure IV prevails, it will make sure that corruption and fraud get worse because you will go directly to the person at the very instance and try to get him to do things you want and it will actually breed corruption. So, I think, you need to relook at that.

Sir, I certainly want to re-emphasize that this Government cannot go down the path that the previous governments went. That was my main point with regard to the Budget when we voted against it. Our concern is that we have been wronged in the past; there are serious issues. Your Government itself says that in the last 77 years, there was racism. We, the minorities, especially the Tamils, are victims of racism. And, you cannot do the same thing; you cannot tell us that your approach to the issues of the North and the East is going to be the same as that of the previous governments and that is what, unfortunately, todays scenario seems to be.

Thank you.
