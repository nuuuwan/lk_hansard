PUBLIC FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Hon. Speaker, I present the Report of the Committee on Public Finance on the Appropriation Bill for the Financial Year 2025 in terms of Standing Order No. 121(5) (i) of Parliament (on the fiscal, financial and economic assumptions used as the basis in arriving at

1355 1356

total estimated expenditure and revenue of the Budget) only in the English language with special leave of the House and the copies in Sinhala and Tamil languages will be presented as soon as possible.

. . Ordered to lie upon the Table. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva)

Sir, let me take three minutes of your valuable time to give a brief summary of the Report. Every Member has this Report on the table right now. What we have done is, we have looked at the Budget that was presented a week ago. According to the Standing Orders, we must present a Report on the fiscal, financial and economic assumptions used as the basis in arriving at the total estimated expenditure and revenue before the commencement of the Committee Stage Discussion of the Appropriation Bill. So, this is the first Report. There is another Report that is due. We will present that. It refers to the Estimates and looks into whether the allocation of money is in compliance with Government policies. That Report, Sir, we will present to this House on Thursday morning before the Committee Stage Discussion begins.

Sir, this Report consists of 92 pages. We have gone through the Budget, looked at the assumptions on revenue and expenditure and prepared this summary Report. First, the Report refers to the legislative background upon which these Reports are presented and also the Budget is prepared. Sir, the key legislations are, the Public Financial Management Act, the Economic Transformation Act and the Public Debt Management Act. Next, we have looked at the key macroeconomic projections in the Budget for 2025. The basic projection is the growth rate of the economy, which is expected to be between 3 per cent to 5 per cent this year. We have mentioned here that, however, the growth remains vulnerable to global trade uncertainties, geopolitical risks and climate-related disruptions.

Sir, the inflation is expected to return to the 5 per cent target by the third quarter of this year, after several quarters of deflation. The relaxation of import restrictions is expected to boost tax revenue, but it may also widen the trade deficit and exert pressure on foreign exchange reserves. Here, we also discuss about ensuring fiscal and monetary policy coordination along with structural reforms, which will be crucial for maintaining macroeconomic stability and achieving fiscal targets for 2025.

Then, in Section 3, we analyse the revenue projections in the Budget for 2025. The estimates for this year project the revenue to increase by 1.67 per cent of GDP primarily driven by indirect taxes. The Governments revenue strategy heavily relies on vehicle imports, contributing to between 50 per cent to 70 per cent of the total revenue increase.

Then, Sir, compliance with the IMF's Extended Fund Facility targets hinges on achieving a tax-to-GDP ratio of 13.9 per cent, but any delays or setbacks in vehicle importation or administrative inefficiencies could jeopardize this goal.

Section 4 of this Report looks at the Government expenditure, projecting a 17.3 per cent increase in 2025, which is an increase from 14.4 per cent in 2024. This excludes debt amortization. It is primarily driven on account of a 61 per cent increase to Rs. 1.3 trillion in Capital Expenditure, in comparison to a 12.4 per cent reduction to Rs. 817 billion last year. The increase is mainly on account of the resumption of foreign-funded projects, post-debt restructuring.

Then, in Section 5, we look at the Debt Sustainability Analysis, which is a key important factor, and the IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis - DSA - targets. Sir, by the end of 2024, Sri Lanka outperformed IMF projections with Central Government debt-to-GDP at 98.7 per cent compared to the IMFs target of 108.8 per cent. Sri Lankas debt trajectory remains on a positive path, benefiting from improved economic performance, a stable exchange rate and lower-than-expected inflation, as per the IMF projections.

Finally, Sir, we conclude with some concerns pertaining to the Budget process. The initial assumptions provided to our Committee stipulated that the Budget estimates are prepared based on the assumption of Sri Lanka recording a 10 per cent nominal growth rate and this was made up of a 3 per cent real growth and a 6.7 per cent GDP deflator for this year. We observe that these initial assumptions by the Ministry of Finance differ from the assumptions presented in the documents of Budget, 2025, which refer to an estimated real economic growth rate of 5 per cent in 2025. That concludes the summary.

Sir, finally, I want to mention that we have not still got our team in place; we still have not got a technical team. We had a number of volunteers. I want to briefly mention them because they did it as volunteers. The team was led by Dr. Roshan Anne Perera and consisted of Dr. Venura Welagedara, Mr. Umesh Moramudali, Ms. Chethana Ranatunga, Ms. Hansini Yasu-e Karunaratne, Ms. Fathima Hafsa Haniffa, Mr. K.D.D.B. Vimanga and Mr. Damintha Gunasekera.

Thank you very much.

PRIVILEGE: THREAT TO SECURITY

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramanathan Archchuna) Hon. Speaker, I know that you are stressed and I do not want to make you more stressed after this. So, I will read out the Question of Privilege submitted in writing.

I, Dr. Ramanathan Archchuna, Member of Parliament and the Leader of Independent Group 17, being the sole Representative of my party in Parliament, wrote to you formally to request for an opportunity to raise a Privilege issue in the House on 22nd February, 2025 regarding a serious incident that poses a direct threat to my safety and security.

On the night of 12th February, 2025, approximately at 10.25 p.m. while being in Valampuri Hotel, I was physically assaulted by two known individuals. In the same incident, my personal legal secretary, Miss Kowshalya Narendran, was also attacked. Immediately following the attack, I reported the matter to the police via the Emergency Hotline 119 and personally lodged a complaint at the Jaffna Police Station. The police conducted an inquiry, leading to the arrest of the suspects. However, in an unexpected turn of events, a case was filed against me for self-defence, which was wrongly interpreted by the authorities. Subsequently, complaints from both sides were withdrawn.

1391 1392

This incident is of grave concern as it directly impacts on my right to function as a Member of Parliament without fear for my life. As you are well aware, the recent murder of Mr. Ganemulle Sanjeewa within the courts and the continuous killings that have occurred in the past week have heightened my concern regarding every Members personal security, including mine. Given the current security situation and the threat I have experienced, I respectfully urged you to allow me to raise this Privilege issue in Parliament on 22nd February, 2025 and I thank you for the opportunity given at least after three days.

In light of these circumstances, I also request that two security personnel be assigned to me at the earliest to ensure my safety. Additionally, I kindly ask that this request be forwarded to the Hon. Minister in charge of police and public security for immediate action.

I appreciate your kind consideration of this request and look forward to your positive response after facilitating my right to bring this urgent matter before the House.

I do not want to make you more stressed, Sir.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) , .

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam, please. You have 18 minutes.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Pnnambalam) I was told 20 minutes have been allotted to me, Hon. Deputy Speaker.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, we have to economize on time as all the speakers are exceeding their time limits.

[12.13 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Sir, I thank you for allotting me at least 18 minutes.

When this Government took office, Sir, I actually wanted to wish the Government well. The reason for that is this. As you know, we have had basically two parties governing this country for the last 77 years; there had been changes in names and certain postures but, by and large, it had been those two parties or formations which had governed this country. When the Hon. President, as Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, presented the Budget, he mentioned that; he also mentioned that in his Policy Statement. So, this Government's coming into power marks a radical departure from that 77-year history and whatever one may say about the JVP, which is the predominant constituent of the National Peoples Power, it has stood for certain principles.

As a party, we might not agree with the way in which they look upon the ethnic problem or the Tamil nationalists position with regard to the vision for this country. But, nonetheless, they have stood by certain principles and have stated that when they are in power, they will ensure the complete eradication of racism, which has been the bane of this country and which, we ourselves say, has been the backbone of the ethnic conflict. Racism, meaning a majoritarian Sinhala Buddhist nationalist ideology, unfortunately is exclusive in nature to a point where the Tamil-speaking people predominantly, but definitely the Tamil people of the North and the East, have been terribly targeted. So, it is in that backdrop, where there has been a clear departure, that my party and I were hoping that this Government would demonstrate a new beginning through this Budget.

So, when we look upon this Budget, the test, Sir, is whether there is a significant departure from the previous way of looking at the key issues facing the Tamil people of the North and the East - we represent the Tamil people of the North and the East - which had made us oppose the

previous governments. That is not rocket science; that is the key test we would apply when we look at this Budget. So, in that sense, I mentioned that we were hopeful and were actually looking forward to this Budget because there is an element within this Government, the predominant party, the JVP, being a leftist-oriented party, that it would not be too enamored by centre-right and right-wing economic policies, but there would be a tendency towards looking at the vulnerable, paying special attention to them, to protect them and their economies, making sure their economies would grow. That is a key element of leftist thinking. So, that was something we were actually looking forward to in this Governments Budget.

Sir, one of the key things I was looking for - actually, the Hon. President, the Minister of Finance, mentioned it once or twice - is that to the North and the East, which, due to the war situation for over 30 years, has been specifically vulnerable, special attention would be paid.

And, that is true, that is exactly what we were expecting to see in this Budget. But honestly, Sir, there is nothing specific in this Budget for the North and the East, nothing specific to say that the North and the East, because of the war situation that existed for 30 years, is specifically vulnerable and must be protected.

The President mentioned, for the North and the East, certain projects. For example, he said that for rural road development project in the North, he is allocating Rs. 5 billion. That is, Rs. 5,000 million. When he was in Jaffna a few weeks ago and attended the District Coordinating Committee meeting, which I also attended, he specifically asked the officials of that particular department under the Provincial Council as to how much money they are capable of spending for rural road development in Jaffna. The gentleman who represented the particular department said that they have been allocated Rs. 1,300 million and they would be able to spend that amount for this year. Then, the President went on to say, "Okay, if you say that you can spend that money, I will allocate Rs. 5,000 million for the Northern Province". That is, Rs. 5 billion. This is a typical example where doubt creeps in. In the Northern Province, you have five districts. Assuming that you allocate the Rs. 5,000 million equally to those five districts in the war-affected area, Rs. 1,000 million will be allocated for each district. Jaffna, for this year, has been allocated Rs. 1,300 million and it is relatively developed when it comes to roads. It is the other districts in the Northern Province which actually need far more allocations. So, now, under his proposal of Rs. 5 billion, Jaffna is going to get, at best, only Rs. 1,000 million, Rs. 300 million less than what we have been allocated this year. So, to say in a sweeping statement that you are getting Rs. 5 billion looks quite good, but in the detail, there is a serious problem.

Another thing he specifically mentions is the allocation of Rs. 100 million to the Jaffna Public Library. Good, it is something that we welcome. But honestly, Sir, today, Rs. 100 million is nothing. You know that. I mean, a fairly wealthy person who tries to build a house in Colombo will not be able to complete it for Rs. 40 million

1427 1428

or Rs. 50 million. So, what is Rs. 100 million for an entire library that was completely destroyed and still not restored to its original splendour? Therefore, when it comes to the details, there is a problem. We have repeatedly said this in previous Budgets. I have been a Member of Parliament since 2001 and at that time, we spoke in terms of needing a special provision for the North and the East because it was war-affected. Certainly, since I got re-elected in 2020, we have been saying that after 2009, the consecutive Governments should have declared the North and the East a war-affected area, brought in certain protectionist measures for, maybe, five years or ten years to ensure that the economies of the people who are vulnerable, who are literally 40 years behind the rest of the country are protected, strengthened and are allowed to grow, and once they are ready to compete with the rest of the country, then you can have an all-encompassing policy for the whole country. We have been saying that to the previous Governments, but, of course, none of those Governments listened. So, we were hoping that this Government, which is dominated by the JVP, a leftist party, would actually take that point, but they have not. And, as a result, there are serious concerns, Sir.

Now, take, for example, the allocations of Capital Expenditure to the Kachcheries in the North and the East under the First Schdule of the Appropriation Bill. They are in this way: the District Secretariat/ Kachcheri - Jaffna has been allocated Rs. 187 million, the District Secretariat/ Kachcheri - Mannar, Rs. 189 million, the District Secretariat/ Kachcheri - Vavuniya, Rs. 100 million, the District Secretariat/ Kachcheri - Mullaitivu, Rs. 126 million and the District Secretariat/ Kachcheri - Kilinochchi, Rs. 179 million. You think that these are very good figures. They should be very good figures, especially because those are war-affected areas which need much more than the rest of the country. But, compare those figures with that of Hambantota. The District Secretariat/ Kachcheri - Jaffna has been allocated only Rs. 187 million, whereas the District Secretariat, Hambantota has been allocated Rs. 578 million as Capital Expenditure. The District Secretariat, Matara has been allocated Rs. 473 million, the District Secretariat, Galle, Rs. 545 million, the District Secretariat, Gampaha, Rs. 432 million, the District Secretariat, Kalutara, Rs. 516 million and the District Secretariat, Colombo, Rs. 452 million. These are fairly safe and developed areas. The District Secretariat, Kurunegala has been allocated Rs. 256 million, the District Secretariat, Anuradhapura, Rs. 309 million, the District Secretariat, Ratnapura, Rs. 566 million and the District Secretariat, Kegalle, Rs. 540 million. But, our allocations do not even go beyond Rs. 200 million! In the North and the East, an area affected by war for over 30 years, we do not get even more than Rs. 200 million, but well below Rs. 200 million. Surely, there is something wrong with these allocations. What is the message you are sending to people like us? The President and Minister of Finance, in his Budget Speech, says that the war-affected areas must be developed and special focus must be given. But, in reality, it is the complete opposite. So, those are our concerns.

There has been a lot of dedication to education. Sectoral-wise, there have been several matters that the present Budget has raised. Those, we welcome. Sir, if you take education - the Prime Minister is the Minister concerned - they talk of modernizing school education, pre-school nutrition programme, student scholarships and development of sports schools. All these are wonderful; these are things that we will give our support to. I ask the Hon. Prime Minister whether she, as Minister of Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education, is not aware that there is a thing called pre-schools. Under her Ministry, pre-school teachers in the North are paid something like Rs. 6,000 as an allowance. That is it, only Rs. 6,000.

And, the Ministry of Defence also has pre-school teachers under the Civil Security Department. Do you know what their wage is? Well over Rs. 20,000! If I am not mistaken, it is Rs. 30,000 or even more now. What does that mean? What is the message you are giving? Teachers who are supposed to perform the same job, under the Ministry of Education, are paid Rs. 6,000 whereas under the Ministry of Defence, which is a military institution, they are paid over Rs. 30,000! What is that? Why is that applied only to the North and the East, especially to the Northern Province? Is that not militarization of education? Does that not sound very sinister? But, this Government says nothing of it. It talks of pre-schools; it talks of developing that sector, but says nothing about this disastrous policy of the previous governments, their very racist and extremely counterinsurgency policy for even 15 or 16 years after the war, which we have opposed very vehemently. This Government is silent on that. That means, it is going to continue with that.

If we look at the Eastern Province, all that is said is, the Eastern Province is going to be promoted, made into a financial hub, and the entire burden is put on India, that India will be sought after, that India will come in and take the entire burden of developing the Eastern Province. Very good! We know that India will come forward. But, whilst you want India to come forward to help us, you are also announcing in this very same Budget that 39 tanks in the Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm are going to be bidded for internationally. You know that India is very interested in those oil tanks. If those 39 oil tanks are going to be palmed off to somebody else, do you think India would be interested in helping us? Do you think India would take that kindly? When India has repeatedly said that they have a special interest in completely taking over those oil tanks, since these commitments come under the Indo-Lanka Accord, you have chosen to go for international bids. And, we know what that means; if it were some other government, we would know for sure what that means. So, there is no guarantee that India would come forward to help us because on the one hand, you say you want India, but on the other, you aggravate the situation, creating doubts.

And the Eastern Provinces entire future, according to this Budget, depends on India. All are up in arms, Sir. So, even in that regard, we have no definite commitment because of your own policies, which, very clearly, might negatively impact on India.

Then, agriculture and food security is another topic that the Budget speaks of. Sir, for the North and the East, the Forest Department and the High Security Zones are a curse! Soon after the war, High Security Zones were declared for the military and large swathes of lands were taken over by Forest Department, from which people were displaced because of the war situation. When they came back, their lands have been declared a forest area. We have been trying to get those back, but we have not been able to. People have been arrested and produced before courts without bail.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you have only two more minutes. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Deputy Speaker, please give me two extra minutes; two more minutes over the two minutes I have.

And, there is nothing about any of that in this Budget. If you all do not tackle the Forest Department and the militarization in the North and the East, which the Government said it will - in the last three months, it has done nothing - then, this concept of agriculture and food security becomes a pipedream for people in the North and the East, Sir.

Then, you talk about dairy production. Well and good, we will be supporting it to the highest. But, in Mayilathamadu and Madhavanai in the Eastern Province, over 30,000 acres of dairy lands allocated are today being forcibly and illegally confiscated by people from outside districts, preventing dairy production there. In the past, previous Governments had stood against the Tamil people on this question of dairy lands in Mayilathamadu and Madhavanai. There is not a word from this Government also with regard to that very vexed problem. Those people who are affected are protesting even today. It is the second longest protest this country has ever seen next to that of the families of the disappeared from the North and the East because their livelihoods are being destroyed.

There is not a word from the Government! So, without tackling this question of dairy production in the areas of Mayilathamadu and Madhavanai, Sir, this becomes meaningless for the people of the Eastern Province.

Irrigation is another very good sector that we would strongly support. The Hon. President mentions in the Budget Speech two important projects. One is, the Maduru Oya Right Bank Development Project. Sir, do you know the reason why the people of Mayilathamadu and Madhavanai in the Eastern Province are facing such a calamitous situation with their lands being grabbed and them losing their livelihoods? It is, in fact, because of this Maduru Oya Right Bank Development Project. The previous Governments wanted to chase away the Tamil people and colonize those areas with people from outside districts. So, it is because of that this livestock problem in Mayilathamadu and Madhavanai became such a huge

problem. Now, this Government talks of continuing and bringing that irrigation project to fruition without addressing those sinister colonization schemes of the previous Governments. This sends shivers down our spine, Sir, and the Government must have answers to that issue. Then, when the Lower Malwathu Oya Irrigation Project completes, actually, the ones who are affected are 15 Muslim families because their areas are low-lying and get flooded. But, the previous Governments had identified 1,500 families from the Anuradhapura District as the affected! This Lower Malwathu Oya Irrigation Project is carried out in Mannar District. My good Colleague, the Hon. SelvamAdaikkalanathan is from that district and it is actually carried out in Mannar District. But, 1,500 families have been identified from the Anuradhapura District saying that they are affected by this project and that they are going to be relocated. Where are they going to be resettled? They are going to be resettled in Chettikulam in the Vavuniya District.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Ponnambalam, could you please wind up now? You have exhausted even the two minutes over your two minutes.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I am finishing up, Sir.

So, all of these schemes, Sir, are actually quite worrisome. Unless this Government comes up with very clear, unambiguous positions on the matters we have raised, this Budget goes the same way as the previous ones did. The policies of this Government are no different to the policies of the Governments we had opposed, whose Budgets we had opposed.

Then, Sir, military expenditure has also gone up, of which I will speak in great detail under the Ministry of Defence. But, these are all fundamental problems for the Members of Parliament who represent the Tamil people of the North and the East, none of which have been addressed. I am sad to say that it actually makes us lose hope, Sir. The only party that had not come to power in the last 77 years has come to power now. When that party came to power, we were hoping that there would be a radical change and a departure from the policies of the previous Governments. That was what we were looking for in this Budget for the North and the East. But, that has not happened. That means, Sir, that until the Government comes clean and gives us unambiguous answers for these issues we have raised, we have no choice, unfortunately, than to vote against this Budget.

In repudiating and rejecting the policies followed by the U.N.P-.F.P. Government, the country has endorsed the programme of the United Front of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the Lanka Sama-Samaja Party and the Communist Party. That programme lays the foundation for the building up of a socialist society. It assumes as its thesis that a developing country cannot leave development at the mercy of the inter-play of forces which are motivated solely by the profit instinct. It recognizes at this juncture that private enterprise has a part to play in building up and exploiting the resources of the country, but the leading part must be in the hands of the public sector. 1977 ,

Recognizing both its growth potential and that risks must be managed for economic stability of our nation, the Hon. President, as Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, has presented this Budget at a crucial juncture in our economic recovery, where fiscal discipline is imperative to sustain growth while ensuring economic stability. Given the IMF Extended Fund Facility - EFF - Programme, fiscal consolidation remains a key priority with expenditure constraints playing a significant role in shaping allocations. As a matter of fact, the risks, challenges, fiscal constraints and revenue concerns are matters which we have to focus on. The total revenue for 2025 is estimated at 15.1 per cent of GDP, while expenditure stands at 21.8 per cent of GDP. The projected Budget deficit of 6.7 per cent raises concerns about financial sustainability.

If we take debt servicing and fiscal sustainability, a significant portion of revenue is earmarked for debt servicing costs. Any drastic increase in interest rates and the depreciation of the rupee could definitely trigger an unsustainable imbalance, in which negative consequences can be experienced. Therefore, any dip in revenue collections or external shocks could lead to fiscal imbalances.

Then, Sir, let me point out what the Daily Mirror of 24th February, 2025 states. I quote;

..........Duminda Hulangamuwa, the Senior Economic Adviser to the President said Sri Lanka can spend up to US$ 1.2 billion in foreign currency on vehicle imports in its first year of re-opening and earmarks about Rs. 300 billion or roughly 1.2 per cent of Gross Domestic Product from its taxes.

When the Senior Economic Adviser to the President says this, what does his Deputy Minister of Economic Development, the Hon. (Prof.) Anil Jayantha say? Again, I am picking up this headline from the "Business News" section of the Daily Mirror of 24th February, 2025. It states Govt. targets Rs. 300 billion from vehicle taxes, but many remain skeptical. Why are they skeptical? It is because people like the Deputy Minister says things like this. That article states, I quote:

Professor Jayantha last week hinted that they could revise down vehicle import taxes if the demand fails to pick up for vehicles.

? , ? ? 300 , :

......... now an indication has been given by the Central Bank about the possibility of reducing import duties, Jayantha was quoted to have said in a post-cabinet media briefing last week."

1453 1454

[ ]

2025 25

He says this at a media briefing! What a jovial thing to do! . , " tax " . tax ? ? . , . .

Now, this is what Fitch Ratings says. Fitch Ratings' statement has been reported in the "Economynext" of 20th February, 2025, which states, I quote:

Sri Lankas 2025 revenue target achievable, but long-term challenging.

Fitch Ratings . It further states, I quote:

"Sri Lankas 15 per cent revenue target in 2025, can be achieved and the deficit may be better than expected depending on the rollout of capital expenditure, but in the long term remains challenging, Fitch Rating has said.

'Fitch believes the goal is achievable, given revenue-raising measures already announced and implemented,' the rating agency said in a statement.

'However, it will depend heavily on a smooth liberalization of import restrictions, notably for vehicles.'"

When Fitch Ratings says this, your Deputy Minister says otherwise. He is already discouraging people from opening LCs to bring down vehicles, hinting that the duties may be reduced soon. So, how can you ever reach this Rs. 300 billion revenue target? That is the problem.

Now, I would like to offer some advice, but, of course, it may not be looked upon well. Anyway, I have to responsibly critique this Budget, Sir.

Let us take public pension system sustainability. We have to be really concerned about this. With the increase in public sector wages and pension adjustments, a serious concern arises over the strain on State resources in the medium to long term. This is what Fitch Ratings is talking about. Sri Lankas public pension scheme is an unfunded scheme, meaning that pensions are paid directly from the Consolidated Fund, making it financially unsustainable as the ageing population increases and there is going to be a serious strain on the countrys Treasury. Therefore, a sustainable pension reform strategy is required to transition towards a contributory pension system while ensuring the current beneficiaries are not affected. Sir, the Government must take this issue head-on and initiate a transition strategy. Gradual transition to a contributory pension scheme and introducing a hybrid pension system where new entrants to the public sector contribute to a pension fund while existing employees could have partially funded pensions is important. As far as public-private pension fund management is concerned, an independent pension fund managed with strict oversight and professional investment strategies must be

established. Moreover, private sector pension schemes that complement public pensions must be encouraged. Indexing pensions to economic indicators is needed to ensure that pension increments are tied to inflation and GDP growth, rather than arbitrary increases. What you have now introduced is an arbitrary increase. Encouragement of a retirement savings culture, IMF-backed pension reforms and aligning of pension reforms with global best practices and IMF recommendations to ensure financial sustainability are also important. You can, of course, ask for technical assistance from multilateral and bilateral development agencies. The Government should actively seek help and support from both multilateral and bilateral development agencies to adopt a pension reform programme. The Hon. Prime Minister, in the morning, was talking about new directions. These should be the new directions.

Sir, today's Daily Mirror has reported, I quote:

Bar Association urges IGP to launch inquiry

Calls for preventive measures against future encounter killings and custodial deaths

, Hon. Minister, you know very well what has been happening. It further states,

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) yesterday announced that extrajudicial killings could never be a solution to addressing the rise in criminal activity and that crime could be best curbed when the State adhered to the rule of law.

The BASL is urging the Acting Inspector General of Police to promptly initiate an impartial inquiry

, . I would like to end with these few issues, particularly on enhancing tax revenue. We have to enhance tax collection mechanisms to prevent revenue shortfalls. There is going to be revenue shortfalls with this type of conflicting statements coming from Government authorities, particularly with what the Deputy Minister has said. You have to ensure fiscal discipline by streamlining public expenditure and reducing inefficiencies, encourage private sector-led growth by incentivizing investment and entrepreneurship, increase transparency in public spending to restore public confidence in fiscal management and strengthen social safety nets while targeting subsidies effectively to benefit those who need them most.

Of course, the Budget presented by the Hon. President has addressed some of those issues. All that has been been done in keeping with the IMF guidelines. We appreciate that; we are quite appreciative of that. But, if we take the way this Government is going about, certainly, it is turning to right while having put the signal to the left; that is the current position. We would like the Government to turn right rather than to left.

Finally, wishing the Government well in this process, I would say that we are constrained since we have many issues, particularly with the treatment of the Opposition in this House. Our composition in Committees has still not been properly restored. Under those circumstances, we are constrained to vote against this Budget to show our protest against the conduct of the Government as regards the Oppositions rightful place in this Parliament. Thank you.

2025 23 The Morning :

It anticipates a 23% increase in total revenue, a 13.5% rise in non-tax revenue, and a 17% expansion in Government spending. In evaluating the IMF compliance of these key fiscal parameters, particularly the projected primary surplus target of 2.3% of GDP in 2025, many economists believe that Budget 2025 aligns closely with most IMF targets.

, :

The IMF suggests a revenue target of 15.1% of GDP in 2025, which is in line with the 15.1% total revenue estimation in Budget 2025.

BPOs operate providing services to foreign countries call centres. You all have imposed a 15 per cent tax on those services. They can easily keep their monies out, sending only the actual cost here. Therefore, if you all want to encourage outsourcing, I respectfully urge the Hon. Minister to take a more prudent approach and consider giving tax incentives to them without adopting taxation because that is detrimental to investment. So, I humbly request - this Budget has a lot of positives - that with regard to investment, you focus a little more, Hon. Minister, because through loan capital, you cannot take this country forward. The only way this country could move forward is through investment. . . If you take India, they have a plug-in system, where all the infrastructure facilities and concessions are given to investors. Therefore, I humbly beg the Government to take connaissance of what I have mentioned, not to take these aspects in a spirit of confrontation but to consider them, which, I think, would help take Sri Lanka to a better position.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 12 .
