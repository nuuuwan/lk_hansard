It has been one month since I complained in this House that time is not allotted to me to speak in Parliament. On 18th December, I made a written request in that regard and today is 21st January, 2025. More than a month has passed and time has not yet been allotted to me to speak. Therefore, please, kindly consider my request. If you continue doing this, there will be no reconciliation between the two communities which fought a war for 30 years. Madam, I made a request and there is no committee appointed to consider that. Today, I went to a Parliamentary Committee and learnt that there is no committee that has been appointed to take up this matter of Privilege. So, please find -

. ( . ) (The Hon. M. Nizam Kariapper, PC) Hon. Presiding Member, I think I may have to raise a few matters quickly while the Hon. Minister of Justice and National Integration is here.

In trying to understand the concept of Clean Sri Lanka, let us get into a little serious discussion. I have looked at the concept paper and also at the particular Gazette Notification issued under Article 33(h) of the Constitution. You are very well aware that under Article 33(h), the President has exercised his powers. Clean Sri Lanka is based on three pillars. While I do not think anybody could make any reservations about that concept, we have serious issues about its implementation mechanism.

Sir, I am compelled to speak a few words in Tamil because I do not have the benefit of doing it in both languages.

, Clean Sri Lanka 33 . . There are three pillars. ; environmental ; ethical . public toilets, . ; . chart . Clean Sri Lanka . , . ; .

, . . . , ? . , . ,

. , . , . So, this is a matter that we have to take seriously. , , !

. Clean Sri Lanka ! ! . It is a very good thing. , ; . train . train berth . , - It is not water - sealed . . . .

I am so happy to speak after the Hon. Minister (Mrs.) Saroja Savithri Paulraj. . . . " " . How many times does this train go through towns and cities? . .

(iii) It is indicated in Annex.

(iv) Under the resettlement programme currently in operation, the Government has granted Rs. 400,000 for buying a plot of land, Rs. 1,600,000 for buying a land with a house, and Rs. 1,200,000 for building a house on a land either provided by the Government or on a privately owned land.

However, since the current amounts are insufficient for constructing houses or purchasing land/houses under the prevailing market prices, steps are being taken to submit a Cabinet Memorandum proposing to increase the amount allocated for purchasing a land to Rs. 500,000, for purchasing a land with a house to Rs. 2,500,000 and for constructing a house, to Rs. 2,000,000 while reducing the floor area of the house to 550 square feet. Additionally, until approval is obtained, the necessary arrangements are being made to utilize the currently allocated funds to set up a room, a kitchen and a bathroom for occupation, instead of completing the full 650 square feet of the house.

Furthermore, a housing rental allowance up to Rs. 10,000 per month is being provided for a period of six months to families whose houses were damaged due to landslides. Within this six-month period, necessary preliminary arrangements must be made to resettle these families in a safe location.

Furthermore, during instances of heavy rainfall, necessary coordination is carried out to evacuate individuals residing in high-risk areas, as identified by warnings issued by the National Building Research Organization, and relocate them to safe locations under the supervision of District and Divisional Secretaries.

Provisions relating to measures to be taken with regard to individuals who are unwilling to join the resettlement programme and those currently residing in high-risk houses have been included in the Disaster Management Act and proposals for amending the Act have been submitted.

(iii) It is indicated in Annex.

(iv) Under the resettlement programme currently in operation, the Government has granted Rs. 400,000 for buying a plot of land, Rs. 1,600,000 for buying a land with a house and Rs. 1,200,000 for building a house on a land either provided by the Government or on a privately owned land.

However, since the current amounts are insufficient for constructing houses or purchasing land/houses under the prevailing market prices, steps are being taken to submit a Cabinet Memorandum proposing to increase the amount allocated for purchasing a land to Rs. 500,000.00, for purchasing a land with a house to Rs. 2,500,000.00 and for constructing a house to Rs. 2,000,000.00, while reducing the floor area of the house to 550 square feet. Additionally, until approval is obtained, necessary arrangements are being made to utilize the currently allocated funds to set up a room, a kitchen and a bathroom for occupation, instead of completing the full 650 square feet of the house.

Furthermore, a housing rental allowance up to Rs. 10,000 per month is being provided for a period of six months to families whose houses were damaged due to landslides. Within the six-month period, necessary preliminary arrangements must be made to resettle these families in a safe location.

Furthermore, during instances of heavy rainfall, necessary coordination is carried out to evacuate individuals residing in high-risk areas, as identified by warnings issued by the National Building Research Organization, and relocate them to safe locations under the supervision of District and Divisional Secretaries.

Provisions relating to measures to be taken with regard to individuals who are unwilling to join the resettlement programme and those currently residing in high-risk houses have been included in the Disaster Management Act and proposals for amending the Act have been submitted.

(b) Does not arise.
