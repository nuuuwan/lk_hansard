( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake Hon. Speaker, yesterday, there was a Question for Oral Answers that I had asked from the Hon. Minister of Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education and eight or nine Annexes relating to the Answer were tabled. I tried to extract copies of the Annexes from Hansard because today also I have to ask a Question from the Hon. Prime Minister, but it is not available. Further, I looked into the Hansards published and the last Hansard published was of the 09th of May, 2025.

So, there is obviously a time lag between what happens in Parliament and the relevant Hansard comes out. Can we not use artificial intelligence? I know there is pressure on the staff, but we cannot be deprived of this information because if we are to ask a Question from the Hon. Prime Minister, we must be equipped with the relevant information.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Speaker, I wish to ask the following Question from the Hon. Prime Minister:

1. Is it correct that over 2,100 medical doctors and 2,500 nurses have left Sri Lanka during the past two years seeking employment abroad?

2. If so,

(a) The number of doctors including specialists who have migrated during this period and the main destinations of their migration?

(b) The impact of this brain drain on the public healthcare system including services at major hospitals and rural areas?

(c) The measures taken or proposed by the Government to address this situation and to retain medical professionals?

(d) Is the Government paying salaries realistically to these professionals?

(e) Why has the Government stopped recruiting students through the Z-score of the UGC to the KDU? And, I was informed yesterday that the parents of the applicants have met the President and have also gone to court.

3. Most doctors pass out through free education in our country. Has the Government considered seeking compensation or other arrangements from countries benefiting from the exodus of Sri Lanka's trained doctors, as suggested in some international forum?

I saw that the Hon. (Dr.) Nalinda Jayatissa had mentioned in Switzerland that we must get compensation from countries which benefit from the migration of our doctors for the monies that had been spent to train them by countries like us. I am sure the Hon. Prime Minister would be able to entail some information on that matter as well.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees) .. .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Madam, I actually asked the Office of the Leader of the Opposition to allocate me a certain amount of time. They have, today, allocated me less than half the time I had asked for. So, there is no point in my making a speech because I actually cannot condense my speech to less than half the time I had asked for.

Since the Hon. Minister of Justice and National Integration is here, if he would give me just two minutes, I just wish to raise an urgent matter. There are mass graves that have been discovered in the cemetery in Chemmani. Once before also I raised this issue and your Ministry has been -

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees) , ?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I just want a minute to raise this. Madam, let the Opposition take the time allotted to me because at the very least, if they cannot -

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees) .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I only get one speech per Sitting week. If I am not given enough time to speak, they must at least tell us in advance that they cannot allot time so that we could make changes to our speeches. It is ridiculous to be treated like this! I have been a Member of Parliament for over ten years and I have never been treated like this.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Minister, in those graves, there had been more than three skeletons found. So, it qualifies, under international jurisdiction, as a mass grave. But, there is no security put in place there; there is no protection at all. When court officials go there, they do whatever they have to and after that, it is open to all the elements. Also there

1937 1938

is no funding. At the moment, the amount of money that has been allocated to the Judicial Medical Officer to make his findings is not going to last more than 20 days. So, if there is not enough funding, they are going to stop proceeding. So, I ask you to, at least, declare it a potential mass grave site and if you want, we can also help you in getting some funding from outside in order to do it properly. It must be done because - I say it with a lot of responsibility - you must be fully aware that, in 1996, that area was declared a mass grave site because the accused in the Krishanti Kumaraswamy murder case said that there were over 600 people buried in that area. So, I think it is extremely important with regard to finding the truth. Therefore, I ask you to intervene in this matter, firstly, fundwise, to make allocations and secondly, to declare it a mass grave site so that we can raise funds, maybe, with the international community or with any other institution that could help with funding. Also, that site must be protected to ensure that there is no tampering with the evidence.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Harshana Nanayakkara, Attorney-at-Law) Thank you, Hon. Ponnambalam. Yes, your matter is well noted and definitely, I will take action. I will get the matter investigated immediately. I know that the Ministry has allocated some funds for that. If it is not sufficient, we will see what we can do. I can understand the importance of what you say and I will act accordingly. Hopefully, I will be able to give you a better feedback in a few days.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees) , . 11 .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) , . , . . . , . . , , . , .

Hon. Presiding Member, we are debating certain Regulations brought under the Anti-Corruption Act. I wish to state a few points with regard to my interpretation of what anti-corruption ought to be.

Sir, when a government acts in a way that its actions are so gross in nature and result in approving projects or various activities which are ultimately unsustainable to the point that it becomes impossible for the government of the day to service that particular effort and the country, that is, this country, to, in some way, lose its grip on that particular project, it is not only corruption to the hilt, but various other criminal elements must also be attached to it. Sir, Sri Lankas past had been inundated by various governments at various times acting in such a way and in fact, the accusations of parties in Opposition at that time, including the present NPP Governments chief partner, the JVP, as and when those governments acted in that way, had been that the governments of the day had been bought over by various forces. Whenever the JVP sat in Opposition in the past, it had been probably the most vociferous of parties, accusing whichever government that was in power at various times with regard to not just of corruption, but also of being blatantly sold out to foreign powers interests. That is a very serious allegation to make. Today, such a party, the JVP, is the primary partner of the NPP Government. The question is, what actions has this Government taken with regard to those several projects that the JVP, at that time, blatantly accused the government of the day of having sold out to foreign powers? Now, the first and foremost project that comes to mind is the Hambantota Harbour Project. The

question is not with regard to the country, but with regard to the Government of the day deciding to go ahead with a project that, even at that time, was warned to be unsustainable. So, you go ahead with such a project, which created such a calamitous opinion in the country and was bulldozed through simply because the party that was in power at that time had won the war and they, in some way, felt that they could get away with blue murder and bulldozing that project through.

So, they bulldozed the project through, so much so that when that Government fell and another Government came into power, that Government was forced, because they could not service the debt, to handover the Hambantota Harbour over to the country which had, in fact, given funding for it. So, my question, Sir, is this. There had been blatant disregard to that project's sustainability and commercial viability and they bulldozed it through to such an extent that, ultimately, the country had to give it over for 99 years to the country it was funded by. Is that not the highest form of corruption? Is that not criminal, all-around? Should that not be investigated?

This is not just a one-off incident. That same Government came to power in 2020. The actions of that Government with regard to handling of the economy and the taxation system, ultimately, resulted in the complete crash of the country's economy, from which we are reeling even today, and cannot simply be brushed away as negligence or as actions of some fool in power. The question is, what have we done? Have we taken any steps to seriously hold such actions into account? It was all done by the same dispensation, the same party and its successors. So, Sir, those are matters that, in my opinion, this Government must, because this Government was the chief accuser of those actions, look into. And, not to do so means that you also did it, at that time, just to accuse the Government concerned, but after that, you simply think that that can just be wished away and be carried on with it. Maybe, in that case, your Government will also have to face the accusation that you have also been bought over. The way in which you argued at that time was so vociferous that you cannot run away from the responsibility of checking these things.

Sir, I think I am well informed and this side of the House normally asks for various agreements with various countries to be made public. My understanding is that those actual agreements are not public documents, but if the Government wants to, in consultation with the country concerned, it could release the agreements. That might be the best practice. But, if you take the Hambantota Harbour Project, it is a case where we have fallen face forward to the point that we were forced to give that asset away for 99 years! Surely, under those circumstances, is it not the public duty of the Government concerned to release that agreement to find out the terms of it and to see whether its unsustainability is so stark?

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , .

1959 1960

2025 04

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Despite its unsustainability being so stark, to go ahead with it means that there was something far more sinister. So, if there is any agreement, that must be released and made public. It is an agreement on which the Government has acted in such a gross and criminally negligent way that the agreement must be made public so that we could have a closer look at and get to the bottom of the motives to agree to such a project.

So, Sir, I think those are the things that a country like Sri Lanka, an island situated in a strategic position and over which geopolitical contestations are taking place globally, must look into. I think if any responsible government wants to set a precedent to show that Sri Lanka would not be held to ransom or be used by foreign powers, whichever power it may be, these are the sort of agreements on which the Government must take steps. If this Government is true to its word in accusing previous governments of having foreign involvements, of being pressured by foreign governments or of being bought over by foreign governments, then, it is this Government that must take those actions.

Thank you, Sir.

In addition to that, Hon. Presiding Member, I also want to bring to your notice another important matter. There has been a serious violation of humanitarian law in Palestine and I am taking this opportunity to raise that. On the 03rd of June, 2025, as eyewitnesses watched in horror and disbelief, Israeli authorities had launched a brutal attack, which resulted in indiscriminate killing of Palestinian civilians - men, women and innocent children - who were waiting in line to receive humanitarian aid, nothing else! Let me be very clear, Sir. They were not fighters; they were not carrying weapons and they posed no threat. They were simply desperate human beings hungry, displaced and reaching out for food to survive. And yet, even that most basic need - the right to live and the right to eat - was met not with compassion, but with fire and death.

What kind of a world are we living in today, if starving children are answered with missiles? What moral authority can we, as nations, as believers and as human beings, claim, if we remain silent while such atrocities are committed in the name of security?

Do they not read their Torah? I am sure there would be God abiding Jews who would come forward to condemn this act. The Torah, the Sacred Law of the Jews, commands, Do not stand idly by the blood of your neighbour. Those are not empty words; they are divine imperatives. Sir, I would tell them this. You are a people who have been known for suffering, walking through exiles and facing persecution and cruelty of Hitler. Can you now turn away as others suffer the same fate?

I just like to quote from Genesis 4:10, which states:

The voice of your brothers blood cries out to Me from the ground.

Today, Hon. Members, the blood of Rafah cries out to all of us. It cries out not just for justice, but for remembrance, dignity and for humanity. This is not about

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , .

. ( . ) (The Hon. M. Nizam Kariapper, PC) .

Sir, let us send out the clear and unequivocal message that the indiscriminate killing of civilians, especially children, is an abomination before the God and humanity, that such cruelty has no place in any society which claims the value of life.

We should have the courage to speak up, Sir. And, I, once again, bring the attention of this solemn House to those acts and appeal to speak up for those Palestinians. I am extremely sorry, Sir, that I had to use this particular time slot when we debate the Regulations under the Anti-Corruption Act to express these sentiments.
