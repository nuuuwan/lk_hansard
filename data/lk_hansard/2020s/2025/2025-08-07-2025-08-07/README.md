( ) (The Hon. Harshana Nanayakkara, Attorney-at-Law) As I have indicated to you, Hon. Member, granting of pardon is basically a Presidential prerogative and a right, according to the Constitution. That is why, in my Answer, I said that as per Article 34 of the Constitution, the President has the powers, not the Minister of Justice. However, a group of about 15 persons, whose loved ones are now convicted and imprisoned under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, their families, came to meet me and handed over a letter. So, those names had been taken in and are being considered at the moment as to what we could do. Other than that, I cannot make any promise because this prerogative is not within the purview of the Ministry of Justice, but with the President. So, whatever applications you have, you may present them to the President also. However, the members of their families came and spoke to me. That is a matter I am studying now. There were about 11 or 15 individuals in that letter, if I am not mistaken.

That is my Answer. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) 27(8) 88 8

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) The Hon. Chathuranga Abeysinghe. You have 12 minutes.

[2.00 p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Chathuranga Abeysinghe - Deputy Minister of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I think it is a very important Debate that we have today. After nine months of governance, the new Government is reviewing and explaining to the country how the economy has been moving from stability to growth.

About the economy, the Hon. President clearly articulated and told the Opposition, Tell us a particular indicator that is going in the wrong direction. So, when we talk about the economy, basically it is explained and reviewed through indicators and those indicators are mostly in economic terms. There are also social and environmental indicators, matrices which tell us whether the economy is moving forward in the right direction. But, what we know is, for the last 40 years, all those indicators have been moving away from their targets. So, I need to iterate a little bit to make the experts in front of me understand what kind of a country that we have been making over the last 30 to 40 years, where we have already made 30 per cent of our population poor or to be below the poverty line. Then, on an annual basis, we had a widening trade gap as big as eight billion US Dollars.

That is because of the industrial policies and strategies they conducted and we also had a continuingly increasing fiscal deficit, which led us to a lot of debts and the crisis we have been facing for the last few years. And, we, as a country, have the highest interest cost in the world compared to government revenue and has one of the highest number of people who cannot repay at these interest rates. So, these are the indicators we have been left with over the past few years and we were among the lowest tax collecting nations. The tax collection as a percentage of GDP was 8.5 per cent in 2019 and even now, we use indirect taxes to collect these revenues.

That is the root cause for the issues we faced as a country and the parties responsible for that are in front of us, giving advice to us today.

If you really look at what the Opposition said before the elections, you would see that they claimed or blamed the NPP for several things, especially with regard to the handling of the economy. They went on stage and said that the NPP basically does not have the skill, the experience and the expertise to run the economy. They also said that foreign investors would run away when the NPP comes into power because our flag is red. Then, they thought that there would be another crisis within a few months of the Government coming into power. Some in the Opposition said that within six months, this Government would collapse and the people would come on to the streets. At the same time, the economic experts on the other side said that we have no capability to deal with the IMF and that the IMF programme would collapse. Those are the things that they used to say on stage to convince that the NPP is not capable of handling the economy. Also, they engaged in fearmongering, saying that when the NPP comes in to power, it would take over private assets and would nationalize all the companies in the country. Those are the lies they told. Not only that, after the Government was formed, when we were striving to fix or stabilize the economy, they used various statements to put fear back into the people to destabilize this economy. Now, what we understand is that everything they have been preaching has been proven wrong by this Government.

Sir, if you want to really look at the fundamentals needed for a countrys economic growth, we need to take lessons from countries like Singapore. I was lucky enough to meet Dr. Kishore Mahbubani last week and to share some thoughts. He is famous in the economic sphere and says that the rule of law, meritocracy and discipline are the base for a countrys economic growth. And, what we are trying to showcase is that this Government is following that path and those traits. We really need to ask the Opposition, Have you ever been able to exercise meritocracy? If you really look at their advisers to the Government and the CEOs of the State-owned institutions, were they of that calibre who could run the institutions with no interest in or with no affiliation to politics?

As you can see, the Hon. (Dr.) Anil Jayantha is leading the front as the Deputy Finance Minister and (Dr.) Harshana Suriyapperuma has been doing his part,

1765 1766

both as Deputy Minister of Finance then and now, as the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance. They are examples of meritocracy and you can also see that we, as a Government, have given merit and the credit to the Central Bank Governor and the people who have been handling this process earlier. So, all that was done on merit. We have never had this experience in the history of our country, where the governing party have given people responsibilities on merit.

Very recently, I was fortunate to be part of a research finding forum conducted by Verit Research. At that forum, they explained how Sri Lanka is faring based on the assumptions of the Debt Sustainability Analysis of the IMF. It is very interesting to note that, as a country, we are doing far better than what was predicted for the country, and especially with regard to government revenue, we are doing better than what was expected with this year's revenue collection being 18 per cent more that that of the previous year. And the primary balance is better than what was expected and public debt, as a percentage of GDP, has been coming down continuously and we say we will work to better the predictions for 2029. The only indicator that is moving away from the original forecast is the interest cost, which is a little high. But, if you look at exchange rate stability, the inflation interest rates, the current account surplus and the official reserves, we have beaten the targets that were given to us. So, that is why we keep on asking anyone to tell us an indicator which indicates that Sri Lanka would derail again, that Sri Lanka would fail again. These are the fears you all have in your minds, you all dream in your dreams for this Government to fail and for you all to come to power. That is not going to happen, we would say.

Also, there were certain social indicators that we need to look at like poverty, employment and real wages. Yes, we understand that those have not been improving. They cannot be improved in a year. This is a systematic failure that you all brought about over and over again over the decades. So, it will take some time for these benefits to trickle down to the people, and we are pretty sure that the poverty indicator and the rest of the social indicators will improve over a period of time.

At that same Forum, economist Ms. Subhashini Abeysinghe shared very interesting findings about how small nations in the world could prosper. She took up examples from small nations like Sri Lanka to say that there were two main factors for an economy to thrive. One particular factor which I heard being discussed for the first time in an economic forum is that good governance and hygiene are a must or have to be the base for a country to prosper, and I am happy to say that for the last nine months, we have been putting things in place. We have been bringing in digital technology and have been driving for good governance. moving up in Corruption Perceptions Index, Ease of Doing Business Index and the Innovation Index. Digital penetration of this country will improve, giving us the necessary environment for businesses to come up, investors to come in and to make a level playing field for business to thrive in the Sri Lankan economy.

The second factor she mentioned was, access to market. It was discussed that all these small nations have greater access to markets through bilateral and multilateral agreements. Sometimes, it is funny to hear the Opposition pushing us now for that. But, while they were ruling, they had no ability to balance those or to ensure that we get into trade agreements and that our domestic industries are made strong and competitive to fight with those goods and services on the international market. So, what we are doing now is, parallely, supporting the industry to become efficient and productive so that we could open up our markets and getting into trade agreements, both regionally and globally. I think those two factors will ensure that Sri Lanka moves forward.

Another thing that we need to understand is that though we have moved from crisis to stability, in achieving economic growth, the IMF programme is restrictive in certain ways on Government expenditure. So, with that, we are trying to prioritize our expenditure to support our industries. We are also trying to support the marginalized communities, ensuring that we are within the growth trajectory, which we see from the data that was produced today.

So, what do we have today? We have the Government expenditure, which is the largest consumer or the spending of the economy, close to Rs.4 trillion with Rs.1.3 trillion in Capital Expenditure. That is the biggest investment which has happened during the last few years and which is going to grow the economy at a faster rate than what we are having today. Then, in terms of exports, we have reached an 8.7 per cent increase. So, exports are increasing in a positive way and not in a generic way because market diversification is happening today. Exports to Europe, Africa and East Asia are improving at a higher rate than anybody anticipated, which is over 20 per cent. Then, the manufacturing index of the country is moving at a higher rate, and I am pretty sure that the Ministry of Industries and the Export Development Board are doing the right thing to ensure that we have a growth of more than 9 per cent in manufacturing. If you take private borrowings, they growing at a rate of 16 per cent, which is something that the Opposition never dreamed of. So, those are the results that we are seeing today with the way the NPP economic and the industrial teams managing the economy. And, if you really take bond yields, the long-term and the short-term bond yields are converging, which gives confidence to the investors and shows that this country has secured economic stability because the Government has a two-thirds and is doing the right thing to ensure that the economy thrives.

The next issue is, misinformation about foreign direct investments. We have enough foreign direct investments coming in. We had Inquiries for investments for over US Dollars 4.6 billion and we have already secured US Dollars 536 million of foreign direct investments, which is a growth of about 100 per cent compared to last year. Also, under the Ministry of Industries, we have given approval to start 78 factories, which will be started during this year and in the first half of next year.

1767 1768

So, I am going to wind up saying that the country is moving forward, taking the economy from stability to growth and here, the request for the Opposition is to be part of this journey because Sri Lanka is transforming. Sri Lanka is transforming with reforms to the legal structure, changing the bad political culture and the Government going after the people who wasted public money.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Chathurange Abeysinghe, your time is up. ( ) (The Hon. Chathuranga Abeysinghe) Sir, please give me ten seconds.

Finally, what we are trying to say is, while the country is moving in the right direction, do not try to pull us back by the leg and make statements which are false and which could create fear among the investors and the business community. We are doing all this in a very honest way, and also, we need the support of the Opposition to take Sri Lanka towards growth since we are on the right trajectory.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Next, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa.

[88 5816] ( ) (The Hon. Mujibur Rahman) 8 8 With great pride as an old Zahirian, I extend my heartfelt wishes to Zahira College and Hameed Al Husseinie College for the Big Match. As an old Zahirian, it is always a proud moment to see our alma mater take to the field, especially in a match like this themed on tradition and brotherhood. This Sunday encounter between two oldest Muslim schools in the country is more than just a game; it is a celebration of history, sportsmanship and unity. I wish both teams the very best! May the match be competitive, respectful and a true showcase of the talent and spirit within our community! All the best for both the teams!
