( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Next, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake. You have 18 minutes.

[11.27 a.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Chairman, I am happy to speak while you are presiding over.

I stood up to speak on the Votes of two very important Ministries taken up for discussion today. I would like to speak about taking Sri Lanka out to the tech-world and beyond and would like to highlight certain examples in the fast-developing world relevant to the fields we are discussing today. Sir, these are two very futuristic Ministries which could propel the country towards a rapid economic recovery process after the very traumatic times that Sri Lanka went through and it is time that we pull ourselves together and take the country forward.

May I now show, Hon. Chairman, how disconnected we are from the world? I recently saw the military expenditures of ten countries in the world and some of which happen to be the US, the military expenditure of which is US Dollars 811 billion, China, US Dollars 298 billion and India, US Dollars 81 billion. Likewise, the total military expenditure of the rest of the ten countries - Saudi Arabia, Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan and South Korea - is tantamount to US Dollars 1,625 billion. Why did I quote all that? Only to show the military expenditures around the world and how we, as a country, struggle to secure just US Dollars16 million in order to ensure that we stay afloat.

Ministry of Digital Economy 13.5. 7.5, 6. Ministry of Science and Technology 5 - 2.,, 2.2. So, out of the projected Rs. 8.7 trillion expenditure, only 0.0001 per cent is for research and digitalization. If you look at the military expenditures around the world, why on earth are such harmful expenses being made at this moment, when I am sure 90 per cent of the countries are faced with the same predicament that we are facing?

The world is becoming frightfully tech-freak. The human element is being replaced fast by technologies like artificial intelligent, Grok 3 and you name it, they have it. My IT or the tech knowledge is not as savvy as of those who are leading these two Ministries, but I certainly

1955 1956

[ ]

2025 11

thought, with my financial background and past experience, I would contribute to this effort to ensure that we make use of these technologies for a better tomorrow. We must use technology for our advancement, to make people's lives happier, more secure and quality time-oriented. But, is it the case? It certainly is not. On that particular basis, we must ensure that we utilize this knowledge to take Sri Lanka towards a better tomorrow.

Science and technology cannot replace biology. They can enhance our understanding of the application of biological principles, but they cannot substitute it. A human being - a man or a woman - cannot and would not be substituted. How could a robot replace a man or a woman? That would not happen, a man would be a man and a woman would be a woman. And what about a child? There is no way you could change it. A child born cannot be replaced by a robot. A man could be sent to the moon, but when nature calls, he has to answer. You cannot apply a technological circuit into that. A government has to be run by humans; you cannot use artificial intelligence to run a government. So, all I want to show is that there is a human element which cannot be substituted. However, technology could be brought in to supplant the areas with deficiencies.

I call the Government to make the expenditure on the digital economy and science and technology fully tax-exempt. Unfortunately, I do not see that happening. The IMF has given a prescription thinking that it is a panacea for all ills, but it is not the case. Therefore, again, I would call the Government and the Hon. Minister to ensure that we have the taxes on such expenditures, whether it be on research and development, digital software, royalty, capital expenditure on hardware, costs of labour or whatever, exempted fully .

Even when I was Minister of Finance, on certain qualifying expenditures, we gave 200 per cent to 300 per cent tax deductions in order to boost expenditures in that particular area. Why I mention this is because this is the way or the direction that the country should move forward. Allocating 3 to 5 per cent of GDP on research and development is the hallmark of successful governments which have transformed their nations from what they were to what they are today. Korea, the USA, India, the UK and Singapore are success stories of such transformation. We must be able to emulate such strategic decisions because the expenditure on research and development may, sometimes, be 60 per cent effective, with the other 40 percent being wasted. But, that is the investment which needs to be made in todays context.

Sir, my intention here is to show whether Sri Lanka, after 77 years of independence, has really managed to achieve economic independence. We have lost out on many opportunities; we have missed opportunities. In 1956, we missed the opportunity with the adoption of the Sinhala only policy, where we should have embraced Sinhala, Tamil and English to connect with the world. Then, in 1977, thanks to the Hon. J.R. Jayewardene, we managed to open our economy. But, there again, there have been distortions and reinterpretations in various ways to its approach and eventually, we missed out the opportunity at that moment.

Digitization and all that are loosely used words. But, do we have the competence to ensure that this technology is used to catch up with the opportunities we have missed out by the younger generation who would provide leadership in the future? Sir, in achieving that, we must have sincerity. While we would like to see 3 to 5 per cent of GDP allocated on research and development, expending only 0.01 per cent of the Budget on that would not be walking the talk.

Why do we want to have such digitalization, a digital platform or a digital economy? Because we need to have development in national digital infrastructure, to create the backbone of the economy and to have the mindset of the people attuned to the changing world because there is a resentment that development basically means moving away from the normal traditional approach. That is a wrong notion. We must be able to take that risk to step into the unkown world. Otherwise, we would be like frogs in the well being unable to move forward with the rest of the world. We must look at success stories and not do it just for the sake of talking.

Then, in order have national digital infrastructure development, we need to build its backbone with high-speed Internet and ensure that the 5G concept is there to take the country forward. National data centres and the adoption of the Cloud are areas which could take us to a better tomorrow.

Then, e-governance and a digited Public Service. I think that is a key success story we need to look at in taking our country forward. The Aadhaar system, the unique identification number, transformed India from a backward country to a fast-moving country in the world. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with his sagacity, managed to ensure that the backward India was transformed into a future-oriented nation in the world. When I was the Minister of Finance in 2015, under the auspices of the then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and President Maithreepala Sirisena, we also tried our very best to bring about that unique identification system. But, stiff resistance came up from the bureaucracy and basically defeated that purpose.

And, I tell this Government - the enthusiasm is there and words are spoken of - that if you do not walk the talk, it would be the same story and the history would record that you tried, but there was no participation in the process. So, I call upon the Government to put your money where your mouth is and ensure that the Unique Identification Number is brought into the process. That process would certainly ensure that social security contributions, which are being misused today, are effectively used. Today, if you take Aswesuma, there are 2.3 million families who are getting it, while those who rightfully should get it do not get it and those who should not, getting it. So, that is the reason why the digitization process should be introduced and it will certainly help eradicate inefficiency and corruption in the process. So, let us ensure that we have it.

Then, Sir, the next one we must ensure is a paperless government. This has been spoken about for the last 15

1957 1958

years. It is not an unkown concept, but is simply not being looked at. I am happy that a fairly knowledgeable team is there now, taking it forward. Ensure that it is taken to the next step. Do not allow the bureaucracy to take that decision; it has to be led politically. Out of ten people, nine may be right and one may be wrong. But, dare take on the system. If you sit back and expect everything to happen, it would never happen and I am saying this from my experience. So, a paperless government is absolutely necessary. We must implement a blockchain governance system for secure and transparent document management.

Now, we are talking of artificial intelligence. Ensure that we take advantage of it. Look at Donald Trump. He got elected on the 21st of January, three months ago, and today, with the Department of Government Efficiency under Elon Musk, he is transforming his country. There is a sense of urgency to cut US Dollars 2 trillion in expenditure. He is not only pruning down irrelevant costs to save that US Dollars 2 trillion but is also diverting that money into more effecient areas it is so dearly required. That is also another aspect this Government must look at. While Rs. 8.7 trillion is the projected expenditure under this Budget, the relevant Capital Expenditure is only Rs. 1.3 trillion. If we take the actual application and implementation of the process, we have already lost three months; we are already in March. So, Sir, our intention should be, while there is enthusiasm and the way-forward is known, to implement the process as soon as possible.

Then, connected digital government is something which should have been done yesterday, not tomorrow. A classic example is the area of exports, where we have a lot of problems. The ASYCUDA system is something which could unite all the government departments together in this process. Unfortunately, the Sri Lanka Customs, when issuing export licenses, the Department of Commerce, when issuing Certificates of Origin, and the banks do not synchronize and work together. So, I request the Hon. Minister who is leading the Ministry and his Deputy Minister, who is very knowledgeable, to cut the red tape that is there. Bureaucracy wants political leadership because when they take something in the right direction and if it goes wrong, they fear that they would have to go before the FCID or some body like that. They are people who have gone through harassments. Therefore, we must ensure that we give them freedom to deliver what is best for the country to go forward.

Then, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the country was functional even though it was closed for five to six months. That shows that human intervention is required where necessary, but it is not necessary everywhere. At that time, you had the passport office, the Department of Immigration and Emigration and the health system operating while the country was closed. So, that again shows that technology could take us to a better tomorrow.

Ten years ago, people were flying from one end to the other end of the world to participate in meetings and conferences. Today, in the digitalized world, with Zoom

technology you are able to attend all meetings virtually. Even President Anura Dissanayake speaks with the Managing Director of the IMF virtually. Earlier, either the IMF Managing Director had to come to Sri Lanka or our President had to go there. But, today, virtual meetings have shrunk the world and it is necessary for cost reduction and to take optimum advantage out of the resources we have.

Having said that, I will take an example from the CEB. I was also Minister of Power and Energy for a short period. There were 29,000 people working in the CEB and 3,900 electricity meters readers. If we have a digitization process, we would have smart metering in place and smart metering would not allow tampering with or human intervention and also the CEB to have direct link with the consumer. Then, you would know your monthly electricity bill, the costs would be reduced and efficiency would be improved ten times over. But, the fear that the 3,900 meter readers would go on strike basically retarded the digitalization process of the CEB. Therefore, I tell the Government that if you want these areas to be foolproof, that is the way forward.

Then, look at the expressways. Now, you see revenue coming in from expressway, but you still have manual intervention in issuing tickets. You have five, six counters at the entrance to the expressway, where a person issues a ticket, and two or four hours later, at the exit, another person collects money issuing another receipt. And, ETCs are functional only on the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway. These are the areas where the world is going forward and we have been retarded. I am not asking you to throw those employees out. You can use them for more productive purposes like for the beautification process of expressways, revenue-gaining methods, ensuring that they are used humanely for better jobs rather than being at a particular counter of one end of the expressway issuing tickets or collecting money at the other end. ETC cards do the job with lesser human intervention and derive more revenue. You saw that when there was trade union action by those ticket counter employees, the revenue from the expressways went up by 30 per cent with the Army running the place.

So, you could see that there is distortion. The Minister of Justice and National Integration is here, who has been very vocal and very active these days. Ensure that these types of things are brought in. We do not need to send government servants on retirement. We have 1.6 million government servants, which figure is one of the highest in the world.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, you have only two more minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, the Hon. Gayantha Karunathilleka will give me three minutes extra.

1959 1960

[ ; ]

2025 11

So, on those 1.6 million, we have to have a cost benefit analysis; we must have value for money, ensure that we get the maximum for what we spend on the government service. There is no point in just saying that we have 1.6 million government servants when you could use them for a better future.

Then, as regards to the digital economy, you must give tax incentives for digital start-ups. Forget about the problems that would come up with the IMF in giving tax incentives. We need to give tax incentives. If we do not give tax incentives to investors, you would basically discourage them investing in Sri Lanka.

Sir, the next one is the cashless economy. Ensure that we have a cashless economic drive in the country. The more we meddle with money moving, the more we would basically be looking at the dead past. But, if you look at going forward with the digital economy, the cashless economy, we need to bring the formal economy in and then, our revenue would be much greater. You are called upon to earn a revenue of five trillion rupees, which is 15 per cent of GDP, and to have a 5 per cent growth every year. So, unless you have the digitalization process in place, which would basically help increase revenue, be more user-friendly as well as improve the efficacy of collecting revenue, how are you going to achieve that?

The other area is agriculture, where the digitalization process could be used in an extremely profitable way. I am happy to see that the Bank of Ceylon has come forward to support agriculture. At this moment, I would like to quote from an article in the Business Today magazine of March, 2025. In page 40, it states,

Drones are transforming agriculture in Sri Lanka, supported the Bank of Ceylon (BOC). Professor Buddhi Marambe, an expert in climate-smart agriculture from the University of Peradeniya, has been a key player in these initiatives.

Why do I mention this? Where there is initiative and it has been shown that there is a way forward in the correct direction, we need to recognize them. Today, many do such findings, go unnoticed without the talent being exposed. Always a politician comes forward instead of giving the credit to the person who really initiated it. Therefore, I think that technology is laudable and ensure that it is taken forward for a better tomorrow.

27 . 2 . " ;2 " . 2 . . " 2 " 2 ? . 2 19(, . 2 . These are the areas in which we must take advantage of artificial intelligence and the digitization process. . . 2 .

Then, industrial automation is also required. Today, labour is very costly. But, if you go for the industrial automation process, that would help you take the country forward for a better tomorrow.

Then, I move on to education. My digital literacy is far less than that of my daughters. When they tell us something about digitalization, we look dumbstruck. But, the actual situation is, the world is moving forward and we have to adapt ourselves to that. Just because we do not have digital literacy, that does not mean we should stop behind. Then, we give the unknown the opportunity and the leadership as well. I think it is necessary to give political leadership and experience in this regard is also important. The only way forward is to lead the government servants to do their job in the manner required.

There are many promises made by you. And, you all have to be given time to ensure that you fulfil those. But, after one year, do not come back and still blame the past 76 years. Then, you would also be part of the 77 years of the non-delivery of those promises. 2 762 77 ; 2 . artificial intelligence and digitization process .

Then, coming back to education and digital literacy, I can remember the change that the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe made when he was Minister of Education. I also can remember the revolutionary change the Hon. Lalith Athulathmudali made, bringing in the computer. At that time, looking at computers, people were saying that they were going to cause impotency. But, today, you cannot live without computers and that does not mean that there is an impotent world. So, Sir, all I want to basically say at this particular moment is that let us ensure that we have a target of taking this country to a growth rate of 5 to 6 per cent.

1961 1962

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Karunanayake, you have exhausted your additional time too.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I will certainly heed your request. Just give me a few more seconds.

Then, there is STEM education. With that, we can create our future. In that regard, coding and related subjects, artificial intelligence and robotics must be taught. Today, about 176,000 students succeed at the Advanced Level Examination, out of about 240,000 students. But, only 55, 000 students get into government universities. So, ensure that we have private universities to take them to a better tomorrow.

Finally, while ensuring these are done, also bring in data protection laws. Hon. Minister, I request you to ensure that data protection laws are brought in and our court system goes into that. I heard you saying that one million cases are pending.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Member, could you please wind up now? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The next is to have a cybercrime taskforce. Ensure that we give them the necessary assistance and that we have a 70 per cent success story instead of only a 5 per cent talk story.

Finally, ensure that we take Sri Lanka to a better tomorrow. Thank you very much, Sir.

First of all, the Department of Registration of Persons is under our Ministry. So, there would not be any duplication. The development of MOSIP and the e-NIC Project is also done by the same Ministry. So, there would not be any duplication of work.

At the same time, we are also currently evaluating issuing of low-cost PVC cards. However, the previous attempt to issue a PVC card had not been successful because of the quality of the card and the lifetime of it was only two years. Therefore, if we are to issue a PVC card, it would be something which lasts, at least, for five to ten years. Otherwise, people would keep on asking for renewal of ID cards, which would create a bottleneck for the Department. So, those are two things I would like to clarify.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Sir, I have just one small matter to raise. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Yes, Hon. Member? () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva) Thank you, Sir.

Hon. Deputy Minister, I appreciate your answer. The point is, if you are doing it together and if you are already evaluating the purchase of PVC cards, then why are you again floating another tender to purchase more plastic carbon cards? Also, if the law says that the card is valid for ten years, we can change the law because technology is changing so fast. We must update the law to change with the times we are living in. For example, you need to create a Single Window system in the Sri Lanka Customs, but the Customs Ordinance is 207 years old! So, unless you change the Customs Ordinance, you cannot create a Single Window in the Sri Lanka Customs. So, none of the digital infrastructure you are building, none of the authentication, verification or SL Stack, nothing is going to work unless we change the law.

Sir, I am with him. If it is done under one Ministry, that is better, but let us think outside the box. Let us not get restricted because the law says ten years. When that law was written, technology was not this advanced. Technology is so advanced today that the laws need to facilitate technology.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Next, the Hon. Lasith Bhashana Gamage. You have 10 minutes.

() ( ) ( () - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harshana Suriyapperuma - Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning) Hon. Deputy Chairperson, it is very important for us to understand the approach of the Government to facilitate the activities, initiatives and strategies of the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Ministry of Digital Economy and the critical areas the Government has paid attention to. Let me start with the approach relating to connecting Sri Lanka to the world. An important aspect to understand is that Sri Lanka is no longer an isolated entity, an isolated country or an isolated community. The approach of the Budget is to ensure that we are provided with adequate resources to take the country forward and to connect Sri Lanka to the global economy. In order to achieve that objective, several approaches and several initiatives have been made and started.

The second important element is by creating ease of doing business for local entrepreneurs, investors and global investors who want to invest in Sri Lanka and based on our destination and geographical position, there are several advantages we can offer to the world. But, for foreign investors to come into Sri Lanka and our investors to invest more in the industries, we need to facilitate them by creating ease of doing business. Digitization is a platform which would take Sri Lanka on that journey. So, a lot of efforts are being made and attention is paid in the Budget to connect the digitization process with the requirements of the nation.

The third pillar in that journey is efficiency in providing services to the citizens of this country by ensuring not only there is facilitation for businesses, but also that the required types of services provided by the Government are delivered in a seamless manner to them through government offices in their respective districts and provinces without having to come all the way from their remote villages to Colombo. So, that is another key objective to be achieved with this digitization map being rolled out and provisions being made in the Budget.

The fourth important pillar in this journey is minimizing room for corruption.

Madam, through a digital platform, it is expected to minimize person-to-person connections and at the same time, to increase the efficiency of the delivery of services

1997 1998

in a manner that would minimize room for corruption, improve revenue to the Government and also facilitate faster and efficient delivery of services. With those pillars in place, to achieve economic objectives, several improvements and facilitations have been made.

Madam, in order for the economy to move to the next level, we need to ensure that every citizen and every business contribute proportionately to the revenue of the Government. Currently, the challenge is, many are evading or escaping without paying the fair share of taxes they are supposed to pay. Therefore, digitization would bring in solutions to bridge this gap and to ensure that our citizens and businesses are seamlessly connected to the tax payment system. So, instead of payment of taxes becoming a burden, the system is designed to make it easier for citizens, to get themselves connected to the tax payment system. In facilitating this task, another important element is the transformation of the informal economy into the formal economy. This journey is strengthened to utilize digitization to the maximum level.

I will give you a few examples as we move forward, which shows that digital transformation is paramount for our economy to strengthen its activities. In the Budget, 2025, Rs. 4,752 million has been allocated for Recurrent Expenditure while Rs. 4,351 million has been allocated for Capital Expenditure of the Ministry of Digital Economy. A notable item under that, Madam, is the increase in allocation from Rs. 355 million last year to Rs. 640 million in the current year for the Information and Communication Technology Agency - ICTA - of Sri Lanka, a significant improvement. Further, in the Budget Estimates for 2025, compared to the allocation of Rs. 5,345 million last year for Recurrent Expenditure, the present Government has allocated Rs. 6,752 million for the same, which is a significant increase in terms of expenditure. In the same way, compared to the allocation of Rs. 6,446 million last year for Capital Expenditure, Rs. 6,871 million has been allocated for this year. As a result, the increase in the total allocation to support digital infrastructure and the digital economy has been from Rs. 11,791 million to Rs. 13,623 million.

[3.39 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Arun Hemachandra - Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Employment) Hon. Presiding Member, I think this is a great opportunity for me to speak about the Budget Proposals for the Ministry of Digital Economy at the Committee Stage Discussion. Sir, first of all, let me start with this quotation: Digitalization is not just a tool, but a shield against corruption. It is a gateway to transparency and the foundation of good governance. Therefore, the more we embrace technology, there would be less room for exploitation.

[4.47 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. M. Nizam Kariapper, PC) Hon. Presiding Member, I rise today to make the winding up speech on behalf of the Opposition at the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Digital Economy and the Ministry of Science and Technology.

Sir, digital economy is not just a concept, but it is our present and our future. The basic principle, as I understand, is seamless integration of digital technology into the economy. Digital technology has become an essential part of our daily lives. Whether we acknowledge it or not, the digital economy is the reality, with or

without a dedicated Ministry. It influences every sector - finance, justice, transport, parliamentary affairs and even cultural affairs. We no longer operate in isolation; we live in a digital world.

As we discuss the Budgetary allocations, it is crucial to recognize the role of digital transformation in driving economic growth, improving governance and enhancing service delivery for our people. Within the time allotted to me, I wish to highlight some of the essential applications of digital technology which could create significant economic benefits without imposing additional financial burdens on the National Budget.

Let me begin with railway transport and the challenges faced by that sector. The recent elephant-train collisions in our country have raised serious concern, Sir. However, is the solution not quite simple, something that could even be developed by a student with basic computer knowledge? For instance, if we integrate the entire railway network with Google-based tracking and install a simple device on every train engine, the central operating system could monitor train movement in real time, something, I believe, is already in place. Additionally, we already know the areas where elephants and other animals frequently cross railway tracks. By utilizing CCTV cameras capable of capturing night-time movements, live footage of these animals could be displayed on a screen installed in every railway engine, providing an early warning to train services. Simultaneously, the central monitoring system could oversee such situations, ensuring timely intervention to prevent any collisions. Once this network is in place, every railway station would have a display screen showing the real-time arrival of the next train. 2 .

Now, moving on to the legal system which has already been prepared for digital integration through the passage of necessary laws, I believe the Ministry must allocate funds to equip all courts with the required digital infrastructure. More importantly, a well-connected network should be established between the higher and lower courts. That network must also be linked to other relevant departments such as the Attorney-General's Department, the Legal Draftsman's Department, the Department of Government Analyst and of course, the Parliament, which is responsible for enacting laws. Additionally, officers should be provided with specialized training programmes to effectively use this technology. Sir, I also propose the establishment of a dedicated unit within the Ministry - I hope the Hon. President would take note of this - to oversee the implementation of the digital economy across all the governmental departments.

Now, I wish to address the current election process, which, in my view, undermines the Presidents efforts to implement the digital economy. Sir, you would be surprised to hear this. As the Secretary of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, I requested for necessary documents to field candidates for 90, just 90, local authorities and when my secretary went to collect them, he informed me that

2053 2054

he would need to hire a lorry to transport all the paperwork! My seven-seater vehicle, even with two seats folded, was not sufficient to accommodate the documents. 2 90 . ? . 90 2 350 ! ; 2 . So, why can we not have digital forms for candidates with only a single-page printout for affidavits? The law already recognizes digital documentation as legally binding. Therefore, there is no justification for this outdated, paper-heavy process. In fact, subject to correction, Section 87 of the Anti-Corruption Act provides for this.

2 . ; 2 . ;2 ;2 ; . . It is a shame that Parliament still relies on the printed copy of Hansard, Order Papers and Committee repots. While it is true that these documents must be printed as per the Standing Orders, there is no requirement that the printed copies should be provided to each Hon. Member. We can certainly make a transition to e-copies displayed on computer screens. I have spoken about this earlier also. As I have proposed, installing a pop-up screens at every Hon. Members table would be a practical solution. I am confident that the money saved from the reduction of printouts for just one year would be more than sufficient to install those screens and upgrade the system with an efficient processor. ; - digital technology - - ; - ; . .

Now, I wish to focus on defence and public security and highlight the shameful state of our police. While we discuss digitalization in various sectors, integration of digital technology into public security, which is an urgent need, remains far below the expectations. In every country, whether rich or poor, priority is given to modernizing public security with digital technology before extending it to other sectors. However, in our case, this crucial aspect has been largely neglected.

But, recently I was asked to bring a lorry to load the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities forms needed for only 95 local authorities! Imagine the situation had we contested for 350 local authorities!
