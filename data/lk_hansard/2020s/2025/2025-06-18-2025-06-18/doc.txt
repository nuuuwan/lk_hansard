asked the Minister of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation:

(a) Will he accept that -

(i) the bus owners holding route permits issued by the National Transport Commission and who sold their unroadworthy buses during the period when import of vehicles into Sri Lanka had been suspended had to wait until the import of buses recommenced in order to purchase a new bus;

(ii) during the above-mentioned period, the bus owners concerned had surrendered their route permits to the said Commission;

(iii) when new buses are put into operation after the import of buses has recommenced, the Provincial Road Passenger Transport Authority charges an outstanding fee for issuing chart sheets even for the period during which the buses were not in operation;

(iv) it was not possible for the bus owners to put new buses into operation, as they were unable to purchase buses during the period when import of buses were suspended; and

(v) it is therefore unfair to charge an outstanding fee for the period during which buses were not operated when issuing chart sheets for the new buses?

(b) If so, will he inform this House of the solution that will be given in this regard?

(c) If not, why?

Let me continue in English, Hon. Speaker. Last Sunday, there was an article in a reputed Sunday newspaper. As you are aware, we, on a policy basis, did say that we will take steps to abolish the pension of Parliamentarians who had served just five years and also that we will attend to the Presidents Entitlements Act to take away the privileges which we thought was immoral for an ex-President to have. For that purpose, we have been working on the subject for a while. And, last Monday, I presented a Cabinet Paper for those two Acts -

the Presidents Entitlements Act and the Parliamentary Pensions Act - to be repealed with repeal Acts and that proposal was accepted by the Cabinet. So, accordingly, I am in the process of taking the next steps to bring in those two laws to repeal the Presidents Entitlements Act and the Parliamentary Pensions Act in the near future after the due course of procedure has been followed. But, what happened, Sir, is that a particular newspaper, after an RTI request, has obtained information of the Action Plan of the Ministry of Justice and National Integration and made a headline news that the Government has reversed its policy, but not in the words "Presidents Entitlements Act". So, that was a front-page news continued half way through. That particular news in that Sunday newspaper is partly true and partly, does not process the information they have. It is pointless being a journalist, if you are unable to process the information you have. Sir, this is what happened. There was an Action Plan. At the beginning of this year, the Presidential Secretariat informed us of 58 activities in the policy document and to prepare the subjects. Accordingly, we did prepare them, but there were certain subjects which were not within the purview of the Line Ministry. A couple of them were Subjects 17 and 18. Subject 17 in that Action Plan was to do with amending the parliamentary electoral system and Subject 18 was about abolishing the pensions and special privileges given to retired Presidents. Those two particular subjects were not within our Line Ministry. So, accordingly, we informed the Presidential Secretariat that those be deleted from our Action Plan because they technically belong elsewhere. That is, with the President. Then, a few days later, we got a reply from the Presidential Secretariat deleting those two proposals. Writing about the deletion of proposals from a Ministrys Action Plan equating it as a reversal of policy by a government is done either by someone who does not know how to process an information or someone who is trying to mislead the public. And, the public was misled because we spoke to many of our supporters and citizens, explaining this is what happened. So, what I am saying to those authors is this. Sir, I will fall short of calling it fake news; I will not call it fake news, but they were either unable to process the information they had to come out with the right news because they did not know the procedure or they had some other ulterior motives. But, either way, that is what happened. According to Article 44 of the Constitution, the President can assign any subject under him to any Minister. So, the fact that those subjects had not been in the programme does not mean that we were reversing them. But, that was the message the newspaper was giving either deliberatly or by accident, I do not know. If it was by accident, it is a serious problem because unlike social media and other YouTube platforms, traditional journalism must be more careful with the information they give out to the public, especially when the newspaper has a reputation.

Anyway, I will not find fault with that newspaper, but want to just remind them that getting the information is not enough; they must process their information properly and come out with the correct news, which, I believe, they failed to do. And, the fact that we have now passed it in the Cabinet should put that speculation to rest. So, Sir,

2557 2558

I thought that I should explain it. Further, the same newspaper is carrying another news with regard to an assault on a particular political party, which I will not talk about. They have already named the party and the Member, but I am still looking for more information.

Sir, it is very important to state at this juncture that local government authorities including the Colombo Municipal Council have been clearly and decisively being won by the National People's Power, the Government. Again, people have given the Government a chance to carry out their mandate and that step is being taken now.

Sir, we need an Opposition. Why? To criticize the wrong decisions of the Government and to give a good input as an Opposition. We fully welcome that, but quite unfortunately, what do we see in this Parliament? This Opposition is not being responsible except for a few Members on very rare occasions. We have a shouting match, a deliberately prepared shouting match for a morning session. Thereafter, none of them are in Parliament. Now, only a few are here and I can count them; it is only a few. But, at the start in the morning, it was full with the Opposition MPs. Their intention in the morning is to come and make sensational remarks, which are baseless, and get a voice clip out on their YouTube channels and Facebook pages. This is not how a responsible Opposition should act. I respect those few Opposition Members who are still seated here participating in this Debate; others are not here. Sir, I can count them. Out of the 59, there are only seven Opposition Members now. This is how they act. - [Interruption] No, we have more than that. Hon. Member, you are in the House. So, I am not attacking you in anyway. Therefore, Sir, my request is that this House should be a place for proper Debate, extending courtesies.

[2.56 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha, PC) Hon. Presiding Member, I am thankful that I am given the opportunity to speak in relation to the Orders under the Reciprocal Recognition, Registration and Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act. Prior to this law, there was an Ordinance in the 1920s. With the repeal of that law, this Act came into being and under it, I believe, judgments of 53 countries would be allowed to be enforced here. The Hon. Minister of Justice and National Integration as well as the Hon. Minister of Women and Child Affairs are here in this House at this moment.

We know that with regard to divorce, there is a major problem of recognition of foreign judgments. I think this clears the path with regard to recognition of divorce proceedings in those 53 countries and thereby, the enforcement of foreign judgments.

Sir, I would also like to make an appeal to the Hon. Minister of Justice and National Integration and the Hon. Minister of Women and Child Affairs regarding this.

- , , , , - , - . ,

, with these Orders, I am sure this problem would be solved.

Sir, I would also like to emphasize another very important matter to this House. We have a proud judicial system. Parliament exercises its judicial powers through courts. So, we have a fundamental duty to protect our judges. Recently, the Kaduwela Magistrate was suspended because, unfortunately, there was a sex tape about her. That is not only an indictment against her, but against the system because it was a false and malicious statement. At various times, you could also see judges being attacked on social media. So, I appeal to the Hon. Minister of Justice to form a Select Committee and also this Government to take steps against persons who attack judges on social media. Unfortunately, today, such attacks against persons and judges take place not only in our jurisdiction, but also outside our jurisdiction. Therefore, if we are going to protect the integrity of our judicial system, we have to protect our judges from those malicious slander and defamatory statements.

In addition, Sir, there is another issue with regard to the Contempt of a Court, Tribunal or Institution Act in our country. We saw that a lawyer was locked up recently and the Bar Association of Sri Lanka had to intervene and seek his release. We also saw that a person was locked up because his phone rang in the court, which resulted in his death. The Bar Association of Sri Lanka has also expressed their concerns with regard to that. The lawyers too, in certain instances, find the Contempt of a Court, Tribunal or Institution Act an intimidation on the system; it intimidates them. Therefore, I appeal to this Government to revisit the Contempt of a Court, Tribunal or Institution Act and also to look at the report the Bar Association of Sri Lanka is preparing now. If you look at it, you would see that there are various reforms needed to the Act.

2621 2622

Sir, if you take our judicial system, there are only three career Judges in the Supreme Court today. So, we need to look at things differently and I believe that the NPP Government pledged to this country to look at things differently, that they will look at these issues in a holistic manner and at the concerns expressed by all quarters, in a positive manner.

In addition, Sir, our life expectancy is 75 years today.

Therefore, if you take our Judiciary, we need to increase the retirement age of the Judges of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal and also of the employees of the Public Service because when they are in their 60s, they are in their prime and it is sad to take them out of the system, which prevents them from contributing more towards the judicial system of this country. Therefore, we have to look at things differently.

Then, the question of law's delays. The law's delays in this country have been an issue for a long period of time. And, I, as a practising lawyer, would say that infrastructure - buildings and facilities - is not the only issue, but, today, clerical staff, stenographers, computers, photocopies, all these have also become an issue. Therefore, if we are to improve and have an expeditious justice system, we need to improve the facilities in the judicial system. At the moment, if you take courts, there is a greater shortage in staff required. Therefore, I would appeal to the Minister of Justice and National Integration to look at this matter and address it expeditiously.

Sir, we have a lot of laws to protect women in this country. Unfortunately, in Sri Lanka, domestic violence is on the rise. So, I appeal to the Minister, who is here, to educate the police and have a mechanism with regard to domestic violence.

There is another fundamental issue which I would like to bring to the notice of the House. The law of Sri Lanka is based on the presumption of innocence; until you are convicted, you are presumed innocent. , The ratio of toilets to our prisoners is low. Also, they do not have the liberty of having a pillow and a mat. Especially, at remand prisoners, the prison officials should look as persons against whom investigations are pending. Also, those officials should be taught that the presumption of innocence is operated in favour of the prisoners and therefore, they should not be treated as convicts.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 10
