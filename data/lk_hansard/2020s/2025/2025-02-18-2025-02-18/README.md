QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE

RECENT ISLANDWIDE POWER OUTAGE

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Speaker, I ask the following Questions from the Hon. Minister of Energy:

1. What were the root causes of the recent power failure and how did the monkey incident at the Panadura Substation contribute to that outage? Is this the first time an animal had caused a nationwide blackout?

2. What measures were taken to restore power, mitigate disruptions of this essential service and why did it take approximately six hours to fully restore electricity across the country?

3. What steps are being taken to prevent such widespread power failures in the future and what is the timeline for implementing those measures?

4. Could the Hon. Minister confirm whether there were any prior warnings or indicators of a potential grid instability, which were overlooked?

5. What is the estimated economic impact of this power outage on businesses and households and what compensation, if any, is being considered for those affected?

6. Is there any indication of negligence, technical failure or sabotage and if so, will there be any independent inquiry into the matter?

7. What is the average cost of generation at the CEB in the last three months and is the entity pursuing a cost-reflective policy as of today?

Hon. Speaker, I am disappointed that the Hon. Minister concerned is not here to answer the Question regarding a very important incident that happened ten days ago. Normally, there has been a sense of discipline pursued by the Hon. Ministers in answering these Questions.

1970-1977 .. . . , . . , 1970 25 :

Mr. Speaker,

It is a great privilege to have the honour of presenting the first Budget of the United Front Government ...."

"On the 27th of May, 1970, the people of this country endorsed the programme of the United Front placed before them and gave the Front an overwhelming majority with a mandate to carry through this programme. In the process, the country has rejected the policies hitherto followed by the United National-cum-Federal Party during the period 1965-1970."

"In repudiating and rejecting the policies followed by the U.N.P.-F.P. Government, the country has endorsed the programme of the United Front of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the Lanka Samasamaja Party and the Communist Party. That programme lays the foundation for the building up of a socialist society. It assumes as its thesis that a developing country cannot leave development at the mercy of the inter-play of forces which are motivated solely by the profit instinct."

"We have embarked upon a unique task."

There is macroeconomic stability; there is exchange rate stability; there is interest rate stability and there is price stability. So, what you need is growth. How are you going to achieve growth? I told you, we have a 13 per cent cap on what we can spend, on primary expenditure.

Madam, the Budget is based on the fundamental of growth facilitation. Considering the importance of consistency and continuity, businesses are able to forecast and plan for the future. These are important fundamentals and principles allowing businesses to invest to expand the production capacity of the economy, particularly to support local value addition for our industries to ensure that we support our SME sector to reach out to their maximum potential.

An Hon. Member from the Opposition during his speech mentioned that there is a lack of support for the SME sector in the Budget. I will take a few examples. There are over 24 references to the SME sector in the Budget Speech relating to facilitation, both in terms of policy and financial assistance, facilitation through financing. I will refer to a few of them starting from page 9 of the English Text of the Budget Speech: formulating the national export development plan, introduction of National Tariff Policy for removal of limitations to access high quality markets, strengthening the network of Free Trade Agreements, expansion of export-oriented

367 368

investments, leasing out underutilized State-owned lands for productive economic activities with SME participation, introducing new laws to ensure effective implementation of the one-stop-shop concept, expanding the activation of the process for new insolvency law, providing required technical and financial assistance for exporters and importers to obtain quality testing and certification, which is a burning issue for both importers and exporters, a development bank for the SME sector to improve SMEs' access to finance and the establishment of a new administrative structure within the existing banking mechanism.

Then, if you consider financial allocations from the Budget, for Innovation Invention Fund, Rs. 1,000 million is to be allocated. Underutilized lands managed by State institutions will be identified for private investments with Rs. 250 million allocated including for SMEs; for the producer co-operative society for youth entrepreneurs, the financial incentive is Rs. 100 million; for youth entrepreneurship development in agriculture targeting youth-led, agro-based SMEs and startups, Rs. 500 million would be allocated; for the improvement of Dairy Value Chains, the allocation is Rs. 2,500 million; for promoting high-yielding coconut seedlings mechanism, Rs. 500 million; for trade promotion programmes, particularly for Ceylon cinnamon, Rs. 250 million; for establishment of freshwater related industries, Rs. 200 million and particularly for the SME Line of Credit Project, Rs. 6,868 million. Likewise, the list goes on.

Madam Chair, that indicates that adequate and detailed attention has been paid for these sectors to facilitate a production economy. , , . - industrial zones - . .

The Budget has been prepared on the basis that no one is left behind, particularly the vulnerable segments of the society. Children, the disabled and other segments of the society have been identified and adequate provisions have been made to allow them to connect to economic activities. The Budget has been based on strategies such as budget deficit reduction, Government expenditure management, particularly the reducing of wasteful expenditure of the Government and revenue enhancement measures relating to the Sri Lanka Customs, the IRD and the Excise Department of Sri Lanka. When you consider the Sri Lanka Customs, sufficient allocations have been made to ease congestion in cargo clearance by acquiring new scanners and developing new container yards. That is, once again, to ease the congestion. All that is to ensure the production economy is facilitated and the system functions smoothly.

Then, effective debt management mechanisms have been put in place. Currently, the SriLankan Airlines' final debt negotiation is underway with the identified parties; proposals are to be handed over. Once it is finalized, we expect the ratings of Sri Lanka will further improve. That is the expectation of the Government.

The Budget has allocated for investment in human capacity development, particularly for a healthy society. Early childhood development and various other sectors have been identified and adequate funding has been allocated. Creating equal opportunities for eveyone is a fundamental aspect. For providing necessary assistance for students, scholarship increments, for vocational sector students, the Mahapola Scheme, to grant opportunities in high-ranking universities for students who have achieved higher scores or made educational achievements and for development of the sports sector, several allocations have been made in the Budget. Economic expansion is expected through investment facilitation of export-oriented industries. The Investment Protection Bill would be targeted and developed for this purpose.

The Trade National Single Window is expected to be expedited. Interim solutions will be provided to those industries and institutions. The digital economy is prioritized in this process through the UDI mechanism and the digital payment infrastructure. We provide opportunities to the people or communities in the remote areas of Sri Lanka to get connected to the national economy.

The SME ecosystem, as I mentioned, and the Credit Guarantee Scheme are to provide opportunities for businesses to borrow from the financial system without collateral. . grace period , 12 , . . ,-

There are further reforms, structural reforms to be done in the system to strengthen the State-owned enterprises. Governance is to be introduced to these institutions. Many institutions have challenges with regard to money that had been taken, but never accounted for. Therefore, the Auditor-General has qualified many of the financial statements of these institutions. A mechanism has already been identified to facilitate these institutions to be more accountable, transparent and to expand their capacity to deliver. Through that system, it is expected that these State-owned enterprises would add value, particularly to welcome investors into the country.

A host of legislations have been proposed to align with the Budget. One of them is the Investment Protection Bill I mentioned earlier. In addition to that, there is the Insolvency Bill, the PPP Bill and the Data

369 370

[ () ]

2025 18

Sharing Bill relating to State agencies refusing to share data with each other. As a result, those would remove the impediments that are there for importers and exporters to engage in their activities. At the same time, they would also remove the impediment for State revenue agencies to function smoothly. The new Bill relating to data sharing would be enacted after going through the due process with stakeholder consultation and adequate facilitation. With the system that has been managed in the past, we, as a country, have become poor not only in terms of money, but in terms of availability of data as well. As a result, a new Statistics Act would be brought in to ensure that relevant, accurate and timely data would be procured in a timely manner and that data would be used in making policy decisions. Instead of making decisions based on political connections and at the discretion of Ministers, a data-driven approach would be made use of to create an economy which we can proudly hand over to the next generation. Similarly, the Act relating to valuation woudl be refined to provide the necessary foundation.

There are many instances where we, as a nation, get stuck due to the lack of a Valuation Act which addresses the needs of today. As I mentioned earlier, you all were referring to archaic and outdated regulations, systems and laws, whereas the new Budget paves the way and lays the foundation for creating a country we all can be proud of.

We noted that State accounts are currently qualified by the Auditor-General due to the way the nation's finances were handled in the past. The introduction of the new Public Asset Management Act would pave the way for recognizing some of these assets, ensuring they are brought into the books to reflect the investments the taxpayers and the public have made to take the country forward.

Similarly, a Public Procurement Law, as mentioned yesterday during the Budget Speech, will also be introduced. Currently, we are managing the country with guidelines and circulars. Instead, a Public Procurement Law will be introduced to close the gaping holes in the system. Through this mechanism, transparency in procurement and accountability required in evaluation will be introduced into the system.

Similarly, a microfinance and credit regulatory framework, which has been a national requirement for several years, will also be introduced. Efforts had been made to introduce it on several occasions in the past. However, due to certain vested interests, the Bill was not allowed to be proceeded with. We are of the view that it is an important requirement, particularly because the vulnerable segments of the society have been affected due to the absence of a microfinance and credit regulatory law.

, we are aware that due to the financial crisis, so many suffered. But, those who suffered most were the marginalized people. People are marginalized due to their race, gender, cast, financial status, age and disabilities. So, they are the ones who had the most impact. Therefore, it is natural for a Government like ours to focus on those groups who are marginalized. .

Madam, may I quote from the Holy Bible: Proverbs 31:8-9? It states:

Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute.

Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy.

And that is what we are exactly plaining to do.

, , . . . But, children? They suffer in silence; they are voiceless. . , " ; ; " ? . They suffer in silence. Therefore, there is a massive duty and a very serious responsibility on the part of the Government to look after the welfare needs of those children who are in orphanages. -/ / 522 , . . , 522 .

then you must match your words with actions. We are looking after the most marginalized group - the children of poor families who cannot support themselves.
