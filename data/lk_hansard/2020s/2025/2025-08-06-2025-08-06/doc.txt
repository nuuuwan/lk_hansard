QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE

REVIEWAL OF POLICIES IN LEASING SECTOR

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) [, 1 [ 27(2) [ [ 1[ [ .

I rise today to draw the attention of this august House to the urgent need for reform in the leasing industry which has grown into a highly protected and lopsided sector, operating with minimal accountability and disproportionately favouring financial institutions over struggling citizens.

It is deeply concerning that leasing companies - particularly Finance Companies under Central Bank licensing and supervision are resorting to increasingly forceful and punitive measures to recover leased assets, including vehicles and machinery, even in cases where 60 -70 per cent of the dues have already been settled. These actions often disregard context, compassion and fairness and are carried out without transparency or proper checks and balances.

Moreover, current regulations permit seizure of mortgaged assets merely upon a 90 to 150-day delay in payment without adequate consideration of whether the default was willful or due to unavoidable economic hardship such as job loss, illness or macroeconomic instability.

[, 1 , [[ 5 [[ 3 1 [ [ 1 1[ [ . 1 [ , .

This state of affairs erodes public trust in the financial system, exacerbates poverty and undermines the role of the Central Bank as a responsible regulator. It is imperative that the Central Bank introduces a more humane, tiered and compassionate framework for asset recovery, which distinguishes between defaulters acting in bad faith and those affected by genuine difficulty.

[, [ , 11 1 [ 1[ 1 1. [ [ 1 1. , 1[ [ .

1497 1498

1

Accordingly, I seek urgent responses and policy clarity on the following key questions:

1. What specific regulatory protections are currently in place under the Central Banks direction for borrowers who face involuntary default in the leasing sector?

Can the Central Bank provide data on how many asset seizures occur annually, and how many involve individuals facing economic hardship rather than willful non-payment?

2. Why does the Central Bank permit the seizure of mortgaged assets such as vehicles after just 90 to 120 days of non-payment, without mandating any assessment of the lessees financial hardship, intent or willingness to negotiate?

3. Can the Central Bank introduce or recommend guidelines to financial institutions to differentiate between willful defaulters and genuine hardship cases and mandate negotiated settlements or restructuring options before seizure proceedings are initiated?

4. Has the Central Bank considered introducing a mandatory Grace period mechanism or a mediation board to be consulted prior to the seizure of leased property especially for micro and small enterprise operators who rely on such assets for income generation?

5. What are the legal remedies currently available to lessees who allege unfair repossession of their leased assets? Has the Central Bank ever intervened in cases where financial institutions were found to have acted with undue haste or without exploring restructuring options?

6. Will the Central Bank commit to a policy review of the leasing sector, particularly to examine the impact of harsh seizure practices on small business owners, self-employed individuals and low-income earners so that a more equitable and humane framework could be instituted?

7. Can the Central Bank provide a breakdown of leasing contracts by institution and indicate whether large finance companies dominate the market due to regulatory asymmetry or monopolistic practices and if so, what steps will be taken to ensure a level playing field for the consumer?

Thank you, Sir.

When a matter of Privilege is raised, if there are certain mistakes, for example, if an Hon. Member has not kept to his written submission, your pointing that out to him is a different matter. But, to allow another Hon. Member to make comments about a matter that has just been raised, even before you refer the matter to the Committee, is very dangerous, Sir. Some comments or some decisions that you yourself have made whilst in the Chair are being investigated by that Committee.

(Dr.) Archchuna's speeches from going live. What I am now trying to say, Sir, is that when a Privilege Matter is raised, you have to refer it to the Committee before you take a decision. You must not allow other Hon. Members to make it a debate.

As such, the proposed CSA deviates from the merits and principles of the Bill and therefore is inconsistent with Article 78(3) of the Constitution.

But, I say that the Attorney-Generals representative does not explain how or why moving LTL Holdings Limited from the NTNSP to a residual company conflicts with Article 78(3) of the Constitution. So, I would like to ask the Attorney-General himself to explain to this House how that Committee Stage Amendment on moving LTL Holdings Limited deviates from the merits and principles of this Bill because it is a critical matter.

I must say, Hon. Presiding Member, that in the midst of the situation we are in, the very difficult recovery process from the devastating sovereign debt crisis that we are undergoing, we now face a very unprecedented existential threat. So, in this midst, it is important for us to consider legally unbundling the Ceylon Electricity Board, its core functions and push for a more competitive and transparent electricity market. It will enable attracting private capital and enhancing efficiency, which are critical to economic recovery and energy security. That would be considered a landmark step towards a more efficient and accountable energy future.

But, what are we trying to do now? We are trying to reverse the entire process started by the earlier Act presented by the previous Government. Now, we are trying to reconsolidate the CEB by placing generation, transmission and distribution under 100 per cent State control. That will inevitably entrench inefficiencies, deter private investment and further strain the already constrained public finances. That would be the end result, if we continue on this path.

The CEBs losses and infrastructure needs are fiscally unsustainable, all of us know that. Our ability to maintain the countrys primary surplus and meet the International Monetary Fund commitments is well known. With that issue, we are going to further undermine the countrys creditworthiness, limiting access to capital markets and affordable borrowing.

Then, take creating a range of investment opportunities, allowing private investors to engage in specific segments which align with their risk-return preferences. We should understand that unbundling has improved operational efficiency, transparency and service delivery, particularly when supported by competitive tendering and strong regulatory oversight. But, what are we doing now? We are even trying to cripple the existing regulatory framework and bring Finance Ministrys supervision over the regulators functions.

Sir, now, I would like to read from an article in the "Daily FT" titled Sri Lankas Electricity Amendment Bill 2025: Trojan Horse for national economic collapse. This is what it states, I quote:

The National Peoples Power Government rose to power promising transparency, institutional reform and a green energy revolution. The President vowed to build an accountable electricity regime; the Energy Minister committed to regulator independence and market modernisation. Yet, the Electricity Amendment Bill 2025 delivers the opposite. It entrenches ministerial control, resurrects monopolies, enables corruption, and locks the nation into decades of coal dependence. Enacting this Bill will devastate donor confidence, repel investors, deepen energy poverty and reverse Sri Lankas hard-earned progress.

So, that is what this particular article states. There are some details in it, but I do not want to go into those details.

Then, I will move on to some other issue which is now being discussed in the energy circles. That is regarding the 2025 tariff revision for Standard Power Purchasing Agreements governing projects up to 10 megawatts. Though this revision is presented as a routine, cost-reflective recalibration cloaked with references to the International Monetary Fund and its conditionality, the substance reveals a different story. This is not a correction; this is sabotage, a systemic, deliberate distortion by a group with vested interests that threatens to derail the Governments own renewable energy goals.

The new tariff structure pegs the cost of equity for solar power projects at 11.47 per cent, identical to the 10-year Treasury Bond yield. In doing so, it offers zero premium for risk. Let me repeat that, Sir. Investors in renewable energy are being offered no compensation for the risks they carry, including currency volatility, policy uncertainty, construction delays and regulatory risk. In global practice, even regulated utilities earn 3 per cent to 5 per cent premiums over risk-free government bonds. What signals are we sending to the local entrepreneurs and international investors? Is it that Sri Lanka does not reward risk or that we penalize clean energy? This rupee-denominated return only applies to projects under 10 megawatts. Meanwhile, the projects above 10 megawatts

1575 1576

are allowed US Dollar-pegged tariffs, protecting larger, often foreign-backed projects from foreign exchange risk. Why is this inconsistency? Are we creating a tariff regime that rewards size, not merit? Are we discouraging distributed, citizen-led renewable investments while paving the way for large, centralized fossil fuel infrastructure? This is not just poor design, but also structural discrimination.

Sir, I can go on, on this subject, but I want to move on to another important area. Now, we have a very efficient Secretary to the Ministry and Chairman of the CEB, Prof. Udayanga Hemapala, who is known to me. He had once served under me in an institution, to which I appointed him as Chairman, when I was Minister of Higher Education. He is a very efficient gentleman. Now, he is also going to be the Chairman of the Lanka Transformers Limited. While referring to that, I would say that the Government should initiate an investigation, starting from the roots, to understand how former public servants became shareholders of the LTL cartel, whether those former public servants paid fair consideration for their shareholding or whether they were beneficiaries of an orchestrated scheme hatched by the procurement mafia to incentivize a selected group of public servants to keep the procurement mafia fire burning whilst indirectly controlling the CEB.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , [ [ 1. 1 1 .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Parliament should request the subject Minister and the Hon. President to appoint a high-powered committee consisting of non-conflicted professionals who are not aligned to the power industry to deep dive and unravel the maze of entities with cross shareholding and also figure out the net worth of shareholdings of former public servants in this LTL venture. Sir, it is said that there are employees' trust companies which have been formed and are hidden. 1[, 1[ [ [ [ 1 [ 1 [ 1. 1 [ [ ; 11 . Sir, we saw that there was an IPO worth almost Rs. 20 billion. This entity is worth more than Rs. 100 billion today. So, how can there be such a large amount of shareholding of a few public servants, who had been attached to the Ceylon Electricity Board, in charge of the LTL and are now controlling this mafia? Therefore, that has to be looked into. I call upon the Government to look into it very seriously; particularly, the Chairman of the LTL should now initiate an inquiry and let the public know what is happening inside that institution.

Thank you.

( - ) (The Hon. Eranga Weeraratne - Deputy Minister of Digital Economy) Hon. Presiding Member, the new Sri Lanka Electricity (Amendment) Act of 2024, being a bold move to restructure the CEB, does not go far enough in creating a transparent, competitive and future-proof organizational and institutional structure. Therefore, the Amendments proposed by this Government have been introduced to bring in critical structural changes and digital innovations needed to ensure that the electricity sector could serve our citizens efficiently, attract investments, reduce tariffs and pave the way for a future of sustainable energy.

The people of this country gave this Government a clear mandate to reform the broken systems, dismantle inefficiencies, end corruption and to deliver affordable and reliable services to all. As articulated in the NPP Energy Policy, our energy transition by restructuring one monolithic organization such as the CEB would increase efficiency and transparency, inviting innovation and putting the people at the centre of the energy system.

Sir, I will briefly explain a few main structural changes proposed by these Amendments. Planning and procurement, dispatching of electricity and its system operation will be done by the National System Operator - NSO - which will be 100 per cent owned by the Government. The National Transmission Network Service Provider will handle the power flow from generating companies to distribution companies, again 100 per cent owned by the Government. However, there could be additional players of providing transmission services based on the national requirement. Multiple generation companies including those generating renewable energy and Independent Power Producers - IPPs - will compete to provide electricity at a lower price. Then, multiple distribution companies will serve the consumers. The existing distribution arm of the CEB will be restructured into a separate organization 100 per cent owned by the Government and new distribution companies may come up in the future.

Introduction of competitive bidding to build power plants and bulk purchase of electricity by NSO is essential in driving down costs and improving service quality. Sri Lanka is not alone in this journey. Many countries which started with a monolithic government organization for electricity, that is to handle from generation to distribution, like the CEB have successfully navigated in this path of restructuring. For example, Australia introduced real-time electricity bidding and day-ahead power procurement through its National Electricity Market - NEM. That has led to lower prices and improved reliability. Through Tenaga Nasional Berhad -TNB, Malaysia unbundled its operations while retaining government control in transmission. Independent Power Producers now generate a significant portion of electricity under competitive frameworks in

1597 1598

that country. India also reformed its State-owned electricity boards into separate generation, transmission and distribution entities. Singapore operates its electricity sector under the Energy Market Authority - EMA - allowing consumers to choose among multiple electricity retailers. The market features real-time wholesale trading, smart grid integration and strict regulatory oversight to ensure competition, reliability and low system losses. South Africa, too, currently undergoes unbundling of Eskom into three separate entities for generation, transmission and distribution to overcome chronic inefficiencies and load shedding.

In this restructuring, digitalization is not optional, but would be the foundation to make our electricity sector more efficient, accountable and more affordable. For example, smart grids will enable automated real-time monitoring, reduce technical losses and allow catering for flexible demands from customers. Then, smart meters would empower consumers to monitor their usage of electricity and shift consumption during peak times, support for prepaid electricity and eliminate billing errors, which happen in the current way of doing business. AI and data analytics will optimize grid operations, forecast demand, predict failures and support preventative maintenance, thereby reducing operational costs. Digital tendering and procurement platforms for transparent, competitive and auditable procurements are mandatory. Also, land management portals will fast-track project approvals and give investors clear, real-time access to land availability, reducing delays and risks. So, at the end of the day, digitalization will empower the citizen, improve investor confidence and drastically reduce the cost of electricity through operational excellence.

Sir, one main question asked by the Opposition and the public is, will this restructuring reduce the tariff? The short answer is, yes, but with a realistic and phased approach. So, immediate cost reductions will come from introducing competition in power procurement, phasing out costly emergency power purchases, reducing technical and commercial losses and leveraging digital efficiencies. The other question asked is whether there will be an issue for the current workforce. This reform is not for dismantling of the workforce, but for transformation of the institution. The proposed Amendments include a 100 per cent government-owned employees' fund to secure pensions and welfare. Then, there will be employment guarantee for the employees in this transition to the new institutions under this new restructuring or the excess employees could go on voluntarily retirement through a VRS, safeguarding the current staff and their rights. Also, this restructuring involves training and upskilling of the current CEB employees to take on the future-ready roles. Then, transparent communication and HR restructuring to prevent uncertainty and fear are also included in the plan.

In conclusion, I would like to say that these Amendments present a critical step in unleashing the true potential of Sri Lanka's electricity sector. They reflect our commitment to the people's mandate, our confidence in technology and our responsibility to future generations.

Let us rise above short-term political goals and act in the long-term national interest. Let us make electricity efficient, affordable, transparent and digital, as in any modern economy. I urge this House to pass these Amendments not for political credit, but for the benefit of the people we have been elected to serve.

I thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to speak in this Debate.
