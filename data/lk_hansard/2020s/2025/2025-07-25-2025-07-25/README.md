FAILURE TO MEET INFLATION AND MONETARY POLICY

TARGETS BY CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Speaker, I stand up to ask this Question under Standing Order 27(2) from the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development on a persistent matter of accountability relating to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. It is of deep and growing concern that the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has repeatedly failed to meet its inflation and monetary policy targets, at least, for five of the last six quarters, despite enjoying operational independence and a legal mandate to maintain price stability.

Following the enactment of the new Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act, the Central Bank was granted enhanced independence in the formulation and execution of the monetary policy. However, such independence must be matched by a clearly defined framework of accountability. In this context, the critical question arises as to whom the Central Bank is now accountable and through what institutional or public mechanism that accountability is exercised. Sir, I quote from Section 5(2) of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act, No. 16 of 2023.

"The Central Bank shall be autonomous and accountable."

Sir, their autonomy is there, but their accountability is nowhere to be seen. Time and again, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has attributed its failure to meet inflation targets to fiscal slippage, external shocks and supply-side constraints. However, such explanations cannot substitute for timely and effective monetary action in the context of full independence and the freedom for monetary policy-making. Notably, in the face of renewed inflationary pressures in recent quarters, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka refrained from adjusting policy rates in a timely manner, undermining its credibility and ability to anchor inflation expectations. Over the years, since its inception in 1950, the Central Bank of Sri Lank has beaten fiscal authorities for maintaining a higher Budget deficit, that being the scapegoat goat for covering up of its monetary policy failures. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka cannot do it any more since the 15th of September 2023, the day on which the new Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act, No. 16 of 2023 became effective. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka is now fully independent and free to make its own policies.

This raises the following critical questions: 1. Why has the Central Bank continuously failed to meet its inflation targets over the past several quarters? 2. Has the Central Bank, in practice, compromised its independence due to fiscal dominance or external (IMF/political) constraints?

3. What structural reforms, if any, have been undertaken to ensure true independence and accountability of the Central Bank in the context of inflation targeting?

4. Why has the Central Bank not proactively adjusted the interest rate and exchange rate policy in response to emerging inflationary pressures?

5. Has the Monetary Policy Board carried out any self-assessment or published explanations under the IMF Programme's accountability matrix for target misses?

( ) ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Anil Jayantha - Minister of Labour and Deputy Minister of Economic Development) Hon. Speaker, on behalf of the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, I answer that Question.

1. Inflation has deviated from the inflation target primarily due to pronounced supply-side deflation. As outlined in the published target breach reports, significant reductions in administered prices and costs - especially in electricity and fuel - have really exerted a strong downward pressure on inflation in recent times. In addition, the deflation

1127 1128

2025 2

arising from supply-side factors is beyond the scope of the monetary policy. However, considering the overall economic development, mainly the macroeconomic development, the Central Bank has adopted an accommodative policy stance by reducing the policy interest rate by eight per cent from June, 2023 till July, 2025.

At the same time, it is noteworthy to understand that exceptionally high inflation levels prevailed in the country, especially in 2022 and 2023. Therefore, a brief period of inflation lower than the targeted inflation could, in a way, provide some relief to households and businesses.

2. No. The Central Bank Act was enacted with effect from September, 2023, allowing greater independence to the Central Bank. Accordingly, the Central Bank is not subject to fiscal dominance or any other external constraints.

3. The enactment of the Act is a major structural reform and according to Section 8, the Act establishes a Governing Board to oversee the tasks and the general policy decisions other than monetary policy and enforcement measures. Further, according to Section 11 of the Act, the Monetary Policy Board has been established to deal with a flexible exchange rate regime in line with flexible inflation targeting framework to achieve and maintain domestic price stability.

In support of policy transparency and accountability, the Act mandates the Central Bank to publish the Monetary Policy Framework Agreement between the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank, outlining inflation targets according to Section 26. It also defines the requirement of the Central Bank to submit reports to Parliament and make them available to the general public, if the inflation target specified in the Monetary Policy Framework Agreement is not met. So, that has been done. In addition, every six months, another report on inflation is published. The third report, which is on the state of economy, is also submitted annually.

Further, the Act prohibits monetary financing and therefore, there is no influence on the Central Bank activities.

4. Under the framework of Flexible Inflation Targeting - FIT - the Central Bank has taken appropriate and prudent monetary policy measures proactively, while maintaining a flexible exchange rate policy, as stipulated by the Act.

5. The Monetary Policy Board carries out its independent assessment and reviews inflation performance under the IMF Extended Fund Facility programme, which is being monitored by the IMF staff and reviewed by the IMF Executive Board. These assessments are in the public domain and are available on the IMF website as well.

6. Yes. There are specific requirements prescribed in the Act in the event of deviations from the targets and since, consecutively, two quarters were

missed, the Central Bank has submitted the necessary information to Parliament. Those procedures and provisions are prescribed in the amended Act.

The Inflation Target Agreement was signed in 2023. It is valid for three years and will end in 2026. The target set was 5 per cent. That had been determined based on the facts, figures and research done, again within the band of 2 per cent upside and downside, which means that it could vary from 3 per cent to 7 per cent. However, the downward slab - the 3 per cent - is not that much of a worry since it does not really hike the inflation further.

7. The Coordination Council established under the Act provides for coordination especially on fiscal, monetary and financial stability policies between the Government and the Central Bank. Accordingly, several coordination meetings had taken place. From 2023 up to now, seven meetings had taken place, with three meetings held under our regime.

8. As per the Central Banks review, it is not applicable because the Bank does not attribute the deviation of inflation from the target to fiscal activities.

9. The Act endorses the Monetary Policy Framework Agreement with regard to setting out the inflation target to be achieved by the Central Bank. Accordingly, this framework was signed between the Hon. Minister of Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank on 03rd October, 2023.

10. The Central Bank, accordingly, ensure accountability through regular reporting and Parliamentary engagement. Section 26 of the Act mandates the Monetary Policy Board to report to the Minister of Finance and table a Report in Parliament when inflation deviates from the target for two consecutive quarters, detailing causes, corrective measures and timelines to achieve the targets. Such reports are also made available to the public. Section 80 requires the Central Bank to inform the public about monetary policy implementation, at least, every six months. Additionally, the Governor, the Members of the Governing Board and the Monetary Policy Board and every Deputy Governor of the Central Bank must appear before Parliament or its Committees every four months upon request. Accordingly, the Central Bank appears before the Committee on Public Finance, as required. The Governor should ensure that the Central Bank publishes and tables the Annual Report within four months after the closing of each Financial Year, reviewing policies and economic conditions. Further, the Central Bank fulfills its biannual reporting obligation by publishing the Monetary Policy Report each February and August, covering inflation movements, projections, risks and policy actions based on their research.

Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Speaker will now take the Chair.

[ () .

, , [ () ] .

Whereupon THE HON. SPEAKER left the Chair, and DEPUTY SPEAKER [THE HON. (DR.) RIZVIE SALIH] took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, may I seek a clarification? ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, you may have just a minute for that clarification.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker.

While I respect to the Answer you gave, Hon. Deputy Minister, I must state that it does not fully anwer the Question I raised to ensure that you understand the gravity of the accountability of the Central Bank. Basically, the Central Bank's appearing twice before the Committee on Public Finance and the COPE does not demonstrate its accountability. As for the Governor and the Central Bank, it is not clear to whom they are directly responsible. There is a necessity for that when it comes to an institution of this nature. Take, for instance, a citizen who wants to buy a car, a house, invest overseas or seek priority sector lending. Even government salaries are approved by the Central Bank, but the Governors own salary is approved by himself.

The SMEs are being pushed to the wall. So, the control of these types of things is not in the hands of the Minister of Finance Anura Dissanayake, who was elected by the people, but in the hands of an unelected person, who runs the fiscal and monetary policies and decides the fate of the economy of this country.

So, Sir, my point is that this countrys economy has gone through too many turbulent times and it is necessary to bring about a sense of accountability and to make this institution report directly to someone. Now that you all have got a two-thirds majority, if there are half-baked legislations, it is time to have them corrected. I am saying with empirical evidence and with practical experience.

This country cannot go through another 22nd May type operation. Therefore, my question to you, Hon. Deputy Minister, is, if there is a sense of independence for the Central Bank, what was the he doing in Washington when he has a lot to do with negotiations regarding Donald Trump's tariff? This is a breach of that sense of independence, Hon. Deputy Minister. So, I would appreciate if you, with your knowledge, would take this on, Hon. Deputy Minister, and ensure that corrective action is taken with immediate effect.

( ) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Anil Jayantha) Hon. Deputy Speaker, as of now, the Central Bank operates and functions within this given framework and autonomy is not only for administrative purposes, but also for accountability purposes, which is carried out through submission of reports. Actually, they have to go by information, facts, figures and research done and not based on emotions or any other thing. Therefore, they are accountable and they have to report - that reporting really matters - through three types of reports. If there are any deviations from targets, of course, we can question them and hold them accountable. As highlighted in my Answer - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, let him finish. ( ) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Anil Jayantha) I was answering specifically on inflation targets. If you take this inflation target of 5 per cent, it is very clear that they have taken into account the information during the last 20- year period. So, our average inflation now lies at 5 per cent. Of course, during the period of the economic crisis, it went up to 70 per cent. That is a different story. Now, the inflation has come down and we are experiencing a kind of deflationary situation; it has gradually moved up to zero. Therefore, that 5 per cent has been decided based on facts. In the future, if it is not appropriate, we can change it accordingly. So, as of now, they are working based on facts. I must tell you one thing, that with their autonomy, accountability and practices, in fact, price and financial stability has been achieved and now, we have to work on that to take the country forward towards economic growth and development. - [Interruption]

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, we are not going to make this a topic for debate.

VOTES OF CONDOLENCE: HON. RAJAVAROTHIAM SAMPANTHAN, HON. A. PILAPITIYA, HON. W.B. EKANAYAKE,

HON. LUCKY JAYAWARDANA AND

HON. (MRS.) MALANI FONSEKA

[.. 11. 0]

( ) ( - , , ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake - Minister of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation and Leader of the House of Parliament) .

Hon. Deputy Speaker, I rise today with a sense of profound loss to move the Vote of Condolence on the death of our very senior Parliamentary Colleague, the Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan, the Leader of the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi, ITAK, who represented the Constituency of Trincomalee.

The late Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan was first elected to Parliament in 1977 under the Tamil United Liberation Front, representing the Electoral District of Trincomalee and he served his constituency and the country at large as a Member of Parliament until 2024.

He was born in Trincomalee in 1933 to Mr. Arunasalam Rajavarothiam, who worked as a warehouse superintendent at the Gal-Oya Project, and Mrs. Subramaniam Purnasundaram Yogambikai.

He studied at St. Marys Convent, Trincomalee, St. Josephs Tamil College, Trincomalee, St. Annes College, Kurunegala, St. Sebastians College, Moratuwa and St. Patricks College, Jaffna and then, entered the Ceylon Law College in 1951 and became a lawyer.

1141 1142

His political journey began in 1956 with his affiliation to the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi - ITAK. He joined the Tamil United Liberation Front in 1972 and held the positions of Treasurer, Vice President and General Secretary of that party. At the 1977 General Election, he was elected to Parliament and his party secured the majority votes in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces.

In 2001, he assumed leadership of the Tamil National Alliance - TNA - a coalition of Tamil parties. He remained at the helm of the TNA until his demise, providing steady and principled leadership - I reiterate, Sir, providing steady and principled leadership - to that Tamil political movement.

The Hon. Sampanthan was also the senior-most Member, having represented Parliament from 1977 to 1983 - we know why he left Parliament in 1983 - then from 1997 to 2000 and from 2001 onwards until his death. He served as the 14th Leader of the Opposition in Parliament from 2015 to 2018, becoming the second Tamil Leader of the Opposition in Parliament, 38 years after the Hon. Appapillai Amirthalingam became the Leader of the Opposition in 1977.

He was widely recognized as a national and a statesmanlike figure within Sri Lankan politics. A tireless advocate for peace, reconciliation and justice, the Hon. Sampanthan played a central and a stabilizing role in Tamil political discourse. His political ideology was deeply rooted in the aspiration to harmonize the rights of all ethnic groups, with a special concern on the Tamil people, within a united Sri Lanka. Over six decades, he earned the reputation of a principled patriot, one who pursued national unity through dialogue and understanding.

A principled politician who unwaveringly championed social justice, he earned deep respect, both locally and internationally. He consistently advocated for peace and the rights of the Sri Lankan people, often representing their cause on numerous official visits abroad.

He was married to Mrs. Leeladevi and was a loving father of two sons and a daughter.

Sir, the Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan rendered a dedicated service to his party and the broader public as a committed and conscientious Parliamentarian, serving a cumulative total of 31 years in this House. He passed away on the 30th of June, 2024 at the age of 91.

Sir, several times, we have been trying our best to take up the Vote of Condolence on the death of the Hon. Sampanthan, but due to some issues we were not able to do that. We can see the family members of the Hon. Sampanthan participating on this occasion and we welcome them on behalf of Parliament.

Sir, death of a mature politician like the Hon. Sampanthan is an unfillable void on the political sphere of Sri Lanka. We pray that the late Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan attain the state he aspired to in accordance with his religious belief, and request that this august Assembly convey its condolences to his beloved wife, children and relatives.

Deputy Speaker, when we look at pre-eminent personalities in the Sri Lankan political sphere who have performed on behalf of the Sri Lankan people, the late Hon. R. Sampanthan clearly stands out. He was, through his actions, a role model for all of us and for all who are aspiring to serve Mother Lanka. He was a role model as a democrat, adhering to the noble principles of giving due validity and cognizance to the concept of peoples sovereignty.

He possessed certain unique characteristics, characteristics which are important in embarking on accountable and responsible public service. At all times, he represented his constituency, the people he loved, exhibiting kindness, empathy and sympathy and always made it an effort to promote policies which benefited his people, his constituents.

Sir, he was a strong advocate of humanism. He was always of the opinion that Sri Lanka should remain one country, that Sri Lankas political independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity must be protected, enhanced and maintained. He was very vociferous in expressing his opinions, both within and outside Parliament. He stood by principles; he was a conviction politician. He had the noble characteristic of recognizing the spectrum of opinions, the plethora of opinions on any given subject, using a rational methodology to arrive at conclusions and deductions.

He championed the cause of the people, not merely of the people in the North and the East, but of all the people living in our motherland, in all of the nine provinces, the 25 administrative districts, the 341 AGA Divisions spreading across 14,021 Grama Niladhari Divisions and 51,000 micro-villages. He was particularly interested in ensuring that the divisions which existed within our society were addressed and eradicated. He was a strong supporter of inclusive growth and shared prosperity. On

most occasions, he spoke aloud about the social, economic and developmental disparities that exist in our society. I remember that he always illustrated the neglect that the North and the East and even certain other provinces suffered due to political neglect of leaders. So, in all, the late Hon. Sampanthan was indeed a unique leader, a leader who espoused the cause of the people, the people who had been suffering at the hands of politicians who followed policies of benign neglect.

Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees, next, I wish to pay tribute to a distinguished Member and a gentleman we lost from this House, who is none other than the late Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan. He was a dignified Member of this House, who happened to be the second Tamil Member of Parliament to hold the post of the Leader of the Opposition. He was eloquent both in Tamil and English languages and spoke passionately about the matters regarding the Tamil community.

As a patriotic citizen of this country, he always pinned a badge with the Sri Lankan Flag before boarding a plane. I was fortunate to be a Member of the same delegation he was in when travelling abroad and witnessed the friendship and respect extended towards him by the Indian Prime Minister and several other world leaders. Madam, when questioned regarding the ethnic issue, he always expressed that it is an internal matter of this country and a solution is sought by ourselves. He had a vast knowledge of the world history. While visiting China, he surprised the entire delegation with the information he had on the history of the Great Wall of China. The Hon. Sampanthan was a well read and a well experienced Member of Parliament.

Madam, we have lost a senior and a distinguished Member of this House and we wish to convey our heartfelt condolences to the late Hon. Sampanthans family members.

Madam, my final tribute would be to a quintessential political leader who represented this House. That is none other than the Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan. In paying tribute to him, I would say that he had been one of the finest speakers who had adorned this House. His oratory was such that when he spoke, the entire House was willing to listen to him without any disturbance. He was such a colossal figure who adorned this House. Madam, as a tribute to him, I thought that rather than speaking continuously in English, I would say a few words in Tamil since he represented the Tamil community in this House.

[2.54 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Jeevan Thondaman) Hon. Presiding Member, being one of the youngest Members in this House, I cannot say that I have had the privilege and honour to work with the late Hon. Lucky Jayawardana, the late Hon. Malani Fonseka, the late Hon. W. B Ekanayake and the late Hon. R. Sampanthan. However, let me extend my deepest sympathies and condolences to their families. What I was made aware was that my late father had, in fact, shared a friendship based on mutual respect with the late Hon. Lucky Jayawardana. And, from whatever we have learned about our predecessors, we have heard that he was a man of sharp intellect and discipline. He had brought a sense of quiet competence to this House. I think to say that he merely inherited the name "Jayawardana" would be an injustice; he had earned it; more than looking at it as a legacy, he had carried it forward as a responsibility. Similarly, I would also like to say that in this House, we honour not just his lineage, but also his life defined by service, humility and consistency.

Sir, we also mourn the loss of a giant from our cultural life, the Hon. (Mrs.) Malani Fonseka. To call her merely an actress would be to diminish what she meant to the nation; she was the Queen of Sinhala Cinema. In fact, she had even acted in a picture with the late Sivaji Ganesan. I believe it was called Pilot Premnath. She was just loved and trusted. I believe people always felt a sense of reflection around her, and her legacy will continue to inspire artistes, especially women in the field of arts.

At last, we would remember the late Hon. W.B. Ekanayake. A public servant in the truest sense, he represented the people of Anuradhapura with sincerity and dedication. A man deeply rooted in his soil, in his faith and in his people, he believed that politics was not a means to power, but a means to serve. Whether as a State Minister or a grassroots representative, his politics was never about noise, but about people.

Sir, I would like to extend my condolences on behalf of the Ceylon Workers Congress, the United National Party and on behalf of the people of the upcountry to their families.

Sir, I would like to offer my deepest condolences to the family of the late R. Sampanthan. In relation to my experiences with the late Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - I was just mentioning that - I would like to say that on my first day here in Parliament, he advised me on how a Parliamentarian should conduct himself and he also brought up and emphasized the fact that he was the oldest Member of Parliament and I was the youngest Member of

1181 1182

Parliament, but our intention should be to serve the people. Though I may not have had a very close relationship with him, there was always respect for him and we looked at him not just as a Tamil leader, but a leader for us all. He was one of the senior-most leaders in this country and I must say in this House that there may be different opinions and different narratives, but the truth of the narrative is, he was the only architect of national engagement when it came to the Tamil national issue. And what I truly believe is, with regard to late Sampanthan Aiya, what would be carried forward would be his belief and his legacy, where he firmly believed that no one or no one race is above another. We all are Sri Lankans and we all would love to see a shared country.

And once again, let me offer my condolences to the families on behalf of the Ceylon Workers Congress, the United National Party and the up-country community.

Thank you. [.. 3.01] ( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara, Attorney-at-Law) . . . . . .

. .. . 1960 . . The late Hon. Abeyratne Pilapitiya was a distinguished politician hailing from the Sabaragamuwa Province. The Hon. Pilapitiya was born in 1925 and was 98 years old at the time of his demise.

He first entered Parliament by winning the March, 1960 Parliamentary Elections, representing the Kalawana Constituency and throughout his political career, the Hon. Pilapitiya contested the Kalawana Seat five times as a candidate of the United National Party at the Parliamentary Elections held in March, 1960, July, 1960, 1965, 1970 and 1977. Notably, he emerged victorious in three of those contests, specifically at the Elections held in March, 1960, 1965 and 1977. His dedication and leadership qualities led him to the position of Deputy Minister of Posts and Telecommunication, a role he executed with distinction.

In addition to his Parliamentary contributions, the Hon. Pilapitiya ventured into regional politics by running for and winning the first Provincial Council Election for Sabaragamuwa in 1988 under the United National Party ticket, subsequently becoming the Chief Minister. He further served as a Governor of the Uva Province, exhibiting his commitment to public service for nearly four decades. The Hon. Pilapitiya's name became synonymous with discussions surrounding the Sri Lankan Constitution, as his appointment to the Kalawana Constituency during the 1977 Parliamentary Elections sparked legal disputes, triggering a significant constitutional crisis. In response, a proposal surfaced to resolve the situation by splitting the constituency into two seats, allowing the Hon. Pilapitiya to regain his position under the revised 1978 Constitution with subsequent by-elections. Demonstrating remarkable statesmanship, he chose to resign from Parliament before the crisis escalated, thus contributing to his peaceful resolution. There is a lot more to say about the Hon. Pilapitiya, but in the interest of time, I will limit my intervention about him to that.

Finally, Sir, I would like to speak about the late Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan, who was the Leader of the Tamil National Alliance and also our party. He was also a Leader of the Opposition. So, I have to say a few words on behalf of him.

The late Hon. Sampanthan served this House for over half a century across multiple chapters of Sri Lankas post-Independence history. His Parliamentary career was not just long, but was principled. It was shaped by an unwavering commitment to justice, democracy and most of all, the dignity and the political rights of the Tamil people. He believed in meaningful power-sharing, reconciliation without erasure, accountability and in a just and an honourable solution to the national question. He sought peace, not surrender. He spoke gently, but the truth he carried thundered through the halls and beyond this Parliament. What set the Hon. Sampanthan apart was not just his intellect or experience, but his moral clarity. He refused to abandon our cause even when it was politically inconvenient or personally costly and through it all, he conducted himself with a grace that earned the respect of both the allies and adversaries. He believed in dialogue, but never at the cost of principle. He carried forward the mandate of a wounded and often silenced community and carried it with immense grace and discipline.

One important aspect of the Hon. Sampanthans political life was his engagement during the period of the Indo-Lanka Accord. While he was not a direct party to the Accord, he recognized the potential it held to create a framework for devolution on reconciliation. He maintained a constructive and principled engagement with India, not for narrow political gain, but in pursuit of a sustainable and a just solution to the national question. He consistently urged both Colombo and New Delhi to uphold the spirit of the Indo-Lanka Accord to deliver devolution beyond mere words, to implement the Thirteenth Amendment meaningfully and to move forward towards a federal arrangement. He believed that external actors had a role to play, but, ultimately, a solution must come from within through genuine commitment by all communities to exist with equality.

Another significant moment in his career was during his tenure as the Leader of the Opposition. When President Maithreepala Sirisena, during the coup, appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Leader of the Opposition of Sri Lanka, the Hon. Sampanthan took the responsibility upon himself to uphold democracy and went to the Supreme Court. I think he was the petitioner in that case, which later led President Maithreepala Sirisena to reverse his decision. So, the late Hon. Sampanthans contribution has not been just for the Tamil community, but for the entire country.

So, in remembering the Hon. Sampanthan, to this House I would say, let us reflect on what he stood for: meaningful reconciliation, equal rights and a country where no community must beg for dignity. That is the unfinished work of this Parliament; that is the duty we inherit from him.
