Engineering Association Akurana

EEA Recommendations to Mitigate Flash Floods in Akurana

The Engineers Association, Akurana (EEA) has been deeply concerned about the repeated flash flooding of Akurana from Pinga Oya tributaries. Since the late 1990s, there has been increased construction into the river channel, dumping of wastewater and other waste, loss of flood plains in the river margins, and a rapid increase of impervious surfaces in the Pinga Oya sub-catchment around Akurana.

Here, we set out the position of the EEA on the causes, proposed recent mitigation steps and its shortcomings and the principles for developing effective flood mitigation and river restoration.

Primary Causes of Flash Flooding

The primary causes of flooding are:

The continued construction into the river and its margins.

The filling of flood overflow zones.

Land cover used for soil and vegetation beneficial in the infiltration of water to the ground is being reduced rapidly in the catchment.

Dumping of solid waste and construction debris in the river.

Sir, this has been signed off by Eng. J.M. Samoon and Eng. L.M. Zubair, very senior citizens of Akurana who are very qualified engineers, one of whom had been working in the University of Yale in the USA. He has a climate research institute functioning at his home. He has taken the rainfall figures related to Akurana and its floods for several years; he has all the figures. So, these gentlemen have to be invited to the Ministry or the UDA. In fact, I asked the Hon. Minister K.D. Lal Kantha about this at the last DCC Meeting in Kandy. I wrote a letter to him and tabled it at the DCC Meeting. I wanted him to have a detailed seminar on why this flooding is taking place in Akurana. In fact, a seminar was conducted at the Peradeniya University a few years ago regarding the Akurana floods and detailed research papers also had been presented. So, several ideas can be taken out of those to mitigate the flooding in Akurana.

That is, to pack fish for export. That is also a matter of concern as all the fishing boats cannot enter the Oluvil Harbour because the harbour mouth is blocked. That is because of a wrong design of the breakwater. The breakwater design had been done by DANIDA. DANIDA was the agency which funded it and that agency had finally accepted their fault and was prepared to give US Dollars 12 million as compensation. But, the Sri Lanka Ports Authority is unable to access it because the whole cost of it would be more than US Dollars 20 million. The balance has to be provided by Sri Lanka Ports Authority. So, the correction of the breakwater has been held back and it needs to be done. If it is improved, it will be a big help.

I would also like to refer to the issue of the Batticaloa International Airport. . . because China Bay is an important location. It had been a military airport in the past. The runway of the Batticaloa International Airport needs to be properly designed and completed so that commercial aircraft can be landed there. . . : . .

Sir, I also want to tell something about the Kandy Multimodal Transport Terminal. .

( ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake) The Hon. Deputy Minister of Transport and Highways is there to explain.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Okay. The Multimodal Transport Terminal may not be useful unless you set up the necessary facilities for the buses entering the Kandy City to be parked in three different locations - Katugastota, Peradeniya and Pallekele. Those are the entry points to Kandy. A large number of busses come from outstations and when they come into the city during peak hours, a severe congestion takes place. To prevent that, there has been plan: to have three places at which those busses could be stopped and the commuters to use a shuttle service operated within the city. Not only was there a plan for a shuttle service of buses, but also a tram or single train service travelling through the Kandy City, using the rail track; those services had also been included in the original master plan. So, those have to be finalized in order to completely solve the problem of traffic congestion in Kandy. That is a very serious problem. I am sure the Hon. Minister would attend to it when the Multimodal Transport Terminal is completed.

Having said that, may I also deal with another matter. . : . The Deputy Minister of Ports and Civil Aviation, the Hon.

1429 1430

Janitha Ruwan Kodithuwakku, had given a statement to the Daily Mirror. It was a headline in the Daily Mirror the day before yesterday. It states, I quote:

Govt. to woo top ten shipping liners in world for Colombo port expansion.

Then, the Hon. Deputy Minister goes on to describe what they propose to do. But, Hon. Minister, I want to share with you that some of the experts in the logistics sector has pointed out some serious ideological gaps in this issue. I am sure this is part of the Presidents Budget Speech, a promise made through the Budget. The Hon. President has said that the calling for Expressions of Interest for the Colombo West Container Terminal 2 and the Colombo North Port Project will take place within one month. So, you are obviously trying to fulfil what the Hon. President said.

( ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake) We are having discussions.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Yes, you are having discussions, I understand. But, let me point out some experts comments regarding this, particularly about creating excess capacity. The available container terminal capacity of the Colombo Port by the end of 2026 is expected to be 14.15 million TEUs, as detailed in this table I have here with me and which I table*.

It is about 45 per cent more than the 7.79 TEUs handled in the year 2024. So, by 2026, next year, you are going to double the capacity at the Port with all these completions that have been earmarked. But, I have an issue regarding the completion of the ETC. I do not think it will be completed within the next two years; it might take at least another two years with the way you have cancelled some of the tenders. Well and good, if you think there had been some fraud or some issue; you can do that. But, the fact is, as you said, when you try to get some of the equipment, those equipment will not available ex-stock. You have to order those and they will have to start producing them and it is going to take a long time.

Once you cancel a tender, the impact is, the entire project gets delayed. So, definitely the ECT's completion will be delayed by at least another one and a half to two years; that is my assumption. However, without dealing with the issue further, I would like to point out that the National Port Master Plan completed in 2019 - the consultant was the MTBS - states that the 14.15 million

TEUs capacity will be sufficient to meet the demand forecasted through to the year 2040. Once you achieve this capacity of 14 million TEUs, that would be enough to go by the demand forecasted until 2040. So, what is the use of now trying to do the Colombo North Port with three new container terminals, featuring a combined quay length of 4,600 metres, which is not required till 2040.

( ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake) It will take a decade.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Yes, it will take a decade or more. So, therefore, if you all are going to consult and do it after a decade, if you are going to be prepared ten years ahead, well and good. But, we have another serious problem coming up. Of course, the newspapers have given details about the issue pertaining to the concession agreement with the Adani Ports. That issue is also an impediment to calling for new tenders. So, the Adani-run Port terminal contract blocks the SLPAs partnership for East terminal; that is another issue. That issue will also result in further delays in getting a new third party identified to start developing the balance available terminals. So, these issues will also have to be considered.

( ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake) Hon. Member, you are a very senior former Minister in charge of ports, whom I respect. Yes, the Adani agreement has blocked and created some issues, but it is not relevant to the development of the ECT and we can even start West Terminal 2.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) I understand that.

Then, with regard to the capacity of the Hambantota Port, it is expected to be increased from one million to two million TEUs by end of 2027. This would also create a further excess capacity over the countrys demand and a price war with terminals in the Colombo Port, which is going to have 45 per cent over capacity by the end of 2026, as explained earlier. The SLPA-JCT is going to be affected by that trade war; not anybody else, but your own terminal, which is giving you 70 per cent of income, is going to suffer because of the price war. Then, the JCT would not have any customers coming there. At the rate these terminals are getting developed and with this overcapacity, the biggest impact would be on the JCT. So, if the JCT gets impacted on, the SLPA would find it difficult to operate because it has to pay back the cost of the breakwater of the ECT as well. For the breakwater, a big loan was taken and that has to be paid back, all of which would be hampered once this price war starts. At the discussions on the SAGT, which was commissioned

1431 1432

2025 07

way back when my late Leader, the Hon. Ashraff, was the Minister, they commented on having to deal with a price war. So, if there is going to be several terminals operated by different operators, the only way to handle that is to have a proper regulator. You need to have a Port Terminal Regulator appointed and that Regulator needs to be appointed immediately because there are going to be several terminals - the CICT, the SAGT, the JCT, the ECT and the Colombo North Port, which is also going to come up in the latter stages. So, it will become a serious pricing war and would affect the countrys income, if it goes on without any proper regulation.

So, the appointment of a Port Terminal Regulator is a sine quo non; it has to be done without much delay. I hope the Hon. Minister would consider these suggestions and make sure that this price war would not affect the ultimate earning capacity of the SLPA.

Sir, now, I come to the much talked-about internal container dry port in Veyangoda. According to experts, the proposed internal container dry port in Veyangoda is to be established as a long-term measure to ease the container traffic congestion in and around the Colombo Port and to increase foreign earnings through value addition. You can, of course, do some value addition with the logistics park and all that. The congestion at the Colombo Port is mainly due to Customs clearance delays of import and export cargo containers in and out of the Port. A rise in the number of containers being inspected daily by the Customs due to various clearance issues and the surge in the number of ships docking at the Port have resulted in higher container volumes requiring inspection, leading to delays in the container release process causing congestion and impacting on the efficiency of the Port operations. Several hundreds of containers imported are inside the Port of Colombo and more are queued up for days awaiting entry to the Port pending Customs inspections. The congestion in the Colombo Port cannot be eased by making use of a dry port which is located about 40 km away from the Port and in a non-logistic corridor. It is not in a logistic corridor and is a dry port far away from the Colombo Port. Of course, a dry port is all right, but that is not going to help ease this congestion. Therefore, what I suggest is, as an interim measure to ease the congestion, it is possible to hire privately-operated container yards located close to the Port of Colombo until the Kerawalapitiya Customs Inspection Yard and the Bloemendhal Logistics Park are fully established and operational. Until that is done, many such privately-owned, well-equipped and modern container freight stations and yards available in close proximity to the Port of Colombo and in its logistic corridor need to be put in place to be used for the necessary parking of containers. So, rather than going on to create a dry port at a far away place as a solution to this problem, that would be the best way to handle this issue.

Sir, having said all that, I would now like to comment on one other important matter concerning water security for Colombo and particularly, the Gampaha District, the two highly populated districts in the country. There has been a suggestion that we must have dedicated reservoirs for water alone, the Yatimahana and Wee Oya Reservoirs.

Those two projects are very important and cannot be delayed any further. So, immediate feasibility studies have to be done and some studies have already been done. The Wee Oya and Yatimahana reservoirs are very important to meet the demand for water in the highly populated areas in Wayamba as well as in the Western Province.

I also would like to remind you that a famous PPP project suggested during our time, the Weliwita Bulk Water Supply Project, has finally not happened. The Hon. President has been talking about PPP projects. That is a PPP project for which the Asian Development Bank was willing to support, but to that project, unfortunately, there were a lot of objections by engineers of the CEB, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board and various other places. Engineers, sometimes, take over the advisory role and try to prevent these things from happening. But, if those projects are good for the country and if there are PPP project which have already been identified by multilateral agencies as suitable to be supported and promoted, those have to be immediately done in order to bring in a new culture, where private parties cooperate with the public sector, by putting in their capital, to improve the utilities for the common good of the people.

Having said that, I wish the Hon. Minister with so many different important institutions under him - I wonder how he manages his time to deal with all these problems - all the best! - [Interruption.] He says Allah will help. Certainly, this is the month of Ramadan and we will pray that Allah helps you to fulfil your tasks as efficiently as possible.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Next, the Hon. (Dr.) Prasanna Gunasena. You have 14 minutes.

[.. 7.00 " ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Janitha Ruwan Kodithuwakku - Deputy Minister of Ports and Civil Aviation) : : . : : world map ? : :? " " . . :? : . : : :? : . "It was about a Great Nation somewhere down, who knows international trading well, who knows the effective communication at their best, and who had a great foreign policy and professional diplomats; it was a large nation at a very strategic location." : : .

And now, here we are as a nation which has missed centuries, not decades.

Hon. Deputy Chairperson, the Ministry Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation is now the gateway to a modern Sri Lanka, connecting us to the world. We are 22nd in the list of the best-connected countries in the world and we will lead in bringing back our country to its old glory. Our ports, both seaports and airports, can play a significant role in our journey towards a new era of renaissance, achieving economic prosperity while uplifting the living standards of all Sri Lankans.

Moving on to seaports, Madam, you know that the Colombo Port ranks 25th in business volume, handling 7.5 million TEUs. However, considering its strategic location and business potential, the Colombo Port is the 13th best-connected seaport. The 13th best-connected seaport! Exploring this potential for rapid growth, we are focusing on achieving its full operational capacity with the new terminals: the West and East ContainerTerminals. The West Container Terminal would handle 2.5 million TEUs while the East Container Terminal would handle 3 million TEUs. By the end of 2026, the total handling capacity of the Colombo Port wouldl be around 14 million TEUs. So, we are increasing our capacity. Yes, we do have an issue with regard to straddle carriers for the ECT, but not with regard to all the equipment. However, we have a solution for that. We will use prime mover trucks and as the Hon. Minister mentioned, we will operate this Port with a 50 per cent efficiency. So, that is the answer to the question that was raised.

Madam, at present, we are facing a bottleneck in marketing our Port due to capacity constraints and congestion. With continuously increasing volumes, we believe that strategic marketing would raise us to have a

1491 1492

2025 07

better stake in the regional market. Having these targets in the national plan, this year we are calling for EoIs to build the West Container Terminal 2 with a total volume of 3 million TEUs. For that project, feasibility studies have been completed and money has been allocated for detailed drawings to be completed in 2025. Then, the Colombo North Port consists of three container terminals with a total volume of 10 million TEUs. So, with all these terminals together, the Colombo Port would reach a handling capacity of 30 million TEUs by the end of 2035. Now, the Port of Singapore, the second-largest port in the world, is handling 35 million TEUs. By the end of 2035, they target to handle 65 million TEUs, with 30 million more TEUs coming from the global and the regional markets. And, we would increase our capacity by 22 million TEUs. So, that is what we are targeting for. If they could achieve 30 million TEUs, why can we not target for 22 million TEUs?

For that, we have to increase the volume of the Port. Without increasing the volume of the Port, we cannot get any business done. So, to do the marketing, we need to increase the volume. We have set the target to reach that volume by 2035 and we are on the move. We humbly request you all to support, join hands and work together in this journey.

Madam, cargo operations are not enough for ships to call at the Port. We need to facilitate other auxiliary services with heavy infrastructure. Traditionally, bunkering and logistics. The transportation business does not run without fuel. At the moment, Sri Lanka has a very low storage capacity. This year, we are planning to join the CPC with the JCT Oil Bank to enhance our storage capacity and the last mile operations would be done through a joint venture between the private sector and the Ceylon Shipping Corporation.

Then, moving on to logistic centres, we will start a feasibility study this year for a multimodal logistics centre at Bloemendhal, which will be funded by the ADB. That is a cargo hub incorporated with railway transportation. Most significantly, it would be an inland dry port. As we all know, we had a congestion within the Port during the last few days. Apart from that, there are about 30 prime movers roaming around the Colombo City every day. So, how can we come out of that congestion? We have to remove those prime movers from the city traffic. For that, we are establishing this dry port.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson) .

" ( ) (The Hon. Janitha Ruwan Kodithuwakku) Hon. Leader of the House, can I have two more minutes?

( ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake) Okay.

" ( ) (The Hon. Janitha Ruwan Kodithuwakku) Not only infrastructure, but to cater to the requirement of this industry, to enter the international maritime industry and to have a better stake, we also need qualified and skilled human resources. In line with that, we will empower the Mahapola Training Centre to generate the required labour force. And also, Sri Lankan seafarers can significantly contribute to the economy of the country. The Merchant Shipping Secretariat has set their roadmap to increase seafarers up to 50,000 by 2030 with the collaboration of the private sector and State-owned institutions.

Madam, as per the NPP policy, we are bound to boom the economy and spread its benefits throughout the country. This year, we will re-evaluate the master plan for the Trincomalee Port on main sectors such as the oil terminal, the cruise terminal and the container terminal. Oil terminal facilitates the oil tanks which are being restored. With regard to the cruise terminal, as per the national tourism plan, with the increased number of tourists, we need new destinations. Thereby, we may create new destinations, building infrastructure. The container terminal will act as transshipment base for the shipping route to Indian Eastern Seaboard.

When it comes to the aviation sector, our first initiation is to amend the Act to facilitate, one, domestic aviation, for which we did not have enough regulation, two, aviation tourism including ballooning, parachuting, paragliding, para-jumping et cetera and three, agriculture drones.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson) .

" ( ) (The Hon. Janitha Ruwan Kodithuwakku) I will wind up, Madam.

These areas had a bottleneck due to lack of proper regulations and we will be able to ease up these operations without conflicting national security and the ICAO Regulations. And, we are also expecting a rapid boom in this industry.

Then, moving on to the Bandaranaike International Airport, which has a designed capacity for 6 million passengers, it handled 8.8 million passengers last year. So, we need to expedite its Terminal 2 constructions, which are expected to resume in the second half of this year. Terminal 2 will increase the Airport's volume per annum by another 9 million passengers. And also, due to our strategic location, we have around 40,000 to 50,000 aircraft passing through our airspace and we are offering all these aircraft with navigation facilities. In 2024, our revenue was Rs. 3,200 million. Considering its importance as a foreign currency generator, we have

1493 1494

allocated Rs. 3,500 million this year for a new building and the upgrading of technologies.

Finally, Madam I would like to say that we are on the right track. So, through this Budget, we would be able to lay the foundation for what we are going to build in the next few years.

Thank you very much.

Hon. Prime Minister, I would like to bring up just one more matter. I believe at a previous Parliamentary Sitting, my Colleague, the Hon. D.V.Chanaka had brought up an important matter regarding the chromium content in the water that is being supplied. He had initially mentioned - [Interruption] I understand that the Minister concerned is not here, but I want to bring it to your notice. I believe even the Minister of Fisheries had retaliated quite aggressively regarding this. It has been mentioned that hydrated lime containing 14 mg of chromium has been brought in. But, anything above 10 mg of chromium will cause liver-related diseases, CKD and so on and so forth; it creates a lot issues. So, we asked you all to test it and bring it down to 10 mg. I believe this morning, the Hon. Deputy Minister for Environment has mentioned, No, we have brought it down to 12 mg and when questioned whether it has been tested or not, he said, We will try it out and then test it". Hon. Prime Minister, I would like to sincerely make a request. There is an institution called the

1503 1504

2025 07

JRDC - Joint Research and Demonstration Centre for Water Technology - under the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, which is based in the University of Peradeniya. So, I put forward a humble request to send these samples across to the JRDC, which is a Government institution and a Government plant, get it tested and curtail it below 10 mg because anything beyond that is going to be harmful to the people.

Likewise, Hon. Leader of the House, with all due respect, I must address one statement you had made regarding former President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Earlier, you had mentioned that, after his interview with Al Jazeera, he may have suffered brain damage. Hon. Leader of the House, I must tell you again - I do have a lot of respect for you - that we should understand that, today, people have voted for me not to defend the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe at every given chance. Similarly, people have also voted for you to change the political culture and the administration in this country, not for petty insults, if I my say so. I can only imagine had you been there, they would have had to call for a stretcher or an ambulance to get you out after the first question or what is even worse is, God forbid, if the President had been there, we would have had to check his pulse, I am just saying.

( ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake) I only mentioned about the Ferrari licence.

( ) (The Hon. Jeevan Thondaman) No, no. - [Interruption.] See, the Hon. (Dr.) Kavinda Jayawardhana is getting very angry that you had insulted former President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Madam, I am just trying to say that we are all trying to work together, and given the current geopolitical climate with America going on a trade war with China, Mexico and Canada, we are going to face a risk of increased inflation and not only that, but also decreased demand, especially for our exports. I think to gear up for that, we all must come together regardless of there being one party with a majority and 13 parties in the Opposition. I would like to say that we are looking forward to work with you all and my suggestion would be to create an inter-party action committee, where we can actually come together, discuss and come to solutions concerning the Sri Lankan people.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake) : " " . : 3 22 :. 0222 :
