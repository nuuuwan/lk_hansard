QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE

SVAT VAT

SVAT VAT

EFFECTS OF TRANSITION FROM SVAT SYSTEM TO VAT

REFUND SYSTEM

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , I seek permission to raise the following Question under Standing Order 27(2):

It has come to light that effective from 01st of October, 2025, the Simplified VAT - SVAT- mechanism, which has been a vital tool in supporting exporters and deemed exporters with their cash flow requirements, is to be abolished in line with policy directives reportedly linked to the International Monetary Fund, IMF, Extended Fund Facility.

775 776

[ ]

2025 23

Under the proposed alternative, exporters are to rely on a VAT refund system with an assurance of processing within 45 days. However, there is a widespread concern and distrust among the exporter community with the Inland Revenue Departments historical delays and inefficiencies in processing refunds, some of which have taken months, if not years. Hon. Minister, you know that there are refunds outstanding from 2007, which is roughly 18 years.

The unresolved situation of the imposition of new universal tariffs by the US administration makes Sri Lankan products less competitive, creating an uncontrollable problem for the exporter. As you know, today, Japan has hit a 15 per cent tariff deal with the US; Vietnam has a tariff rate of 20 per cent, the Philippines, 19 per cent and India is looking for a rate of 15 to 18 per cent.

Given the fact that export earnings are crucial to Sri Lanka's economic recovery, foreign exchange stability and employment generation, the sudden withdrawal of the SVAT scheme without an effective and a tested refund mechanism may lead to severe cash flow constraints, possible business closures and loss of export competitiveness. Also, as you know, there are companies now shifting to Dubai, the Bahamas, Malaysia et cetera. And, I just heard that Indonesia has also hit a 19 per cent tariff deal with the US.

Sir, therefore, I respectfully request the Hon Minister to answer the following:

1. [ SVAT ? [ [ .

5. The regulations and the requirements under the regulations would be implemented to facilitate and provide refunds within the earliest possible period, subject to exporters submitting correct information and documents to the system. The compliance requirement is that correct information should be submitted.

6. Yes. As I highlighted earlier, a risk-based system is already adopted, under which the risk is categorized into three categories: high, medium and low. Exporters facing risk have been identified based on the categorization refund mechanism. Then, the refund mechanism will be implemented. The RAMIS system has already been developed to have an e-filing system. This is not possible without having e-invoicing and e-filing of VAT returns. It is being tested. Then, refunds could be paid within 45 days for low and medium-risk categories.

7. The IMF recommendations have already been tabled in Parliament. Further, it is available on the website of the Treasury as well.

8. The IRD is making arrangements to implement the system. According to the system, there would be a risk-based assumption mechanism to provide refunds within the shortest possible time period to minimize any challenges to exporters. Since that has already been discussed to be incorporated in the Act, the new proposal would be brought up as an Amendment to the Act. Thank you very much.

[2.52 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees, today is the 23rd of July. Since 1983, we, the Tamils in particular, have been commemorating this day as the Black July day. The Tamil people outside the North and the East,

845 846

particularly in Colombo, were systematically hunted down; they were hunted down by the lists in the electoral registers. The police and the military helped Government-backed thugs in hunting down Tamil families, burning them alive. The carnage and the heinous loss of life, to some extent, was reduced because of the good ordinary Sinhalese people who were trying to hide their few Tamil friends that they could afford to hide from that Government-backed, military-backed, police-backed campaign of mass murder. So, that day is today, a day that we, Tamils, commemorate without fail.

Madam, this Government that has now come into power makes it a matter of point at every possible opportunity to say that they are not racist like the past governments, especially like the Government in 1983, which did that heinous crime. They say that they do not distinguish on the basis of Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim, Christian and Burgher. Those are the famous phrases that they use.

This Governments own youth wing is organizing youths to go to Jaffna today, a day when Tamils in the North, the East and the South commemorate this Black July day, to completely change the traumatic commemoration of that event; to completely change that idea, they are sending trainloads and busloads of so-called youth to Jaffna to commemorate a day of comradery. This is not a day to commemorate comradery. If you all are actually not racist, if you all actually do not have racist intentions, this is a day where it is a duty upon especially you all - the JVP was accused by the then J.R. Jayewardene Government of being the party which actually carried out those riots - to put the record straight and actually make today officially a black day which must be commemorated by everyone, not to try and hide and obfuscate that history. But, what you all are doing is the complete opposite: you all are trying to hide that history; you all are trying to change history and you are trying to change the meaning of today completely. And, Madam, those are not the actions of a government which has intentions of putting the record straight, doing the right thing, facing up to the reality of the past and making sure that the past is not repeated. So, I condemn this Governments youth wing going to Jaffna today and trying to change the nature of the commemorations that are taking place right throughout the North, the East and even in the South by the Tamil people who are still traumatized, and still, we do not have an official apology; still, we do not have it. That is what we face today.

Madam, today, we are debating Amendments to the Companies Act. I was listening to many speakers. Amendments to the Companies Act are being brought in to ensure prevention of money laundering, prevention of black money and with all of those intentions. I think 20 odd Sections of the Act are being amended and those are things that we welcome. But, I noticed everybody else except the Minister repeatedly concentrating on the notion of preventing terrorism financing and how important these Amendments are towards that.

I mentioned how, in 1983, innocent civilians were massacred. No justice, nothing whatsoever! This Government also refuses to bring those who were responsible for those heinous crimes before court and convict them. Then, what do you expect the people who have been victims of such heinous crimes to do? What did the JVP do? When the JVP, as youth, felt that the State is working against their interests, that it is a cabal who controls the State and acting for the interest of a very few elites and felt that the country must be brought back to the people, what did they do? Ultimately, they decided that they need to take up arms. I will never call that terrorism because those are legitimate reasons that have to be addressed. But, you all are doing the complete opposite! You yourselves say that all the previous governments, for the last 70 odd years, were racist. Then, if you say that, that means there are aggrieved people amongst the Tamil people. Then, when they are so bitter, if they are forced to take up arms like what happened in 1983 because they feel that that is the only way they can have some sort of security, you, of all people, calling that terrorism and refusing to look at the whole conflict in its proper context to find answers, are not going to find solutions. No, you all are pandering to the same past.

Last week, people from Valikamam North, particularly from a village called Myliddy, came down to Colombo and protested in front of the Presidential Secretariat and some of them went inside and met with, I think, one of the Secretaries or the Private Secretary to the President. They were protesting, Madam, because in 2013, 6,317 acres were gazetted under the Land Acquisition Act for military purposes, for High Security Zones. Then, eventually, because of international pressure and protests of the Tamil people, almost 3,000 acres were released and now, there are 3,000 acres that are still not released. The Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Land and Irrigation, we have found out, is thinking in terms of gazetting those remaining 3,000 acres as a High Security Zone permanently, refusing to allow them to be released. That is against your own policy; that is against the promises you gave! Today, out of these 3,000 acres, Madam, almost 75 per cent is not used for military purposes; it is used for farming by the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, for you all to bring vegetables to the local market and undercut the local farmer. Surely, is it not something that your Government should be against? You should be on the side of the ordinary people. Over 75 per cent of the lands are used for non-military purposes, Madam.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees) , . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) I am finishing up, Madam.

Six temples and churches within those 3,000 acres, within this so-called High Security Zone have disappeared. They were there in 2009. People, the

villagers, used to get special permission, go to those temples and pray there. Those six temples and churches have disappeared today! That was not a war zone; there was no heavy fighting inside those High Security Zones. So, how did they disappear? That is a UNESCO crime! So, these are things that you have to look into. If you do not look into this, Hon. Minister, the Companies Act being amended to prevent so-called terrorism is all rubbish. Nothing you do would ever prevent people from resisting this sort of absolutely unacceptable conduct by the State. So, I appeal to you, Hon. Minister, as a JVPer, not as an NPPer, who knows why you took up arms to find solutions to the core issues, to look into these matters and also tell you that if you do not do that, no amount of legislations - you had legislations for the last 30 years which did not prevent anybody from taking up arms - could actually prevent conflict.
