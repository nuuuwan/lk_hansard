BUDGETARY RELIEF ALLOWANCE OF WORKERS (AMENDMENT) BILLS: DETERMINATIONS OF THE SUPREME

COURT

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) I wish to announce that the Hon. Speaker has received the Determinations of the Supreme Court on the Bill titled Budgetary Relief Allowance of Workers (Amendment), (L.D.-O 19/2025) and the Bill titled Budgetary Relief Allowance of Workers (Amendment), (L.D.-O 20/2025), which had been challenged in the Supreme Court under Article 121(1) of the Constitution.

The Supreme Court has held that the provisions of the Bills are inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution and can only be passed with the special majority required under paragraph (2) of Article 84.

Further, the inconsistency will cease if the National Minimum Wage of Workers (Amendment) Bill is first passed by a simple majority and certified into law and subsequently, these two Bills are passed by a simple majority and certified into laws.

I order that the two full Determinations of the Supreme Court be printed in the Official Report of today's Proceedings.

COMPANIES (AMENDMENT) BILL: DETERMINATION OF THE

SUPREME COURT

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) I wish to announce to Parliament that the Hon. Speaker has received the Decision of the Supreme Court in respect of the Bill titled Companies (Amendment), which had been challenged in the Supreme Court in terms of Article 121(1) of the Constitution.

The Supreme Court has communicated that since the Petitioners in S.C. (SD) 19/2025 and S.C. (SD) 20/2025 had opted to withdraw the petitions as they are satisfied with the proposed Committee Stage Amendments, the Court had not made a Determination on the constitutionality of the Bill.

I order that the Decision of the Supreme Court be printed in the Official Report of todays Proceedings.

SRI LANKA ELECTRICITY (AMENDMENT) BILL:

DETERMINATION OF THE SUPREME COURT

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) I wish to announce to Parliament that the Hon. Speaker has received the Determination of the Supreme Court in respect of the Bill titled Sri Lanka Electricity (Amendment), which was challenged in the Supreme Court in terms of Article 121(1) of the Constitution.

In the said Determination, the Supreme Court has summarized the Constitutionality of the Bill as follows:

- Clause 8(2) shall be amended suitably to provide that the members of the Committee referred to therein shall be liable under the Anti-Corruption Act, No. 9 of 2023.

- Clause 13(1)(c) is violative of Article 3 of the Constitution and requires to be passed by the special majority of Parliament and be approved by

2977 2978

the people at a Referendum. However, the said violation shall cease, if this Clause is amended as set out in the Summary of the Determination of the Supreme Court.

- Clause 13(1)(b) is vague and arbitrary as it does not contain any provisions relating to the transfer of employees and their rights as employees during the second stage of unbundling. Therefore, this Clause is violative of Article 12(1) read with Article 14(1)(g) of the Constitution, and this Clause shall only be passed by the special majority required under Article 84(2). The said violation shall however cease, if this Clause is amended as set out in the Summary of the Determination of the Supreme Court.

- Clause 13(2) is in violation of Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution. The said violation shall however cease, if this Clause is amended as set out in the Summary of the Determination of the Supreme Court.

I order that the full Determination of the Supreme Court be printed in the Official Report of todays Proceedings of the House.

Deputy Speaker, may I intervene with regard to some reports and the Statement presented by the Hon. Prime Minister to Parliament today, which relate to the Central Bank. I am sure that the Hon. Prime Minister would have seen that last week, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Mr. Powell, was before the Senate and the House of Representatives and there was a sense of independence. All I would like to point out is that even though there are eleven independent institutions in this country, the Central Bank does not come within that purview. I would greatly appreciate if your Government would look into that matter and take it into consideration. Sir, I will not take any more time; I only wanted to pose that matter.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Okay, Hon. Member, I think your point has been taken.

( ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake) Sir, it is not a point of Order. But, I think in the course of the Debate, the Deputy Minister of Economic Development and the relevant Ministers would address the issue.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Okay. Hon. Member, the issue would be addressed in the course of the Debate of the day.

Now, the Fiscal Strategy Statement for the year 2026 in terms of Section 11(3) of the Public Finance Management Act, No. 44 of 2024 to be announced by the Hon. (Dr) Anil Jayantha, Minister of Labour and Deputy Minister of Economic Development on behalf of the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, what is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order under Standing Order No. 26 (3).

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, what is your point Order?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, the Public Financial Management Act is in vogue at the present time. Section 11 of the Act very clearly stipulates that the Fiscal Strategy Statement must come up with certain minimum parameters. Section 11(4)(a) states, I quote:

provide the Parliament and the public with a formal statement of the Governments fiscal strategy.

In the process, it is required to give the following, Sir. Section 11(5)(b) states, I quote:

include proposed timeframe for the reduction of public debt to sustainable level;

Then, Section 11(5)(c) states, I quote:

explain how the Governments fiscal targets and polices are consistent with the objectives of responsible fiscal management;

Section 11(5)(e) (iii) states, I quote:

an assessment of expected compliance with the fiscal targets for the next financial year and the four succeeding years;

The next one is, Section 11(5)(g), which states, I quote:

disclose the macroeconomic impact of fiscal decisions taken over the past three years.

Only half of that information is in front of us, Sir. This is the first time the Public Financial Management Act is coming into play. The most important thing is the public debt fiscal reduction and I do not see that given in this Statement, Sir. The Fiscal Strategy Statement is there. The Act gives that there are minimum requirements that you need to comply with and that compliance is not to be seen.

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Anil Jayantha) Thank you very much, Hon. Ravi Karunanayake. All the required provisions are given in the Public Financial Management Act, No. 44 of 2024. But, this is basically the Fiscal Strategy Statement. The indicators with regard to debt sustainability and how best we are going to achieve those are in our Annual Borrowing Plan. There are other requirements as well and those would come later. But, as far as this particular Statement is concerned, we have clearly mentioned that we are reaching that particular target of 95 per cent of the GDP by 2032. Even in the Debt Sustainability Analysis - DSA - there is a possibility that that level could be further brought down to somewhere around 90 per cent. These details would be dealt with accordingly then and there in different statements.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, - ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Shall we proceed with the Debate? - [Interruption.] Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, you are listed to speak later on and you have 15 minutes to speak on this. You can bring this matter up then. - [Interruption]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It is the main point of debating this Statement under this Act. So, there is no point in discussing it without your four-year target, which is a specific requirement under this Act. That is what is expected by this Act.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Anyway, we listened to the Hon. Minister.

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Anil Jayantha) The medium term plan is for four years and how best we are planning to achieve those targets is stipulated here. So, our plan is to achieve those revenue targets subject to risk assessment. Identification of risk variables and how best we are going to mitigate them, all those things are stated in this Fiscal Strategy Statement.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Minister, it is not there. That is the reason why I raised it.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, could you please stick to the topic of the Debate?

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramanathan Archchuna) I am sorry, Sir. The only thing is, these matters have to be stated in Parliament because we would not get any other chance to speak on this. Therefore, I should definitely mention this. You are only constraining me, not others. Sir, you have never said to anyone -

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) I have stated it previously. Had you been in the House, you would remember that. Anyway, as much as possible, you confine yourself to the topic of the Debate.

) ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramanathan Archchuna) Sure, Sir. But, this is very important and it is a matter of concern for the Tamil people. So, let me speak. . skeleton 6 ; schoolbag skeleton . 6 . . skeletons 33 . inquiry - . . . . rape rape - . skeletons 33 .

"Fiscal Strategy Statement" . . ? ? . Without a clear fiscal strategy, a nation cannot move

forward. . . . ? ?

. . . . . . . . . . . . - strategy - . . . .

. . .

with due respect to all my Colleagues, I want to say that we all are products of the education which we got free. Our learned Colleague, the Hon. Minister Sunil Handunnetti, recently participated in the World Economic Forum. I do not want to go into the contents of his contribution, but, in fact, the way he handled the whole thing, I think, was a disaster. So, what it shows is that we have got into, as we call in technical terms, a weak state. We do not have a statement issued on behalf of our nation which can impress the world. That is where we face the biggest issue. In terms of creating wealth, we need to attract foreign investments. What is the message that we get across to the world? Why should investors come to Sri Lanka now? Is it because we have put some ex-Ministers and some politicians in jail? Will that attract investors? ?
