asked the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development:

(a) Will he inform this House the -

(i) amount of profit made/loss incurred by SriLankan Airlines from 2015 to date, separately according to each year;

(ii) reasons for the profit made/loss incurred by the SriLankan Airlines during the above-mentioned period; and

(iii) steps that will be taken to maintain SriLankan Airlines in a state of not incurring losses?

(b) If not, why?

() ( ) ( () - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harshana Suriyapperuma - Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning) Sir, on behalf of the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, I give the following Answer:

(a) (i) Amount of net profit/loss incurred by Sri

Lankan Airlines from 2015

Year Rs. Mn.

2014/2015 (16,494.66)

2015/2016 (12,621.69) 2016/2017 (28,929.99) 2017/2018 (17,213.57)

(ii) In the years 2014 and 2015, in addition to

the mismanagement and politicization of the institution, there was a hike in global fuel prices. ( ) (The Hon. Chaminda Wijesiri) ,-

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harshana Suriyapperuma) In addition to the previously mentioned reasons, in 2015/2016, the temporary closure of the Bandaranaike International Airport affected the profitability of the institution. Then, in 2016/2017, the institution had to pay compensation for cancellation of Aircraft Lease Agreements. In 2018/2019, there was an unexpected high interest cost, which the entity had to absorb. In addition to the previously mentioned reasons, in 2019/2020 - these are compounded and have been coming down year after year - due to the Easter attack and international travelling getting affected due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the situation further worsened and caused a lesser number of tourist arrivals.

In 2020/2021, due to the continuation of the previous reasons as well as the international travelling ban due to COVID-19 restrictions, a loss was incurred. In 2021/2022, there was a loss of Rs. 166 billion due to the compounding effect of the previously mentioned reasons such as mismanagement, politicization, hike of fuel costs and also the continued challenges due to the COVID-19 outbreak, resulting in reduced travels. In 2022/2023, in addition to the continuation of the compounding effect of previous reasons, the depreciation of our currency, the exchange rate crisis and the economic turmoil affected the profitability of the institution. Then in 2023/2024, there was an extraordinary exchange gain; as a result of the gradual recovery of the economy, the entity had recorded an exchange gain, resulting in a profit of Rs. 3.8 billion.

(iii) A comprehensive Business Plan approved

by the Board of Directors will be submitted to the EGM for consideration and approval of the shareholders, and based on that, future courses of action will be decided.

(b) Does not arise.

Sir, I also table* the detailed Answer for the Question.

Even though the cost recovery tariff is being implemented since 2022 and the balance sheet was restructured through the transfer of CEB debt to the Government Balance Sheet with the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers, the General Treasury made an equity investment of Rs. 126.3 billion in 2023 as a cross settlement mechanism to settle the long outstanding payable to CPC and Independent Power Producers (IPPs) to further strengthen the balance sheet of CEB. As a result, the debt outstanding to CPC and IPPs stood as Rs. 78.4 billion at the end of 2023, a decline from Rs. 191.8 billion at the end of 2022.

If you take the economic side, the poor man cannot have access to microfinance and he is not entitled to relief, but when it comes to large entities, they get millions out of their loans wiped out. Loan sharks are profiting through poor masses. Therefore, steps must be taken to eradicate loan sharks and to provide the common man with loans at concessionary rates so that he could carry on with his life.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees) .. . 12 .

[3.45 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees, when we are discussing this Clean Sri Lanka programme of the Government, I must say that I went on to the website and tried to familiarize myself with the programme and I found that it was divided into three main sections: social, environmental and ethical. When I read the social and environmental sections, I found out that those sections predominantly looked at apolitical issues, that they are primarily to do with environment and also cleanliness in a very physical sense and I think it was only the section under "ethical" which had a slightly more wider perspective.

The section "ethical" particularly stated, "....aims to build trust in the systems by ensuring integrity..." It was a brief section which described it. I wish the Government had a far more comprehensive programme put up on the website. At least that sentence seemed a little bit wider, reflecting the mandate that the Government got at the last

961 962

Parliamentary and Presidential Elections because the mandate was a complete overhaul, not only with regard to corruption, cleanliness in that sense, but also with regard to the entire political culture that had plagued this country for the last 75 years. So, in that sense, Madam, I wish to bring to the notice of the Government - I am glad that the Hon. Minister of Public Security and Parliamentary Affairs and my good Friend, the Hon. Minister of Justice and National Integration are here because I wish to bring to the notice of this Government about their own comments over the last few days - that the expectations are very high and I say this in a good sense. I do not much agree with the main party, the JVP element, of the National People's Power because of their past positions with regard to the Tamil national question. I think the JVP has still not made their position clear with regard to the ethnic problem or, at the very least, if they have, it falls far short of what the Tamil people expect. But, the view of the National People's Power is slightly wider, not slightly wider, but considerably wider and I know personally of Members within the Government who have very progressive views on many issues. So, therefore, when we talk in terms of being ethical, I think it is important that there must be a clear picture. Why do you use the term "ethical"? Obviously, it means that the last 75 years was not ethical. That is why the people wanted a complete overhaul and why you had been voted in. So, when you use the term "ethical", an important part of it is that you must be consistent in what you say today, what you say tomorrow and with regard to the meaning and connotations of your own actions. I think that is very important.

If you take, for example, one of the biggest issues that the Tamil people face, it is this godforsaken Prevention of Terrorism Act. It is a law that the JVP itself, whom I might not agree with on several policy issues, condemns because they were a victim of it and what was said at the time of elections and before was that the PTA would be repealed. I quite understand that to repeal a law or to come up with a new law, you need some time, if, in case, you need one. I do not believe that you do, but if, in case, the Government thinks that they need one, you might take some time. The nature of the PTA was so draconian, Madam, that in 2015, when the then Government made commitments to the United Nations Human Rights Council that they would have a moratorium on the implementation and the functionality of the PTA, the current President Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake was seated in Opposition and did not object because he himself knows the draconian nature of the PTA. But, after the elections were over, this Government has backtracked very quickly within the first week and stated that they will have to monitor the implementation of the Act because as long as the implementation and the application of the Act is monitored and looked at carefully, then no faults would be done. But, faults have been done. During the memorialization of the Tamils, there were arrests under the PTA. Subsequently, maybe because of certain policy decisions taken, the police went before courts and then withdrew the PTA charges in the B reports. But, the point here, Madam, is that the law is so draconian and you say it is draconian because it is so wide in its possible

applicability and that the police will misuse it; they will always misuse it. That has been the history of this terrible law. And, even if your Government wishes to be otherwise, the law is applied by the police and they continue to misuse it and that is my point. So, you cannot have a policy saying that you want to be ethical and then backtrack from your previous position. Actually, that empowers a police which wants to be in transition. That is the point I am trying to make. The PTA is now being applied to teachers in schools! Yesterday, the TID had gone and questioned the teachers in Konavil Maha Vidyalayam in Kilinochchi. The TID in Paranthan had gone and questioned them because at a function, at a sports meet, there were certain artistic interpretations that the teachers had done and they have been questioned by the TID under the PTA. So, surely, there must be something done for this.

I am told now that the Hon. Minister for Public Security and Parliamentary Affairs has said that memorialization in the North and the East will be observed and scrutinized very carefully. Why? His justification for it is because certain people in the South have said that that memorialization is terrorism or is amounting to terrorism. Surely, just because someone in the South says it is terrorism, you cannot have a different form of application for the North and the East! That in itself shows that it is unethical. Just because people shout, you cannot suddenly change your application of the PTA and the way in which you look at memorialization only in the North and East. There is something wrong and that is because you must be very clear. You only have one year. If you want to make those radical changes that you got a mandate for, you have that one year to make those radical changes because after that, if in case you falter, you would not be able to do anything. So, if you are going to change the culture, I expect you to change it immediately. The more you drag it out, the more you cave into pressure - that is what the Minister of Public Security means and if people in the South are complaining and that you are going to look at memorialization differently in the North and East, you are caving into pressure - that will mount more and more and you all will take the same path as the previous governments did.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees) , .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Please give me more time, Madam.

I will conclude by just saying this. The Hon. Prime Minister is now the Hon. Minister of Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education. When she was seated in the Opposition - actually she sat just behind me - she raised an issue with regard to the Jaffna Central College. In the Jaffna Central College, there was a new lady principal who was appointed and she was fully qualified. She was from the Sri Lanka Principals Service. But, because of political interference by Douglas

963 964

[ .. ]

2025 22

Devananda, her appointment had been suspended and the acting Principal there now is someone who is totally unqualified. The Prime Minister stood up in the House at that time and said that such political interference must stop. Well, she is now the Minister of Education and I urge the Prime Minister - it is over 100 days since she has come into power and she is now one of the most powerful people in this Government, in the country - that this is one thing she can do. Look at this sort of things. That is an uncontroversial issue and she must interfere.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees) , .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) One last thing, Madam, with regard to solar power. For over three or four months, solar meters are not being issued by the CEB. There are people who have spent millions of rupees on solar power; because of the increasing rise in the prices of electricity, they have invested in millions. But, because the CEB is not issuing solar meters, they are at a complete loss. They have spent money, but they are not able to get the benefit of that investment. At least now, the Government must look into that. These are uncontroversial issues.

Also, look at the issues of the PTA, memorialization and the political prisoners. My good Friend, the Hon. Minister of Justice has said that there are no political prisoners. The JVP identifies their former prisoners as political prisoners. The President at speeches in Jaffna had said political prisoners will have to be released and since he is committed to that position, he must look into that. Thank you.

Hon. Ponnambalam, you raised a very valid point about the PTA. I thank you for that. I think also on a last occasion when it was raised, I assured you that a Cabinet Paper will be put forward for the formulation of a committee to look into the abolition of the PTA. Now, that Cabinet Paper is being prepared. Hopefully, in the next Parliamentary Sitting, I will be able to confirm to you that Cabinet approval has been given for the abolition of the PTA and to bring in the ATA, which concerns international standards. That is what I wanted to clarify and we will hold onto that pledge.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairperson of Committees) . 12 .
