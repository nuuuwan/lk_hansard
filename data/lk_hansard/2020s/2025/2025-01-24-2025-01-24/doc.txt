[11.20 a.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) Hon. Deputy Speaker, today, I would like to express my condolences to the families of all four Hon. Members who had passed away.

The late Hon. Rukman Senanayake, who was 76 years old when he passed away, was the grandson of the first Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, the late Hon. D.S. Senanayake. Though he was born to a powerful political family, he cut his own teeth in politics. At that time, he was a rebel in politics and was also a strong, dedicated member of the United National Party, the UNP. He also served the people diligently during his period as a politician.

Sir, the late Hon. Rukman Senanayake was from my District. He last contested from my District, Kegalle. He was elected twice as a Member of Parliament from the Kegalle District. In 1970s, at a by-election, he was first elected to Parliament. I remember - I was a young school boy at that time - that my father worked for that election and there was a lot of violence at that election. I can remember that my fathers car was damaged badly at that election. But, the Hon.Rukman Senanayake, despite all the odds and with all the violence, emerged victorious and was elected to Parliament. Again in 2001, the Hon. Rukman Senanayake was elected from the Kegalle District and was our district leader. He gave leadership to

the Kegalle District for the United National Party. He was a very good leader and worked with everybody together. He was actually instrumental in bringing the open zoo concept into the Kegalle District.

Actually, he was too much of a gentleman to be in politics; he was a real gentleman. I can remember that he was the district leader at the General Election in 2004. He won that election, but was not number one. I came first in the district and he refused to take up the district leader position saying that I was number one. But, I, too, refused to take it saying he was the most senior. It is very rarely that people give up positions in politics, but the Hon. Rukman Senanayake stood on principles. There are very few people like that. Actually, I remember that incident up to today.

Sir, I was fortunate to attend his funeral and to condole with his family and relatives. We, not only in Kegalle but all over the Island, respect him. At this time, I would like to convey my condolences to the Hon. Ruwan Wijewardene and Hon. Vasantha Senanayake, the extended members of his family. May he rest in peace!

I would also like to say a few words about the late Hon. Sirinal de Mel. At the time when the late Hon. J.R. Jayewardene was the leader of the United National Party and President of Sri Lanka, people classified the United National Party as a capitalist party. It was the Hon. J.R. Jayewardene who started the unions, the Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya and the Lanka Jathika Wathu Kamkaru Sangamaya, under the UNP and gave representation to the working class within the UNP. He believed that the UNP could represent all the classes in this country. And, the late Hon.Sirinal de Mel was appointed as the head of the Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya. He, the Hon. Sirinal de Mel, was a legend. For years, he led the JSS successfully. Today, Mr. Gayan de Mel is here in the Speaker's Gallery. I would like to convey my condolences to him and the family. I would like to remind the yeoman service the late Hon. Sirinal de Mel rendered to the JSS and to the UNP. May he rest in peace!

Then, I would like to speak about the late Hon. A. A. Reginald Perera, whom I did not know very closely, but I was in Parliament when he was here; he was a senior Parliamentarian. What I know is that in the Gampaha District, he was loved by the people, a politician that people loved. At this time, I console with the family and extend my condolences to them.

Finally, Sir, I would like to speak about the late Hon. (Dr.) I. M. Ilyas, who entered Parliament in 1994, the same time I first entered Parliament. And, I remember, we were backbenchers; we sat on the back benches. He represented Jaffna and raised a lot of issues in Parliament. During the period he was in Parliament, he did his job very diligently. I believe he served the people who were displaced from Jaffna at that time immensely. I extend my condolences to his family, too and may he attain Jannatul Firdaus!

Thank you.

1976 29 . :

". . .

. . . Ceylon Daily News" , Rukmans statement on his expulsion . . , . Here, I have the full text of Mr. Senanayakes statement. . . This was published in the "Ceylon Daily News" of 03rd May, 1976. , I quote:

The general secretary of the United National Party informed me by letter dated 24th April, 1976, that I had been expelled from the membership of the UNP for the following reasons:-..."

reason one .

.. I am accused of having attempted to sabotage the Ja-Ela by-election campaign by issuing a press statement regarding the Ward Place incident. At the very outset, I must point out that my statement did not blame any individual or the party for this unfortunate incident. My constituents from the Dedigama electorate were brutally assaulted when they came to visit Mr. J.R. Jayewardene, to speak on my behalf. My statement condemned this disgusting act

. . :

Secondly, my conduct in connection with the Colombo South by-election was considered as an additional reason for my expulsion. The committee of inquiry which inquired into my conduct in relation to the Colombo South by-election, stated in no uncertain terms that I did not at any time work against Mr. J.R. Jayewardene. I was found fault for allegedly evading my responsibilities by not working for Mr. Jayewardene at the Colombo South by-election. The evidence given by Mr. Ananda Tissa de Alwis at the committee of inquiry clearly indicates that even he, who was at that time the general secretary of the UNP had adopted the same attitude as me, not to evade ones responsibilities, but to prevent Mr. J.R. Jayewardenes election being challenged in a court of law. Motivated by a desire to bring about unity in the party, Mr. de Alwis and I did our very best to prevent Mr. Suriyapperuma from contesting Mr. J.R. Jayawardene."

. . . ..

"Thirdly, I am accused of handing an affidavit and a letter to the Minister of Finance. When this accusation first appeared in the journal of 21st February, 1976, I wrote to Mr. J.R. Jayewardene on 2nd March, 1976, denying the charge. When written explanation was requested from me I wrote to him on 6th March, 1976.. .

Then, Sir, very interestingly, he says what the reason is. I further quote:

Problems between Mr. J.R. Jayewardene and myself arose not because of the Colombo South by-election as publicised, but because of the Kalawewa by-election."

There were other accusations that were made against him, Sir.

"... Mr. J.R. Jayewardene, proposed that if Mr. Anura Bandaranaike received SLFP nomination, the UNP should send him uncontested. I opposed this proposal and maintained that we should contest the seat irrespective of whether Mr. Anura Bandaranaike was to be the SLFP nominee or not. Mr. Gamini Jayasuriya, Mr. Niyathapala, Mr. Suriyapperuma, Mr. Karunasena Kodituwakku and myself are five persons who took the initiative to oppose this proposal. Mr. Niyathapala, Mr. Suriyapperuma and myself are already expelled from the party. Mr. Gamini Jayasuriya was a joint secretary of the party at that time and Mr. Krunasena Kodituwakku was the general secretary of the youth league. Neither of them hold those positions any more. What we have witnessed is a slow process of elimination executed in a very crafty manner.

And he ends by saying,

Insinuations are being made that I am working with the Government. Let it be known that I have no intention of joining the Government or any other political party. It is my intention to place the facts before the people and build up a force to halt the dictatorial trend in the UNP. What I intend creating may with the passage of time erupt into a political force, depending upon the wishes of the people and I leave it to the people to decide.

So, finally, what happened obviously was that Parliamentary Elections of 1977 came up and J.R. Jayewardene won with a landslide five-sixth majority. The Hon. Rukman Senanayake did not contest, but subsequently came to Parliament in 1994 and I am not going to repeat that recent history.

The point I am going to make is how the Hon. Rukman Senanayake stood up and fought for what he thought was the right thing to do at that time and he fought against the dictatorial leadership of the late Hon. J. R. Jayewardene at that time. And, the late Hon. J. R. Jayewardene, being the cunning fox he was, as everybody referred to him "Yankee Dickey", found a way to take care of his political opponents by creating a smoke and mirrors situation and accusing them of various things. I think the lesson here for all of us is that politics is a very difficult profession to be in. You all are new and you will also learn fairly quickly. It is tough to stand up for what you really believe in. I think what people admired about the Hon. Rukman Senanayake was the fact that he always stood his ground. He said, "whether I win, lose or whether I would not even contest, I am going to stick to what I think are the right things to do".

Once again, Sir, I want to express my condolences to his family. I know two great grandchildren of the D.S. Senanayake family, Vasantha and Ruwan, and both are my dear friends. I myself have business in Dedigama and they both are aware of it. I wish both my friends well in their political careers.

Thank you, Sir, for the time given. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Next, the Hon. K. Kader Masthan.
