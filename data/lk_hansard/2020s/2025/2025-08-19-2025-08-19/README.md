PUBLIC FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Hon. Speaker, as pro tem Chairman of the Committee on Public Finance, I present the Report of the Committee on Public Finance on the -

(i) Gambling Regulatory Authority Bill;

(ii) Resolution under Section 10 of the Customs Ordinance (Chapter 235) relating to Import Duties

(Published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 2434/02

dated 28th April, 2025);

(iii) Order under Section 3 of the Excise (Special Provisions) Act, No. 13 of 1989, as amended, relating to Excise Duty

(Published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 2434/04

dated 28th April, 2025); and

(iv) Regulation under Section 19 read with Section 51 of the Finance Act, No. 35 of 2018 relating to Luxury Tax on Motor Vehicles

(Published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 2434/05

dated 28th April, 2025),

which were referred to the said Committee. . . Ordered to lie upon the Table.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) Sir, may I briefly read out one or two contentious portions of the Repor on the Gambling Regulatory Authority Bill. Point No. 5 in page 11 states, I quote:

5. During the discussion held on 12th August 2025, regarding the GRA Bill, the Committee observed that there is a significant need to design practical mechanisms to allow the legal movement of foreign exchange for the purpose of gambling and repatriation of winnings in foreign exchange while ensuring compliance with the existing exchange control laws. The Committee emphasized that these issues require careful consideration and potential regulatory or legal reforms to facilitate lawful and efficient handling of gambling proceeds.

Further, there is also this comment, I quote:

"Some Committee members noted that, in its present form, the GRA Bill is not strong enough to meet expectations and requires significant revision, international benchmarking, and a more comprehensive regulatory framework to ensure transparency, accountability, and robust enforcement."

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, it is at the right time that you came to the Chair. All I want to know is - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, you can clarify your issue. Take just 15 seconds.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. I wish you a long stay in that Chair, Sir.

Sir, what I want to raise with the Deputy Minister of Economic Development is this. Printing of money goes on every day and whether it is asset-backed printing is all that is asked. When you say there is no printing of money by the Government, then, there is something wrong, there is a contraction.

Sir, the next one is, the Hon. Deputy Minister mentioned that the Central Bank Chief or his envoy would be represented in this Gambling Regulatory Authority. Remember, this House had made the Central Bank an independent institution. He goes for textile negotiations; he goes to Singapore for investment promotion. How can that independent institution suddenly become non-independent? You cannot basically get him to be in a position when he is completely independent. He is the only one who can buy cars when the rest of the country cannot buy cars. What is this? This Parliament becomes a joke on that basis.

Sir, what I am trying to drive at is something which is good for the country. This is not the Opposition taking on the Government. Let us act together as a country and ensure that we correct the anomalies that are there.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Okay. I think the Deputy Minister has got your point. Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, I see that you have not got a slot in today's Debate.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, today, the Hon. Gayantha Karunathilleka has given time - But, Sir, we have saved one hour for you today and that is the reason why we also graduated you to the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) I think you could still take a little time from the Opposition's allocation and join this Debate because you have a long submission to make, I feel

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, with your magnanimity, if you could get the Deputy Minister to answer my question because the entire Public Financial Management Act basically stems - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Shall we move on to next Hon. Member from the Opposition due to speak?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The Hon. Deputy Minister can anwer. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) That is left to the Hon. Deputy Minister.

The next Speaker is Hon. Kabir Hashim. You could air the views of the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake.

[1.00 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha, PC) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I am thankful for the opportunity to speak on the proposed Gambling Regulatory Authority Bill.

Sir, various quarters in this House has accorded sentiments, but one has to realize that casino and gambling have already been legitimized and that what needs to be debated before this House is whether the present Gambling Regulatory Authority Bill has oversight, accountability and focuses on responsible governance.

Sir, the global casino market was valued to be US Dollars 287 billion in 2022 and is predicted to reach US Dollars 477 billion by 2031. Gambling and casinos are considered a necessary evil, but unless we are geared, we will lose out in international tourism. My faith is, gambling should be prohibited, but, unfortunately, it is a necessary evil today, if we want to entice tourism in this country. So, we are looking at not promoting gambling among us, but with regard to enticing foreign nationals to come here and bring us valuable foreign exchange, which we need.

Sir, if we speak about gambling, in pre-colonial times also there were various forms of gambling like "cheetu", cock-fighting et cetera. I would not delve in to that; I think the Hon. (Dr.) (Ms.) Kaushalya dealt with it quiet extensively. The first regulatory framework was brought during colonial times, the Gaming Ordinance, No. 17 of 1889. That criminalized unlawful gambling and common place gambling. Further, horse racing is also a form of gambling, which was regulated under Betting on Horse-Racing Ordinance.

During post-Independence era, Sri Lanka took a different stand. Gambling was not encouraged; it was somewhat prohibited. However, the State, through various lotteries like the Hospital Lottery in the 1950s and the National Lotteries Board, encouraged gambling. A sweep is a form of gambling. So, on the one hand, the State said, "Do not gamble" and on the other, it realized that it is necessary and used the revenue from gambling for development. The open economy in 1977 saw the emergence of the casino industry. It was an illegal industry, but the governments turned a blind eye to that. Then, they brought in the Betting and Gaming Levy Act, No. 40 of 1988. On the one side, the Government said gaming and casino are illegal, but it was used as a revenue-generating exercise. So, the Government, while saying it was an illegal act, taxed gaming, thereby giving it tacit acceptance. The Government did not have the courage to say that it is legitimate and said it was illegal, maybe, because of politics or other social norms, but thought fit to collect revenue through taxes.

For the first time, casinos and gaming were legitimized by the Casino Businesses (Regulation) Act, No. 17 of 2010, thereby introducing a licensing mechanism for casinos in this country. So, legitimacy was brought in only in 2010. In 2013/2014, Australian billionaire James Packer wanted to invest in a casino in Sri Lanka. There was a massive social outcry. His investment was US Dollars 350-400 million. Other than the social factors, there was an economic factor, which was detrimental to the nation because his profits were not to be taxed for ten years. Therefore, according to some estimation, for the period of ten years, there would have

1937 1938

been a revenue loss of approximately US Dollars 1 billion for the country. In 2015, the then Government cancelled all the permits and all the concessions given and with that, Mr. Packer left. And, that was the end of their project.

At present, casino operators are not given any form of concession in terms of taxes and levies. In addition to the local operators, there is a foreign operator who has invested US Dollars 125 million and that, too, is subjected to the same taxation and levies. So, there is a level playing field and through taxation, the State is able to obtain the much needed revenue. However, when we look at the 2010 Act, there were various issues and grievances. They said that there is no proper mechanism to monitor money laundering, and gaming was somewhat unregulated because of the loopholes in the law.

Sir, I would say that the Gambling Regulatory Authority Act is a step in the right direction, but there are certain shortcomings and loopholes which, I believe, this Government needs to address. The 2010 Act gave the Minister of Finance absolute discretion to grant or refuse a licence. Therefore, in terms of the 2010 Act, without political patronage, you cannot get a licence. The present Bill creates a Gambling Regulatory Authority and if there is refusal by the Authority, you could appeal to the Secretary and from the Secretary, you could appeal to the Court of Appeal. So, there is a transparent mechanism, if a licence is refused or suspended.

The present Bill replaces certain old enactments that were in existence. In addition to the land-based casino industry, there is a global online casino industry, which is valued at US Dollars 110 billion. Anybody who has a smartphone can access online gaming. So, I appeal to the Government to bring in more stringent laws and regulations. Casinos do not attract the common man; it affects the common man less. However, online gaming could be an addiction. Therefore, I appeal to this Government to look at bringing in very stringent laws and regulations to monitor online gaming. Further, the physical casino industry creates jobs and entice tourism, but if we have online gaming, its revenue will go out of the country and there would be no net benefit to the country.

Sir, talking about autonomy, I would like to bring your attention to Clause 77(1) of the Bill. Whilst the Authority has certain autonomy in terms of the Bill, Clause 77(1) gives the Minister the authority to give directions, which the Authority is obliged to follow. That could be considered as an infringement on the autonomy of the Authority. So, therefore, I would like the Government to address this Clause because unlike a statutory authority, when you have a regulatory authority, the Minister giving dictates could affect its independence. However, I would like to reiterate that the present Bill is more progressive than the 2010 Act because it has more transparency.

In addition, Sri Lanka encourages casinos in this country only for the purpose of enticing foreigners to come and gamble here. Therefore, I would urge the

Government to consider having a representative from the tourism sector represented in the Authority, thereby issues in relation to tourism could be further addressed.

Also, Sir, I believe there is ambiguity in this Bill with regard to certain provisions. Clause 22 refers to a main cash desk. Today, we are in a digital age. A main cash desk should not be interpreted as a physical main cash desk, but should include other generally accepted forms of payment like electronic transactions, which would connect to one centralized system. So, the definition of main cash desk should mean one centralized system.

The term currency in Clause 22, I believe, should be read with Clause 59 to include electronic fund transfers because if you give a very restrictive meaning, especially in this day and age where everything is in a digital form and everything is electronic, it would create issues. So, allowing other forms of payment would be better for attracting overseas travellers and would also remain auditable.

There are some other defined terms such as digital gambling, gambling software, prohibited gambling machine, junket, junket operator and casino game, which, I believe, need clarity. Unless there is clarity by way of regulations, there would be a lot of ambiguity in the Act. Unfortunately, the Minister is not here at this point of time, but I would urge the Hon. Deputy Minister to take into consideration the various issues I have raised. I have raised them after studying the Bill. I see this Bill as very progressive, but if you look at the international norms and practices, for operators to operate in Sri Lanka, there need to be clear definitions. And, when there is ambiguity, the Minister is empowered to bring in regulations and through those regulations, you could get over the ambiguity created.

Today, I see a lot of debate on casinos. I would like to reiterate that in 2010, casinos came into operation in Sri Lanka. So, if one speaks about social norms now saying, You said no" and "You said yes, I would say that the bus had already left. Unfortunately, some in this House as well have already missed the bus. What is there to be debated in this House is whether the Authority created has transparency and accountability. Therefore, I would like to appeal to the Government to take the views expressed by us into consideration - nobody in this House is an expert - to get over the ambiguities in the Bill as this Authority intends to encourage other major operators to come to Sri Lanka. It is a known fact that Singapore first discouraged gambling.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, your time is up. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha, PC) Just give me half a minute, Sir.

So, Singapore first opposed gambling. However, they did a deep study and later, brought in casinos. Through casinos, their GDP has increased by 1 to 2 per cent and their tourist arrivals increased by 50 per cent after setting up casinos. Therefore, I humbly request this House to look at this progressively while addressing the shortcomings. Here, nobody looks at it from a religious angle and in 2010, this House had already voted that casinos should be given licences. Social factors are a different issue, but what we are debating here is whether there is a conducive legal environment for a regulatory authority to perform being fair to the gambler, the gaming operator and the public at large.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Attorney-at-Law) ? - - ? " . " . . " . " . . . ? " " . . . . .

Hon. Presiding Member, gambling is considered a grave sin and is totally prohibited in Islamic law. This applies to all forms of gambling, including lotteries, betting and games of chance, where money or valuables are at stake. Wealth should be earned through legitimate means such as honest labour, trade or investment. Where there is a clear exchange of value, then, it is permitted. Gambling, by relying on pure chance, contradicts this principle. That is why Islam prohibits gambling. The Quran highlights the detrimental effects of gambling such as stirring up enmity and hatred among people, diverting individuals from the remembrance of God and prayer and leading to financial ruin and family discord. That is happening all over. So, what is this Government saying? They are saying, We are going to promote responsible gambling. What is this nonsense? There is nothing responsible in gambling. Unfortunately, I happened to be the Chair at the Committee on Public Finance - other Members also participated - in approving this Bill.

When looking at some of the issues, let us be practical and pragmatic. Hon. Presiding Member, this done right, regulation can formalize activity, raise standards, bring in investment and create jobs, but done wrong, it will entrench cash-driven opacity and turn casinos into pipes for underground banking. This Bill, in the current form, tilts towards the latter. In fact, I pointed it out at Committee sittings.

What are our international monetary obligations? Sri Lanka is a current-account convertible economy under Article VIII of the International Monetary Fund. Simply put, a country that accepts Article VIII must not impose restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, except with IMF approval. Gambling-related payments are current-account services under the IMFs Balance of Payments Manual. The operators margin is recorded as a service charge, while wins and losses among players are current transfers. So, we must enable such payments, but through formal, supervised financial channels and not through other illegal channels.

1989 1990

We also carry binding commitments on anti-money laundering and countering financing of terrorism laws set by the Financial Action Task Force and assessed regionally by the Asia-Pacific Group. Our third mutual evaluation runs in 2025. Remaining outside the FATF grey list depends on effective controls, particularly for high-risk sectors like casinos. A cash-centric model would not pass that test. Therefore, what the Bill actually does and why there is a problem, let me point it out. Clause 22 of the Bill channels any transaction relating to gambling to currency or debit or credit card at a main cash desk merely subject to the Financial Transactions Reporting Act and the Foreign Exchange Act. There is indeed no requirement to settle medium or large transactions through authorized dealer banks, no ban on large foreign-currency note pay-ins or cash-outs, no player-account rails and no CTR or STR thresholds in the Act. That combination is the classic architecture exploited by Hawala and Undiyal networks. Cash in, chips, side-settlement and cash out are all off the banking radar. So, this is going to put us in serious trouble with the IMF.

The Bill is silent on junkets and VIP promoters, the entities which historically bridged gamblers and underground banking. The international experience in Macau and other areas shows that unregulated junkets are prime conduits for illicit cross-border flows. Our Bill has no licensing class, no fit and proper joint liability and no ban on promoter of deposit-taking. So, that is another violation.

The other is, at our borders, the practical regime permits any amount to be brought or taken with declarations required at US Dollars 15,000 of total foreign exchange and US Dollars 10,000 in currency notes. Declarations alone are not a control on downstream use. Without a bank-rail mandate inside casinos, this becomes the perfect pretext for cash-based foreign exchange recycling, rent-seeking and corruption risks in the cage.

Therefore, have we studied our peer jurisdictions? In Singapore, casinos must file Cash Transaction Reports to the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office for over Singapore Dollars 10,000 of cash, in or out. After recent reforms, the Customer Due Diligence thresholds for deposits and cash were lowered to Singapore Dollars 4,000. Data sharing and enforcement are muscular. Those are the conditions of the Singapore Police. In the United Kingdom, under Money Laundering Regulations, there are very strict Regulations for casinos. In the United States, CTRs are filed by casinos under the Bank Secrecy Act. Similarly, in Macau, post-reform junkets are heavily curtailed, joint liability is attached to operators, revenue sharing is barred, credit is tightly controlled and the number of licensed promotors is capped. These measures have specifically targeted illegal deposit-taking and underground banking.

Sir, what is the core inconsistency here? We should promote gambling tourism as a current account service consistent with Article VIII of the IMF Agreement. But, "promoting" cannot mean pay in and cash out in foreign

exchange notes at a front desk. Promotion in a current account-convertible economy must mean frictionless, bank-channel settlement with strong AML/CFT safeguards. Todays Bill locks in the opposite. Therefore, I have a detailed suggestion and I table* it so that that could be taken into account.

Sir, we are a current account-convertible country. That means, we facilitate legitimate current transactions including gambling services, but through banks and regulated PSPs with real-time reporting and tight oversight. Our peers show that it is possible. There are Singapores thresholds and data-sharing, UKs CDD rule and crime prevention mandate and also similar things in Macau and other places. Also, there is a clampdown on junkets and joint liability in Macau. Let us import those guardrails, rather than importing past mistakes. That is what we are saying. This Bill, as drafted, creates a cash-first front desk, ignores banking channel settlement and leaves junkets unregulated, which are going to create serious problems in the future. This will create a haven for various other people.

In the meantime, what do the very people who have come here and set up those businesses now say? This particular Melco Resorts, who have come here and set up a casino business with the John Keells Holdings, states this in its Annual Report, 2024, I quote:

"Additionally, if public opinion regarding casinos in Sri Lanka shifts or if policymakers adopt more restrictive views, we could encounter unforeseen challenges in maintaining our licence or expanding our operations."

But, that will not happen because they have a willing party in office; those who opposed casinos earlier have now done a complete turnaround. Those very people who wanted to chase out Joe Sim and James Packer back then are now saying, "Joe Sim and James Packer are welcome". So, now, our country is a haven for all these people, but still they are entertaining doubts.

Hon. Presiding Member, let me say one more thing. There is a serious problem regarding betting in sports. Betting in sports also has to be brought under this law. Cricket is such a valuable sport for us.

"The Morning" newspaper of 18.08.2025 states that an ex- Lankan cricketer - I do not want to mention the name - has been banned by the ICC for betting.

Now, what is happening here? The Sri Lanka Cricket sometimes allow betting entities to come and take on our franchise cricket leagues, our Lanka Premier League matches. And when asked, they say, "The ICC has approved them". But, they are known betting entities, who are coming and taking on franchise cricket here. So, whether it is done by the ICC or the Sri Lanka Cricket, everybody must be brought under proper monitoring and regulation.

Whatever said and done, I must congratulate the Government for having decided to take the bitter pill. . " " . . .

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 8 .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Presiding Member, I would have appreciated if the Hon. Deputy Minister of Finance had been here so that we could have corresponded because when I asked a Question in the morning, he gave a contrary Answer. Anyway, let it be answered properly subsequently.

Sir, we have three Items being debated today. One of them is the Regulations under the Public Debt Management Act, which has hitherto been under the Central Bank and is going to be officially transferred to be under the Ministry of Finance from 26th January, 2026. At this particular moment, it is undergoing a period of observation. The most critical factor that we came up with while interrogating the Central Bank officials when they came before the Committee on Public Finance of the Parliament was that the competent people who are expected to transfer to the Ministry of Finance from that particular institution have not yet been recruited. When we asked a question about the professionality of the people who are there, the answer that came forward was that they have not got the approval to recruit competent Chartered Financial Analysts - CFAs; none have been allowed to be recruited! Since that is one of the most critical factors, I call upon the Government to ensure that we have the best of people there so that they could administer this Public Debt Management Act and to execute the functions coming under that, which would be bestowed on the Ministry of Finance in future. The reason why we asked that question was, there were certain technical matters which have been brought about under the Public Debt Management Act as well as the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act with regard to the viability of a loan that is taken, the ability to repay that by an institution, and it has been moving forward from the point of view of a national balance sheet, including the ability of government institutions to pay back. With bankruptcy taking place in April, 2022, I think the Government took necessary precautions; it was the Ranil Wickremesinghe Government which basically took those additional precautions. Those precautions had been specified in the Act so that protection and remedial action would be provided.

1997 1998

Now, in the process, let us take a government institution such as the RDA. - . RDA Public Debt Management Act Division risk premium . Risk premium ADB loan .

At this moment, it is not only the expenditure, but also the cost benefit analysis that has got to be looked at. So, these are matters that have got to be looked at and also, the required professional staff have to be given.

If you look at the SriLankan Airlines, you would notice that it is the same problem that exists there. When the first Budget of this Government was presented, there was an intention to allocate Rs. 20 billion to service the interest charges and it was said that there would not be any further allocation of funds. We mentioned that Rs. 20 billion is hardly sufficient to resurrect the dying airline. Even though its operations have been functional for the last two years, it is the overall debt sustainability of the airline that has been in question. So, now, when there is liability to mop up, you could see that that has got to be addressed. And, the IMF is very concerned about this particular matter and they are basically saying that it needs to be commercialized. So, the Government must come up with a policy because if, by chance, the Government does not come up with a policy, it would certainly have an impact on the IMFs fifth tranche, which has to be negotiated somewhere in September.

Sir, the main reason why we are mentioning all this is because we are very mindful of the fact that from April, 2028, the Government has to start paying its debts. Payment of debt is something substantial and for that, we need to have a robust economy going forward. If the economy does not go forward, you would not be able to meet the revenue targets that have been set.

Today, you could see that there was a high debate on money printing. Why I took up the Public Debt Management Act, the Regulations under which are being debated today, was because of the debate on how much money has been printed. Money printing is absolutely essential.

Then, the total debt has increased from the time the Hon. Ranil Wickremesingh left office in September, 2024 from Rs. 17.595 trillion to Rs 30 trillion. On that particular basis, what we have to look at is foreign reserves. The foreign reserves when President Wickremesinghe left office in September, 2024 were US Dollars 5,900 million. But, in July, 2025, they were US Dollars 6,080 million. So, roughly, within 11 months, the reserves have gone up by US Dollars 180 million. But, the Central Bank makes a big noise saying that they have intervened in the market and that US Dollars 1,100 billion were brought into the open market. But, what is the net increase? The net increase is the most important factor. For debt sustainability, basically, you have to add US Dollars 250 million a month; US Dollars 250 million . US Dollars 7.2 billion to US Dollars 7.3 billion . US Dollars 1,100 million .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) .

Now, I will move on to the casino industry. It is very important that the Gambling Regulatory Authority Bill has been brought in, but we were very circumspect when it came before the Committee on Public Finance. We were trying to say that there is no point in bringing in laws, if its operation becomes hampered. When it comes to authorization of transactions relating to gambling, how do you bring in money? Would it be cash only, would modern technology be used for that or how you tax the sources, none of them have been explained. The Gambling Regulatory Authority Bill is something that we have been waiting for, for the last 10 to15 years. So, it is good that it has been brought in. But, if we take the legislation, if somebody wins and he is unable to take that money out of this country, then that would create a problem and it would give out a sour picture to the world. We have two to three domestic gambling companies operating. Then, you have Melco Resorts and Entertainment which has come in. So, on that basis, you should have not only cash, but other modern technology used for transactions relating to gambling. Then, record keeping. Now, they say that every transaction must be recorded.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, give me just a few seconds.

How can you record every single transaction? So, it has to be modernized, keeping the materialness.

The other one is, digital gambling. Digital gambling is basically outside. Even though the Gambling Regulatory Authority Bill talks about gambling, the ambit of digital gambling is so wide that it could be anything and everything. So, it has to be brought to a meaningful operation. Then, gambling software. "Gambling software" is not defined properly, it is not termed properly. So, these vague terms are used in the Gambling Regulatory Authority Bill. That is the problem in our country; we do not allow the professionals to do the job, to draft the legislation. So, we bring in half-baked legislation and that means you have to perpetually be in court. Then, rules of gambling, list of gambling, the number of stakes and junket operations must be meaningfully explained so that we know what those operational activities are.

About 23.6 per cent of the population is between the ages of 15 and 29. It is a population of more than five million. The highest unemployment rate is within that age category with about 28 per cent of youth being jobless. As you know, there are about 700,000 youth in the category of NEET - Not in Education, Employment or Training. So, that is a very serious matter. I do not know to what extent this Government has made plans, except for paying lip service, to rectify these issues.

Even the World Bank, in 2025, has given US Dollars 1 billion towards job creation and private sector stimulations. But, what are the plans the Government has for the jobless youth in the North and the East? , . . projects 2024-2025 Budget . , projects .

2021 2022

They are just projects; they are not yet being implemented. But, funds have been allocated for us from the Budget for 2024-2025 and we were also supposed to get aid from India. Now, it is August, and the projects are only on paper; they are not being implemented. US Dollars 1 billion has been given by the World Bank towards youth training programmes. However, we do not know what projects are going to come up for the East. We have been neglected and it is a very serious matter. We have to prepare the Budget for 2026 by the end of September or October, but, so far, nothing has been allocated for the East.

. , . , , . , drama show . , , . , .

Thank you for bringing in this Motion to pinpoint the lack of proper youth training programmes in the North, the East, the up-country and especially in areas of Tamil-speaking people. There seems to be an attitude, not particularly of this Government, but throughout successive regimes, that National Youth Councils are only for the majority community. It is wrong! You can just go and check, as I have just said, how youth training programmes have been implemented in the Districts of Ampara, Batticaloa, Trincomalee and across the Northern Province. You compare them with the programmes implemented in any other district or any other part of the country and you would see that there is absolute discrimination. It does not make any sense whatsoever. Even when giving promotions, there has been discrimination. For once, there had been discrimination in making appointments to the National Youth Councils. Also, the officers are slow and reluctant in providing encouragement to the youth in the North and the East.
