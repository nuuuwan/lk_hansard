WHO Sri Lanka Annual Report 2016 states, I quote:

Steadfast political commitment helped the country achieve major gains in 2016. Sri Lanka withstood pressure from the food and beverage industry and introduced traffic light labelling on sugary food and drinks. Tobacco taxation was increased significantly despite resistance.

There will be many challenges ahead as the country gears towards plain packaging, introducing stricter tobacco and alcohol control legislation and extension of the traffic light labelling system. WHO will continue to support the country in its mission to resist industry interference and address the growing challenge of NCDs.

Sri Lanka is one of six countries for targeted WHO support on NCD prevention and control from all three levels of the organization - WHO Headquarters, WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia and WHO Country Office for Sri Lanka. This will provide a major boost to the countrys efforts to reduce the NCD burden. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, your time is up. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senarathne) Okay, I will finish, Sir.

[3.22 p.m.] ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Diana Gamage) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, as this is my Maiden Speech, the Hon. Hesha Withanage has offered me a few minutes of his time as well.

Sir, firstly, I would like to congratulate the Hon. Speaker, the Hon. Deputy Speaker and you, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, on the appointments you have received in the Ninth Parliament of Sri Lanka. I also hope and anticipate that you would carry out your duties equally and fairly to every Member of this Parliament.

Sir, I wish to thank the 2.7 million voters of this country who voted for the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, which I represent here today, at the last General Election. The voters vested their trust in the Hon. Sajith Premadasa and his team. Being a new Party with a life of just six months, I think it is a great achievement for us to sit here today as the main Opposition. Sir, I also wish the Hon. Sajith Premadasa, the Leader of the Opposition, all the best. It is with great honour and respect that I thank the Hon. Sajith Premadasa, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya and the Hon. Ranjith Madduma Bandara, the General Secretary of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya for accepting me, for trusting me and giving me the opportunity to serve the nation as a Member of Parliament. Not forgetting the least, the pillar of strength behind me and who has always been beside me throughout my life in my achievements, the man who made possible the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, my husband Mr. Senaka de Silva. I thank him dearly with great appreciation.

Sir, I would like to read out a quote of a great lady the world has recognized as the Iron Lady, former Prime Minister of the UK, Mrs. Margaret Thatcher. She said, I quote:

Any women who understands the problems of running a home will be nearer to understanding the problems of running a country.

Sir, I wish to bring to the attention of this Parliament about the women of this country, who represent 52 per cent of the population of Sri Lanka. Fifty six per cent out of these 52 per cent of women vote at every election in this country, which means they create leaders, create governments and give their support towards the progress of the nation. But, unfortunately, we only listen to

1047 1048

,

fairytales regarding women in this country. We have never seen any steps being taken with regard to women for the last so many years of politics in this country. Today, we have a mere 5 per cent of women Representatives in this supreme Parliament itself and I would like to say that no one and no government has worked towards the protection of women.

Women go through so much of violence - domestic violence, rape and harassment - on a daily basis in this country, and I wish to say that I represent them in this supreme Parliament.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. (Mrs.) Diana Gamage, you have only one more minute left.

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Diana Gamage) Sir, as I said at the beginning, could I have a few minutes from the time allotted to the Hon. Hesha Withanage?

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) He has not indicated anything about time allocation.

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Diana Gamage) He offered me, anyway. Sir, can I just have two more minutes, please?

So, Sir, that is about women.

Also, there is another serious issue today in Sri Lanka and that is the abuse of innocent children in the country. Innocent children are being abused on a daily basis. At this present moment, while I am speaking, there is so much of child abuse going on in this country and I see that nothing is being done about it. Sir, if you need a report from the NCPA, I have a report here which states that 5,000 children have been abused during the first part of the year 2020 and we are still in the ninth month. Where does that take us?

Sir, I actually would like to thank the Prime Minister, the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, because he took action within 24 hours on something which I raised in a certain television programme. It is regarding the young children who have been living in prison from birth until the age of six with their imprisoned mothers in this country, for no crime they have committed. Where are we heading with the new generation, the future of this nation? We need to address this issue because it is a serious issue. So, I request His Excellency President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the Hon. Prime Minister to do something about it because as citizens, as parents and as responsible adults of this

country, it is a shame for us to see the future of our country just fading through our hands.

Sir, I would also like to say a few words in my mother tongue, if you do not mind.

[4.37 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Hon. Presiding Member, I thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak at this Debate. Sir, I find that this Government is proposing to give fillip to local production partly by its taxation scheme. We welcome such initiative. My Party, the Thamizh Makkal Thesiya Kootani, has enthroned self-government politically, self-sufficiency economically and self-reliance individually and socially as its goals. Working towards self-sufficiency in production and other economic sectors is the need of the hour. With so much of foreign debt to be serviced, we need to work towards self-sufficiency and to conserve our foreign exchange. There are many theories in this regard.

A World Bank expert met me once when I was the Chief Minister. He had noted that our farmers hardly made ends meet by paddy cultivation. Therefore, he proposed that we should not produce paddy at great cost since rice was available cheaply in countries like Thailand. He was thinking globally. He suggested that we should try other crop production. I told him that apart from our people preferring red rice to white rice, however much the cost of production might be, we must continue to produce our basic staple food with modern production methods to be in readiness for any emergency. Suppose production from Thailand and other countries gets delayed unduly due to war or other reasons, we would find it difficult to feed ourselves is what I told him. His answer was that we could get rice from some other country. I was not satisfied with that since war times can be tricky.

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has taught us the need to become self-sufficient in our food requirements. We must produce more than merely to make ourselves self-sufficient. We must export the excess; we must add value to our production. It is the Governments duty to facilitate considerable production, granting many subsidies, relevant production auxiliaries, advice towards value addition and help to export our products.

1071 1072

,

Sir, our Party has started popularizing home gardens in the North. More and more of our people are now growing at least some of their daily requirement of vegetables in their home gardens. I, for one, in my retirement, before being forced into politics, used to grow a lot of vegetables in my roof garden in our Colombo house. A journey towards self-sufficiency would help our war-affected people immensely. To a country faced with innumerable economic setbacks, ensuring such journey towards self -sufficiency would be the ideal way forward.

Giving fillip to local production would also generate employment to our people. Unemployment in our war-affected areas have exceeded 10 per cent while the national average of unemployment is less than 6 per cent. We need to take immediate steps to reduce unemployment in the war-affected areas. Increasing production after due planning would ensure decrease in unemployment and give impetus to development. We must ensure that at least one person in every family has employment. That would, in turn, reduce the number of families living under the poverty line.

Sir, speaking of the North and the East, agriculture is the mainstay of the economy there. Around 40 per cent of our people are farmers. But, some of our people have been unable to do farming in their own traditional lands in recent times. You would remember that very recently, a venerable bhikkhu, a member of the Presidential Task Force for Archaeological Heritage Management in the Eastern Province, prevented the farmers from entering nearly 1,000 acres coming under the Trinco-Kuchchaveli Pradeshiya Sabha Division in Thiriyayi, stating that certain paddy lands were archaeological sites. The farmers have been prevented from continuing their cultivation activates during this season. Those among us who argue that the Provinces must not be given land powers should take notice of this. A bhikkhu from nowhere comes and prevents our people from participating in their traditional agricultural pursuits.

Sir, are we interested in rallying all the communities and taking the country forward towards economic regeneration or are we interested in subjugating one community under the pretext of preserving archaeological sites at the expense of economic development and regeneration? We have not even identified the so-called archaeological sites, as to whether they belong to the time when those areas were occupied by Tamil Buddhists or Sinhala Buddhists. If those so-called sites were Buddhist remains from the time of Demala Baudhayos, the decision to preserve those sites must come from the Tamils of those areas and not from a pan-Sinhala task force. Let us first have a commission consisting of Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim and foreign historians well versed in the South Asian history to sit and identify the period when the Sinhala language was born. Buddhism and Sinhalese are not coextensive, Sir.

I find no reference to the immediate economic development of the war-affected areas. It is high time that we decide to give priority treatment to the war-affected areas to develop them quickly, if need be, with aid from

countries like Japan who came forward earlier to help us. This would help the Central Government as well as the war-affected areas by attracting urgent foreign exchange into the country.

There are two types of challenges we face in the North and the East in promoting economic recovery: one relates to administration, the other being the practical problems. Administratively, there has so far been a top-down attitude in deciding what is good for the North and the East. All economic planning was done in Colombo and thrust upon us at the periphery. Such planning never took into account our identity, our terrain, our climatic conditions, our culture and our way of life. Our public officers and local experts were not consulted when planning was done in Colombo. We lacked the power and authority to plan and execute what was best for us. I say so because I found this to be so when I was the Chief Minister of the Northern Province. The other challenge our people face is the practical difficulties. Even electricity metre readers are now brought from outside the Province. This way, our locals are continuing to be unemployed. Another example is the presence of the military who occupy valuable land. They are a hindrance to our progress.

I referred to the intrusion of the Buddhist priests of the Presidential Task Force for Archaeological Heritage Management a little while ago. In Sinhala, there is a beautiful phrase as to what they do - " .

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , , . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Just give me one more minute, Sir. So, Sir, intrusion by outsiders prevents our progress.

Let me conclude by congratulating the Government for promoting self-sufficiency and self-reliance in the field of economic development whilst, at the same time, pointing out the need to allow our people in the North and the East to mind their own business unhampered by outside influences while still continuing to be part of the same polity.

I thank you, Sir.

King Pasenadi Kosol described his fifth dream out of the sixteen dreams to Lord Buddha as "I saw an extraordinary horse which had two mouths on either side of its head being fed on both sides at once. It was eating greedily." Then, the Lord Buddha replied, Dear King, when the world is nearing its end, the rulers that come to power are so irresponsible, they appoint greedy men to the high chair of law. These deceitful judges, blind to the truth and honesty, take bribes from both parties like the voracious horse with two mouths.
