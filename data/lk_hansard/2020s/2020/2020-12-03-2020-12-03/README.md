I must also say this for your benefit since it is an important matter concerning the Sri Lanka Police. When the police come to prosecute cases before the original

courts of this country, the difficulties in pursuing a case without the assistance of the Attorney-Generals Department is a serious issue. To train the police officers to appear in courts also takes a long time. There are police sergeants who appear before the original courts, particularly the Magistrates Court. The present IGP himself also joined the police force as an Assistant Superintendent of Police. You can recruit lawyers with 10 years' experience as ASPs and then get them to lead these cases and for each SSP division, if you can appoint one ASP who is a qualified lawyer, it would be very helpful to pursue cases and also to dispose of these cases. I think it is a matter that you must take into consideration and take some steps to appoint lawyers with at least a minimum of 10 years' experience in criminal work before the Magistrates Court and the High Courts so that they will be able to prepare the plaints and dispose of these cases. Even the Mahara incident had happened because there are so many remand prisoners without plaints being filed in courts. With this COVID-19 situation, Courts are also not sitting. Almost 23,000 remand prisoners are in several prisons overcrowding them. All this has happened because disposal of cases is getting delayed due to the inexperience of police officers who are appearing before the Magistrates Courts. Therefore, I suggest that you take immediate steps to recruit ASPs who are qualified lawyers so that they will be able to conduct cases before the Magistrates Courts in this country.

Having said that, I would also like to bring to the attention of Major General (Retd.) Kamal Gunaratne, who is the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and since the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa is also in the House, the need to consider releasing the Silawathura land which is occupied by the Navy. The Navy Camp in Silawathura has taken over the entire Silawathura Town. The Hon. Kader Masthan, former Deputy Minister, is also aware of this. He and myself made representations to the former regime. We have taken some steps. We discussed with the earlier Secretary of Defence to have this naval detachment in Silawathura to be shifted to another strategic location close by and to release the entire town area for the use of the civilian population who have resettled in that area. That is an important matter because several acres of valuable land which belongs to private individuals had been occupied and now a big complex has come up there. It would be useful if you could consider releasing those lands for the private people who own them. Their deeds and all the other documents have been submitted to the Defence Ministry and this has not been attended to for several long years. This has been a serious issue. Therefore, I request that that be considered earnestly.

Together with that, there is also the issue of the Murakottanchanai Artillery Regiment Camp which was sought to be shifted to Punnakuda area in Eravur. I would ask the Hon. Minister of Public Security - the President has to be approached regarding this - not to do that because the Murakottanchanai Camp is a big complex. There is a school there and that school has been provided with an alternate building already. Therefore, there is no need to shift that camp to the Punnakuda area in Eravur. That land is earmarked for a BOI zone so that there

1835 1836

[ . ]

2020 03

would be investments coming to that area. That is an LRC land which has to be left for the use of the people of the Eravur area. Therefore, I ask you not to consider shifting that camp. I believe now the present regime has taken a decision not to shift the Murakottanchanai Camp. I would like, once again, to urge that issue be dealt with as we have requested.

Buildings have already been allocated for the Ramakrishna Mission School and that school is functioning quite conveniently in the new buildings. Therefore, that issue needs to be attended to so that there would not be an attempt to take over the LRC land in Punnakuda for this purpose.

Having said that, let me deal with the issue of custodial death. That is a matter the Hon. Minister will have to look at since there are several allegations now coming up with what is happening in prisons as well as in police custody. Custodial death is a very serious issue regarding which we may face problems when it comes to the International Community. Therefore, these issues have to be thoroughly examined. The Criminal Procedure Code provides in Section 371 that for any death taking place in a prison, there has to be a postmortem and a proper inquiry. I was surprised when the new State Minister of Prison Management and Prisoners' Rehabilitation, the Hon. Lohan Rathwaththe, told us today in the House that nobody has died of gunshot injuries. These are matters that have to be established through a proper postmortem and these inquiries also have to be conducted in a very open manner.

Today, the Hon. Ali Sabry gave an assuarance to the House that there is a committee of inquiry appointed with retired High Court Judge Kusala Sarojini Weerawardena heading it and with former President of the Bar Association, my batchmate, President s Counsel U.R. de Silva also as a member. I hope that the Committee will have hearings where the public also can come and give their version of the incident because there are so many parents and kith and kin of these prisoners who want to know the exact situation and many other facts. Therefore, there must be an open inquiry where this issue will be settled once and for all. This is not the first time an incident like this happened; there have been several incidents earlier. Mutinies inside prisons is a very serious issue.

Custodial death is something that we have to get involved in and stop. Also, it would be better for the Human Rights Commission to be permitted to visit the prison and do their own inquiry. Since the Human Rights Commission is an independent organization, while the ministerial inquiry is proceeding, it must also be given provision to conduct a separate inquiry so that the veracity and the truthfulness of the inquiry would be better established through such a mechanism.

Having said that, I must say that we were all very disappointed to a certain extent when the Supreme Court did not entertain our application to request for burial for the COVID-19 victims. It was unfortunate that the Supreme Court failed even to give reasons for that. While

having failed to entertain the Notice, they have not even given reasons. It is unfortunate because a Fundamental Rights application is a jurisdiction that the Supreme Court enjoys as an original jurisdiction. The Supreme Court is, in fact, the highest final appellate court, and as far as a Fundamental Rights application is concerned, the litigant has no opportunity to appeal beyond the Supreme Court. Therefore, when reasons are not given, it is very unfortunate that those litigants are unable to know why the Notices were refused.

Similarly, when petitions against the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution were filed, for ten days at a stretch, the Supreme Court heard all the counsels and there again, Notices were refused without giving reasons. This should be corrected and His Lordship the Chief Justice, for reasons best known to him, has not followed this practice. I would appreciate if reasons would be given when refusing Notices of at least Fundamental Rights cases and other important cases where you have heard counsel for more than two, three days. For the benefit of the litigants, reasons must be given so that it would be some solace to know on what basis the Court came to that conclusion.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .. . 5 .

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam. You have 14 minutes.

[3.25 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Hon. Presiding Member, to be honest, I take part in this Committee Stage Discussion quite reluctantly

because Defence Ministry is a subject that is very polarizing. When you hear speeches not only in this House but even when you consider the opinions expressed outside this House, they are polarizing on ethnic lines. On that basis, the tragedy is that this House has deteriorated in its conduct to such a point where deferring opinions are not respected, are not allowed to be voiced and then in that backdrop, on has to ask the question whether there is any point in speaking. But despite that, it is my duty by the people who elected me to express certain views, which I will endeavour to do.

Madam, in May, 2009, - the date was the 16th - I was approached by the LTTEs political head at that time, Mr. Nadesan, and Mr. Pulidevan who was in charge of the LTTE Peace Secretariat to approach the Government of the day. There were nearly 150,000 to 100,000 people in the LTTE-controlled areas by the 16th of May, 2009 and the LTTEs position was that if the Government was not approached and if the LTTEs wish to save those lives of civilians was not expressed and conveyed, those lives would be lost. On that basis, I contacted the then Minister Basil Rajapaksa on numerous occasions on the 16th, from about 4 o clock in the afternoon till about 10 in the night. I think we must have discussed ten times the modalities with regard to how those civilians could be brought across. Eventually with the Defence Ministry consultation, it was agreed around 8 oclock in the night that the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa and myself would personally go to the Vanni along with two Bishops that the Government and we would agree upon, who would oversee the whole process by which these civilians would come across. That agreement was reached at about 8 oclock on the 16th, pending the Security Council approval which was to meet on the next day because His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa was away in Jordan for the Non-aligned Movement Meeting and he was only returning on the 17th morning. When he was to return, he was supposed to go to the National Security Council Meeting immediately and approval was supposed to be sought and we were to be ready to go to the Vanni to ensure that those civilians be brought across.

There were 150,000 to 100,000 people - I say those were large numbers and there would have been a discrepancy of nearly 50,000 because it was almost impossible to give a safe number, but those numbers were massive by any stretch of imagination - and at about 11 o clock the next day, after the National Security Council Meeting had started, when I was looking at the TV, the Governments channels, Rupavahini and ITN, announced that all civilians had been brought across, that about 50,000 civilians had come across and that there were no more civilians in the LTTE-controlled areas. I panicked because I knew that when the war started in the LTTE-controlled areas, there were over 460,000 civilians. Those were Government figures and gradually, of the people coming out as well as deaths, the calculations made not only by the TNA, but by all other responsible institutions that were monitoring the war knew that the numbers, even at the very end, were large.

The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera the other day asked where was I. That was my job. I was a Member of

1839 1840

[ .. ]

2020 03

Parliament at that time and I was trying to, in some way, use my Privileges as a Member of Parliament and my contacts with the Government to try and safeguard those civilians. The LTTE was willing to allow them to be brought across. But, that did not happen. From the inception of the war, -

( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera) Madam Chair, I rise to a point of Order.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Please do not disturb, Hon. Minister. I only have a very short time. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes, Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera?

( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera) The thing is this. When you are trying to mislead this august Assembly - [Interruption.] No, you cannot mislead the House because the entire nation is listening. When you are trying to mislead, as an officer who had been in the war, it is my duty to correct you. About 300,000 people were used as a human shield by Prabhakaran. Are you going to dispute that fact? - [Interruption.] You are telling untruth.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) That is not a point of Order, Madam.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Ponnambalam, you continue with your speech.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Kindly be respectful. In my submissions, you must not disturb me like this. Be responsible, please.

( ) (The Hon. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka) Madam Chair, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, what is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka) Hon. Member, I am not arguing with you. I am giving you some more details. On the 19th of April, we attacked the LTTE line at Pudumatalan and took 120,000 civilians out. Everything is recorded. - [Interruption.] Hold on. Let me finish. - [Interruption.] Listen! Then again on the night of 16th May, - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Ponnambalam, you may continue with your speech.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) If this is going to happen, I might as well stop speaking. Madam Chair, if you are going to allow these Hon. Members to disturb me, I will stop speaking. There is no point in allowing me to speak in this way.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) We are running short of time. - [Interruption.] All right, Hon. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, finish it within a few seconds.

( ) (The Hon. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka) On 16th night, nobody came; you never came. The Army attacked the LTTE's Mullaitivu line and took 85,000 civilians out. So, those are the facts. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Ponnambalam, you can continue with your speech.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) So, 460,000 more civilians were in LTTE-controlled areas when the war began. But, the Government, from the very inception, was saying that there were only 70,000 civilians in LTTE-controlled areas. You cannot deny that.

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) That is wrong. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Food and medicine were sent only for 70,000 people, Madam Presiding Member. That is the truth. That is what the Government did.

1841 1842

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) No, no. You are telling untruth. - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Eventually, 320,000 people came out. They were kept in Manik Farm and various other places. So, Madam Presiding Member, when you have a situation where a Government says untruth about the numbers held, where a Government sends food and medicine enough only for a fraction of the population in a war situation, what is the intention? Even on the 16th of May, 2009 - I personally am a witness - when I contacted the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa and conveyed to the Government that the LTTE was willing to lay down arms to allow the civilians to be brought across safely, that war was not stopped. What is the intention you can derive from that? Is it not the intention to destroy them in whole or in part? Is it not that intention that was being demonstrated? This is the reality that is known to the Tamil people. That is why I said this Ministry is the most polarizing Ministry to speak on. This is the reality that we live with where over 164,000 people are unaccounted for.

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) That is wrong! - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) So, when that is the situation, Hon. Presiding Member, a responsible Government - [Interruption.] Today, an Hon. Member from the Opposition stated that over 52 senior members of the military do not get visas to countries. Why? Why is it that members so senior are being denied visas? Therefore, is it not the duty of the Government, if these senior members are, in fact, innocent, to prove their innocence? - [Interruption.] Is it not in your interest to do that? Is it not what we are asking for? Have an inquiry; agree to an international inquiry. - [Interruption.] If you have nothing to hide, then why do you shy away? Do not do that. Do not do that because for as long as you shy away -

( ) (The Hon. Premitha Bandara Tennakoon) Madam Presiding Member, I rise to a point of Order.

Hon. Member, the LTTE gave weapons, bombs and cyanide capsules to children, to the under-aged children.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) That is not a point of order. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Ponnambalam, you continue with your speech.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) So, for as long as you shy away, not only will your own image in the eyes of the international community be run down, but you will also continue to polarize the society within this country. The Defence Ministry, Hon. Presiding Member, is so polarized that as far as the Tamils are concerned, you should change the name of the Ministry. The Ministry should be called Tamil Genocide Ministry or Anti-Tamil Ministry. That is how we feel. Yes, that is how we feel. So, why do you deny that?

The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekara is now in charge of the Police. He stands up in this House and says that the Hon. Members of the TNA must be banned. - [Interruption.] He says that the Hon. Members of the TNA must be banned!

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. U.K. Sumith Udukumbura) Madam Presiding Member, I rise to a point of Order.

.. .

( ) (An Hon. Member) . [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. U.K. Sumith Udukumbura) . ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . [ ]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekara, the Minister in charge of policing, stood up shamelessly and said that the TNA must be banned, that they must be thrown out of this House. - [Interruption.] Is this what a Minister who is in charge of policing says? - [Interruption.]

The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, on the 23rd of November, made a speech. The poor Member thought that he was praising the President. He boasted that President Mahinda Rajapaksa did not want to allow the civilians to come out. When different countries and different individuals like myself were trying to intervene to save those civilians, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe

1843 1844

2020 03

boasts, President Rajapaksa did not want the civilians to come out because Prabhakaran might escape. For one man, you chose to destroy thousands and thousands of lives! That is what is called war crimes; that is what is called genocide where you choose to destroy the lives in whole or in part.- [Interruption.] Hon. Member, please! For Gods sake, the future of this country is going to get inheritance of this culture. - [Interruption.] That should not be allowed. - [Interruption.]

There are senior Hon. Members in the front Benches. They are not racists. I know they are not racists. They are people who might have differing views, but, at least, they are not racists. But, that cannot be said of some senior Hon. Members who are being appointed today as Ministers and that too, to be in charge of security and public security. - [Interruption.] Madam Presiding Member, are you allowing this language?

( ) (The Hon. Thisakutti Arachchi) . . rose.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) These are hooligans, [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] Madam Presiding Member. These are not honourable Members; these are hooligans.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

[Interruption.] This is the reality.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) So, it is on that basis -

( ) (The Hon. Chamara Sampath Dasanayake) Madam Presiding Member, I rise to a point of Order.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Madam, the TNA is willing to give me some more time from what is allotted to them. I just want to make a few more points. You yourselves call it the "Defence Ministry". -[Interruption.] You yourselves call it the Defence Ministry for the whole country. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sivagnanam Shritharan)

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Ponnambalam, please continue with your speech. - [Interruption.]

1845 1846

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Madam Chair, the TNA has given me five more minutes.

The Ministry of Defence has 20 divisions in this country. Twenty divisions! Of the 20 divisions, 16 are based in the North and the East! There are six headquarters and four are based in the North and the East. In whose defence? Who is your enemy? You claim here that it is only the LTTE which is your enemy, but it is the Tamil people that you are oppressing. Is this what you want to convey for generations and generations to come? For Gods sake, think again! In order to pursue your chauvinistic and racist policies, you all are creating a precedent today which is going to curse this country, curse it to the point that you might quite well destroy us, but you only destroy yourselves.

( ) (The Hon. Premitha Bandara Tennakoon) Madam Chairperson, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Yes, Hon. Premitha Bandara Tennakoon? ( ) (The Hon. Premitha Bandara Tennakoon) Hon. Member, I wish you had the balls [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

to talk like this against the LTTE when they were giving arms to children, when they were giving bombs to children - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) That is not a point of Order, Hon. Member. Hon. Ponnambalam, please continue.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) Thank you.

So, is this the precedent you want to set? When you set this precedent - yesterday, it was the Tamils; today, it is the Muslims and tomorrow, it will be your own people. Because the people who you consider your competition, you will turn against them.

( ) (An Hon. Member) That was seen the day before yesterday in Mahara.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) That is the reality. This is a downward spiral, Hon. Presiding Member. If these Members - whom I mean by "these Members" are not the hooligans

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] who sit at the back, but the Senior Members, the Members who have been in this House for decades, Members who are responsible and who have the intelligence to meet the opposing arguments. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . . [ ] Hon. Ponnambalam, you have only two more minutes. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam) If these Senior Members continue to fail in their duties as they are failing today, it is this country that will go to the dogs. That, you can never prevent. - [Interruption.]

I have been repeatedly stating that I am an individual who was born and bred in Colombo. My friends are Sinhalese. I grew up with the Sinhalese. During the 1983 riots, it was the Sinhalese people like Mr. Ananda Wijesekera, Presidents Counsel, Mr. Kosala Wijetilleka, Presidents Counsel and Mr. Stanley Williams who saved us. Those were the Sinhalese people whom I knew. But, quite honestly, even ten years ago when I came here as a Member of Parliament and even when the LTTE was there, this was not the culture, Madam Chair. People were willing to listen; people were willing to answer and even though they disagreed, they were willing to answer with decorum. But, it is a disaster what has come before this country. Make no mistake, you can, by all means, continue to disenfranchise the Tamil people. You might even succeed in your continued systematic genocide; you might even succeed in totally dismantling our identity and there might come a time when we cannot even claim that we ever had a place in this Island. But, you will leave a legacy that will destroy yourselves. Mark my words, you are destroying yourselves!

Thank you. ( () ) (The Hon.(Dr.) Sarath Weerasekera) . . . . . .

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Madam Chair, - ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Madam Chair, my name had transpired in my absence during the course of the speech of the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam and I would like to put the record straight.

1865 1866

It was a complete distortion to state in this House that we had prevented the rescue of hundreds and thousands of Tamil civilians who had been used as human shields and that they were being deliberately prevented from coming out for us to rescue them from the LTTE. I want to make it very clear that every effort was made, in fact, successfully by the Government at that time to rescue hundreds and thousands of innocent Tamil people by sacrificing the lives of the armed forces who went forward inch by inch to ensure the safety of the people of those areas. He has only to refer to the speech I made at the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Foreign where I very clearly stated that those civilians were not only rescued by the armed forces during the last stages of the war, but were also given essential food items as well as medical items so that they would be able to get by during that troubled time. I also made it a point to inform the House that nearly 15,000 young people surrendered soon after the war and they were all accounted for. It was President Gotabaya Rajapaksa who took them over, rehabilitated them and reintegrated them into the society. So, at no point did we ever put the lives of the people of those areas at risk. So, it is a complete distortion by the Hon. Ponnambalam and I would ask him to refrain from making such references especially when referring to me while I was not in the House.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . .
