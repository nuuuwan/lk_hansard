, , . , , , . . . . [9.45 a.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa - Leader of the Opposition)Hon. Speaker, let me take this opportunity on behalf of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya - the main Opposition Party - to congratulate you on your unanimous election as the Speaker of this House.

Having done your educational activities at Telijjawila Central College, Rahula College and the University of Colombo, you have contributed tremendously to the political activities of our country, and your tremendous contribution is well recognized. Throughout your political career you have acted with dignity, integrity and honour and we salute you. You have been a true patriot; you are not a pseudo-nationalist and neither are you a modern-day racist. So, we, on this side of the political aisle, are extremely honoured to have you as our Speaker. If I may quote the former British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, he said, I have climbed to the top of the greasy pole. That was what he uttered when he became the Prime Minister and I believe you have achieved much and this is the climax of your political career

Mr. Speaker, a democratically elected Parliament is the epitome of a functioning democracy. It is incumbent upon all of us to protect and promote a vibrant and sound democracy. Sir, as the custodian of this august Assembly, you are ethically and morally obliged to uphold the great principles of democracy and the legitimacy of this institution. It is incumbent upon you to be equitable, impartial, unbiased and non-prejudicial. We fervently believe that you will be meticulous, methodical and proficient in conducting yourself; we believe you will be just and fair because it is indispensable for a flourishing democracy. Therefore, it is incumbent upon you to nourish and nurture these main ingredients of democracy. This institution represents the will of the people, the voice of the voiceless and you, as the guardian angel of Parliament, we believe, will ensure that peoples sovereignty will be protected and enhanced.

In conclusion, Sir, I fervently hope that you will abide by the great principles proclaimed by the former President of the Unites States Abraham Lincoln, that you will act with malice towards none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right.

I congratulate you, Sir. [9.50 a.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) May I seek your indulgence, Hon. Speaker, to say a few words on this memorable occasion. I want to in the first instance convey to you on behalf of myself and the Party I represent in Parliament, the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi and the Tamil National Alliance our warmest congratulations on your being elected to the exalted position of Speaker of this honourable Assembly.

With your long experience in Parliament, I have not the slightest doubt, Sir, that you will discharge your functions effectively, efficiently and in a bipartisan and an acceptable way to all Members of Parliament. May I clearly state, Sir, that my Party and I will extend to you our maximum cooperation that you would expect of us in the discharge of your functions as the Hon. Speaker. Thank you. [9.51 a.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Speaker, may I extend to you, on behalf of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, my warm congratulations and wishes for a well-deserved Office. We have witnessed many of your predecessors bringing honour to this esteemed Office. You are the custodian of the rights of this Parliament and us, Members of this House.

We have in the past attempted to introduce many reforms within the House with regard to the way in which this House conducts its affairs and also to maintain the dignity and decorum of the affairs of this Assembly. In doing so certain far-reaching reforms have been introduced with the concurrence of both sides of the House; very particularly in the conduct of affairs as the House being the primary watchdog over pubic finance. These progressive measures, I hope, under your esteemed leadership, will be maintained and we really appreciate that we have had the opportunity of a seasoned politician to be heading this institution.

We also note that you, by virtue of your Office, will also be chairing the Constitutional Council, which is entrusted with the important function of appointment of high officials who are mandated by the Constitution and you, while conducting the affairs as the Chairman of the Constitutional Council as well as the Speaker of this House, I am sure, will bring honour to your Office.

With those words, may I be permitted to wish you once again on behalf of all of us. Thank you.

I start my felicitations, Hon. Speaker, hailing you in my mother tongue, the oldest living language of this world and the language of the first indigenous inhabitants of this country, and proceed in the link language. I thank you for accepting such a high position in our Parliamentary tradition. Sir, I am sure, you would bring with your high Office your experience with men and matters gained throughout your long political career.

We have a very powerful Government now. A similar Government was constituted under the late J.R. Jayewardene in 1977. It was during that regime that we had the 1983 Pogrom. Certainly, this Government too could follow the path of the Elephant of that time and end up as today reduced to a single Member in the future. But, I am sure they would not. They would prefer to learn from our mistakes of the past and usher in a period of peace and prosperity where all communities would feel equal to each other and walk with dignity and pride as children of Mother Lanka. That freedom and equality could dawn only if we shed the false historical perspectives of the past and recognize the intrinsic rights of the people living in the North and the East of Sri Lanka, who are entitled to the right of self-determination as per Article 1 of Chapter one of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in addition to their hereditary and traditional rights to be recognized as a nation.

Sir, I hope, we would not be called upon in this August Assembly of Parliamentarians in the future, during your term of Office, for your protective assistance since we would respect each others rights and our duties towards each other. We are sure that you will guide us all without fear or favour if any such impasse comes to pass.

There is no need Sir, in a country which professes Buddhism to expect a hegemonic dominance from anyone. We have not forgotten what the Sinhala villager is only too well familiar with, that every act has its opposite reaction; .

Today, we have a House that is heavily weighted towards one side and under those circumstances, for a Speaker belonging to that one side to perform his duties on behalf of the entire House is that much more onerous. We must not forget, Mr. Speaker, that all parties represented in this House have come here today with their respective mandates. Those mandates must be respected; those mandates must be voiced; those mandates must be debated and due place must be given. In a House that is so heavily weighted on one side, it is your responsibility to ensure that such

debates and such fairness take place. For you to perform that duty, our Party will extend to you the utmost cooperation. I wish you once again all the very best. There can be no doubt that your experience as a Member of Parliament for so many decades will serve that purpose.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) , , , , . . . . , , .

ENGLISH TEXT OF THE ADDRESS TO PARLIAMENT BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT

Hon. Speaker, Hon. Prime Minister, Hon. Leader of the Opposition, Hon. Ministers, Hon. State Ministers, Hon. Members of Parliament, the election held on August 5th marked a turning point in the history of Parliamentary Elections in Sri Lanka.

We asked the people to give us a two-thirds majority to form a stable Government.

First of all, I would like to thank and extend my gratitude to all the patriotic Sri Lankans for giving Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna and its allied parties a historic and resounding two-thirds majority for the first time in the history at an election held under the Proportional Representation System.

Universal suffrage is a democratic right that we must all respect and uphold. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all Sri Lankan voters who exercised their voting right at this election.

During the Presidential Election held last November, over 6.9 million people gave me a decisive mandate, placing a very high confidence in me. So far through my actions, I have proved that I will uphold the promise, that I will not violate the trust they placed on me.

The period between the Presidential Election and the Parliamentary Election has been very challenging for us. What we inherited was an economy that had collapsed. Since we did not have a majority in Parliament, we were compelled to function with a minority Government. In addition, we had to face the COVID-19 pandemic that disabled the entire world during that period. At a time when even the most powerful countries in the world were left helpless in the wake of COVID -19 catastrophe, we were able to successfully face the challenge. Even foreign nations praised our efforts to prevent the spreading of the pandemic.

The historic mandate received by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna has proven that people are impressed with the way we have governed the country during the past nine months despite various obstacles. People appreciate the change taking place in the political culture of this country.

As representatives of the people, we always respect the aspirations of the majority. It is only then that the sovereignty of the people can be safeguarded.

In accordance with the supreme Constitution of our country, I have pledged to protect the unitary status of the country and to protect and nurture the Buddha Sasana during my tenure. Accordingly, I have set up an advisory council comprising leading Buddhist monks to seek advice on governance. I have also established a Presidential Task Force to protect places of archaeological importance and to preserve our Buddhist heritage.

While ensuring priority for Buddhism, it is now clear to the people that freedom of any citizen to practise the religion of his or her choice is better secured.

The Government has paid special attention to the protection of national heritage, culture and our identity as well as the protection and promotion of performing arts and folk arts.

When we took over the Government, the confidence of the people in the security of the country had been severely dented due to the Easter Sunday attacks that occurred in 2019. Establishing firmly that the prime policy of our Government is national security, we have restructured the security apparatus and intelligence services, eliminating the fears of the people, thereby restoring the security of the country. We have recreated an environment where any citizen can live freely without any fear for the safety of themselves and their families.

As I have pledged, the launch of the methodical mechanism to protect the people against social evils such as the activities of the underworld and the drug menace that have been a hindrance to the day-to-day lives of the people has also increased the confidence of the public. Accordingly, a virtuous and a law-abiding society is emerging as we promised.

We are working towards a significant transformation of the political culture of this country.

After I assumed office as the President, changing the existing system, a methodical procedure was introduced to appoint heads of government institutions, whereby qualifications of prospective appointees were examined through a panel of experts. A well-experienced team of professionals, entrepreneurs and academics were appointed instead of relatives, acquaintances and followers. This policy will continue in the future as well.

We also took measures to build a production economy. Paddy farmers were given a higher guaranteed price for their products. We took steps to protect local farmers by halting importation of exportable produce for re-export as well as banning importation of crops that could have been grown locally. Farmers were provided with required fertilizer free of charge. People were encouraged to recultivate abandoned lands throughout the country. Through all these, we provided a new lease of life to the agricultural sector in this country.

After we assumed office, we provided tax concessions targeting local entrepreneurs. Interest rates were brought down to encourage businesses. Competitive imports were restricted in order to protect local entrepreneurs and industrialists.

It is clear that people enthusiastically supported us in this election due to the trust we have been able to build in them in this manner. We will continue to serve the people in a manner that affirms this trust.

53 54

It is equally important to precisely interpret the mandate given by the people. We respect the trust that the people have placed in me and the Prime Minister and the newly elected peoples Representatives. We have a clear understanding of the expectations with which the people gave such a powerful mandate to the Government. We will leave no room for such expectations to be dashed for any reason.

It should always be remembered that the prime responsibility of a peoples Representative is to serve the public. We will be sensitive to fulfilling the needs of the people, keeping in mind that all these positions are responsibilities and not privileges.

I travelled all over the country to support every candidate who represented our group in this election. Instead of holding political rallies, I went to the people during these visits and listened to their grievances directly. A large majority of issues presented by the general public were not personal, but common issues. Even after 72 years of freedom, simple issues have not been resolved.

There are people who do not possess proper deeds for the lands on which they have lived for many years. We will provide them with legitimate deeds, utilizing a swift and due process. I assure you that without a proper alternative, we will not evict people from their ancestral homes or farmlands.

Human-elephant conflict has become a major issue to the people. A group of experts has already been appointed to craft a feasible solution for this issue. A separate State Ministry was established solely for this purpose because we are aware that this issue needs a sustainable solution.

An incredible percentage of people across the country suffer from a shortage of drinking water. We will take necessary steps to address these humane issues. As a national policy, we will enact procedures to provide drinking water to every part of the country.

Parents request for their childrens education suitable schools. The shortage of National Schools was evident in every area. Most schools have significantly inadequate facilities. The shortage of teachers, laboratories, libraries and sports facilities was frequently mentioned. Although we request students to follow science and technical subjects in order to successfully contribute to the economy, their schools do not even have basic facilities to teach those subject streams. Funds expended by the Government for children to pursue their ambitions and to hone their skills are an investment for the future. We will accord priority to resolve these issues through the ministries which had been assigned with new responsibilities.

Both resources and facilities in rural hospitals are inadequate. There is a considerable shortage of doctors, nurses and other staff in these hospitals. Patients in some areas have to travel long distances to seek treatment. We will eliminate these discrepancies in the delivery of free healthcare facilities for people.

Both Ayurvedic and indigenous medicinal systems will be preserved and promoted.

Instead of spending large amounts of foreign exchange to import medicine, we have already commenced operations to manufacture medicines locally. We will also eradicate corruption which occurs in the importation of medicine. This is why we formed a separate State Ministry to manufacture, supply and regulate medicine.

A large percentage of citizens of this country earn their livelihood through self-employment. Also, a large number of people depend on agriculture. Their sole requests are for adequate water and fertilizer during their cultivation seasons. We should address these issues. Therefore, we will implement a broad set of activities to rehabilitate the tanks and to develop the irrigation system across the country.

Another major social issue faced by the youth is unemployment. Both short-term and long-term solutions have been discussed to address this issue. We have already commenced a programme to provide employment for 100,000 persons representing the most underprivileged families in the country. Simultaneously, we have set plans in motion to provide job opportunities to 50,000 graduates and train them to render their services efficiently. When offering government job opportunities, we will accord priority to the poorest households. Further, we will have to ensure equal distribution of job opportunities for every province. Every appointee to the Government should contribute productively to the country. Therefore, no unnecessary and arbitrary enrollment will be allowed to any ministry or institution.

Both Ministries and State Ministries will work in cooperation with the respective private sector establishments in the industry to generate job opportunities. In addition, we will take necessary steps to promote self-employment and entrepreneurship in each industry as well.

Our duty and responsibility is not to distribute job opportunities, but to generate them. In order to overcome both local and global challenges and revive the economy, we will have to adopt new ways of thinking. An out-of-the-box thinking is required in order to meet the economic challenges. This time, the Ministries have been formed with this thought in mind.

We have ascertained the requirement for a people-centric economy for our economic revival. When forming ministries, special attention was given in assigning their subjects and tasks to cover fields such as agriculture, plantations, fisheries, traditional industries and promotion of self-employed job opportunities which affect most of the people in the country.

Our basic aims are to strengthen the local economy and to increase export income. Currently, the income from tea, coconut and rubber industries is not at a satisfactory level. We will commence operations to develop tea plantations and at the same time, the Government will assist the small and medium-scale tea estate owners as well. Due to the shutting down of tea factories, tea estate owners have encountered a number of difficulties. We will restart these factories and eliminate existing irregularities, simultaneously encouraging the export of high quality tea products. We will reclaim the global brand name we held for Ceylon Tea.

We will also encourage planting of new coconut saplings. In order to enact a reasonable price for rubber, local rubber industrialists will be encouraged to utilize local rubber. Plantation of palm oil trees will be stopped completely.

We promote the production of export crops such as pepper and cinnamon. We will provide opportunities to generate substantial foreign exchange by providing a stable price to the farmers through value addition to agricultural products and exporting them.

In assigning responsibilities to ministries, special attention was paid to the development of urban as well as rural infrastructure facilities and to find solutions to the issue of housing for the people.

We have taken measures to identify several sectors that can directly contribute to the development of the country and to appoint State Ministers responsible for these tasks and to assign them the relevant subjects and activities. As human resource development has been identified as a priority, the subject of education has been brought under one Ministry and four State Ministers were appointed for different responsibilities therein. Separate State Ministries for preschools, education reforms, skills development as well as Dhamma schools and Bhikku education have been set up due to their importance.

In achieving our future objectives, special attention needs to be paid to technical education. We will pay special attention in education reforms in respect of Grade 6 to Grade 13.

We will increase the capacity of universities enabling all students who pass the Advanced Level Examination to pursue university education. Further, we will take measures to improve the Open University network and distance learning methods. The curriculum will be revised to ensure that these degree subjects would directly contribute to the growth of the economy.

The cost of electricity is an important factor that impacts on the economic development process of the country. Therefore, a separate State Ministry has been set up to promote renewable energy sources.

The focus of relevant Ministries will be directed to assist entrepreneurs to use modern technology for value addition, to encourage innovation and to explore new market opportunities in a creative manner.

Although our country is rich in natural resources, the value-added industries are not yet on par with international standards. Measures are afoot to earn a large sum of foreign exchange by adding value to the export of natural resources such as gems and minerals.

Methodical development of our traditional industries such as batik, local apparel, brass, cane, pottery, furniture, gem and jewellery will pave the way for the country to promote self-employment, to generate new employment opportunities as well as to build businesses and earn a large amount of foreign exchange.

One-third of the countrys population depends on agriculture, plantation and fisheries as their livelihood. We should raise the living standards of these people. The development of these industries requires a new approach based on technology that goes beyond traditional methods. This is why Ministries directly targeting several sectors related to agriculture, plantation and fisheries have been set up to focus attention on this matter.

We will take measures to introduce high quality packaging as well as proper transport facilities to deliver the best quality produce, minimizing wastage while taking steps to produce high quality seeds locally with the aim of providing such seeds to the farming community. We will take necessary measures to develop dairy and poultry industries.

We will also target to increase the production of organic fertilizer locally with the aim of producing toxic-free foods and in the next decade, to ensure total organic farming in Sri Lanka.

We are targeting a massive progress in the fisheries sector. We should halt the importation of fish into our country as our motherland is surrounded by the ocean. We will introduce a comprehensive programme to provide new technology and equipment needed to enhance the fisheries sector. All the fishing

harbours will be modernized to provide facilities for multi-day fishing boats that fish in deep seas. Similarly, we will take steps to build new harbours as per any necessity. We will bring a halt to the plundering of our oceans by unlawful foreign fishing vessels.

It is part of our strategy to introduce new technology to develop the inland fresh water fisheries industry.

The scopes and responsibilities of each Ministry and State Ministry have been demarcated very clearly. Through this initiative, it is expected that the relevant Ministers will implement policies for related fields as well as take steps to monitor the functions, activities and efficiency of State Ministries. The State Ministers are able to fulfil their respective duties and responsibilities without any hindrance as the monetary provisions required to implement development projects and financial responsibility are directly placed with them.

People are of the view that they are not getting the expected service from the Public Service in an efficient manner. Therefore, I request all the Ministers and State Ministers to take steps to provide fast and efficient service to the public via Ministries, departments and institutions that come under their purview. During my recent visits to several State institutions, I observed that some of their institutional procedures do not add any value to the Government or to the public, but only waste the time of the public. You should identify new methods to provide an efficient, speedy and convenient service to the public instead of continuing with prevailing traditional methods. You need to re-engineer the processes for greater productivity and customer satisfaction. We should find new technological solutions in this regard.

In the National Policy Framework "Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour", we promised the people that we would eradicate waste and corruption. This is a core responsibility of all of us. We will take steps to completely eradicate waste and corruption in all the Ministries and institutions. In future, I will not hesitate to enforce the law against those who are involved in fraud and corrupt actions, irrespective of the status of any such perpetrator.

Constantly, I will review the progress of the achievement of the goals of the Government that are implemented through Ministries and the public sector. If I find any Ministry failing to achieve its set targets, I will not hesitate to effect necessary changes to implement policies of the Government.

In the current political culture, most of the peoples Representatives, after they get elected, neglect the prime duty of going to the people. When I travelled round the country in the recent past, this was confirmed by the people who voiced their grievance on this matter. Henceforth, Ministers, State Ministers as well as Members of Parliament will fulfill this expectation of the people by visiting them often to understand their issues and find solutions to them.

The basis of the success of a democratic State is its Constitution. Our Constitution, which has been amended 19 times from its inception in 1978, has many ambiguities and uncertainties, presently resulting in confusion. As the people have given us the mandate we wanted for a constitutional amendment, our first task will be to remove the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution. After that, all of us will get together to formulate a new Constitution suitable for the country. In this, the priority will be given to the concept of one country, one law for all the people.

An unstable Parliament that cannot take firm decisions and succumbs to extremist influences very often is not suitable for a country. While introducing a new Constitution, it is essential to make changes to the current electoral system. While retaining the salutary aspects of the Proportional Representation System, these changes will be made to ensure stability of the Parliament and peoples direct representation.

I love my country. I am proud of my country. I have a vision for my country. Our ardent desire is to build a prosperous nation with a productive citizen, contented family and a righteous society. What we have done so far as well as the plans we propose to implement in future will be aimed to achieve this objective.

We have arrived at an important landmark in history. The people have given the current Government a massive mandate. We have been given the responsibility to take the country towards prosperity while safeguarding the people and protecting the sovereignty of the country without succumbing to any force. The present generation must fulfill that responsibility for the sake of the future generations.

This is the Motherland of all of us. Hence, the time has come for all of us to join hands for the sake of the country irrespective of race, religion or party differences.

I extend my hand of friendship to everyone to join me in building the prosperous nation we promised to our people.

May the Noble Triple Gem bless you all!
