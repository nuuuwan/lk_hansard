Then, Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan, you have made a request to the Hon. Speaker that you would like to make a clarification in regard to the official residence and the official vehicle allocated to you. You can do it now.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION BY HON.

RAJAVAROTHIAM SAMPANTHAN ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for permitting me to make this Statement of urgent public importance pertaining to the Bungalow of the Leader of the Opposition and other matters related thereto.

You recognized me, Sir, as the Leader of the Opposition of the Sri Lankan Parliament in September, 2015. At that time, for over 20 years, as a Member of Parliament, I had been occupying the Summit Flats 2D, where I climbed and descended 60 to 70 steps every time I entered the flat or left it. Given my age - I am well past 80 - this was very inconvenient and difficult, but I put up with it.

I was given the Bungalow for the Leader of the Opposition only in September, 2017. two years after I became the Leader of the Opposition, and I was able to move into it only in September, 2017. While they were looking for a bungalow for me, the former President suggested to me that I rent out a bungalow. But, I did not want to do that on account of the exorbitant cost it would have entailed to the Public Exchequer. The other facilities provided to me as the Leader of the Opposition were attached to the bungalow and the staff. I did not request either the Hon. Speaker, the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya, or the Hon. Prime Minister, the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, to permit me to continue to occupy the Opposition Leaders Bungalow. Whatever action they took, they did according to their own will. The other facilities that have continued were also in terms of that decision.

Following the October, 2018 Constitutional crisis, both the then Prime Minister, the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, and the then Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, exchanged positions, which happened at the same time. My removal as the Leader of the Opposition also occurred at the same time. The only

545 546

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

other facility not referred to so far is the vehicle bearing number CAT 1094, a Benz motor car, which was handed over to me on 30th January, 2017. I sent that vehicle to the new Leader of the Opposition on 07th January, 2019. During the two years the vehicle was in my possession, it has done only 2,082 kilometres, showing how sparingly the vehicle was used.

Sir, I have been saddened by what has happened. This ugly situation should not continue. I raised this, Sir, as a matter of urgent public importance because various comments have been made by various persons including Hon. Members of Parliament and I wanted to put the two facts on record so that everybody will know what the true position is. Sir, I am thankful to you for permitting me to make this Statement.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) ( . ( . .

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Deputy Speaker, with regard to the Statement the former Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Sampanthan, made, I would like, on behalf of the Government, to make it clear that we have the highest respect for Hon. Sampanthan, and to any facilities that he has been enjoying as a result of the office that he held or otherwise, this Government is not interested in making any changes.

During the Presidency of the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, the necessary security was provided to the Hon. Sampanthan and all the Members of Parliament from the Northern Province, which shows that we have not been politically biased in making any of these decisions. We will continue to adhere to that and any facilities that have been provided to former Ministers, Deputy Ministers or the former Leader of the Opposition as a result of the offices they held, would be decided in accordance with the normal procedure.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) I am thankful to the Hon. Minister and the Hon. Leader of the House for the statement he made. But, there were some statements made by some Government Members of Parliament in regard to this matter, which did not quite represent the truth and which caused me a great deal of pain. I kept quiet because I did not want to make an ugly controversy more public. But, I thought I should make a statement and put the facts on record so that everybody in the country will know the truth. I never asked for any favour. You gave me a house two years after I became the Leader of the Opposition. If the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa or the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe was the Leader of the Opposition, they would have got a house the next day or the next week, not two years later. Having done that to me and making me climb 80 steps for two more years, which I had done for 20 years earlier, your Members of Parliament were making unkind

547 548

remarks about the true state of facts. That is why, Sir, I made that Statement. I do not want to develop this controversy any further. I am thankful to the Hon. Minister for the very gentlemanly statement he made.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) ( ( ( ( . . . . even the former Leader of the TULF, Mr. V. Anandasangaree has been provided with facilities in Colombo though he is not in Parliament. I explained that and we, as the Government, will continue to respect the Leader of the TNA in Parliament. The President has very clearly invited all to join hands with him in solving the issues that our country is facing. So, once again, I reiterate that position.

. 2020 22 " " . It states, I quote:

The CID yesterday informed the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court that an analysis of the phone recordings revealed that some people including former CID Director Shani Abeysekara and former Lake House Chairman Krishantha Cooray appeared to be involved in the alleged abduction incident of Swiss Embassy employee...

The reason why I am bringing it up is this. We know that there has been an issue involving an employee of the Swiss Embassy. This was consequent to an article that appeared in "The New York Times" on the 27th of November, 2019, which stated that the officials in Colombo said that the abductors forced her to unlock her cellphone data, which contained information about Sri Lankans who have recently sought asylum in Switzerland and the names of Sri Lankans who have aided them as they fled the country because they feared for their safety. So, the Government of Sri Lanka immediately got concerned about it because naturally, if this situation is true, the Government bears some responsibility for it. Whatever the facts of the case are, it is very clear that the Swiss Embassy has not really contradicted this, that a cellphone was taken and data was taken from that phone. That is absolutely clear.

While that investigation goes on, the concern I am raising today is that there is an attempt to slowly shift the focus to other individuals and say that those individuals have been responsible. So, the focus of the investigation has shifted to the former Chairman of the Lake House, a professional journalist, Mr. Krishantha Cooray, the former Editor of the "Sunday Observer", Darisha Bastian, and others. Why are they shifting the focus to them? We can see that there is such an attempt. Mr. Cooray is a responsible journalist who has been working in this country for a long time. If you remember the Keith Noyahr incident, where he was attacked by some people and left on the streets - Mr. Noyahr was working for "The Nation" newspaper - it was Mr. Cooray who actually came forward and defended him. So, we can see that there is a certain hand behind these things to discredit professional people, and these newspaper articles referred to their having connections with this Swiss Embassy lady. Investigations will show that they have had no such connections. There had been phone calls, which are referred to in the articles, between Mr. Krishantha Cooray and Darisha Bastian, who was the Editor of the "Sunday Observer" and that is only natural; the Chairman of the Lake House speaking to the Editor of a newspaper of the Lake House is only natural and normal.

So, why are they doing this? Why is this Government using the media to corner and frighten people? In the last four and a half years of our Government, not a single journalist in this country left the country because of fear, not a single person, not a single journalist was harmed, not a single person was killed or murdered and not a single one went missing. That was the environment our Government created over the last period. But, just two months after this Government coming into office, there are people who have had to leave the country because they are not sure whether they will be fairly treated. They

are professional people. You can imagine what is going to happen to the image of this country internationally if people are treated like this. For the flimsiest of excuses, they are being arrested. We saw Ministers of the previous Government such as the Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne and recently, the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake being arrested. I do not agree with the methods the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake used. But, I would like to tell the State Minister of Defence of this country that after the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayakes speech in Parliament yesterday, his life has to be protected and the Government must take responsibility for the environment it is creating. Darisha Bastian herself is a professional journalist who has been working for "The New York Times" as its local correspondent and has been working in this country for a long time. So, professionals must be protected.
