Then, Sir, I knew the Hon. Prince Casinader when he was in Parliament from 1989 to 1994. He came from the Batticaloa District, from a well-known family, the Casinader family, and had been a teacher there. He came to Parliament with the late Hon. Sam Tambimuttu. It was a loss for the Hon. Casinader when the Hon. Sam Tambimuttu and his wife were killed outside the Canadian Embassy. The Hon. Sam Thambimuttu was succeeded by the Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham. We all knew that the Hon. Sam Tambimuttu was killed by the LTTE. The LTTE also killed the Hon. A. Amirthalingam and the Hon. V. Yogeswaran. That was a very difficult time. The other victims included the late Hon. Gamini Dissanayake, the late Hon. Ranjan Wijeratne, the late President Premadasa and the late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Those were the years in which we had the biggest setback with the LTTE. Later, the Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham was also assassinated. Unfortunately, the Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham's assassins have still not been identified, as to who is responsible for it. But, the late Hon. Prince Casinader took a big interest in it.

Before coming to Parliament, the late Hon. Prince Casinader served in the Citizens Committee of Batticaloa. He was a very prominent person in putting forward the interests of the Batticaloa citizens and protecting them. I must say that he kept an active interest in Batticaloa until he died and the people of Batticaloa will remember him for the services he had rendered.

Thank you. [..12.17] ( , , ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena - Minister of Foreign Relations, Minister of Skills Development, Employment and Labour Relations and Leader of the House of Parliament) , . ,

Hon. Deputy Speaker, we are here today to pay tribute to four of our Hon. Members of Parliament with these Votes of Condolence.

One among them is the late Hon. Prince Casinader. Sir, it is with a deep sense of sorrow that I rise in this House to speak on the Vote of Condolence on the passing away of my dear and respected mentor from my younger days in Batticaloa. I consider it a privilege to pay my highest tribute to a person of the calibre of the late Hon. Prince Casinader, who was much more than a popular personality as far as Batticaloa is concerned, and he himself was an institution for more than half a century. As an educationist, a civil society leader cum human rights activist and a legislator, he served Batticaloa with immense passion and distinction.

He was born on 21st July, 1925. As one of the five siblings and like many other children of that era, Prince started his primary education at the St. Vincent Girls High School, Batticaloa and had a stint at the St. Cecilias Convent before settling in at the Methodist Central College. Hailing from a well-distinguished family in Batticaloa, the late Hon. Casinader had a great pride in his family heritage. He always loved and cherished his childhood memories and the times he spent with relatives and friends. His father Charles Brown Casinader wanted his bright son to pursue a legal career. However, fate designed a much nobler career path for Prince Casinader. Between 1948 to 1949, with the departure of the British, the newly independent Ceylon had a severe shortage of competent teachers of the English language. The then Principal of the Methodist Central College, late Mr. S.V.O. Somanader, impressed upon young Prince Casinader to join his teaching staff on a voluntary basis. Having started as a volunteer teacher, Prince Casinader then entered the Government Training College at Maharagama and returned to the Methodist Central College as a trained, qualified teacher in 1952. He dedicated his life and career to his Alma Mater and also to the public of Batticaloa. He had been serving as a teacher for four decades, except for a short stint at the Arasadi Methodist Mission, the Mahajana College of Batticaloa.

Under his purview, the Methodist College was transformed into the most disciplined school not only in Batticaloa, but was also considered as the most reputed school in the entire Island. It would not be an

381 382

exaggeration if one were to claim that it was under the late Hon. Prince Casinader that the accurate vision of Methodist missionaries, who were the founders, significantly materialized. In contrast to the elaborate establishment of the colonial era, the missionaries of Methodist Central College had a diverse concept and a different notion of grandeur. The missionaries were content with humble beginnings in simple buildings in order to produce great intellectuals. Sir, during his tenure, a rapid improvement and expansion of the school took place whilst continuing to maintain the tradition built up by an illustrious line of principals, dedicated teachers and loyal students of the school.

One of the activities that kept alive the spirit of school service and which helped instill discipline in boys was the Pathfinder Club, which functioned under the guidance of the Hon. Prince Casinader. The parents had the confidence that their children would come out as well-rounded citizens who will be productive in serving the future generation under Prince Casinaders nurturing. He was the ultimate disciplinarian, whose brand of tough love won over many hearts.

The Hon. Prince Casinader instilled a sense of pride and mindfulness towards duty in teachers and students alike. He was a strict disciplinarian led by example. His students ought to be proud that he devoted 35 years to the Methodist Central College as a teacher, a Deputy Principal and finishing off as the Principal of it. Sir, while reminiscing about his past career, I must mention the fact that the Hon. Casinader himself had admitted that he never dreamt that one day, he would be called upon to serve his Alma Mater as its Principal. But, when he was given the opportunity, he proved worthy of following the noble steps of illustrious men of that generation who did not merely sat on that chair, but adorned it with dedication and service.

During his tenure as Principal, he simultaneously wrote articles on a wide variety of topics for Sri Lankan dailies and the "Asiaweek". He was one of the delegates who represented Sri Lanka at the world conference of the Amnesty International held in Amsterdam and he had travelled around the world.

In one of his interviews to the BBC Radio 4 about Batticaloa, the Land of the Singing Fish, he described the research done on singing fish by Jesuit Fathers, the Swami Vipulananda Institute of Aesthetic Studies and the Science Navigators with the help of local fishermen in the muddy Lagoon of Batticaloa in the moonlight. The Hon. Casinader was of the view that the singing fish is a reality and not a myth and he took pride of this ancient historic symbol, the singing fish that emanated aquatic music.

Finally, when he retired in 1986, the Methodist Central College lost one of its brightest beacons. After his retirement, the Hon. Prince Casinader joined the Batticaloa Citizens Committee which served the people of Batticaloa at the height of political disturbances. He was a human rights defender who served people in dire

times. He also served as a member of the Board of Governors of the Eastern University of Sri Lanka.

Sir, in 1989, the Hon. Prince Casinader was elected as a Member of Parliament for the Batticaloa District and served Batticaloa with his usual charisma and devotion. In Parliament, he was truly an eloquent gentleman. His Parliamentary speeches on varied subjects were evidence of his extensive knowledge and he deployed his educational expertise to a great extent in the Parliamentary Consultative Committees, more specifically in steering the Committees on education towards improvement.

He was well known for his oratory skills in English and spoke his mother tongue with equal passion. His speeches were always combined with wit and humour, which kept his audience spellbound. Thus, the Parliamentary speeches he delivered were full of sense and substance. Sir, it is noteworthy that he had chaired Parliament occupying the Speakers Chair, where you are now seated, Sir, which was an honourable Privilege he officiated in a just and impartial manner and which was appreciated by the Hon. Members of the House on both sides.

It was during his tenure as a Member of Parliament that he still helped his school with the activities of the School Development Society, the Parent-Teacher Association, the Past Pupils' Association, the teachers and students. In celebrating the 175th Anniversary of the College, he gave his valuable advice and guidance to plan that anniversary programme to be a success and also made sure that a commemorative postage stamp was issued to mark that 175th Anniversary.

He lived amidst us fruitfully for 93 years and was called to eternal rest on the 12th of December, 2018. Although the late Hon. Prince Casinader was affectionately called Prince by his friends and Colleagues, he was a simple and humble man with unassuming ways and his qualities of geniality, generosity and humanness endeared him to all and sundry. His greatness lays in the fact that he was accessible to anyone at any time. He took a personal interest in his relationship with his friends and all those who sought his advice and guidance. His life was exemplary and was a blessing to all who associated with him. I have had the opportunity of associating with him during my school days while I was studying for GCE Advanced Level at St. Michael's College, Batticaloa as I got acquainted with his cousin, the late Mr. Kingsley Somanader, who was the then Principal of St. Michael's College.

Further, I closely associated with him in the 1980s as he was campaigning for civil rights and working towards creating peace and understanding among all communities and we had a mutual admiration towards each other. He served the multiethnic communities around him with great commitment and compassion, earning their honour and respect despite being rooted in the Christian faith. During this time, he gave leadership and voiced the plight of the innocent people many a time bringing solace.

I happened to visit the Hon. Prince Casinader at his residence at Love Lane, Batticaloa with the late Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer, before the latters demise, who was one of his contemporaries and another great admirer of his. There, I witnessed the exchange of pleasantries by these two retired Parliamentarians and the accurateness of their memories of many years interspersed with much wit and humour. As usual, he wittily said, I am a poor pensioner with a limited income. Though I am wrongly called 'Prince Casinader', I have no 'kaasi'. In Tamil, kaasi means money.

"Prince" had a lively mind even in his old age, though in the last few months before he passed away, he was feeling lonely and his health was deteriorating. As his daughters were domiciled overseas, his past students and relatives looked after him with much care and kept his spirits up until he left to his eternal abode.

The representatives of the Old Boys Association of the Methodist Central College, Mr. Ebenezer Darshan, President of the Old Boys Association, Mr. Paramasivan Muralitharan, Member of the Old Boys Association, Engineer D.A. Pragash, ex-President of the OBA and Mr. Sangarapillai Sashidaran, ex-President of the OBA are present here in the Gallery today on behalf of his family to witness this paying of tribute. The late Hon. Prince Casinaders daughters Praemini Gersmann and Sharmini Upasiri, who are domiciled overseas, could not be present in Parliament today.

I must put on record today that when I was there to pay my last respects to dear Prince Casinader, I witnessed a large representative gathering of mourners from all communities and from different walks of life - religious leaders, Parliamentarins, ex-Parliamentarians, provincial councillors, members of local government bodies, the past and present community of the Methodist Central College and loved ones from here and abroad - who came to pay thier last respects at his residence, at Cartman Hall of the Methodist Central College and also at the Alyadycholai Methodist Cemetery, and it was ample testimony of the affection they all had for him.

Let me express once again my heartfelt condolences to his daughters Praemini and Sharmini and all his loved ones. May the Alimighty God, the Greatest Comforter give strength to all of them to bear this immense loss!

With a deep appreciation of the life, career, leadership and contributions of the late Hon. Prince Casinader, I wish to conclude saying that he will be remembered in the annals of history of Sri Lanka and more specifically, in Batticaloa. He was Prince Casinader and will always remain the Prince of Batticaloa in our hearts.

Before I conclude, Sir, let me express my sincere condolences to the family members of the late Hon. C. Nanda Mathew, ex-Member of Parliament, the late Hon. (Dr.) Ranjith Atapattu, ex-Member of Parliament and also of the late Hon. M.S. Themis, ex-Member of Parliament. May these souls atain eternal peace!

Thank you, Sir.
