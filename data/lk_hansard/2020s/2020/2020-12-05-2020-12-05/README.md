LPL Jaffna Stallions , . , .

Sir, first of all, I would like to state in this House that I was elected to Parliament with the highest number of preferential votes in the Batticaloa District for the TNA. I am not a National List MP. I heard there were some rumours about me, saying that I was given a slot in the National List and a couple of Hon. Members came and asked me whether I was an MP from the National List. So, I have to put that on record.

I am very happy to speak today on this Committee Stage Discussion where we are discussing the Votes of the Ministry of Tourism, State Ministry of Aviation and Export Zone Development, Ministry of Ports and Shipping and the State Ministry of Warehouse Facilities, Container Yards, Port Supply Facilities and Boats and Shipping Industry Development. I am very happy to speak today because I feel that these areas really need to be given attention in the North and the East of Sri Lanka, because these areas really could help transform the economy of the North and the East.

I attended the Consultative Committee Meetings of both the Ports and Shipping Ministry and the Tourism Ministry and raised some questions there. It was very unfortunate to note that the present government officials were not aware of some of the projects that had been started by the previous government. When I raised some questions regarding the Talaimannar ferry service, I was told that it was something that was done in 2001. But, in fact, I have a letter here that was sent by the former State Minister of Tourism, the Hon. Ranjith Aluwihare to the Sri Lankan High Commissioner in India and also various meetings had been held within Sri Lanka as well with regard to restarting the Talaimannar ferry service. However, the officials were not really aware of those matters. So, I feel that it is really important that we look at the work that has been done by the previous government before we go ahead with any new proposals, because the resources that may have been spent on those projects would otherwise be a waste. So, irrespective of which government is in power now we need to look at the work that has been done by the previous government so that we can start from where we have stopped. Otherwise, if we start now, by the time the Governments term is over or if there is a Cabinet reshuffle, then there will be a new set of proposals. So, I would like to bring that to the Hon. Ministers attention.

Sir, the tourism industry is the fourth largest revenue earning industry in Sri Lanka. However, it is very sad that in the last two years, this industry had been hit really hard, initially, by the Easter Sunday attacks and then, because of the COVID-19. The Hon. Prasanna Ranatunga has been given a very tough task to restart this industry. I think he is a very capable Minister and he will be able to turn this around. We are very much willing to support the Hon. Minster in these endeavors by helping him identify resources and also supporting him to develop these resources in the North and the East.

At the Consultative Committee Meeting, they mentioned that there were some systems being looked at. When the Airport is open, large-scale hotels will be

2247 2248

2020 05

opened up. But, I would like to request the Hon. Minister and this House to look at a way where we can restart or support the economies of the people who are right at the bottom. For an example, I spoke to a gentleman recently. He had started a career in tourism with a three-wheeler 20 years ago. Then, he had gradually developed himself and about one ago - when the Easter Sunday attack happened - he had bought a car. He was very proud of it. He was calling himself, travel guy. But due the Easter Sunday attacks, he was unable to make his repayments and today he is back to square one - he is riding a three-wheeler. So, it is very unfortunate. This is happening to everybody. I know moratoriums, grace periods have been given by the banks and the borrowers can pay later in the future.

However, the interest needs to be paid. It has been two years now from the Easter Sunday attack. Even two years later, the industry has not picked up. So, how are these people going to run their businesses? So many backpackers were there. So many homestays were established. People have taken loans. All these industries are suffering. So, Hon. Minister, I would like you to look into this matter. I know it is a very hard challenge. It is not something easy. You are not a magician. I understand that, but I would like to request you to look into this matter. We are not a rich country. We cannot give out grants and dole out money. But, I am requesting you to appoint a team to look into what can be done to uplift the economy of these very small-scale businessmen.

Next, Sir, I would like to draw your attention to how we can develop some industries in the North and East of this country. I think one of the main things that need to be done is to increase the accessibility to the North and the East. Today, if you look at the South, the South has been developed to an unimaginable level. I think it is mainly due to the distance. So, if you look at Galle, it is only 100 kilometers from Colombo and with the Southern Expressway it is only one-hour drive now. If you look at from Colombo all the way up to Matara, Hambantota, these areas have been developed because of the Expressway. When I say these areas have been developed, I am not saying that major hotels have come up or major tourist zones have been created, but what I am trying to say is that the industry has gone right to the bottom. People from right at the bottom to hoteliers have made really good gains, whereas, if you look at the North and the East of this country, there is a very little development, because there is a very little accessibility.

If you look at a tourist who wants to travel to Jaffna and he is going to spend seven days in Sri Lanka, it will take one day to travel to Jaffna and one day to travel back to Colombo from Jaffna by road. It is the same with Batticaloa. I travel from Batticaloa everyday. I should be used to it after travelling seven to eight years, but even now it takes me half a day to recover after that journey. So, how is a tourist going to travel to Jaffna or to the Batticaloa District or to anywhere in the North and the East on a seven-day holiday? It is not acceptable. So, we need to increase the accessibility. There are so many ways that we can do that. The ferry service between Talaimannar and Rameswaran was a very lucrative

business back in the day. I still do not understand why we have not started it yet. The Talaimannar Railway Station has been completed. If we can start this ferry service between Talaimannar and Rameswaran, we can open our service to almost one billion Indians who would like to come to Sri Lanka. A ticket could even be priced at Rs.4,000 or Rs.5,000. How many tourists would come in then? I mean, they would support the local industry more than the tourists that we are getting now.

Look at the cargo services in Sri Lanka. Look at the free trade agreements we have. There are free trade agreements between Sri Lanka and India which we are not making use of. So, we need to develop these things. I am saying this because it is great that the Votes on the Ministry of Tourism and the Ministry of Ports and Shipping are taken up for Debate on the same day because they are all connected. So, if we can develop our ports, we can bring in more tourists, we can develop our exports, we can have export zones around it and so many things can be done.

Look at the Jaffna International Airport. I lived and worked in Australia. We used to get a 10-day holiday. As an expatriate, I used to get 10 days off. When I used to come to Sri Lanka, by the time I got here, I lost one day in travelling because of transits; then, on the way back, I lost another day in travelling on transits. When I travelled in Sri Lanka, I lost one day travelling to the North and the East, and then I lost one day travelling back to Colombo from the North and East. So, four days of my 10 days have gone. Then I needed one day each to rest. Technically, I only had a holiday of four days. So, people who live in the UK, Sri Lankan expatriates, also face this issue. So, you have to improve the accessibility to Jaffna. You have built an airport in Mattala. I do not know how many people use it. But if you had built an airport in Jaffna long time ago, I think, today we would not have these economic issues or we would have very few economic issues. Look at the Batticaloa Domestic Airport. The only planes that we get there are planes of Cinnamon Air or 17-seater planes. Why can we not have 40-seater planes? These sort of things need to be looked at. This is how we can develop the country.

Look at the train service. Because the former President was from Polonnaruwa, he developed the train service up to Polonnaruwa. Why can this train service not be extended to Batticaloa? I went to the Ministerial Consultative Committee Meeting yesterday when the Hon. Gamini Lokuge was also there. I raised this matter there and requested to upgrade the track. That is how you can bring tourists to the North and the East. Otherwise, how do they come and why should they come? Just to see a beach, they are not going to travel to Batticaloa; they can travel to somewhere in the South. So, we need to look at increasing accessibility to the North and the East to increase the number of tourists who travel there. I went to the COPE the other day because I am a member of that. For the Central Expressway, they said, there has been a feasibility study done for Rs. 1.5 billion and that feasibility study had not been used. But to develop an airport in Jaffna or to develop Mannar, there is no money. What is this?

2249 2250

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Speaker will now take the Chair. , [ ] . , , [ ] . Whereupon THE HON. SPEAKER left the Chair, and DEPUTY SPEAKER [THE HON. RANJITH SIYAMBALAPITIYA] took the Chair. ( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) Sir, I would like to start from where I stopped. I was saying that we should develop the accessibility to the North and the East. Let us say we finally got tourists to come to the North and the East. But, what is there to be done in the North and the East? That is the next question that we would like to address. Look at Batticaloa. Sometimes when my friends come there, they used to stay at Pasikuda. When they tell me, ", ? , Batticaloa District .", then, I am scared because if we leave around 9 o'clock, by 12 oclock we would be back at the hotel. So, I try delaying it and say, "After breakfast, you go to Batticaloa town, get on to a boat near the Lighthouse, then you can have a tour and see the Batticaloa Fort, Batticaloa Gate, Kallady Bridge and come back to the hotel. The "singing fish" used to be there a long time ago but we cannot hear them any more. We need to create opportunities in Batticaloa. Look at the resources we have in Batticaloa. Batticaloa has a lagoon that is nearly 80 kilometres long. I do not know how many people are aware of it. It has got the same atmosphere as Kerala. People travel to Kerala just to go on houseboats. Why have we not done that? Why can we not look at that?

There is an island called Manthivu which housed lepers long ago. When leprosy was a very big pandemic in Sri Lanka, leprosy patients were kept in that island. There are cottages there and there is a hospital, which they tried to take over to treat COVID patients. We opposed it. Thank God, it did not end up becoming that. It is an island which is home to so many migratory birds. Recently, there was a tourist who had come and he said there were flamingoes there. I was surprised, I did not know there were flamingoes there. There are so many migratory birds there. There are so many buildings there. Why can we not renovate those buildings? That is the reason why people do not want to come to Batticaloa.

Does Sri Lanka has a single theme park? Do we have a single theme park? I know the Leisure World Water Park is there. Look at Gold Coast in Australia. People travel there just to enjoy its theme parks. When I was a kid, I went to Singapore. I was taken to Sentosa Island, was there for three days and had a good time. I did not see even the rest of Singapore, I came back. We need to generate ideas like this to develop the North and the East.

I am not just saying the North and the East, we can have theme parks anywhere in Sri Lanka. But, I am specifically speaking about the North and the East because people visit the other parts of the country. Now if you take Polonnaruwa, people will go there to see the ruins; Sigiriya, people will go to climb the Rock; Kandy, people will go to visit Sri Dalada Maligawa. Why would someone not come to the North and the East? We are not developing even the resources that we have. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Gamini Lokuge - Minister of Transport) What about the temples? ( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) That is exactly right, Sir. Right now, the temples, the Archaeology Department is more interested in land grabbing, not developing them as tourist sites - which is our issue as well. Hon. Minister, thanks for mentioning that. Archaeology Department , - I think her name is Nilu Thennakoon. I brought that to the attention of the State Minister, Hon. Vidura Wickramanayaka.- " 40 , 400 ". . , " Archaeology Department . 500 . 40 , 400 " . I mean, who has given her the power? She is telling me " " . Archaeology Department is more interested in land grabbing than developing temples as tourist sites. Thank you, Hon. Minister, for reminding me that.

There are so many things we can develop. There is no golf course in the North. Why do you not look at that? Now, what is the Government doing? They want to create some tourist zones. But instead of creating tourist zones, what normally happens is land grabbing. I would like to draw your attention to something that happened in Pasikuda. In 2010, lands belonging to Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority were handed over - doled out - to God knows who. They were sold for Rs. one billion. I know who - but they never went for proper investors; politicians took them in 2010 and sold them for exorbitant prices. In 2010, this was sold. I know some people who owned them. I do not want that to happen again in the North and the East. But, I think that is what is going to happen. I have got a report from the Director General of Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority which states, "Development of Kuchchaweli Beach Resort", "Medway Estate in Trincomalee", "Rasol Thottam land in Trincomalee" and "Mannar". You know, 74 acres in one place, 21.57 acres in another place, all these places have been leased out. They have been identified as potential places for tourism. I mean, why are you all worrying about the lands? Leave the lands aside, bring investments. Investments do not mean bringing in hotels. People will come, some multinational companies will come and build hotels. , Pasikuda has nearly 20 hotels. But, if we go

2251 2252

2020 05

inside and ask them, "Who is working there?", they would say, We brought people from Colombo", "We brought people from Kandy et cetera. Once, when I asked them, "Why?", they said, "We do not have skilled workers here. garden " . These beautiful beaches have been given over to multinational companies. Even Sri Lankans from anywhere else cannot come and enjoy these beaches because these multinational companies have put security guards on the beach and they are blocked off to the public. Someone is robbing us. They say that they do not have skilled labour in Batticaloa. So, I asked as to why we do not develop skilled labour.

Then, I looked at the Progress Report of the Ministry of Tourism on which in the year of 2018, in Jaffna, there had been 12 students in the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management. In 2019, there had been 23. In 2020, there have been 36. In Pasikuda, 51 in 2018, 94 in 2019 and 37 in 2020. Do not blame saying this happened during Yahapalana Government and all that. Whatever government that is in power, it is responsible. How are you going to develop skill then? Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management does not have any people from the North and the East. So what is happening instead? I mean, land grabbing is happening. What is happening instead in this country? Instead of developing these, what is happening?

In this country, what is happening right now is that this Government is trying to create unnecessary issues to cover up their inabilities.

You are arresting people for putting a Facebook post. I think why it has been done is, it is Government's policy to cover up their inabilities. This failing economy, - I mean, we are not blaming this Government. We are not pointing fingers at this Government and saying that this Government should turn things around. I mean COVID-19 is a pandemic that is affecting the world, we understand that. Why are you all trying to cover up your inabilities by doing such things?

Look at the other things that have been done. War cemeteries have been destroyed. When I say, war cemeteries, now it is a cemetery. Take war aside, who touches a cemetery? I mean, how bad is that? How dare you touch a cemetery? Are you that scared? Why would you touch a cemetery? Look at the things that have been

done. Sir, 29th of last month is a Festival of Lights -

. I wish the Hon. Minister of Public Security is here. He is being jumping up every day for every single persons comment. Unfortunately, he is not here. The police forces have destroyed the festival. Some temples had been decorated with lights, with little candles. Festival of Lights - - has been destroyed. I will tell you why. Because this Government, , . , . ! ? .. , ", ? .. . . " . This is all nonsense; There is no issue in this country. You all are creating an issue. Because you are not able to manage this country, you are creating issues. This is how Zaharan was created. I will tell you. You are pointing fingers at Muslim politicians and innocent Muslims in this country. How did the Easter Sunday attack happen? It happened because you all created Zahran. I do not know which government; one of the governments created Zahran.

I read one of the investigations with regard to Aluthgama attack. Easter Sunday attack , attack .

When you keep on attacking the minorities like this, what is going to happen? Naturally, they are going to react in some way. Maybe, they were exploited by some other force. Naturally, someone is going to use them. So, why was the Aluthgama incident created? Who created that? Then, look at the issues came up after that. . [Interruption.] I will come to that later. What is this? You are creating an unnecessary unrest in this country to cover up your inabilities.

Now, look at what is happening. The Hon. Minister said that we should be ashamed. I am ashamed as a Sri Lankan today. Look at the Muslims. What are they asking for? They are asking for their last rites. They are asking for the janazahs to be buried. These innocent Muslim people live all their lives according to the Quran, and right towards the end, you are taking away their last rites for politics. You should be ashamed. I am ashamed. I am ashamed of all the Muslim politicians who supported this Government for the Twentieth Amendment.

People are going to courts; minorities are going to courts. Why? For what are they going to courts? For their basic rights. They are going to courts because you are not letting them bury their bodies. Tamil people are going to courts for fundamental rights. I went to courts in Batticaloa. Why? Because there was a mother who wanted to light up a lamp in remembrance of her son. A father wanted to light up a lamp in remembrance of his son. For you all, he may be an LTTEyer. For us it is a different thing. But for a mother, that is her son. For her, it does not matter whether he is an LTTEyer or not - that is her Son. . . Why can you not respect that? Tamils are going to courts to remember their dead; Muslims are going to courts to burry their dead.

Look at the Catholic community in this country. We saw many debates about the Cardinal now. The Cardinal is begging for justice to be done to his dead. So, this is the point that this country has come to. We should be ashamed. The Hon. Minister of Public Security, was talking about - , . , . We have to worry about the Chinese investments. The Hon. Minister of Ports and Shipping is here. We have to worry about Chinese investments. China is investing very heavily in ports. Do you want to be another Pakistan? Do you want to be another Laos? We are getting into Chinese deathtrap. Tell the Sinhala people about this. . . , . . Tell them. If you are so gutsy, go in front of the Sinhala community; . . Tell me the number of jobs that the Chinese have created in this country. Tell me the number of jobs. A lot of Chinese investments have come in. What happens? Chinese come and work here. They are investing; they will take their money and leave. Do you think, Port City is being built because they love us? Port City ? ? No! Port City is being built because they want a base in South East Asia in the Indian Ocean; not because they love us. We are allowing that. But what are we doing to do? . .. , , . .

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) . [ ] ( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) It is a shame on this Government. We do not want to be a Chinese colony. We know, in this country, Muslims are going to court; Catholics are asking for justice and Tamils are asking for - [Interruption.] Hon. Leader of the House, get your people in order. Get your people in order. These are not MPs. Who are these fellows? Have you brought them here just to do this? Let them make a point in Parliament. [Interruption.] Behave yourself. What is the language that you use?[Interruption.]

In conclusion, it is behaviour like this, that strengthens us. [Interruption.] Thank you. When you behave like this, it strengthens our cause. It strengthens our cause. Stop raising about the war. Stop harping on the war. War was finished eleven years ago. , , ,- [ ] ( ) (An Hon. Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Udayana Kirindigoda) ,- ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) , . ( ) (The Hon. Udayana Kirindigoda) , , , . ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) . . ( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Chairman, how are you allowing these points of order to be raised? I mean, you should have a meeting with them to teach what the points of Order are. This is absurd. I do not know how much time I have left, Sir?

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) You have two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) No, I have four minutes, Sir. Let me have four minutes to finish this.

Anyway, I wanted to say more things but I have been disturbed like this. The day before yesterday, the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam said something very important. He said, You might succeed one day in completely destroying us, if you keep going at this pace. But, I would like to tell you something. It has taken 72 years and you still have not been able to destroy our voices. Even if if you take another 75 years, you all will not be able to destroy our voices. What you will destroy is, you will destroy this country. This country will go back. We will all get destroyed. Come, let us join hands in getting destroyed, if that is what you want. If you want to get destroyed, let us join hands. [Interruption.] Worry about the Chinese. Do not worry about us. Do not worry about us, worry about the Chinese because you have been hitting us so hard.

Actually, I would like to say something that my grandfather had said in this Parliament in 1969. Hon. Chairman, I am ashamed that, 70 years later, this speech is still relevant. My late grandfather was a Leader of the Federal Party at one point. He was a Member of Parliament from 1952 to 1970. Sir, I will finish my speech after this quotation.

He said, Mr. Speaker, the Federal Party has existed for more than 20 years. Our objectives, our ideals are our goals. Our scientific theory has been that this country should have a federal form of government. Now, why do we say that? We are supposed to have a democratic form of government. Democracy is one of the very loose words that is used for a concept and a form of government, which sometimes exists and sometimes does not exist in the theoretical form.

I do not want to read the whole thing. But this speech is still very relevant after 70 years. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) , . 29 . . ( ) (The Hon. Shanakiyan Rajaputhiran Rasamanickam) I will finish up with one last saying, Sir. Hatred cannot be removed by hatred, but love. You all boast that this is a Sinhala Buddhist county. But you can not even allow Tamil men to speak. If this is a Sinhala Buddhist country,

2257 2258

you have to love people without disturbing like this. If you are a Sinhala Buddhist country, and if you are a Buddhist, first learn to respect human beings. Learn to respect human beings. Thank you.

I wish you Hon. Minister and the Hon. State Minister, and also Ms. Kimarli Fernando - the Chairperson, and all the others well, and hope you find a solution, and we will extend all our support.

. . , , . . . , . ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 9 . [3.59. p.m.] () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Kavinda Heshan Jayawardhana) Thank you very much, Mr. Presiding Member.

It is a privilege to address this House today on the Votes of a very important Ministry, the Ministry of Ports and Shipping. I would like to bring to the Hon. Ministers attention about the development of East Container Terminal - ECT - for which a MoU was singed by the former Government with the Indian and the Japanese investors. Speaking of India, India is our neighbouring country with which we have shared our heritage, history and culture. India, being a nation who has invested in Sri Lanka, given us grants including humanitarian aids. Yet, they have not taken any of our properties or tried to intervene in internal politics of Sri Lanka. Likewise, Japan has also given us so many grants and assistance. I think, this is a very positive investment and a project. Therefore, my opinion is that the Hon. Minister needs to consider this because through this project, Sri Lankans will get job opportunities and it will help the growth of Colombo Port.

As we all know, the East Container Terminal is a deep-sea container terminal. The other port that we have is the Hambantota Port, for the construction of which we obtained a loan from China, but at the same time, we could not repay that. So, we are still trying to come out of it and we have given it on long-term lease to China. Therefore, I think the development of the ECT is a good venture. We should take it very positively and see it as a national project.

Likewise, Hon. Minister, I would like to raise another very important issue as a Catholic Member, who is not a racist. We have a very sacred and historic place for Catholics called, Kurusakanda in Trincomalee.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. S.M.M. Muszhaaraff) Hon. Presiding Member, thank you for the opportunity given to me to contribute by adding my remarks to the Committee Stage Discussions on the Votes of the Ministry of Tourism in the Budget, 2021.

As we all know, COVID-19 pandemic has hit the tourism industry along with many other sectors all over the globe. The impact of COVID-19 on our communities is severe. It was painful and emotional when adults are suffering, and it is not only about communities, but also, I am sure it is the same in various other sectors. The impact of COVID-19 on economy and negative emotions is deep. However, we need to set ourselves ready to face the most decisive situation of the 21st Century with the firm idea of rebuilding the tourism industry and moving towards a safer and more sustainable tourism. The Government should innovate ways to promote the tourist industry among the local tourists with the proper health and safety protocols, while global tourism is getting back to normal. There should be a way to provide the agility demanded by new travel trends emerging from COVID-19.

Sir, I represent the Digamadulla Electoral District and my hometown is Pottuvil, where the Arugam Bay is situated. Arugam Bay is a well-known tourist destination. It is one of the Worlds best surf destinations, and also recognized as a tourist zone in the East coast of Sri Lanka. Many people in my constituency depend on the earnings from tourism throughout the year. But, due to COVID-19 pandemic, people - I mean, not only the people who are directly engaged in tourism, but the people from other sectors who are interconnected with tourism - are facing hardships for their day-to-day survival.

The fear of hunger seems greater now than the fear of COVID-19. Many need tourism to save their livelihoods. According to the SLTDA, there were 402,607 direct and indirect employment opportunities created in 2019, last year alone. From this number, we can assume that most of them may have lost their jobs due to this pandemic. What are the plans of the Government for these people to uplift their livelihood? As I said, this is a crucial time in the history of the world. But, we cannot just ignore this fact. We need to work together to uplift peoples lives as it is a vital role of democracy. I am here to represent my people.

Sir, while welcoming the relief package given by the Government of Sri Lanka and in view of the second wave of the epidemic, which has now hit all across the Island, the Chamber of Tourism and Industry would like to urge the Government to consider further relief to the stakeholders in the tourism industry. Firstly, tour guides and tourist drivers were given a relief package as a one-time payment of Rs. 20,000 and Rs. 15,000 respectively. Since there has been no tourist business happening, I would like to suggest the same payment to be continued for another six months till the tourism industry resumes operations.

Secondly, tourist hotels around the Island are the biggest hit due to the outbreak. Therefore, a moratorium on loans and vehicle leasing payments was given to the tourism sector for one year. Since there has not been any improvement in the industry, it is suggested that the moratorium to be extended by further one year. Although there was a relief given in the capital payment, the banks have been charging interest payments and they have been paying an interest rate from 9 per cent to 15 per cent. Therefore, it is suggested to remove totally the interest payments or to reduce interest rates to 4 per cent. Although some of the employees in hotels and travel sector are EPF and ETF holders, majority of them who are on contract basis or on temporary category do not receive any compensation from the State. Therefore, it is suggested that a suitable scheme to be worked out to support those who are not covered by the EPF, ETF schemes. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. Please wind up now. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. S.M.M. Muszhaaraff) Sir, please give me one more minute.

Sri Lanka has 12 domestic flight operators whose flights are already grounded. So, it is requested to extend the financial relief offered to them till normalcy returns.

I would also like to remind you that there is a drinking water issue in Arugam Bay area. Most of the ground water is salty in Arugam Bay. So, we are connected to Water Board of Arugam Bay, but, they give the water supply for only 30 minutes per day. Therefore, it is very difficult to manage tourist activities in this area. We also have a shortage with regard to street lights. There is no proper street light installation. There is no proper street light system in Arugam Bay tourism zone. Due to this issue, most tourists face a lot of problems, especially in internal access roads at night. The Tourism Association has sent many requests to the particular officials to take necessary action to solve these issues, but still they have not taken necessary action. Therefore, Hon. Minister, we humbly request you to take necessary action to solve the above mentioned issues through your good office and other relevant officials as soon as possible. Thank you very much.
