Sit down. ( ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal)I know it is difficult for you all to fathom it because you all finished with a 3.7 - [Interruption.] Please listen. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) You are trying to distract the Hon. Minister unreasonably. ( ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal)I am giving facts and figures from the Report of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. So, if you have a problem with that, please go and fight with them. Please do not interrupt me. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Please stop that. ( ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal)Sir, we have had a growth of just 3.7 per cent during the period of Yahapalanaya. That was all. During the period of the regime prior to theirs, during President Mahinda Rajapaksas regime, the average annual growth was 6.8 per cent. That is why they are upset about it. Naturally, they are upset about it; they have to be upset about it. - [Interruption.] So, I cannot help that.

Now, we are getting the country back on the growth track and we have given a firm commitment to our investors, that even with the difficulties we are facing, even with the lesser amount of reserves we have inherited, we will still honour all our debts, and we will continue to do that, Hon. Speaker.

Now, I will come to the rest of the Question raised by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition.

Speaker, because a point was raised regarding the Bonds, I would like to say that there was a forensic audit initiated by the former President and that forensic audit report states that there was a loss of at least Rs. 19 billion to the Treasury during the period 2002 to 2015, and a primary and secondary market transaction of EPF and ETF between that same period. Rs. 19 billion. - [Interruption.] I want to know who was the Governor during most of that time? Who was responsible for that? - [Interruption.] This is a Presidential Commission Report. What do you say to that? , Bond ! ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Okay, now you raised the question. Hon. State Minister, you go ahead. ( ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal)I will answer. Hon. Speaker, I have written an extensive book with more than 350 pages titled The Great Bond Scam Cover-up. All these matters are discussed in it. I have tabled that particular book and it is in the Library. So, I am asking the Hon. Kabir Hashim to go to the Library and read that book. You will get the answer.
