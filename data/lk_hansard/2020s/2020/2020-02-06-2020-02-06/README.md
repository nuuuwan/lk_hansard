[3.06 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Madam Presiding Member, my submissions are regarding the two Orders under the Value Added Tax Act. I would like to mention that some time ago, certain officials who were appointed to the Sri Lanka Tourist Board made remarks saying that the previous Government did not do enough or anything to develop tourism. I want to refute that by saying that it was in 2018 that the largest number of tourists came to Sri Lanka in the history of tourism amounting to 2.33 million. In 2015, after we took over, it was 1.8 million tourist arrivals; in 2016, it was 2.05 million and in 2018, as I mentioned earlier, it was 2.33 million. With that, the total income the country received was US Dollars 4.3 billion or US Dollars 4,380.6 million. In 2019, up to April, the number of tourist arrivals was 907,575. When the Easter Sunday blast took place, our aspiration to reach 2.5 million arrivals was also blasted.

So, what I want to say is that the previous regime did a lot of exercises in order to achieve this objective of getting the largest number of tourists into the country, bringing in a large amount of foreign exchange. For that, we made great strides in promoting Sri Lanka, both overseas and locally, resulting in receiving the following accolades or recommendations from the international agencies: The Lonely Planet, the global authority on tourism and travel, announced Sri Lanka as "the Best Global Destination to Travel in 2019. Those were the recommendations which came from those international agencies. A UK travel association also announced that the Best Long Haul Destination for Family Travel in 2018 was Sri Lanka. That was another recommendation. The National Geographic Traveler also named Sri Lanka on its Cool List of 2018. Then, the Australian edition of Virtuoso Luxe Report also mentioned that Sri Lanka was among the five best popular destinations for Aussies to travel. Similarly, all these international agencies were recommending Sri Lanka to be the best place to visit in 2019 also. But, very unfortunately, the Easter Sunday blast took place and that brought down the numbers. However, it ended up with nearly 2 million tourists with all the problems that we had to face in 2019.

Now, because I have a very little time, I will just mention very briefly the promotional programmes that we had embarked on. A digital campaign was launched with US Dollars 3.5 million in five key markets - India, China, UK, France, Germany - which gave ample publicity about the opportunities that are available in Sri Lanka. Then, we launched a new logo and a brand identity for Sri Lanka at WTM - SO Sri Lanka. Also, an advertising campaign in the CNN was just concluded. A global promotional campaign was launched in March, 2019. But, though we did that, unfortunately, we could not get the results due to the blast. Then, a campaign named Island Escapes was mooted to promote Sri Lanka during the off season months, in collaboration with airlines, hoteliers and travel agents in Sri Lanka. A lot of concessions were given to attract tourists. In addition to participating in seven major travel fairs in the world, the SLTPB had also participated in other annual fairs, roadshows and tourism-related events. But, now, all these things have been suspended. So, how can you develop tourism? You have to allow the officials to participate in these campaigns; the Ministers must visit those fairs. Also in 2018, 47 bloggers and 80 journalists from Europe, USA, Canada, UK and the rest of the world were hosted by Sri Lanka. I mentioned all this to show the amount of work that had been done by us and the dividends paid to Sri Lanka, as a result.

The President is very keen to develop tourism. In his Manifesto, he has very clearly stated that he hopes to bring the tourist arrivals up to 10 million. Very good. As a person who has associated with tourism, I am very much thankful to the President that he has a vision and the fact that he wants to bring the earnings up to US Dollars 10 billion is very good. Sri Lanka is the best tourist destination. Of course, you must have the country's current situation known to the world, make sure that no further bomb attacks would take place and the viruses that have caused all these problems would not

229 230

spread in the country. I hope those viruses would be controlled and contained. I must say that we should not give much publicity that there are virus victims in Sri Lanka. Everyday, I see it in the newspapers and other news media. When you do that, the people who want to come here also will not come. They will cancel their destination programmes.

Therefore, I strongly urge the Government to concentrate on tourism. This is the best bet for the economy because without any imports, you get foreign exchange. Not only that, it also creates enough employment for the younger generation, on one side and also bring an income to the Government and to the local producers, on the other. Thank you.

-[ ] . . Sir, I want to make the point that when it comes to appointments, appointing fit and proper persons should apply not only to government institutions but even to the Judiciary. I have to raise this point even reluctantly because it relates to the Judiciary, and I am concerned that all appointments to the Judiciary should be the best appointments. For example, recently, the Constitutional Council has approved the appointment of a person as President of the Court of Appeal. Actually, there is a case before the court against that particular Judge and the former Attorney-General Mohan Peiris. That case is pending. I am sure the Constitutional Council, in considering this appointment, may have taken the view that the case is still not proven and therefore, the individuals are not guilty and should not be excluded. I am sure they may have taken that view. That is the reason, I think, why the appointments have been made. But, when it comes to the Judiciary, we need to be far above that; our expectations should be far above that. The people of unquestionable integrity should only be considered for such appointments.

The allegations were about some transaction with LECO and it was argued whether that was sort of a commercial fraud. It is a complicated matter and I will

not go into that. The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption filed a report in the Magistrate's Court that those two individuals should be charged for corruption. We do not know the truth about this and are not in a position to know about it either. But the fact of the matter is, there is an institutional case. Then, the two individuals go to the Supreme Court and get a Stay Order. But, the case is still pending. So, how can the public have trust in the Judiciary? It is not a question of innocence until proven guilty. It is a question of judicial appointments; it is about judges of whom there should be no suspicion at all and whose integrity should not be in question. Some are raising this. Certainly, independence means they should not be made to earn their post-retirement.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya - State Minister of Social Security) Does that not imply that the Constitutional Council is either incompetent or they have failed?

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I would not make any judgement on the individuals in the Constitutional Council. I do not look at the individuals, but basically at the processes. There are good processes and good checks and balances. They will obviously be more successful, if the right people are appointed. That is why I am raising it.

Then, I am raising a further point on appointments. - - . ? . . . . . . ; . . ? . . ; a cooling-off period should be given. That is a policy that must be adopted by all Sri Lankan Governments, present and future. Cooling-off period . . .
