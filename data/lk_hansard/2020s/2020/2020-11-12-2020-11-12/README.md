[11.44 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to speak today on this very strange Bill that we are debating. It is called Appropriation Bill, 2020 and we are debating it in the month of November, 2020. Before I get to the subject matter, I wish to, at the outset, say that when I spoke on the Second Reading of the Budget Debates in the years 2010 to 2015, I criticized the fact that the then President - todays Prime Minister and Minister of Finance - held the portfolio of Finance on the basis that a person who was not directly responsible to Parliament held the portfolio of Finance and that it did not accord with the principles enunciated in our Constitution. I am glad that today the situation is different and the Prime Minister, who is accountable to Parliament, holds that portfolio. Nevertheless, that is spoilt by the fact that he is the brother of His Excellency the President.

The Bill that is before us is not only a strange Bill, but it is also an act to cover up various illegalities that had been perpetrated in this country. Why do I say that? An Appropriation Bill must be debated and approved prior to the financial year for which it applies. It is only then that the Executive obtains the approval of Parliament to draw from the Consolidated Fund, borrow and generally administer the finances of the country. Article 148 of our Constitution very clearly states, I quote:

Parliament shall have full control over public finance. No tax, rate or any other levy shall be imposed by any local authority or any other public authority, except by or under the authority of a law passed by Parliament or of any existing law.

So, until now, there is no law passed for the Financial Year 2020 which the Parliament has approved. There is no law. What was approved were certain Resolutions under Article 150.(2). Those Resolutions do not permit levying of taxes or borrowing by the Government. I will read out Article 150.(2) and then, I will come to Article 150.(3), which is important for todays Debate. Article 150.(2) states, I quote:

No such warrant shall be issued unless the sum has by resolution of Parliament or by any law been granted for specified public services for the financial year during which the withdrawal is to take place or is otherwise lawfully, charged on the Consolidated Fund.

So, what can a Resolution under 150.(2) authorize? It can only authorize the drawing from the Consolidated Fund such sums of money that are necessary for specified public services only. So, that too, it is stated in Article 150 (2), is for specified public services only.

2099 2100

You cannot do any developmental work. You can only pay salaries of public servants and other expenditure directly related to public services. That is all a Resolution under Article 150.(2) can do.

During this Financial Year, we have had two such Resolutions passed. One, covering the period from 01st January, 2020 until 30th April, 2020, which was passed in October last year and then another, covering the period from 01st September, 2020 to 31st December, 2020. So, even those two Resolutions passed by this House can only be used to pay for specified public services and not for anything else.

All of us know that that is not how finances have been handled in the country for this year. There has been a severe need to make payments to spend and make grants to the general public who were affected in several areas in the whole country. People were given Rs. 5,000 in the months of April and May, but none of those are public services. But, all those expenditure was done; those expenses were met. Developmental activity was also carried out. All this is in violation of the very strict limitation imposed by the provision in the Constitution, which states for "specified public services only. So, there was a blatant violation of a limitation in the Constitution by this Government, and what is worse? For the period from 01st May to 31st August, there was no Resolution under Article 150 (2).

Sir, what the Hon. Minister of Finance stated today is that twice the President, acting under Article 150. (3), authorized expenses. What does Article 150.(3) states? I quote:

Where the President dissolves Parliament before the Appropriation Bill for the financial year has passed into law, he may, unless Parliament shall have already made provision, authorize the issue from the Consolidated Fund and the expenditure of such sums as he may consider necessary for the public services.

Again, he can only authorize spending for public services. It goes on to state,

..until the expiry of a period of three months from the date on which the new Parliament is summoned to meet.

Originally, the new Parliament was summoned to meet on the 14th of May, 2020. Thereafter, after the Election Commission postponed the elections, it was put off until the 20th of August, 2020. Nevertheless, the very limited authority that the Constitution gives the President is, during a period of dissolution, he can authorize, but he can authorize only for expenditure for public services and nothing else. So, there are two issues here. He can authorize for expenditure, but that must be limited only for public services, not for anything else. If you look at the Bill before us, that has all kinds of developmental activities specified. Bad it is that this is coming in the month of November for this Financial Year, it is blatantly revealing to us that what has been expended is far beyond the authority that the Constitution gives the President and the authority that the Constitution gives even this House when it acts under Article 150.(2).

So, what are we doing today? We are trying to legitimize grave, illegal and unconstitutional acts that have been perpetrated in this country. Appropriation Bill, 2020 that is before the House today is not a covering approval; it is not a ratification. A ratification or a covering approval can only be something that is done legally. If something is done legally, then you can ratify it. If something is done legally, then you can grant covering approval for it, but no illegality can have a covering approval or a ratification.

So, that is the sorry state that we are in, in this country today debating a Bill which is blatantly for the purpose of covering up illegalities. The very reason that the Government has presented a Bill called Appropriation Bill, 2020 confirms that the Government concedes that there is an illegality that needs to be covered up. All of these periods are covered, the Hon. Minister of Finance says. There were four Resolutions: two, under Article 150.(2) and another two, under Article 150. (3). So, why do you need an Appropriation Bill? If those are legal, why do you need an Appropriation Bill? The very fact that you have brought an Appropriation Bill at the tail end of the Financial Year unprecedentedly seeking what you call a covering approval is to cover up illegalities.

Sir, I started by saying we are debating a strange Bill, but it is not so strange considering what the Government is anyway doing today. We were told of a royal decree last night signed off by the Army Commander in his capacity as Army Commander, saying no persons will be allowed to leave the Western Province with immediate effect until the midnight of the 15th of November. Under what law, may I ask you, can the Army Commander make such an order? Can anyone in the Government answer me? Under what law can the Army Commander make such a decree? This sounds like a royal decree and his loyal master or the king is announcing it to the public. That is how things are done in this country today. Wholly and totally illegal acts are being blatantly published.

Sir, when COVID-19 struck - we came to know of it in the month of March - several of us in the Opposition asked for a reconvening of Parliament. We even went to the Supreme Court asking for reconvening of Parliament because one of the reasons, we urged, was that Parliament had total control of public finances and that in order to meet this unprecedented threat, Parliament had to authorize expenditure amongst other things like the curfew. We hear of quarantine curfew. Wherever did you see that phrase "quarantine curfew"? The law does not recognize any such thing.

The Public Health Inspectors' - PHIs' - Union called for tougher legislation to prevent COVID-19 spread long ago. I have the newspaper article from the Daily FT of 18th March, 2020 titled "PHIs call for newer and tougher legislation to prevent COVID-19 spread." Sir, I table* that.

2101 2102

So, they said the country needs new laws. They said the Quarantine Law is 123 years old; the Quarantine and Prevention of Diseases Ordinance is over 100 years old. One was enacted for cholera and the other, for smallpox, not for a spread of a disease like COVID-19. So, we asked for Parliament to be reconvened to authorize spending of public expenditure for various other reasons. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court heard this petition to grant leave to proceed for ten full days and refused leave without assigning any reasons. That is also unprecedented. Ordinarily, as a regular practitioner in the Supreme Court, I can say that within about ten minutes, they decide whether leave to proceed ought to be granted or not. If there is anything to be looked into, leave to proceed is granted. That is decided within ten, twenty minutes. You do not hear a matter for 10 full days. We sat till 5.00 p.m. on some days. They took 10 full days and then decided that there was nothing to look into. Such a joke, I regret to say! Parliament exercises judicial power through courts. So, it is here that we can even make remarks about that. Unfortunately, the Government stubbornly refused to reconvene Parliament and therefore, we were put into this spot where expenditure was being made without proper authorization by Parliament.

Not only that, something else also happened. The Government borrowed. Under Article 150, either under 150. (2) or 150. (3), of the Constitution, there is no talk of Government being able to borrow. Under that, there is no talk of Government being able to borrow anything, but the Government did borrow. Already, the Government has borrowed. By what authority? No authority at all. They printed money, just minted money in order to meet this.

As I conclude, Sir, I want to say this. The rule of law, it has been said, is the bedrock of this country. Rule by law is also not desirable. But, what we have is something far worse. It is rule by Executive diktats! That is what we have today.

Three Hon. Members of this House have been prevented from attending the Sittings for the reason that they are in remand prison. That maybe a good thing. Nevertheless, their right to attend Parliament has been recognized and if there is a Vote taken, they will be brought here. But, whilst that is the rule prevailing here, one of the Hon. Members of this Parliament, the Hon. Sivanesathurai Santhirakanthan, was seen chairing a DCC meeting in Batticaloa two days ago. He was seen opening an office building yesterday in Batticaloa. How does that happen? A Member who is in remand having a right to attend this House is another matter. That happens as a result of a Ruling by the Chair here. But, how does he go about chairing DCC meetings and attending functions like opening of office buildings?

Sir, I say that today is a sad day when this House has taken up for debate something wholly unprecedented, an Appropriation Bill for a year that has gone by. We will not participate in the passage of this legislation when it is taken up at 5.00 p.m. this afternoon.

Thank you.

Next, the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne. You have 13 minutes.

[1.45 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I take this opportunity, when the Appropriation Bill, 2020 is being debated in Parliament, to say first that this is a very unusual situation where an Appropriation Bill of a particular financial year has been presented at the end of that year.

We must not forget that we elected a President in this country at the Presidential Election on November 16th and that President actually had the opportunity to present a Budget in this Parliament, but he did not make use of that. Often, the excuse that had been made was that there was a minority Government. But, there had been minority governments across the world by which budgets had been presented and Parliamentary processes had been followed. But, this President could not do so. In 2015, we were a minority Government, but with the understanding of the Opposition, we were able to actually present a Budget, get is passed and carry out what we had got approval for, from Parliament.

There is a constitutional provision that even if Parliament has been dissolved, the President can, under special circumstances like an emergency, reconvene Parliament. He did not even use that provision. Therefore, a constitutional question arises. There was a Vote on Account covering the period from January to April. There was also a Vote on Account subsequently when this Parliament was elected. But, the constitutional question is this. From 01st of May till the August, for four months, expenditures were incurred, incomes were received and

2131 2132

borrowings were made by the Government, but are those legal and constitutional?

Sir, I am not going to deal with the constitutional or the legal issues, but to look at it from the point of view of political philosophy. Parliament in a republic has two main functions and they are, firstly, to legislate and secondly, to approve finances. In a republic, you cannot even raise a rupee from a citizen without the approval of Parliament. So, this is the first time in the 72-year history of independent Sri Lanka that a situation like this has arisen. Therefore, we must ensure that it would not be repeated under any circumstances. We, the Parliamentarians, have a primary responsibility, not to the Executive of the country, but to the people because they are sovereign in a republic. We have been elected by them and it is our duty to stand by the Constitution and protect the freedom and the rights of the people. Therefore, I hope that this precedent will never be followed again.

Sir, then I would like to very briefly look at the income that has been raised. The revenue from taxes - Income Tax, Excise Tax, VAT, NBT, Cess and PAL - is the primary source of income. If you take revenue in general, the income from those taxes has come down. The Government has made tax changes since December, 2019 up to now. Those changes should have been made under legislation. But, where is the legislation? Only the VAT rate can be changed under the Act because it is provided in the Act. No other tax rate can be changed without the approval of Parliament. But even with regard to the VAT, the threshold cannot be changed because the Act does not permit for the threshold to be changed, but only the VAT rate. Therefore, revenues have also dived because of political exigencies that arose during the elections. Revenues have come down; the Income Tax has come down by 32 per cent; import duties have come down by 9 per cent and the Special Commodity Levy has gone up by 10 per cent. What does this show? What this shows is that the taxes on the poor have gone up; the commodity taxes have gone up; transport taxes have gone up, but the taxes on the rich have come down because income taxes have come down. We must state that we do not approve of this state.

Sir, we were in a situation where we needed fiscal consolidation when we took the office. The revenues of this country had dropped to about 10 per cent to 10.5 per cent of GDP and we went for fiscal consolidation and by 2018, it had exceeded 13 per cent of GDP. Even in India, it is about 18 per cent of GDP. We are the lowest in the region. I do not even want to talk about Europe and the Scandinavian countries where their revenue may be 40 per cent to 50 per cent of GDP. But even by South Asian standards, we are the lowest. In 2020, it will dip into 8 per cent or 9 per cent of GDP. Whenever revenues drop, the poor are under pressure. Revolutions happen because of that. Therefore, every government has a responsibility to make sure that revenues come in so that the provision of basic services and the pangs of hunger could be addressed and that the people do not come on to the streets. There are the first signs of that and the Government must be

quick to address that. The rich need to be taxed so that the poor shall live comfortably and all of us can live in harmony. We need a more equal society. One important thing in taxation is that there will be more equity in the system. The Government has failed in terms of generating incomes. If you take expenditures, the question I would like to ask is, how have these expenditures been incurred?

Sir, I would also like to go into the question of borrowings, which is the other factor. Parliament has to approve the borrowing limit. As we see from the Appropriation Bill, borrowings have gone up. We can take figures from the Appropriation Bill and the statistics from January to July - revenues, expenditures and borrowings - which the Ministry of Finance has given more recently and compare them with that it in the same period of 2019 to see what has happened. During those months, borrowings have gone up by Rs. 1,230 billion. If I put it in another way, borrowings have gone up by Rs. 5.8 billion per day. Let us look at these borrowings in terms of GDP. The GDP was Rs. 15 trillion in 2019. Today, we hear from the Ministry of Finance that the GDP is going to be Rs. 16 trillion in 2020. How can that be? We are heading for a negative growth in this country. So, how can the GDP go up? Playing with the data is dangerous and the Government has not even released the growth figures for the second quarter and the third quarter. Even countries like Indonesia has released their data - figures - for the third quarter and the reason that the Government is not releasing it is because technically, when the growth is negative in two quarters, a country is officially declared to be in recession and that is probably the reason why the Government is not doing it. It is foolish not to because investors understand what is happening, not just in Sri Lanka but across the world and therefore, having honest data, releasing them on time is actually to our benefit as a country. If you compare the GDP figures of 2020 with the GDP figures during the same period of 2019 - do not even discount it - then, our borrowings will be about 95 per cent of GDP. If it continues to grow at that rate, by the end of December, the borrowings will be 100 per cent of GDP. Therefore, a manipulation of data will not help at all. Therefore, we must take note of this so that we would be able to get our country out of the present rot or the present problem it is facing.

. 2015-2019 . , 2020 . I think that is what the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne also stated, that this is a wrong precedent and this is the first time it has happened. But, I would like to bring to your attention, Hon. Eran Wickramaratne, that when your Government was ruling the country in 2002, a similar situation occurred for the first time. The UNP set this precedent. I do not know why such a precedent was set, but the Budgets for 2002 as well as for 2003 were presented in 2002. So, this is not the first time this is happening in Sri Lanka. But you can be happy that we have given the figures. This is one of the most difficult times that the country has gone through. The whole world is going through a difficult period. So, I think you were trying to point out that was not right. You should have studied the history. I can see that the Opposition has forgotten the history and they are trying to set wrong examples. I think you will not do that in the future because now you all have dropped down to 54 Members. If you all carry on like this you will not be able to get even 40 Members elected at the next election.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I did not say boycott. ( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) Then, what are you going to do? Are you going to vote in favour or against it? You have to either vote for it or against it. What do you mean by boycott? I think this is what is happening. Even the Opposition has realized that the present President, the Prime Minister and the Government are taking the country forward through a very difficult period. We think of the general masses in Sri Lanka. You should be happy. You should be happy that the North and the East are being looked after by this Government unlike your Government. Though you had a President and a Government led by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinge coming into power in 2015, what did the North and the East get? Now, you can see the Minsters going to the North and the East; they go and help your people. - [Interruption.] This is how we govern the country. So, be happy. We are in the correct path. During difficult periods, we have taken the country forward. So, support us as a responsible Opposition.

( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) , . 150(3) . 2002 2020 . . I am ashamed of Hon. Eran Wickramaratne, a Member whom I respect. You are talking as if you are not in this world. I know to whom you spoke today. You never spoke to the Sri Lankan masses; you spoke to the international community who is supporting you. I want to tell you, do not worry, the international community will support us in governing the country. Do not worry about that. Our policy is a very friendly policy. So, do not worry about that. Your efforts will go in vain. So, do not do this. - [Interruption.] I am telling you, do not do this.

From Covid-19, which has hit the entire world, do not try to gain cheap popularity, do not try to take cheap political advantage because you are a respected Member. That is why I did not disturb you while you were speaking.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) There was nothing personal. ( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) That is why I did not even disturb you while you were speaking. I think if you contested the last election, you would have realized what it was like. Now, you do not realize what it is like.

2139 2140

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) It is a fact. That is all. ( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) You did not realize that. Had you contested the last election, you would have realized what people went through, how much they suffered and how much they cursed at you. People were cursing your Government. - [Interruption.] So, when you point out things, be careful. When we pointed out that it is the same thing you had done in 2002, you cannot say it is right. So, if it was right in 2002, there is nothing wrong in doing the same thing in 2020.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you very much for the clarification. The next speaker is the Hon. Thushara Indunil Amarasena. You have nine minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I rise to a point of Order. My name was mentioned and I need to respond to that.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) I think you clarified earlier. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Sir, I rise to a point of Order because he is misleading the House. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) There was a clarification. - [Interruption.] Yes, Hon. Eran Wickramaratne?

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, under Article 150.(3) of the Constitution, payments can be made, but not in the present circumstances; it cannot be done. That is the illegality.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) That has already been clarified. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) He is making a wrong point. If it was right in 2002, how can it be wrong in 2020? I never referred to him, I referred to what he said. - [Interruption.] I think he has forgotten the history; I think the Opposition has forgotten the history. The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne cannot remember what he said 15 minutes ago.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you very much. Hon. Thushara Indunil Amarasena. You have nine minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal) Thank you very much for your concern. I appreciate it. But, at the same time, we have worked out the logistics, as to how we are going to manage the debt, Hon. Member. So, we are confident that we can manage it at this moment with the resources we are having as well as with the plans that we are going to put in place. Therefore, while I deeply appreciate your concern and your advice, I would like to say that we think, at the moment, we would not need to do that and that we would like to prove you are wrong in that. So, thank you very much for your advice.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I only hope that it would not be like how you all went and invested in the Greek Bonds and the monies disappeared. It should not happen in this case because this is a liability and a responsibility which we cannot run away from. That is the situation.

( ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal) Once again, Hon. Member, I have written a book on the Greek Bonds. Please go to the Library and you will be able to read that. It is on page 280. You are a lawyer. In that, you can read the Judgment of the Supreme Court.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) You must give us a copy. ( ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal) Yes, I will give you a copy. Thank you very much for asking me. I will autograph and give you a copy of the book.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I have limited time. ( ) (The Hon. Ajith Nivard Cabraal) That particular book is there in the Library at the moment. Please refer to page No. 280 and there, you will see the Greek Bond case Judgment. I am so glad that you referred to it. Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, since I have very limited time - ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Within those two minutes, since there is a debate tomorrow on COVID, I would refer to one other matter, Sir. , , . - 19 . . " . " , . . , . . - . .
