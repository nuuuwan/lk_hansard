. , . . . . . . . I quote:

The people in whom sovereignty is reposed having made the President as the Head of the Executive in terms of Article 30 of the Constitution entrusted in the President, the exercise of the Executive power being the custodian of such power. If the people have conferred such power on the President, it must be either exercised by the President directly or someone who deserves authority from the President. There is no doubt that Executive powers can be distributed to others via President. However, if there is no link between the President and the person exercising the Executive power, it may amount to a violation of mandate given by the people to the President. If the inalienable sovereignty of the people which they reposed on the President in trust is exercised by any other agency or instrument who do not have any authority from the President then such exercise would necessarily affect the sovereignty of the people.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir.

I seek just a clarification, Sir. There seems to be some confusion with regard to the Presidents power to dissolve Parliament after two and a half years. In the English and the Sinhala versions of the Amendment, there is some inconsistency. You said all of the Committee Stage Amendments are on the Table. You might have to consider some slight adjustments to that Amendment. So, will you give us an opportunity, even outside, to bring that to your notice?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. M.U.M. Ali Sabry) Definitely. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you.

[12.40 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Mr. Speaker, we are debating the proposed Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution. Substantial sections of society in Sri Lanka have expressed their views on the Twentieth Amendment and those are all well known.

The Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi and the Tamil National Alliance strongly oppose the proposed Twentieth Amendment. We state that sovereignty vested in the people is inalienable and that sovereignty can be exercised only by the people. Sovereignty of the people is defined to include powers of governance: Legislative, Executive and Judicial powers, Fundamental Rights and the franchise. The Twentieth Amendment, as formulated, violates all these three components of sovereignty exclusively vested in the people; Legislative, Executive and Judicial powers are violated, so are Fundamental Rights and the franchise.

Sir, within the short time available, I propose to deal with only some of the main features, some of the more blatant features. The Legislature which exercises legislative sovereignty and power on behalf of the people is elected from throughout the country comprising of 225 Members of Parliament for a period of five years. Provision for dissolution at the discretion of one individual prior to the expiration of the legitimate term, after one year or two and a half years, is tantamount to the Sword of the Damocles hanging over the heads of the legislators and is a serious curtailment of the independence of the Members in the exercise of legislative sovereignty on behalf of the people. Curtailment of the functions and powers of the Prime Minister and Ministers who are collectively responsible and answerable to Parliament, the Legislature, is again a gross violation of the legislative sovereignty of the people.

Independent institutions such as the Election Commission, the Human Rights Commission, the Judicial Service Commission, the Public Service Commission, the National Police Commission and several other institutions play a crucial role in ensuring good governance. It is harmful and undesirable that the appointment and removal of the Chairman and members of these institutions are at the sole discretion of one individual and not the result of collective thinking by a group of well-informed and independent persons. This has a seriously adverse impact on both the sovereignty of Executive power and the Fundamental Rights of the people, which is also a component of the peoples sovereignty.

Similarly, the appointment of the Chief Justice and other Judges of the Supreme Court, the President of the Court of Appeal and other Judges of the Court of Appeal and the Judicial Service Commission, who exercise powers over the lower Judiciary, is at the sole discretion of one individual and not on the basis of an independent judgement by some well-informed and balanced people,

1455 1456

which can include that individual, in violation of sovereign Judicial and Executive powers of the people, which is unacceptable.

Other important officials such as the Attorney-General, the Auditor-General, the Inspector General of Police, the Ombudsman and the Secretary-General of Parliament are to be appointed at the sole discretion of one individual and removed by that one individual. That is also totally unacceptable.

Judicial power is crucial. There can be no compromise on the exercise of judicial power. Every effort must be made to ensure that the Judiciary is absolutely independent with no reservation whatsoever.

The above facts, Sir, clearly indicate that the inalienable sovereignty of the people to be exercised by various constitutionally established institutions is to be controlled by one individual who directly or indirectly arrogates to himself all powers in such a way as to put an end to democracy and the will of the people. This would be immensely harmful to the whole country and all its people. If this was to be executed, if this was to succeed, Sri Lanka would, before long, end up as a dictatorship embracing totalitarianism. Sir, I want to very clearly state that no one has received any mandate from the people of this country to do any such thing, to transform a democracy into a dictatorship or a totalitarian State. If such a mandate has, in fact, been received, why do you not take the whole of the Twentieth Amendment before the people and get their approval at a Referendum? A victory at an election by whatever majority does not give anyone the right to transform a democracy into a dictatorship. It is for those reasons that we of the ITAK and the Tamil National Alliance have decided to oppose this Bill. We have always endeavoured to make our decisions based on principles.

I heard the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena speaking about the Hon. (Mrs.) Sirima Bandaranaike being deprived of her civic rights. I have many things to say about how the ITAK and the TNA have conducted themselves on various issues in the country on a matter of principle and I reserve that for another day for lack of time, Sir. When the Hon. (Mrs.) Bandaranaikes Civic Rights Motion was brought to Parliament, we as the Tamil United Liberation Front comprising of 16 Members fearlessly opposed it; we were amongst those who stood up for her and did not want that to happen. In fact, my Leaders, the Hon. Amirthalingam and the Hon. Sivasithamparan at the end of Proceedings, walked out with her from Parliament, escorting her to the car - I walked behind them - because she was in danger of being physically assaulted. Sir, we have always stood up for the right thing and we will always stand up for the right thing. There are many matters that I want to refer to; I will deal with them in due course on some future occasion.

It has been publicly stated by the present Government that the country will have a new Constitution very soon - the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House said that this morning - before the end of 2021. That is the date you have fixed. The country, at present, does not have a

Constitution approved by the people or with the will and consent of the people. The Constitution of 1978 had been rejected by the people at every national election since 1994, which means that for over a quarter century, this country is being governed without a valid Constitution. Unilateral practices, as happened in 1972 and 1978 in regard to the First and the Second Republican Constitutions, should not be repeated. The democratic verdicts of the Tamil people since 1956 in the North-East must be respected. That is the verdict given by the Tamil people in the North and East consistently and steadily from 1956; it is a verdict given by the Tamil people in the exercise of their sovereignty, in the exercise of their franchise and must not be disregarded and disrespected.

Since 1988 or 1989, over the past 32 years, there have been various processes, various arrangements and various agreements that have been arrived at during President Premadasas time, during President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas time, during President Mahinda Rajapaksas time and during President Sirisena and the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe's time. All these must be studied; they must all be looked at. The country has been informed that a Committee of Experts has been appointed to initially handle this matter and that they are looking into the question. If the new Constitution is to be a sacred and sacrosanct document, it must have the substantial consensus of all the peoples in this country, not merely of the majority people. We will reject any Constitution that does not have a substantial consensus of the Tamil-speaking people. All the material should be made available to every one. We should discuss this matter in earnest and come to a good decision.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) The next speaker is the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara. Before he starts, the Hon. Deputy Speaker will take the Chair.

. It should not be the will of the majority . . It cannot be the will of the minority either. We are at a point where we have no consensus. So, we must try to find a consensus, undoubtedly.

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) We are prepared to play a reasonable role and tell the other people that there must be a solution within the framework of a united, undivided, indivisible Sri Lanka, where all citizens are equal. Sinhalese leaders like you, on both sides, do not take that message to the Sinhala people. You must tell the Sinhala people that the Tamil-speaking people are prepared to accept a solution within the framework of a united, undivided, indivisible Sri Lanka. That must be done.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Thank you. Now, may I proceed with my speech? - [Interruption.] I agree. Likewise, the leaders on that side should address their own minorities on the same lines so that we might come to a consensus which is satisfactory to all, which has been the challenge we are yet to overcome. Let us see.

"" . . . . . . . . . 1972 we are discovering our own future; we are discovering our own new Constitution. Constitution . Constitution ; it is a reflection of the existing balance of forces at any given time. So, we have it one moment and it becomes negated at the next moment. Then, it rises again as a counter revolution. Then, it is challenged once again by the mass forces. . narrative . . .

[3.56 p.m.]

. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.V. Wigneswaran) Sir, I thank you for giving me this opportunity to participate in this Debate.

It has been unfortunate that every party which had come to power in the Centre of this Island has been generally legislating to further the self-interests of that party, its members and supporters, forgetting their duty

towards all the people and the country as a whole. Those who aspire to become a Lee Kuan Yew should shed their partisan predilections if they are to progress. Lee Kuan Yew did not pursue a Chinese-Buddhist path. He loved every Singaporean of whatever hue he or she was. Branding the minorities as terrorists might bring votes from the majority, but it would not help to take the country forward. There would certainly be geopolitical and international reactions. It is in furtherance of their attitude of self-interest that those in power are today bringing in this Twentieth Amendment to clothe a single individual with enormous powers. This would, for sure, strike the death knell for democracy and human rights in this country.

The world civilization, in its onward march, searches for ways and means to improve democratic principles and work towards human rights, equality and reconciliation among contending factions locally and internationally. At this juncture, it is funny that we in Sri Lanka want to denigrate democracy and desecrate the decent dimensions of a democratic way of life.

I do not view the paradigm shift taking place or about to take place from democracy to dictatorship as the outcome merely of "tanha" - greed - for office. I view it as the preparation for more sinister political activities in the future. For example, I see the hurry with which the Twentieth Amendment is sought to be passed in Parliament as an attempt to clothe the powers that be with authority to barricade, block and bar with an iron fist the democratic corridor still available to the minorities, especially to the Tamil-speaking, to demonstrate against the discouraging anti-minority activities now taking place in the North and the East and elsewhere, silencing them and stultifying their attempts to bring the truth of what is taking place in the North and the East to the world outside especially before March next year.

Under the pretext of Presidential Task Forces, lands of the minorities are plundered by departments. Under the pretext of security, over a lakh of members of the military have been asked to keep the Tamil-speaking under control, not allowing them to articulate their legitimate feelings and aspirations. Peoples lands are forfeited by departments such as the Forest Department. Resources from the North and the East are expropriated by illegal adventurers with surreptitious official sanctions. Colonization under the Mahaweli Scheme brings lots of denizens from other provinces into our provinces while our Northern Province is not provided with a drop of Mahaweli water. Indeed our engineers say that no water from the Mahaweli will ever come to the North. This has been a sham to bring outsiders and colonize the traditional Tamil- speaking areas. This is the present state in the North and the East.

For over 20 years, we have been talking of bringing in a Constitution which would reconcile the ethnic differences among communities and lead the country forward. For over a quarter of a century, we have been promising to abolish the Executive Presidency. Nothing has been done so far in that regard. But, this Government is making the April 21st Easter bombings as a convenient

1523 1524

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

excuse for them to bring in this Twentieth Amendment. They are trying to make out that it was the lowering of Presidential powers by the Nineteenth Amendment which gave rise to the April 21st tragedy. Hence, they say that the President must have unfettered powers. It certainly sounds humorous to say that a criminal or thief could only be caught or arrested if the President is clothed with extraordinary powers. The real causes for the April 21st incident was the carelessness and indifference of the security arm of the law, which has been politicized in recent times. If the Judiciary, the Police and the Public Service had been allowed to function independently, we would not have witnessed the April 21st tragedy.

Most countries in the world do not have an Executive Presidential system. Do those countries always have security lapses or do countries which have this system never had security lapses? Therefore, it is time that we thought prudently and pragmatically and got rid of the Executive Presidential system and make the rule of law supreme.

It is the duty of those in the Government and the Opposition who love this country to strengthen the Police, the Judiciary and the Public Service to make them act independently and fearlessly. Allowing both to come under the overlordship of the single Executive Presidentship would affect the Sri Lankan body polity seriously in the future.

This Government says that it intends bringing in a new Constitution in six months. Then, what is the great hurry to pass this Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution? It shows that there are hidden agendas working from behind.

Let me point out an example. This Government says the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution, as amended by the proposed Committee Stage Amendments, seeks to amend the powers of the Auditor-General by removing the Constitutional requirement that the Auditor-General should audit companies in which the Government or a public corporation owns more than 50 per cent of the shares. There is a lingering question as to why the Presidential Secretariat and the Office of the Secretary to the Prime Minister were taken out of the purview of the Auditor-General in the Bill and why they are brought back through the Committee Stage Amendments. Nevertheless, the most important question, in any event, is why are government-owned companies taken out of the Auditor-Generals constitutionally mandated audit? This question takes special significance when one looks at the argument put forward by the State in the Supreme Court. I quote from page 59 of the Document SC.SD No.1/2020 - 39/2020 handed over to us, yesterday.

The Attorney General submitted that the mere absence of reference to any class of institutions in Article 154 per se does not preclude the Auditor-General exercising his powers and carrying out audit of such institutions. He contended that Section 55 of the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018 defines what an auditee entity is, and any entity listed therein does fall within the purview of the Auditor-General.

The Attorney-General then goes onto explain that companies in which the Government or a public corporation owns 50 per cent or more of the shares as well as the Presidential Secretariat and the Office of the Secretary to the Prime Minister are brought under the National Audit Act and therefore, needs no mention in the Constitution. If the Governments position is that Government-owned companies are brought under the National Audit Act and as such, it is not necessary to have the requirement included in the Constitution, then why did the Government bring back the auditing of the Presidential Secretariat and the Office of the Secretary to the Prime Minister through the Committee Stage Amendments? They could have added those two institutions to the list, but they did not. In fact, if that is the argument of the State, then why have any institution subject to audit listed in the Constitution at all? Why not remove all the institutions listed in the Constitution? After all, the National Audit Act would apply in any case. One may ask, why not remove the Auditor-General himself from the Constitution altogether? So, the Government argument goes, "We have the National Audit Act. Auditing will, for sure, take place." I find it inconceivable that the Hon. Members of the Government, with a long history as Legislators, fail to see the merit in elevating the obligations of the Auditor-General to a Constitutional level.

To me, it is obvious that this is being done with the insidious motive of repealing the National Audit Act after the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution is passed. The National Audit Act also provides for the Audit Service Commission, which too is to be abolished under the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution. Thus, the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution paves the way for the abolishing of the National Audit Act in toto, thus emasculating the position of the Auditor-General. What the Hon. Members of the Government should remember is that this amounts to the emasculation of Parliament itself.

The control over public finance is an integral and one could say, the mostly fundamental power of Parliament and it is shameful that that very institution is seeking to undermine its most sacred obligation. Why are Government-owned companies being targeted first? The answer is simple. These are the commercial establishments of the State. This is where lucre dwells and is, therefore, lucrative. No reason has been adduced by the Government for the removal of the audit of Government-owned companies. In fact, no argument can be advanced in view of the Attorney-Generals submissions before the Supreme Court. To now say that there is, in fact, a reason to remove Government-owned companies would directly contradict the rationale advanced by the Attorney-General. One must remember that the role of the private sector auditor is a very limited one. Issues such as waste, inefficiency and unlawful largesse are not the province of private sector audits. It is only the Auditor-General who will be willing to probe those areas.

The tragedy is not that the Executive is seeking to empower itself, but it is Parliament that is willingly ceding its control over the Executive. The elder brother

1525 1526

2020 21

wants to clothe his younger brother with enormous powers, Sir.

There are those who advocate for a stronger Executive on the grounds of expediency. My having, first-hand, been tasked with acting as the bulwark against Executive excesses for several decades, the solution to maintain a balance of power is having accountability and checks and balances. Let us assume that efficiency requires the Executive being clothed with all manner of powers. Audit, by definition, occurs after the act. Audit does not fetter or impede Executive acts. It merely allows the stakeholders to evaluate the acts that had already taken place. So, why is this unholy hurry to divorce the Auditor-General or jettison him altogether?

Let us remember and I say so with responsibility, that those who are working hard today to bring this Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution and all those who support it today will surely take to the streets tomorrow to fight for the abolition of the same Amendment. This Amendment you bring in today will have a boomerang effect on you, your children and the future generations of your family. Please do not prick your eyes with your own fingers. My dear Colleagues on both sides, please do not allow this Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution to be passed with a two-thirds majority tomorrow. Let all of us who value human rights, democracy, good governance and peace forget our party differences and personal obligations and prevent the passing of the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution.

I thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 10 .

We are a simple majoritarian democracy with very complex minority demands and political aspirations. The Tamils have been demanding for a more consociational democracy where they will be, as they say, treated as equal partners of the governing body. I think, at a historical juncture like this, it is good for us to listen not only to the Tamils and their aspirations, but also to the majority Sinhalese people and the Muslims and to both their aspirations. Today, in this Parliament, there are about 20 different political parties and they represent Tamils, Sinhalese, Buddhists, Muslims, Christians, Catholics, socialists and even Marxists. Even though such representations are made, equality in democracy is a long journey for my motherland, Madam Chair, and that is our aspiration.

As a person who teaches democracy in universities, I tell my students that unless the citizenship participates in an active manner, working democracy will be a long journey for all of us. Therefore, it is our earnest, honest and determined aspiration that the coming Constitutional change will reflect our peoples aspirations as a whole, that of a whole nation or a whole State. Our Constitution must reflect the future of democracy of this country, which is your motherland and my motherland; our

1561 1562

[ ]
